            <seg id="p029">State of Nebraska, Legal Department, Lincoln, Nebraska, November 30, 1910. To His Excellency, Ashton C. Shallenberger, Governor. Sir: In compliance with the provisions of section i"_' ( article 5, Constitution, I herewith submit the biennial re - port of the legal department of the state for the period beginning December 1, 1908, and ending November 30, 1910. - During this period Hon. V, T . T. Thompson served as attorney general from December 1, 1908, to October 1910, and the undersigned served from October 31, 1910, to November 30, 1910. In addition to the report herewith submitted the de - partment is now preparing a complete report of all official opinions rendered by it during the biennimr. ; said r" will be completed within a short time. Practically all of the opinions reported were rendered by the department prior to the time I became connected with it. Having no personal knowledge regarding th ions I have di. ed Miss Josephine Murphy to compile these opinions, pre - pare the syllabus and head notes, and make the classifica - tions, tables and index. Miss Murphy has i knowledge and is fully acquainted with all these opinions, having acted as stenographer in the department during all the biennium. An examination of the reports will disclose that the duties of this department during the biennium have been extremely onerous. The railroad litigation alcne has taken more than the time of one of the office force. In order to </seg>
            <seg id="p030">XXXII KKI'OKT OK ATTOKXKY GENERAL Pind assist in the trials of the railroad litigation a necessary to secure the services of an expert :. During the present year Mr. L. E. "Wettling the greater part of his time in getting informa - nt computations, and preparing satistical in - for the use of the department in that class of At the time this department was created it did not require all of the time of the attorney general to attend to duties. Evidently the framers of the constitution thought that the attorney general would have time outside his office hours to look after his private practice. The work of this department has grown until it is practically impossible for the attorney general to intelligently attend to his many duties in the ordinary working hours of the day. By constitutional and statutory provisions the attor - ney general is required to discharge duties on nine or ten different boards. These duties alone, if discharged in an intelligent and careful manner, will take practically all of his time. It must be apparent that the salaries paid the officers of this department wholly inadequate. The salary paid the attorney general is limited by the constitu - tion; hence, there is no way to increase his salary without a constitutional amendment, but the legislature could, if it saw fit, increase the salaries and appropriations for the deputy attorney general and the other assistants in the office. It is beneath the dignity of the state of Nebraska to those who look after its legal affairs the small salaries heretofore appropriated by the legislature. I respectfully suggest to your excellency that you recommend and ask the legislature "to make an appropria - tion increasing the salaries of the deputy attorney general and the other assistants in the office, and that an appro - priation be made to pay the salary of an additional assist - ant, whose duty it shall be to assist in the trial of the rail - road litigation now pending and to look after and attend </seg>
            <seg id="p031">XXXIII to litigation that grows out of and is connected with the workings of the railway commission. Among other recommendations I ; that your excellency recommend to the legislature the following: I. ANTI-TRUST LAW. The anti-trust law of tl materially changed and amended. At the present time many o provisions are weak and ineffective. Among tin* chai necessary I would suggest the following: tl. That a provision be made giving this department right to examine and procure testimony of witn&lt; ore commencing any proceedings agaitist any pool, trust, spiracy or combination in restraint cf trade, to a - 1 whether or not an action should be brought. 12. That provisions be made requiring the agents, offi - s, and employees of corporations, joint stock companies, 1- co-partnerships to testify and to produce the books, ords, and papers of the said corporations, joint stuck npanies, and co-partnerships to testify and to produce books, records, and papers of said corporations, joint ck companies and co-partnerships when requested by the orney general, and that upon a failure to comply with d request and appear, testify, and produce said bo ords, and papers the court would have authority, upon I motion of the attorney general, to strike out the an - er, motion, reply, demurrer, or other pleading, and enter udgment by default against said corporations, joint stock npanies, and co-partnerships. 3. That section 11, article 2, chapter 91a, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1909, should be amended. In its present form this section in effect provides that corpora - tions, joint stock companies, and other associations must be twice adjudged to have violated the provisions of the anti- </seg>
            <seg id="p032">XXXIV trust laws of the state before a forfeiture of their charter can be declared. The supreme court in the case of State v. Omaha Elevator Co., 75 Neb. 654, appears to have so con iiued this provision. It is not clear that the court in - d to hold that the legislature had the power to limit the Jurisdiction of the supreme court in quo uarranto pro - ings. Personally I do not think that the legislature has the power. As there is room for debate on this subject, the legislature should remove this doubt by repealing that part I the foregoing section which requires a double conviction. ie power of the supreme court in quo uarranto cases juld not be hampered by legislative enactments. The preme court was wisely given original jurisdiction in quo rranto. Our constitution vests that court with a wide icretion regarding penalties that the court may pose in that class of cases. The executive func - ns of this department should not be hampered by ng required to. secure two convictions against an oflfend - against the law before the state can ask to have an ective penalty imposed. In contests between the state and those v.'ho have violated the laws,the legal department tiuld be armed with every executive function necessary enforce the criminal laws. The purpose and object of legislation should be to give this department a wider lati - tude and more power instead of hindering and impeding it by useless and unnecessary limitations. II. DERELICT PUBLIC OFFICERS. In 1907 the legislature passed Senate File 180, popular - ly known as the "Sackett Law," which provides for a pro - ceeding in quo uarranto to oust derelict public officials. Under the provisions of that act the governor directs the attorney general to institute and prosecute, in the supreme court, quo warranto proceedings against derelict officers. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">ItKI'ORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL XXXV Experience has shown that the provisions of that act are inadequate. If it is thought wise to invest the governor with power over derelict public officials, then that power should be given to him in such a way that he can make liis orders effective. Under the provisions of the law as it now stands the delays incident to the trial of cases defeat the purpose and object of the law. Provision should be made for a speedy hearing with power to make a prompt and III. The legislature of 1909 appropriated $18,000 to pay the expenses of this department for the biennium. It is evident that the legislature proceeded on the theory that all this department was to do was to act in self-defense in liti - gation brought against the state. I Because of the small appropriation the policy of this mrtment has been to conduct the affairs of the office hin the appropriations made by the legislature. The al department of the state is not merely one of self do - se. Sufficient appropriation should be made to cover expenses of prosecutions as well as defenses. Sufficient jropriations should be made so that the department ild use some discretion with reference to instituting pro - dings to enforce the laws of the state. As it has 1 appropriations are barely enough to pay the legitimate ining expenses of the office and the expenses of pending gation in which the state is interested generally II, therefore, recommend that for the biennium beirin - g April 1, 1911, the following appropriations he Made to i department : $ 5,000 for office expenses, postage, stationery, tele - graph, telephone, office supplies, printing </seg>
            <seg id="p034">XXXVI briefs, traveling expenses, furniture and sup - plies. $10,000 to defray expenses of litigation that grows out of and is connected with the railway com - mission. $10,000 for prosecutions that may arise under the provisions of the anti-trust laws. $10,000 for expenses of other litigation that may arise during the biennium. IV. The legislative reference department of the State His - torical Society has been of much assistance to the legisla - ture and has been invaluable to this department, having relieved this department of the necessity of answering scores of inquiries and spending much time in looking up information for the members of the legislature regarding legislation and the court decisions of other states. I recommend that liberal provisions be made for the support of that department. V. II desire to freely acknowledge the active and efficient istance rendered me by Grant G. Martin, deputy attor - r general, George W. Ayres, assistant attorney general, I Miss Josephine Murphy, stenographer. At the time I ilified I did not think it would be wise or expedient to mge any of the office force. Actual experience with the ny duties of this important office has convinced me more n ever that the course pursued was the proper one. VI.

You c two questions: 1. For how long a term does the chairman chosen, as above desig - nated, hold? 2. Can the board leave the appointment of committees to a com - mittee on rules and appointments, or is the chairman vested with sola committee appointing power? In answer to your first question, I think the chairman chosen by the new board, in the manner designated by you, may hold such position during the remainder of the year </seg>

In answer to your second question, I think the county board has the right to make its own rules and regulations regarding committees and the appointment of the same. If it wishes to leave the appointment of committees to a committee on rules and appointments, which it has created, there is no legal obstacle in the way, that I know of.

Lard packed and sold in tin cans or pails, with no indication of the contents or weight on the outside, is a violation of the pure-food law E. E. Ross, Esq., County Attorney of Merrick County, Central City, Neb. Dear Sir : I have yours of the 5th instant, in which you ask the question as to whether lard packed and sold in tin cans or pails, with no indication of the contents or weight on the outside, is a violation of the pure-food law of this state. That portion of the pure-food law referred to is subdivi - sion 3, section 8, chapter 63, Session Laws of 1907. The law provides that for the purpose of this act an article of food shall be deemed to be misbranded if sold for use in </seg>
            <seg id="p105">3 in paoKage iorTn oilier 1(1(411 cÂ«inni'(i goods, when contents or weight are not correctly stated on the out - side of the package. This provision of law has not been construed by our court, although a er.se is now pending to determine the validity of the law and also as to whether it requires the branding of packages of butter with the weight thereon. I take the position that the law requires articles of that character to be branded with the contents and weight. The question you propound is to determine whether pails or cans of lard come within the exception relating to canned goods. This question is not without doubt. I think the legislature used the words "canned goods" according to their ordinary use and acceptation. I take it that the pails of lard are put up in the form of those ordinarily sold. and have a tin lid and an exterior tin covering over that. Evidently the legislature, in making this exception, re - ferred to goods which were canned for the purpose of pre - serving the same. Lard does not spoil by being exposed to the air. Furthermore, canned goods are commonly un - derstood to be a general name for fruits, vegetables, meats or fish preserved in hermetically sealed cans. This is the definition of canned goods given by Webster's Interna - tional Dictionary and others, so far as I have been able to ascertain. Hermetically sealed cans mean those that are perfectly closed or made air tight by fusion, so that no gas or spirit can enter or escape. I Consequently, I conclude that goods that are put up in Is and buckets, and are not necessarily sealed for the rpose of preservation or are not hermetically sealed, do ; come within the exception of the statute, and that it is â€¢iolation of the law to sell lard put up in pails or cans the manner designated by you. This question does not se alone from the sale of lard, but from a multitude of icles that are constantly being offered to the public, and mow of no way to test the law except by instituting </seg>

A county treasurer to whom a distress warrant has been forwarded should at once proceed to collect the delinquent personal taxes of the person against whom it is issued, and remit the proceeds thereof to the forwarding treasurer, irrespective of what the delin - quent proposes in the way of resistance. For wilful failure to execute a distress warrant, as by law provided, a county treasurer would be liable to the county aggrieved upon his official bond for any damages which such county might sustain by reason thereof.

Thus the duties of a county treasurer irding the collection of delinquent personal taxes are from ambiguity. t Section 11,057, Cobbey'i Annotated Statutes of li&gt;()7,pro - les the manner in which distress warrants shall be issued one county treasurer to another, when the delinquent ;payer has removed from the county in which the tax was ginally levied. It is as follows : "It shall be the duty of the treasurer or his deputy in making the return of the distress warrant to note in such return the county to which any such delinquent taxpayer may have removed with the date of his removal, if he shall be able to ascertain such fact, and it is hereby made his duty to make diligent inquiry therefor. It shall be the duty of the several county treasurers in the state immediately after the return of such distress warrant to issue an alias distress warrant to the treasurer of any county in this state into which such taxpayer may have removed, or may reside, or in which his personal property mar be found, who shall proceed to collect said taxes the same aa upon execution, together with his costs, and after so collecting t" for - ward the same with such warrant and his return thereon to the treas - urer of the proper county." S^rom the foregoing it is plain that the county treasurer whom a distress warrant has been forwarded should at je proceed to collect the delinquent personal taxes of the rson against whom it is issued, and remit the proceeds ;reof to the forwarding treasurer. It is as much his duty make such collection when the distress warrant has been â€¢warded to him from another county as it is to collect linquent personal taxes levied in his own county. Laws of this cl aracter should not be construed to mean little or nothing. They were intended to effect the collec- </seg>
            <seg id="p108">6 tion of delinquent taxes. A county treasurer cannot escape his duty under the law by returning the distress warrant to the forwarding treasurer and saying to him that the delin - quent will not pay but proposes to fight it out in court. It is the duty of the treasurer to proceed to collect the tax ir - respective of what the delinquent proposes in the way of resistance. If a county treasurer refuses to act under such circumstances, I think there are at least two remedies for his failure to act. First, this being a duty imposed upon him by law, it may be enforced by mandamus in a proper case. Second, the only endorsement upon the distress war - rant that justifies the county treasurer in returning it with - out collection is the one that shows no property could be found belonging to the delinquent whereon to levy and col - lect the same; if this return is made when the delinquent really has property, it would be equivalent to making a false return, which under section 11,054 makes the officer liable for double the amount of taxes, with interest and costs, to be recovered in the name of the county. I am also of the opinion that where such treasurer wilfully fails and neglects to perform his duty in matters of this kind, he forfeits his right to office and may be re - moved therefrom by the proper proceedings. (Session Laws of 1907, ch. 87.) In support of these views see Re - port and Opinions of Attorney General 1901-1902, pages 110 and 176. It is my further opinion that a county treasurer who wil - fnlly or negligently fails to execute such warrant, as by law provided, would be liable to the county aggrieved upon his official bond for any damages which the county might sustain by reason thereof.

I state treasurer has authority to pay warrants drawn for salaries of supreme and district judges, established by the recently adopted constitutional amendment increasing the number of supreme judges and their salaries and the salaries of district judges, and to treat the adoption of the amendment as a specific appropriation for the amount necessary to pay the increased salaries named therein. Hon. L. Q. Brian, Staff Treasurer, Lincoln, Neb. EÂ»eab Sir: I am in receipt of your letter of December submitting the following questions and requesting an lion thereon: Eave you, as state treasurer, the authority to pay warrants drawn salaries of supreme and district judges, established by the con - itional amendment adopted at the recent election, and to treat the )tion of the amendment as a specific appropriation for the amount ssary to pay the increased salaries named therein? At the general election held November .*?, 1008, there was submitted to the voters of the state an amendment to tion 5, article o", constitution, in words and figures follow - 1-g: "That at the general election to be held in the state of Nebraska in the year 1909, and each six years thereafter, there shall be elected three (3) judges of the supreme court, who shall hold their office for the period of six years; that at the general election to be held in the state of Nebraska in the year 1911, and each six years thereafter, there shall be elected three (3) judges of the supreme court, who shall bold their office for the period of six years; and at the general elec - tion to be held in the state of Nebraska in the year 1913, and each six years thereafter, there shall be elected a chief justice of the supreme court, who shall hold his office for the period of six years. Provided that the member of the supreme court whose term of office expires in January 1914, shall be chief justice of the supreme court during that time until the expiration of his term of office. And provided further, that upon the adoption of these amendments by the electors of the state, the governor shall, immediately upon issuing his procla - mation declaring said amendments adopted, appoint four (4) judges of the supreme court, two (2) of whom shall be appointed to hold said office until their successors shall be elected at the general election in 1909, and have qualified; and the other two (2) shall hold their office until their successors shall be elected at the general election held in 1911, and have qualified." (Session Laws, ch. 202, sec. 3.) </seg>
            <seg id="p110">8 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. There was also submitted to the voters of the state, at the same time and in the same proposition, an amendment to section 13, article 6, constitution, in words and figures following: I The judges of the supreme court shall each receive a salary of 500, and the judges of the district court shall each receive a salary $3,000, per annum payable quarterly." (Session Laws, ch. 202, 5.) iFhe vote on these amendments was duly canvassed by i state board of canvassers at the time provided by law, d the amendments were found to have carried by a very â– ge majority. Thereafter Honorable George L. Sheldon, vernor of Nebraska, on November 30, 1908, in obedience section 5, chapter 3, Compiled Statutes of 1907, issued his oclamation declaring said amendments a part of the fun - mental law. On November 30, 1908, by the authority vested in him tinder the constitutional amendment thus adopted, the gov - ernor appointed four judges of the supreme court, all of whom qualified and are now serving as supreme judges pt one, who resigned the next day after taking the oath of office, and the vacancy occasioned by his resignation has not yet been filled. Section 25, article 18, constitution, provides as follows: "The auditor shall draw the warrants of the state quarterly for the payment of the salaries of all officers under this constitution, whose compensation is not otherwise provided for, which shall be paid out of any fund not otherwise appropriated." I The question you submit cannot be said to be an open ;e in this state at the present time. The question you esent arose for the first time in this state in State ex rel. yberts v. Weston, reported in 4 Neb. 216. The facts in at case were quite analogous to the facts connected with b question you submit. The question there involved was to the authority of the state auditor to draw his warrant on the state treasurer for the payment of the salary of state officer when no appropriation therefor had been </seg>
            <seg id="p111">9 made by the legislature. Roberts, the relator, was the at - torney general. The office of attorney general; prior to the adoption of the constitution of 187"), was purely a statutory office and the salary was fixed by statute at $1,000 a year, but on November 1 it became a constitutional office and the tenure of the incumbent, as well as the compensation, was made by the constitution independent of the legislature. The compensation was changed from $1,000 to $2,000 by the constitution. Only $1,000 per annum had been appro - priated by the legislature for the payment of the salary of the attorney general, and this left a deficiency of $250 per quarter in the fund appropriated by the legislature for the payment of the salary of the attorney general. The auditor had refused to draw his warrant for the payment of this increased salary on the ground there was no appropriation made for its payment. The court held it was the duty of the auditor to draw the warrant, and commanded him so to do. In passing upon the question the court, by Lake, ('. .F.. "1. On the part of the relator it is contended that such authority is clearly given by section twenty-five of the schedule of the new con - stitution, while on the other hand, the auditor insists that it furnishes no authority whatever for him to do so. This section is as follows: " 'Sec. 25. The auditor shall draw the warrants of the state quarterly for the payment of the salaries of all officers under this con - stitution, whose compensation i3 not always provided for, which shall be paid out of any funds not otherwise appropriated.' I "If this section is given the effect which the language, by it* Unary meaning plainly imports, there would seem to be no doubt it it was intended thereby to dispense with the necessity of a ;islative appropriation in all those cases to which it applies, viz., the payment of salaries of those officers created by the constitu - n, and whose salaries it directs to be paid from the state treasury. "It will be observed that all the words here employed are of com - mon use, and therefore are to be taken in their plain and ordinary sense. The rule is the same in the construction of a constitutional provision, in this respect, as in the construction of an act of the legislature. Kit was suggested, however, by the defendant's counsel, that there l conflict between this section, and the second clause of section aty-two, article three, of the constitution, which provides that. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">10 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 'no money shall be drawn from the treasury except in pursuance of a specific appropriation made by law,' and therefore both cannot stand. But we do not think there is any conflict whatever between them. The constitution is the 'supreme law' in the state, emanating directly from the body of the people; and section twenty-five of the schedule, in plain, simple language, appropriates from the treasury sufficient funda. not otherwise appropriated, to pay the salaries of all officers witbin its operation, whenever it shall happen that no legislative appropria - tion exists. This is, therefore, an appropriation 'made by law,' and applicable to a specific object. * â€¢ â€¢ "Again, section twenty-five, of the schedule, not only requires the payment to be made, but, it also directs that it should be done quar - terly, which renders it just as specific, in all essential particulars, as it was possible to make it." BThe rule announced in the foregoing case was reaffirmed the case of State ex rel. Brown v. Western, 6 Neb. 16. Again this question came before the supreme court in case of WesUm, Auditor, r. Herd man, 64 Neb. 24. Herd - man was clerk of the supreme court and ex officio librarian of the law and miscellaneous library of the state, and accord - ing to section 8, article 4, constitution, he was to receive a salary not exceeding $1,500 per annum. No appropriation had been made by the legislature for his salary. He had made a voucher for his salary and presented the same to the state auditor, who refused to draw his warrant therefor on the ground that no appropriation had been made by law for the same. An application was made for a writ of man - damus to compel the auditor to issue this warrant. The Bupreme court, in passing on the question, held as follows: "A specific appropriation 'made by law,' within the meaning of sec - tion 22, article 3, of the constitution of the state of Nebraska, is an appropriation made either by direction of the constitution itself, or one made by the legislature under the forms and in the manner pre - scribed in the constitution for drawing money from the public treas - ury. "The -appropriation for the salary of the reporter and ex officio clerk and librarian of the supreme court is made by section 25, article 16. of the constitution, and requires no special legislative enactment." In this case Judge Barnes, commenting upon the opinion written therein by Commissioner Oldham, said : </seg>
            <seg id="p113">11 I fully concur in the opinion of my Brother Oldham in this case. This court has held in State v. Weston. 4 Neb. 216, and in State â–¼. Weston, 6 Neb. 16, that no specific legislative appropriation is necessary to authorize the auditor to draw his warrant for the pay - ment of the salaries of those officers created by and whose salaries are fixed in, the constitution." It is apparent from the foregoing amendments adopted by the people at the last general election, and now forming a part of the constitution of the state, that the salary of the supreme judges is $4,500 per annum and the salary of the district judges is increased from $2,500 to $3,000. The ten - ure of these offices, as well as the compensation, is fixed by the constitution, and both the judges appointed and those who were formerly members of the supreme court had their salaries fixed as soon as the constitutional amendments were declared adopted and became a part of the fundamental law. They fall clearly within the rule announced in the cases cited. The people, by the adoption of the constitutional amend - ment, made the necessary appropriation. It is not an ap - propriation made by one department of government alone, but by the people themselves, who created all the depart - ments of government. f[t is my opinion that you are entirely warranted by law paying vouchers duly drawn against you therefor.

The question there involved was a&amp; the authority of the state auditor to draw his warrant on the state treasurer for the payment of the salary of 8 te officer when no appropriation therefor had been made the legislature. Roberts, the relator, was the attorney gen - il. The office of attorney general, prior to the adoption the constitution of 1875, was purely a statutory office d the salary was fixed by statute at $1,000 a year, but on â€¢vember 1 it became a constitutional office and the tenure the incumbent, as well as the compensation, was made by </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 14 the constitution independent of the legislature. The com - pensation was changed from $1,000 to $2,000 by the consti - tution. Only $1,000 per annum had been appropriated by the legislature for the payment of the salary of the attorney general, and this left a deficiency of $250 per quarter in the fund appropriated by the legislature for the payment of the salary of the attorney general. The auditor had refused to draw his warrant for the payment of this increased salary, on the ground there was no appropriation made for its pay - ment. The court held it was the duty of the auditor to draw the warrant and commanded him so to do. In passing upon the question the court, by Lake, C. J., said: "1. On the part of the relator it is contended that such authority is clearly given by section twenty-five of the schedule of the new constitution, while on the other hand, the auditor insists that It furnishes no authority whatever for him to do so. This section is aa follows: " 'Sec. 25. The auditor shall draw the warrants of the state quarterly for the payment of the salaries of all officers under this constitution, whose compensation is not otherwise provided for, which shall be paid out of any funds not otherwise appropriated.' "If this section is given the effect which the language, by its ordinary meaning plainly imports, there would seem to be no doubt that it was intended thereby to dispense with the necessity of a legislative appropriation in all those cases to which it applies, viz.. in the payment of the salaries of those officers created by the consti - tution, and whose salaries it direct? to be paid from the state treas - ury "It will be observed that all the words here employed are of com - mon use, and therefore* are to be taken in their plain and ordinary sense. The rule is the same in the construction of a constitutional provision, in this respect, as in the construction of an act of the legislature. "It was suggested, however, by the defendant's counsel, that there is a conflict between this section, and the second clause of section twenty-two, article three, of the constitution, which provides that, 'no money shall be drawn from the treasury except in pursuance of a specific appropriation made by law,' and therefore both cannot stand. But we do not think there is any conflict whatever between them. The constitution is the 'supreme law' in the state, emanating directly from the body of the people, and section twenty-five of the schedule, in plain, simple language, appropriates from the treas - ury sufficient funds, not otherwise appropriated, to pay the salaries ot all officers within its operation, whenever it shall happen that no </seg>
            <seg id="p117">OPINIONS. 15 legislative appropriation exists. This is, therefore, an appropria - tion 'made by law,' and applicable to a specific object. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ "Again, section twenty-five, of the schedule, not only requires the payment to be made, but, it also directs that it should be done quar - terly, which renders it just as specific, in all essential particulars, u it was possible to make it." â– The rule announced in the foregoing case was reaffirmed the case of State ex rel.

No appro - bation had been made by the legislature for his salary. ; had made a voucher for his salary and presented the me to the state auditor, who refused to draw his warrant erefor on the ground that no appropriat ion had been made law for the same. An application was made for a writ mandamus to compel the auditor to issue this warrant. le supreme court, in passing on the question, held as fol - w$: I 'A specific appropriation 'made by law,' within the meaning of tion 22, article 3, of the constitution of the state of Nebraska, an appropriation made either by direction of the constitution it - f, or one made by the legislature' under the forms and in the nner prescribed in the constitution for drawing money from the blic treasury. Ehe appropriation for the salary of the reporter and &lt;j - and librarian of the supreme court is made by section 25. le 16, of the constitution, and requires no special legislative tment." Bn this case Judge Barnes, commenting upon the opinion tten therein by commissioner Oldham, said: t'l fully concur in the opinion of my Brother Oldham in this case. s court has held in State v. Weston, 4 Neb. 216. and in State v. â– ton, 6 Neb. 16, that no specific legislative appropriation is neces - f to authorize the auditor to draw his warrant for the payment the salaries of those officers created by, and whose salaries are d in, the constitution." </seg>
            <seg id="p118">16 It is apparent from the foregoing amendments adopted by the people at the last general election, and now forming a pnrt of the constitution of the state, that the salary of the supreme judges is $4,500 per annum and the salary of the district judges is increased from $2,500 to $3,000. The tenure of these offices, as well as the compensation, is fixed by the constitution, and both the judges appointed and those who were formerly members of the supreme court had their salaries fixed as soon as the constitutional amendments were declared adopted and became a part of the fundamental law. They fall clearly within the rule announced in the cases cited. The people, by the adoption of the constitutional amend - ment, made the necessary appropriation. It is not an appro - priation made by one department of government alone, but by the people themselves, who created all the depart - ments of government. Eis my opinion that you are entirely warranted by law pproving vouchers presented by the judges for these in - sed salaries. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, December 29, 1908. Attorney General.

It is my opinion that such a certificate as above described goes to the authority of the one executing the release and is a mere incident to and a part of it, that if it is entitled to record at all in the office of the recorder it is entitled to be recorded as a part of the instrument to which it apper - tains, and that there is no authority in law for separately recording and indexing the same or in charging an extra fee for extra indexing in a record separate and apart from the record of the release.

Mr. E. E. Stanton, Stromsburg, Neb.

I ["his statute is simply declaratory of the common law. anty officials cannot participate in the benefits of con - cts entered into by the county.

Webster r. Nebraska Telephone Co. 17 Neb. 126; Wetter* Vmtm Tele - graph Co. v. Call Publishing Co. 44 Neb. 326.) The amend - ment to the constitution creating the railway commission provides as follows: I 'The powers and duties of such commission shall include the ;ulation of rates, services and general control of common carriers the legislature shall provide by law." (Cobber's Annotated Statutes, . 690.) Section 10,650, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes, confers upon the commission the power to regulate the rates and services of common carriers, and section 10,652 makes the term "common carriers" include telephone companies and others engaged in the transmission of inessai: I'hus, it will be seen that the rates and services of sphone companies are subject to regulation by law, I permission to increase or diminish the same must t be obtained on application to the railway commission, ier the law the services of telephone companies must supplied to all alike and without discrimination in rges or rates. Hence, the element of profit contem - ted by the making of the ordinary contract cannot en - into agreements to pay for services rendered by com - n carriers. IChe statute under consideration was evidently designed prevent county officers from participating in the bene - of contracts made by the county in the purchase of â–ºplies or the rendition of services, wherein the element profit is contemplated by those furnishing the same. b telephone company could not lawfully contract with county for a greater or lesser rate than it could with t citizen for the same service.

If the company, without good ise, withdrew this service or refused to furnish it, it ild be compelled by mandamus to furnish the same. By ilogy I think the following is in point: "Under section 629 of the Civil Code, a gas company, engaged in the business of furnishing gas to consumers generally for profit. In the city of Sacramento, is bound to furnish it to the city upon demand; and having furnished it, the city is liable for the rea - sonable value thereof, although the mayor of the city is a stock - holder in and president of the gas company, and section 211 of the city charter inhibits its officers from being interested in any con - tracts or sales to the city involving the payment of money from its treasury."

Supervisors â€” Determining Term of Office. rsr the proposition of township supervisors shall have been adopted by the legal voters, and the requisite number of supervisors elected, the term of office of the various supervisors shall be determined by lot and not by motion. IE. Sandall, Esq., County Attorney of York County r York, Neb. IDear Sir: I have yours of the 30th instant, in which u submit in substance the following statement: </seg>
            <seg id="p123">21 The county board of York county, on petition of legal voter*, caused to be submitted to the voters thereof the question of town - ship supervisors under the provisions of sections 71 to 81. inclusive. article 4, chapter 18, Compiled Statutes of 1907. The proposition for township supervisors was adopted by a majority of the legal voter* at the general election held in the year 1907. At the general elec - tion of 1908 supervisors were elected for each of the twenty townships and wards of cities in the county. On the second Tuesday after their election they assembled at the county seat, chose one of their num - ber as chairman, and undertook to decide the term for which each should hold his office. The following record was made in relation thereto : "The matter of determining the long and short terms for the members elect was then taken up. Supervisor Bittinger moved that the members elected from the odd numbered townships serve for one year, and those elected from the even numbered townships serve for two years. 1 he motion, being duly seconded, prevailed." The question you propound is as follows: Es this action of the board in accordance with the provisions of law for determining the terms of office for the various super - s. and if not what action should the supervisors take in the ilses?" The law relating to this matter is as follows: "If it shall appear by the returns of said election that a majority of the legal voters of such county voting at such election are for township supervisors, then at the next general election after the adoption of township supervisors one supervisor shall be elected from each township and one from each ward of each city of the first and second class and on the second Tuesday after such election the super - visors so elected shall assemble at the county seat of said county and after choosing a chairman from among their number shall proceed to divide themselves by lot into two classes as equal in number as pos - sible. The members of class one shall hold their office for one year, those of class two for two years, and at every general election thereafter supervisors shall be elected to succeed those whose terms expire and such supervisors shall hold office for two years or until their successors are elected and qualified." (Compiled Statutes of lÂ»07, ch. 18, art. 4, sec. 73.) In my judgment the action taken by the board does not comply with the provisions of the law. The terms of office are fixed at one and two years. The law requires that the supervisors determine by lot who shall serve for the long term and who shall serve for the short term. The </seg>
            <seg id="p124">22 supervisors undertook to determine this matter by mo - tion. In other words, they adopted a method of their own instead of the one prescribed by statute. Hence, their action in this matter is void. When they meet on January 12, 1909, in my judgment, they should decide the term for which each shall hold office, as prescribed by the statute, and that is by lot. If there are twenty members they should divide themselves into two classes, of ten each. This may be done by writing the words "class one" upon ten slips and the words "class two" upon ten slips, and placing them in a hat. When they are well shaken each supervisor may draw a slip, which will determine the class to which he belongs. All of the supervisors drawing the slips designated "class one" shall hold office for one year, and those drawing the slips designated "class two" shall hold office for two years. A record should be made showing who are entitled to the short term and who are entitled to the long term. This record will be the guide for ascertaining the vacan - cies which shall be filled at the coming elections. When the terms of office are fixed in this manner, they are as binding as if the supervisors had been elected for specific terms prescribed by statute. The statute with reference to matters of this kind is mandatory and should be strictly followed. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, Attorney General, By Grant G. Martin, Deputy Atty. General.

If TCtch lands are under lease or contract for sale an assign ment in writing should be procured from the lessee or contract holder. The appraiser should also appraise the damages to the state by reason of the establishment of the road, in addition to the value of the land. So far as the state is concerned, no application for the purchase of lands for road purposes shall become effective until ap - proved by the board of educational lands and funds, and all appraisements in reference thereto shall be subject to review by the state board.

In other words, there is only one way known to the law by which the rights of the state in the land designated may be procured, and that is by purchase sub - ject to approval by the board of educational lands and funds in the manner specified in this law. Hence, I think it proper for you to notify the authorities seeking to appropriate this land that they must follow the procedure herein referred to for the purchase of said lands for road purposes, and that the appraisement of the same is subject to the approval and review of the board of educational lands and funds.

You say the ac - cused is demanding a preliminary examination, that this has been denied him on the ground that he is a fugitive from justice, and that for such reason is not entitled to a preliminary examination. You ask, "Is he entitled to a preliminary examination under these facts?" Khis question calls for a construction of section 2757, bey's Annotated Statutes of 1907, which is as foil I "No information shall be filed against any person for any of - se until such person shall have had a preliminary examination refor as provided by law, before a justice of the peace or other mining magistrate or officer, unless such person shall waive his it to such examination; Provided, however, that information may filed without such examination against fugitives from justice, and ' fugitive from justice against whom an information shall be filed y be demanded by the governor of said state of the executive hority of any other state or territory, or of any foreign j,wrn - it, in the same manner, and the same proceedings may be had reon, as provided by law in like cases of demand upon indict- I'. think that under this section an information might ve been filed against the accused in the district court, irging him with this offense and stating therein that was a fugitive from justice, and that upon the filing such an information and the proper application therefor equisition could have been obtained, but I do not think s section applies to a case where a complaint is filed irging the offense before a justice of the ]&gt;eace and a [uisition is procured thereunder.

Dear Sir: In reply to your letter of recent date, inquir - ing as to whether one can lawfully hold the offices of jus - tice of the peace and of village trustee at the same time, I will say it is the opinion of this department that he may.

            <seg id="p129">27 rier does there seem to be any constitutional inhibi - upon their being held by the same person.

It is also true that the office of justice of the peac is a icial office not only in fact but also within the mean - of the constitution, for it is expressly mentioned therein i judicial office. On the other hand, the office of village stee, while it is in fact a legislative office, is not sucb an i as is referred to in the provisions of the constitution, in the next section of the constitution following the above quoted it is expressly provided that the legisla - ? authority is vested in a senate and a house of vepre - tatives. Ei support of the views herein expressed I cite the j of People v. Provines, 34 Cal., 520. Article 3, consti - on of California, is in the following words : f'he powers of government of the state of California shall bÂ« led into three separate departments â€” the legislative, the execu - and judicial â€” and no person charged with the exercise of powers erly belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any tions appertaining to either of the others, except in the case* inafter expressly directed or permitted."

Where the assessor haa failed to procure a schedule of per - sonal property from a resident of the county, and the tax-list is made up and turned over to the county treasurer before such omis - sion is discovered, is there any way to prevent such property from escaping taxation for that year? If so what is the procedure?" "2.

If so by whom? If such erroneous school district tax has been paid and the tax of the cor - rect district is greater, what remedy has the county or school dis - trict?" In answer to your first proposition will say it is tha opinion of this department that there is no legal way by which omitted personal property may be placed on the tax-list and taxes levied against same for any year other than the current year. From this it necessarily follows that in many instances such property will escape taxation. How - ever, there is a statutory provision in this state, as follows: "That the county assessor or county clerk may, at any time, add to the tax rolls any property omitted therefrom for the cur - rent year." (Compiled Statutes of 1907, ch. 77, art. 1, sec. 132.) So where the omission is discovered during the current year for which the omitted property should have been placed on the tax-list, such mistake may be rectified by either the county assessor or county clerk. I Answering your second question will say that where the lessor has listed personal property in one school district en in fact it is taxable in another, the assessor may, if I error is discovered before the tax is paid and credited the wrong school district, correct such error by changing ; name of the district to which the tax is payable, but ;re should be no change made in the amount of tax after j tax-list is made up and the taxes have become delin - ent. If such school district tax has been paid the payment thereof by the person charged with the payment of same frees him from any further liability to pay tax on the prop - erty so assessed, even though the amount of such tax is less </seg>
            <seg id="p132">30 than it should have been and though it is received by the wrong school district, but it is probable that the school dis - trict really entitled to receive such tax can recover from the district, which actually does receive it, the amount so Very respectfully, W.

The state board of canvassers is the legally constituted body to make the canvass of returns on constitutional amendments. Hon. George C. Junkin, Secretary of State, Lincoln, Neb. E)eab Sib: I have your communication of January 8, as ows: Irbe state board of canvassers met on the third Monday after the sral election held November 3, 1908, and canvassed the returns the constitutional amendments submitted to the voters at that tion. The board found that a majority of all voters at said elec - favored the adoption of the amendments relating to the invest - t of educational funds and the increase of the membership of the â– erne court. Thereupon, the result of said canvass was duly certl - to the governor, who, within ten days thereafter, made a finding said amendments had received a majority of the votes cast at election and issued his proclamation declaring said amendments &gt;e a part of the constitution of this state. Thereafter the governor minted four judges of the supreme court, as provided by the ndment relating to judicial powers. "The right of the state board of canvassers to canvass the re - tarns on these amendments has been Questioned, and the regularity and legality of the proceedings in pursuance thereof have been as - sailed. I would like the opinion of your department concerning the regularity and legality of these proceedings." Chapter 3, Compiled Statutes of 1907, prescribes the man - ner in which amendments to the constitution may be pro - posed and submitted to the electors for adoption or rejec - tion. Section 4, of that chapter, relates to the canvass of tbe returns on amendments and, so far as is material to this question, is as follows: "The judges and clerks of election shall make return to the county clerk of their respective counties of the following facts: First, </seg>
            <seg id="p134">32 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. the number of electors voting at such general election at which such amendments were voted upon; Second, the number of electors who voted for said amendment or amendments; Third, the number of electors who voted against said amendment or amendments. The several county clerks in the different counties shall make return to the board of state canvassers, provided for in section 53 of chapter 16 of the Compiled Statutes of 1905, in the same manner and within the same time that they are required to make return of votes cast for officers mentioned in said last named section, and all such return* â€¢hall be directed to the secretary of state and transmitted to him la a separate envelope from the one containing the abstract and return of votes cast for the officers named in said section." From the foregoing it is plain that the county clerks are required to make return of the votes cast on amendments to the board of state canvassers in the same manner that they are required to make return of votes cast for officers mem tioned in section 53, chapter 26, Compiled Statutes of 1905. The latter section is as follows : "The votes cast for presidential electors, judges of the suprem* and district courts, and regents of the university shall be canvassed by a board of state canvassers consisting of the governor, secretary of state, auditor of public accounts, treasurer, and attorney general, and a copy of the abstracts of votes cast for such officers shall be made by the county clerks, sealed up, directed to the secretary of â– tate, and endorsed, 'election returns for the offices of fiis section, establishing a board of state canvassers, â– n'Jis ed by the legislature of 1879 as a part of an act to ] Â»ro - a general election law, and it remains unchanged to day. i)bserve, this section provides that a copy of the abstracts votes cast for said officers should be sent by the county rks to the secretary of state, who, by its terms, is made a mber of the canvassing board. This section also desig - tes the membership of the board of state canvassers, anÂ«l jvides that it shall canvass the votes cast for certain of - &gt;rs therein mentioned. Thus it will be seen that the sec - ary of state is the only officer designated by law to whom s return of votes cast on constitutional amendments may made. Said section 53 and those which immediately fol- </seg>
            <seg id="p135">33 Pt prescribe the procedure and the duties of the sec - of state and the canvassing board in relation thereto, n 54 empowers the secretary of state to send a mes - â€¢ to each county for the abstracts in case they are de - beyond a stated time. Section 55 is as follows: I "The abstracts of votes to be canvassed by the board of state can - ssers shall be kept in the office of the secretary of state, and shall ly be opened in the presence of such board at the time provided the following section." Eection 56 designates the time when the state canvassing rd shall meet. Section 57 is as follows: "They shall make an abstract stating the number of ballots cast for each office, the names of all the persons voted for, for what of - fice they respectively received the votes, and the number of votes each received, in words at length, and stating whom they declare to be elected to the office, which abstract shall be signed by the canvassers In their official capacity, and as state canvassers, and have the seal of the state affixed, but should any two or more persons be returned with an equal and the highest vote, the board shall decide by lot which of uid persons is elected." From these provisions it is evident that the state cam. ing board is the only body having jurisdiction over the re - turns on constitutional amendments, presidential electors, judges of supreme and district courts and regents of the state university. These provisions of the law are meaning - less unless they fix upon the board of state canvassers the duty to canvass the returns on constitutional amendments. If not, why does the law place these returns in the custody of that board and then prescribe the procedure and their duties in making the canvass? If the legislature had in - tended that the returns on constitutional amendments and the officers designated above should be canvassed by that body it would have so provided and made the abstracts of votes cast therefor returnable to the speaker of the house of representatives. In other words, instead of providing that the county clerks of the various counties make return to the board of state canvassers in the manner provided by section 53, chapter 26, Compiled Statutes of 1905, it would </seg>
            <seg id="p136">34 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. have required them to make return to the speaker of the house of representatives in the manner provided by section 51, of the same chapter, which deals with an entirely differ - ent class of officers. Section 51 is as follows: "The votes cast for governor, lieutenant governor, members of con - gress, secretary of state, auditor of public accounts, state treasurer, state superintendent of public instruction, attorney general, com - missioner of public lands and buildings, and district attorneys, and votes cast expressing the choice of electors for United States senators, â€¢hall be canvassed by the legislature at its next regular session. A copy of the abstract of votes cast for such officers shall be sealed up by the county clerk immediately upon the completion of the can - vass, endorsed, 'abstract of votes cast for officers of the executive department from county,' or, 'abstract of votes cast ex- Eiing choice of electors for United States senator from ty,' and addressed to 'the speaker of the house of represent*- This section is a part of the act of 1879 and was passed at the same time as section 53, establishing the board of state canvassers. The reason for giving the legislature the power to canvass the returns on executive officers is ap - parent. The board of state canvassers is composed of five executive officers, and hence they are not permitted to canvass the returns on votes cast for themselves, but that power is lodged in the legislature. !"ertainly it cannot be contended, with reason, that the Lslature required the returns on these amendments to be ced in the hands of the board of state canvassers, who 1 the exclusive right to canvass the returns on a specific 58 of officers, and at the same time intended that the islature itself should have the right to make the canvass reon when its jurisdiction to make a canvass is limited an altogether different class of officers designated by &gt;ther provision of law. No provision is found, either in constitution or in the statutes, which directly or in - ectly places the returns on constitutional amendments in i hands of the speaker of the house of representatives or ich directly or indirectly authorizes the legislature to can - is the same. </seg>
            <seg id="p137">35 In this connection it is well to notice what has been the practice relative to canvassing returns on constitutional amendments. The legislature of 1895 submitted ten con - stitutional amendments to the electors at the general elec - tion of 1896. The returns of all of these were canvassed by the board of state canvassers on November 27, 1896. None of these carried, hence no proclamation was issued by the governor. In 1901 the legislature submitted to the voters at the general election of 1902 an amendment relating to the manner of submitting constitutional amendments. The returns thereon were canvassed by the state canvassing board on November 29, 1902. This amendment was not adopted. The legislature of 1903 submitted to the electors at the election of 1904 the proposition calling for a convention to revise, amend and change the constitution. The returns on this proposition were canvassed by the state canvassing board on November 28, 1904. This proposition did not carry. The legislature of 1905 submitted to the electors at the general election of 1906 an amendment to the constitution establishing a railway commission, and the returns thereon were canvassed by the board of state canvassers on Novem - ber 26, 1906. The board found that this amendment had carried and on November 27, 1906, the governor issued his proclamation declaring the same to be a part of the state constitution. It has been suggested that the legislature of 1907 canvassed the returns on the latter amendment in connection with those on executive officers. If so, this was done subsequent to the canvass made on that amendment by the board of state canvassers and subsequent to the issuance of the governor's proclamation declaring it part of the constitution. The fact that the legislature also took action on the same matter is immaterial. It is sufficient in that regard to say that action by one tribunal upon a mat - ter over which it has no jurisdiction cannot, and does not, oust the tribunal having jurisdiction of its authority to act or render the acts it has taken nugatory. Such action </seg>
            <seg id="p138">36 neither confers authority on the one nor divests the power of the other. Section 5, chapter 3, Compiled Statutes of 1907, provides as follows: E'.t a majority of the votes cast at the election herein provided for, or the proposed amendments, the governor, within ten days after result is ascertained, shall make proclamation, declaring the ndments to be part of the constitution of the state." Ifoserve that this section is a part of the chapter provid - for the submission of constitutional amendments to electors, and immediately follows the section requiring returns thereon to be placed in the possession of the rd of state canvassers. Consequently, it is apparent t the proclamation of the governor declaring constitu - lal amendments part of the constitution was to be ed upon the canvass and result ascertained by the state vassing board. The board of state canvassers has canvassed the returns on constitutional amendments continuously for a period of twelve years. Its right to so act has been conceded and acquiesced in by the various governors and public officials. Thus, the law conferring such authority upon the board of state canvassers has received a practical construction by the officials and various departments of state for a long term of years. iln some jurisdictions long-continued, contemporaneous, and prac- I construction by the legislative and executive departments has a followed, even though the courts believed the language under sideration clear and unambiguous. 8 Cyc. 737; 26 Am. &amp; Eng. yc. of Law (2d Ed.) 634.

He then appointed four judges of the supreme court, as provided in the one relating to judicial powers. In view of the fact that there is no express provision for the canvass of the returns on constitutional amendments, that there is no board or tribunal to which the statute directs these returns to be made other than the state canvassing board, and having due regard to the contemporaneous con - struction placed upon the law by the officers of the state for twelve years and for the other reasons herein pointed out, I conclude that the board of state canvassers was the legally constituted body to make the canvass of returns on said constitutional amendments and that its acts and find - ings in the premises, as well as those of the governor bowl thereon, were regular and in strict compliance with law.* Very respectfully, W.

The second question arises on the following statement of facts: In October 1908 the wife of Joseph Novotny filed a complaint under section 267, Crimnal Code. At the time of the hearing the defend - ant, under the proviso of section 2427, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1907, gave a peace bond conditioned and provided by this sec - tion for the period of one year. The one year being the time as fixed by the court. Within the year he violated his bond by committing a brutal assault on his wife. On December 26 he committed suicide. The bond is, of course, now payable out of his estate. He was ar - rested and tried for the second offense, which also violated his bond, and was convicted and fined, but paid his fine. Is there any way by which the estate may be lawfully relieved of this fine? If so, by whom?" In answer to the first question propounded I will siy that it is the opinion of this department, based upon the facts as above set forth, that the county judge had no law - ful authority to reduce, in December, a sentence previously - pronounced by him in October. I do not know that I have a correct understanding of your second question. You say that Novotny was convicted, fined, and paid this fine, and then ask if his estate can l&gt;e lawfully relieved of this fine. If you mean to inquire whether the amount already paid by deceased can be paid back lawfully to his estate, I will say that it is the opinion of this department that it cannot. Very respectfully, W.

            <seg id="p141">OPINIONS. 39 of January 8, submitting the following proposition and asking for an opinion thereon: I 'About eight years ago A. A. McCoy and Dr. A. H. Thomas were lointed members of the insanity board of Hitchcock county by judge of the district court of said county. No record was made the appointments and no record, of any kind whatever, was made wing that they took the oath required by statute, but they, with county clerk, have been acting as the insanity board of Hitch - k county from that time to the present time. No appointment of r other person has been since made. In your opinion is this a kl board and is the county liable for costs, including costs of riff and witness, in an examination under the law by said parties ing as the board of insanity In a proper case where a lawful com - int was made?" It is the opinion of this department that, under the facts above stated, Messrs. McCoy and Thomas are de facto not de jure members of the board of insanity of Hiteh - k county. It seems they wore regularly appointed, but far as the record discloses failed to take the oath of c?e. Their appointments in the first instance, under the ivisions of the statute, could not have been for longer iods than one and two years respectively. (Compiled tutes, eh. 40, sec. 17.) When the terms of office for ich they were appointed expired, it was the duty of h of them, under the law, to make and file an oath of ce if he continued to hold office by reason of the non - lointment of a successor. "Where the incumbent of an office holds over by reason of the non - election or non-appointment of a successor, or of the neglect or re - fusal of his successor to qualify, he must qualify anew within ten days from the time at which his successor should have qualified." (State ex rtl. Roche v. Coggrwe, 34 Neb. 386.) There is nothing to show from the statement contained in your letter that either of the parties complied with the provisions of the law in this respect, hence they are not de jure officers. But they have continued to serve as members of the board of insanity, and no successor has been appointed for either of them, hence it is plain that they are de facto officers. As smh their acts are as valid </seg>

"The acts and judgments of a de facto officer are as valid and binding as though performed and rendered by an officer de jure." (Dredla r. Baache, 60 Neb. 656.) (See also Ex parie Jolinwm, 15 Neb. 615: Hadcell r. Dutton, 65 Neb. 274.) It follows, therefore, that the county is as much bound to pay the costs of sheriff and witness fees incurred in cases in which these parties have, as members of the board of insanity, served as it would be if they were legally qualified members of such board.

Silas R. Barton, Auditor of Public Accounts, Lincoln, Neb. f)EAR Sib : I am in receipt of your letter of recent date, mitting to me the following proposition and requesting opinion thereon: I 'Is an outgoing state officer entitled to compensation in addition his regular annual or quarterly salary, for the number of days evening between January 1 and the date of the termination of term of office, which this year was January 7, 1909?" The term of office of a state officer is fixed by the con - stitution. In the case of the first railway commissioners it is two, four and six years. In the case of executive state officers the term of office is two vears. In the case of </seg>
            <seg id="p144">42 supreme judges the term of office is six year.-. The salary of each of these officers is fixed by the statute or the constitution at so much per annum. A question pertinent to this inquiry and naturally arising is, what is an official term of office and what is an official year within the meaning of the constitution? The term of an execu - tive state officer begins on the first Thursday after the NrM Tuesday in January next after his election. In l!ie case of : - :iilway commissioner and governor, who were elected in 1906 for two years, their terms began oq tiie first Thursday after the first Tuesday in January, 1907, and terminated on the first Thursday after the first Tuesday in January, I960. In the case of railway commissioner and governor elected in 1908, their terms of office began on the first Thursday after the first Tuesday in January, 1909, which was January 7, 1909. For the salary of each there was appropriated in 1907 the sum of $6,000 and $5,000 re - spectively, lor the biennium. The biennium under the ap - propriation covered the period between April 1, 1907, and April 1, 1909. These annual salaries are made payable quarterly. It will be seen from what has been above pointed out that an official year is not a calendar year under our constitu - tion. The salary of the railway commissioner is not fixed by the constitution, but left to the legislature. When the first railway commissioners were elected in 1906 no salary had been fixed by the legislature. It was not fixed until the passage and approval of House Roll 305, of the 1907 ses - sion of the legislature, which act took effect March 27 of that year. This act provided a salary of $3,000 per annum for each commissioner, to be paid "in the same manner that.the salaries of other state officers are paid." The legislature of 1907 appropriated, by the general salary appropriation bill, the sum of $3,000 per annum for each railway commissioner's salary, or $6,000 for the biennium, and for the governor the sum of $2,500 per annum, or </seg>
            <seg id="p145">43 appropriations was for the two years between April 1, 1907, and April 1, 1909. There having been no biennial appropriation previous to that of 1907 for the salary of railway commissioners, the salary for these commissioners for the time intervening between the first Thursday after the first Tuesday in January and April 1, 1907, was pro - vided for in House Roll 534, a deficiency claim bill, in the "For railway commission, H. J. Winnett and J. A. Willimms in full for all claims for salary, traveling expenses, postage, stationery and investigations from date of taking oath of office to and includ - ing; March 31st, 1907, each two hundred and fifty ($250.00), total $500.00." (Session Laws of 1907, p. 578.) The first quarter of the railway commissioner*' salary â– vrus thus provided for. I am advised that this sum of $250 has been accepted and drawn. Hence, this constitutes full settlement for the first quarter of the first year of the commissioners' two years' term of office. The governor elected in 1906 was authorized to draw $62") for his tirst quarter's salary in 1907 against the appropriation of $5,000 made for the governor by the legislature of 1905 for the biennium commencing April 1, 1905, and ending April 1, 1907. The two years' term of office may have been a few days more or a few days less than two calendar years, but it was in this case no more and no less than two official years. An official quarter of a year may be a few days more or a few days less than three full months, owing to the time when an official year or term begins and ends, but with reference to payment of salary it is a quarter, no more nor no !Â»â€¢ The railway commissioner elected in 1906 would be en - titled to draw from the appropriation of $6,000 made in 1907, for his salary, the sum of $5,250 and no more, pro - viding his successor elected in 1908 qualified on the first Thursday after the first Tuesday in January at the be - ginning of his term of office. The governor elected in 1906 </seg>
            <seg id="p146">44 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. would be entitled to draw from the appropriation of $5,000 made in 1907 the sum of $4,375 and no more, provided his successor elected in 1908 qualified on the first Thursday after the first Tuesday in January in 1909. The first quarter of the term of office may have been a few days less than three full months, while the last quarter may be a few days more than three full months, resulting as above pointed out, but whether short or long the officer, in my opinion, is entitled, and only entitled, to one-fourth of the annual salary fixed by law, for that quarter. If a regular outgoing state officer is authorized to draw pay for the days intervening between January 1 and Jan - uary 7, this year, in addition to his salary for the last quarter, he will necessarily draw a portion of the salary appropriated by the legislature for the incoming officer's first quarter's salary, thus requiring him to receive so Ech less than the statute provides for his salary for the t quarter. I am unable to find any authority in law for so doing, and am of the opinion there is no authority therefor. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, January 15, 1909. Attorney General.

Beside* there is precedent in the statutes for this kind of statutory enactment. The general election laws provide that in counties baring a population of 8,000 or more there shall be elected a clerk of the dis - trict court, and in counties having a population of the county clerk shall be the ex ofjfrio clerk of the district court and perform the same duties as those which devolve upon the clerk of the district court elected in counties of 8,000 inhabitants or more. You also ask the following question: Can the office of county assessor be vacated by statute in counties not entitled to such officer under such proposed law. and thus the assessor be prevented from holding an office the whole of the term for which he was elected? I Che office of county assessor is not a constitutional of - â– , and there is no provision in the constitution in any nn r fixing the term of such officer. Our court has held t where such is the case the legislature may change the m of such officer, and that such change will apply as II to the officer then in office as to those to be elected reafter.

Crites, Esq., County Attorney of Dawes County, Chadron, Neb. Dear Sib: This department is in receipt of your letter of January 14, submitting the following statement of facts and asking for an opinion thereon: Ekt the general election held in this county in November, 1907, a ity assessor was elected under section 7, chapter 26, Compiled utes, entitled, 'Elections.' At the general election of 1908 nomi- Dns were made for this office under section 19, article 1, chapter Compiled Statutes, entitled 'Revenue,' one of them being the ssor elected in 1907. He was defeated, however, by a decisive jrity. The successful candidate has qualified and has submitted he board a list of his appointments of deputies. The assessor ;ed in 1907 has done the same, assuming to act, however, under election in 1907. What they wish to know is. which of these Â»rs shall they recognize?" This department is of the opinion from the above stated facts that the assessor elected in 1907 is the de jure officer and should be so recognized by the commissioners. When the office of county assessor was established, provision was made that the office should be filled by election in 1903 and every fourth year thereafter. In 1905 an attempt was made to amend this law and to provide for the election of a county assessor in 1908 and every fourth year thereafter. This 1905 amendment is a part of what is known as the biennial election law, some parts of which have already been held void by a decision of our supreme court. In 1907 the law was again amended so as to make that part of section 7, chapter 26, of the Compiled Statutes, referring to the election of a county assessor, read as follows: "In all counties one county assessor shall be elected in the year 1903 and every fourth year thereafter." We are, therefore, of the opinion that the assessor elected in 1907 was elected for a term of four years, that such term </seg>
            <seg id="p149">47 has not expired, and that he is entitled to be recognized as the lawful assessor of your county. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, Attorney General, By Geobge \V.

Telephone Companies â€” Rate to Stockholders. tsphone companies cannot lawfully give service to their stockhold - ers at a less rate than to non-stockholders. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Gentlemen : I have your communication of January 29, in which you state that certain telephone companies in this state maintain two classes of rates, the service to their stockholders being given at a less rate than to non-stock - holders. You ask whether this practice is in violation of law. I Telephone companies are public carriers, both within the saning of the statutes of this state and the decisions of ; supreme court. The law provides that no device shall employed which enables a common carrier to charge or Hect from any person a greater or less compensation for y service rendered than it charges, collects or receives &gt;m any other person for doing a like service. This law designed to reach stockholders as well as non-stockhold- i[f stockholders of a telephone company were permitted receive special rates it would lead to all sort of abuses, ider the law public carriers are only entitled to reason - e returns on their investments. Stockholders get their ire of the same from the profits of the business, and they inot be permitted to have reasonable returns upon their 'estments in the nature of dividends and also profit by won of special rates given by the corporation because sy are stockholders.

The stion you submit is, in substance, as follows : IVhere the members of a family are quarantined in their own ne, and expenses are incurred for providing them with necessaries I for fumigating the house, is the county liable for the payment same? Eknow of no statutory authority providing for a coun - liability for claims of this character. Our court has as follows: "In the absence of a statute, a county is not liable for necessaries furnished to persons not paupers while quarantined in their residence for the time being. "The mere fact that they are quarantined, for the public safety, does not relieve persons who are able to support themselves of the doty of so doing." ( Dodge County t. Dier*. 69 Neb. 361, 95, N.

Where a pa - it is taken from his home, is involuntarily isolated from ers and is detained in a place especially provided for by county, the expenses incident thereto would be proper nty charges. The law provides that the county board 11 have power to make and enforce rules to prevent the ead of contagious diseases, and such authority includes power to incur expenses essential for that purpose. The le would be true with reference to expenses necessarily irred in preventing the spread of contagions or infee - is diseases, but the rule is entirely different v!icre one is rantined in his own house, is attended bj physicians I nurses employed by himself and is supplied with nee - iries according to his own orders.

J. P. Baldwin, Esq., County Attorney of Thayer County, Hebron, Neb. Dear Sir : I have yours of the 2nd instant, in which you submit, in substance, the following question: Eas the deputy clerk of the district court the right to sit as a iber of the insanity commission and perform the duties of Ml cipal in relation thereto? Eection 10,065, Cobbey 's Annotated Statutes of Nebraska 1907, provides that the board of commissioners of in - ity shall consist of three persons, two of whom shall stitute a quorum, and the clerk of the district court shall ;x officio member of such board and clerk of the same. Section 10,067, Cobbey 's Annotated Statutes of Ne - braska for 1907, provides that the clerk shall sign and is - sue all notices, appointments, warrants, subpoenas or o.ther process required to be given or issued by the commission - ers, affixing thereto his seal as clerk of said court. I Section 10,068, Cobbey 's Annotated Statutes of Nebraska r 1907, provides that the commissioners shall have power issue subpoenas and compel obedience thereto, to ad - inister oaths, and to do any act of a court necessary and â– oper in the premises. I From these sections it will be seen that two members of e board constitute a quorum, and in the absence or dis - lility of one member of the board provision is made for lecting another to take his place. The deputy clerk of e district court has authority to do any and all acts tiich his principal may do in relation to the duties of the ice of the clerk of the district court. The following sec- Hi is authority for this: </seg>

(Civil code, sec. 893.) ft does not follow, however, that he would have the right act in place of liis principal when his principal is re - red by law to act in conjunction with, or in place of, an - er officer. Section 9,(&gt;f)9, Cobbey'i Annotated Statutes Nebraska for 1907, provides as follows: tin the absence or disability of the principal, the deputy shall per - il the duties of his principal pertaining to his own office, but when officer is required to act in conjunction with or in place of an - â€¢r officer, his deputy cannot supply his place." En Nebraska Loan &amp; Building As**, r. Marshall, 51 Xeb. , it is said : EWany of the officers named in the first section are ts oifrin m-Mn - of boards upon which the performance of special duties are en - ed, and the legislature for some reasoa deemed it wise to per - only the principal to act in such matters, and should he be nt or be incapacitated from acting, the deputy, who generally )lles his place and becomes for the time being the principal of - â€¢, is prohibited by this limitation from occupying the e-r njHrio e on the board." I', therefore, conclude you are right in holding that the mty clerk of the district court should not sit as a mem - â€¢ of the board of commissioners of insanity, in pas&gt;iug an and determining the questions presented to &gt;aid ird, but inasmuch as section 10,0(58 gives the board the ht to issue process and to do any act of a court neceÂ»ary carry out its purposes, two members of the board would re power to order the issuance of process and. in my inion, the deputy clerk of the district court would be thorized to sign the same and affix thereto the seal of i district court for the purpose of giving such process â€¢ce and effect.

E2. Is the party under conditions of this description liable to linal prosecution, who acts as bartender and sells the liquors â€¢ the counter?" The first question you propound is one dependent upon the facts. It is my opinion that if the licensee has removed from the state permanently and has become a citizen of some other state, his license is subject to forfeiture or is forfeited. If lie is only temporarily outside the state and lias not lost his citizenship or become a resident of some other state, I think he has not forfeited his license. IPhe second question you ask is dependent upon the first, the licensee has become a non-resident of the state and feited his citizenship in this state, any one acting under n in tending bar or in selling liquors, would be doing in violation of law and without any legal authority.

George Lavdgren, Esq., Count if Attorney of Fillmore Countij. Geneva, Neb. Dear Sir: I have yours of the fith instant, in which you call my attention to two decisions of the supreme court. The first one, Richie if r. State, 65 Neb. 841, holds that sec - tion 322, Criminal Code, is unconstitutional and void in so far as it authorizes the question of the good faith of the prosecuting witness in instituting the prosecution to be tried and determined at the same time that the defendant is tried, and the taxation of costs against him in case it is found that he acted maliciously or without pi'obable cause. The second case, Teats r. Fox, 75 Neb. 747, holds that sec tion 22, chapter 50, Compiled Statutes of 1905, in so far as it authorizes the taxation of costs against a complaining witness, unless the court shall sustain the finding that there was probable cause for complaint, is unconstitutional and void. In this connection you submit the following ques- </seg>

I^he only remaining section I find which deals with the tstion of security for costs is 2S7, Criminal Code, provid - that the magistrate before issuing a warrant may, in discretion, require the complainant to acknowledge hiin - t responsible for the costs in case the complaint may be missed. Early in its history our court held that eosta ler this section could only be adjudged against a com - inant after a finding that the complaint was made with - probable cause. {Cobbeff r.

I I, therefore, conclude that there would be no authority taking a bond to reimburse the county for costs in roaeeution is dismissed or in case a conviction is secured 1 the person convicted serves his term in jail instead of 'ing the fine and costs, and that an action would not lie such a bond.

Dear Sir: I have your favor of the loth instant, in which you request the opinion of this department on the follow - ing question: KCoulJ this department gain a conviction by prosecution for the ring of, and charging for, game or fish, protected during the open season, by hotels and restaurants?" Section 3258, Cobbey'i Annotated Statutes of 1907, reads as follows : "Any corporation, company, association, person or persons, or Its, hit or their officers, agents, servants or employees, who shall have in Its, his or their possession or control any grouse, pheasant, prairie chicken, quail, wild turkey, wild goose, brant, or any wild duck or any of the birds, animals cr fish protected by this act, except during such open season as may be provided by law. and the period of five days next succeeding the close of such season, or any corporation, com* pany, association, person or persons, or its, his or their officers. agents, servants or employee! who shall, at any time or season of the year, sell, barter, or expose or offer for sale or barter, any wild elk, deer or antelope, grouse, prairie chicken, quail, wild turkey, wild goose, brant, or any wild duck, or any other birds, animals or fish protected by this act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined five dollars for each and every bird or fish unlawfully had in its, his or tbeir possession or control-, or sold, bartered or exposed or offered for sale or barter, and not less than twenty-five dollars or more than one hundred </seg>
            <seg id="p161">59 dollars for each and every animal so unlawfully sold, bartered, or exposed or offered for sale or barter contrary to the provisions of this act." Tliis sect urn of the statute considered alone and taken literally would prohibit the sale of game and fish by any person at any time of the year. P&gt;ut the first paragraph of section .'&gt;l'(&gt;S, which is also a part of the game law of this state, reads as follows: "No panic or fish shall be held in possession of cr placed upon the table of any hotel, restaurant, cafe, or boarding house, or named on its menu or bill of fare as food for its patrons, either under the name used in this act ox under any other name or guise whatever ex - cept during the open season therefor and for the period of five days thereafter." This, by implication at least, &lt;rives hotels, restaurants, cafes and boarding houses the iiÂ»ht to serve game and fish to their patrons, and to charge for same, during the open season. It is a well settled rule of statutory construction that the different parts of the same statute or statutes in part materia must be construed together and force and effect given to each part, if possible. Applying this rule in the consideration of the sectioi the statute above quoted, it seems that while generally â– peaking the sale of game and fish protected by the laws of this state is prohibited at all seasons of the year, yet an exception is made in favor of hotels, restaurants, cafes and boardinir houses, which are allowed to serve game and fish to their patrons during the open season and, of course, to charge for such service. I am, therefore, of the opinion that a conviction for the serving of game or fish during the open season by hotels or restaurants could not be sustained. Very respectfully. W. T.

Telephone Company â€” Discriminatory Rates. An agreement, whether in parol or in writing, by a telephone company with the former owners of such exchange to render service to such parties at a lower rate than that given to other subscribers, for similar service, is Invalid. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Gentlemen : I am in receipt of your communication of March 22, stating that the Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone Company, of Alma, maintains five business telephones in its exchange at Republican City for $1 a month, the reg - ular rate for business service in said exchange being $1.50; and that the reason given for these exceptions from the regular rate is that five persons who formerly owned these telephones had sold out to the Farmers &amp; Merchants Tele - phone Company, of Alma, with the understanding that they should pay no more than $1 a month for business telephone service in the future. You desire the opinion of this department as to whether, under the anti-discrimination statute of 1907, such a verbal agreement would justify the telephone company in giving a lower rate to these parties than it gives other subscribers for similar service, also whether such a written contract would justify the continuance of such a discriminatory </seg>
            <seg id="p164">62 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. My judgment is that neither a verbal nor a written agree - ment to this effect is valid at the present time. It will be iiniod thai the telephone company that made such an ement and the persons by whom the exchange was sold did so with a knowledge of the authority of the legislature to establish reasonable rates for common carriers and to prevent unjust discrimination. When the legislature acted and fixed, either directly or through the railway coirmis - pion, another n*id different rate of service than that estab - lished by the company itself, or when it passed an act to prevent unjust discrimination, any such contract yields to such legal inhibition and becomes nugatory. 11m principle involved in this question was determined the supreme court in the case &lt;&gt;1" State V. Ma it i/ii, 117 X. 71!'. In that case it was contended that Martyn was itled to receive, and the railroad company entitled to e. transportation by reason of a contract made prior to enactment of the anti-pass law. that the anti-pass law I unconstitutional because it disturbed vested rights sing out of the contract previously made, and that the i-pass law impaired the obligations of contract. By tion 7, article 11, constitution, it is provided: E'he legislature shall pass laws to correct abuses and prevent un - discriminations. and extortions in all charges of express, tele - h and railroad companies in this state, and enforce such laws by uate penalties." E?lephone companies are. so far n&gt; said constitutional ision is concerned, to be regarded the same as telegraph panics. The court in the case above cited says: "It is also well settled that the internal commerce of a state â€” that is, the commerce wholly confined to and carried on within the limits of a single state â€” is as much under state control as foreign or interstate commerce is under the control of the general govern - ment. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ The exercise of this power necessarily includes the right to interfere with contract and property rights, so far, at least, M may be necessary to prevent extortion and discrimination. From â€¢Ten a cursory examination of the several acts of our legislature on this subject, it is apparent that the contract under consideration waa, and is, discriminatory in its nature.

J am, therefore, led to the conclusion that this contract being in the nature of an unjust discrimination is contrary to that portion of the railway commission act. which ex - pressly forbids the same, and if said contract was ever and binding on the parties, whether in parol or in writing, it is abrogated by the statute to which I have referred.

E. H. Whehw, Esq., County Attorney of Holt County, O'Nem.Neb. Dear Sir: I have your letters of the 18th and 23rd in - stant, in which you state the following facts: Very resi&gt;ectfully, W. T. Tn March 23, 1909. Attorn County Board â€” Repair or Bridoi </seg>
            <seg id="p166">64 "For the past seven years the counties of Boyd and Holt have jointly maintained four wagon bridges across said river, and one of these bridges has recently been washed out and more than half destroyed by ice and high water. The important question is whether or not Holt county should under the conditions to be hereinafter stated enter into a joint contract with Boyd county for the repair of said bridge. "The bridge fund in Holt county for the year 1908, and previous years, is totally exhausted. The levy for 1909 cannot exceed $13,000. "Judgments for about $16,000 are now standing against the bridge fund of this county, and by the first of July there will possibly be $4,000 more making in all a judgment indebtedness of about $20,000. The levy for 1909 cannot, therefore, even if collected in full, equal more than 65 per cent of the judgment indebtedness against this fund. "It is also proposed to build jointly certain ice-breaks in said river Immediately up stream from the substructure of said bridge, but not physically attached or connected with said bridge." You ask the following questions based thereon: "1. Does the law permit a county board to declare emergencies, without limit, for the repair of bridges when the county is indebted to the extent above indicated in proportion to its levy?" "2. Under the foregoing conditions, can the adjoining county com - pel this county to enter into a joint contract to repair said bridge, or, upon its refusal, can the adjoining county have the bridge repaired and compel this county to contribute?" "3. Assuming that the bridge, including the substructure, has been practically destroyed, the fund being exhausted, can an emergency be declared to rebuild rather than to repair the bridge, and, if so, can Holt county be compelled to join, or upon refusal be forced to con - tribute if the other county proceeds and builds the bridge?" "4. Can an emergency be declared to let a contract for the repair of ice-breaks not actually attached to, or in physical contact with, an existing bridge where there are no funds and no available levy?" "5. The bridge in question having been in existence for seven or eight years on the line of the public road and used by the public crossing this river, does this alone ipm facto constitute an emergency when there is another good bridge joining the same counties across the river about ten miles away, the country not being very thickly settled in the neighborhood of the damaged bridge and not per - ceptibly more thickly settled than prior to the first building of said bridge? What is an emergency?" In answer to your first question I think the county board has a right to declare an emergency relative to any bridge which needs, immediate repairs on account of its impassa - bility by reason of any disaster which may have befallen it, and this may be done as often as the bridge becomes dam- </seg>

I M )&lt; I lU to take speedy action in order to prevent inconvenience or damage to the traveling public. The county hoard should declare such emergencies, and take action in relation there - to, only in such cast's as are contemplated by the statute. The legislature of 1905 passed an act, the purpose of which is to prevent county l&gt;oards from incurring liabil - ities against counties when no" funds are legally available therefor, but this act recognizes an exception in the fol - lowing provision: "Provided this act may not prevent the repairing or any bridge damaged by sudden casualty when the county board shall first declare that an emergency exists and give notice of their intention to repair â– uch damage by at least one publication in some newspaper of general circulation in the county." (Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1907, Â«ec. 4806.) I Under said section 4H(M&gt; and the ruling of this depart - Â»nt (Report and Opinions of Attorney Gtoneral, 1907-1906, 16), I do not think the fact that the county bridge fund is erdrawn in one or both counties is sufficient excuse for Fusal of the county board to declare an emergency and ovide for the repairs of said bridge. The county board 8 the power to transfer from the general fund to the idge fund any unexpended balance in excess of $2,000 len the interests of the county seem to demand the trans - -. (Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1907, sec. 4509.) le money in the district road fund, in the district where ch work is to be performed, may be utilized also. (Cob - y's Annotated Statutes of 1907, sec. 6142.) I In answer to your second question, I think it would hi the ty of your county to enter into a joint contract to repair bridge in which an emergency has properly been de - ired to exist by the county board. In case it should fuse to do so, I believe the adjoining county would have e right, by taking proper steps and giving and pub - hing the notice provided by law, to repair said bridge id recover from your county its proportionate part of e costs thereof. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">66 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL In answer to your third question, I do not think that an emergency should be declared calling for the repair of a bridge, and then under such pretense an entirely new structure be built. In other words, I think the law as to emergencies relates to the repairs of a bridge and not to the building of an entirely new one on the old site. I think the decision in the case of Colfax Count}/ r. Butler nty, 120 X. W. 444, is authority on this proposition. If I am right in this, upon the refusal of your county to partic - ipate in the building of an entirely new bridge the adjoin - ing county could not force you to contribute to the same. In answer to your fourth question will say our court has never passed on the question as to whether or not ice - breaks, not actually attached to a bridge, are a part there - of, and whether the expense for the same can be recovered by one county against another by virtue ol the law making two counties liable for the repair of bridges over streams that divide the counties. One thing is sure, the court has held that the expense in placing ice-breaks cannot be recovered unless the notice separately designates the ice - breaks. (Dodge County r. Sounder* County, 77 Neb. 787.) I am inclined to think that where an emergency is de - clared under the condition of the county finances stated by you, the extra expense of ice-breaks ought not to be included in the repairs, at least until such time as the county finances will justify the same. In answer to your fifth question, I do not think the fact t another bridge may exist in the same county some tance away would legally excuse a county board from ;laring an emergency as to a bridge which has for a nber of years been used by the public and has sud - ily become impassable. The fact that the bridge has â– n constructed, has been used by the public and has ome impassable because of some disaster which has alien it, is sufficient reason for the board to declare an ergency and to take action in relation thereto. The stence of another bridge some distance away, which </seg>
            <seg id="p169">67 might in a measure accommodate the traveling public, would not of itself justify the board in refusing to repair the one which, by sudden casualty, has become ini] able. An emergency is denned as follows: "Any event or occasional combination of circumstances which calls for immediate action or remedy; pressing necessity; exigency; a sud - den or unexpected happening; an unforseen occurrence or condition." {Coh'ojc County r. Jiutler County. 12l) X. W. 444.) I My view is that the emergency clause of the statute u eant to provide for the repair of bridges over rivers ther than the construction of new ones, and that before new bridge can be constructed there should be money ailable to pay for the same. If your question relate-1 the original construction of a bridge, and you woo â€¢out to enter into a contract for the same without su ta - lent money in the county bridge fund from the previous ars, I would say you would be compelled to wait uutil e levy for the year 1909 had actually been made before tering into the contract. (Clark r. Lam aster Cmoity, Neb. 717.) Certainly under the condition of the count v ad fund, and the law as I understand it, you would have â€¢ right to undertake the construction of any new bridges. I am aware that some of the questions submitted by you have never been passed upon by the court, and it is impossible to tell just what the court would hold in rela - tion thereto should a case involving the same be submitted to it. I have given you my best judgment on these mat - ters, according to the light which I now have. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, Attorney General, By Grant G. Martin, Deputy Atty. General.

P. H. Peterson, Esq., County Attorney of Knox County, Wamta, Neb. I Dear Str : 1 have yours of the 25th instant, in which you te that the board of supervisors of Knox county ad - vised for bids for the building and repairing of bridges; it at an adjourned meeting of the said board on March 1909, bids were opened and a contract was let for the ne to the lowest bidder for the term of one year; and it at the time of letting the contract there was no money, the bridge fund derived from the levy of previous Â»rs. You ask the following questions: "1. Is the contract entered into March 9, 1909, by the board of â€¢upervtsorn valid?" "2. If the contract is invalid, would the members of the board bÂ« personally liable for the expenditure of county funds thereunder?" (lections 6127 and 6130, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes 1907, authorize county boards to enter into yearly con - cts for the erection and reparation of bridges, but sec - q 6142 places a limitation upon the building of bridges, ich section is as follows: "That bridges shall not be built, the aggregate cost of which shall exceed a sum greater than the amount of money on hand in the bridge fund derived from the levy of previous yaara, plus eighty-five per cent of the levy of the current year, together with the amount of money in the district road fund in the district where such work is to bo performed." The contract referred to by you was entered into in March, 1909, and, there being no money in the county </seg>
            <seg id="p171">69 question then arises, lias the county board the right to contract in anticipation of the levy to be made in 1909 or must the board await the actual making of the levy ? The supreme court has j&gt;assed upon this question and holds, in substance, that when there are no funds available for the purpose of building bridges, contracts for their building should not be entered into until the levy is actually made. I The limitation on the power of the county board to contract (or Ige buiTding to cost a sum not greater than the amount of money hand in the county bridge fund derived from a levy of previous rs and two-thirds of the levy of the current year, gives no lority to the board to take into account the levy of the current ndar year prior to the making of such levy. Until it is made â€¢e is no 'levy of the current year.'" ( Chat r. LflMMfer County. 69 . 717.) Eonsequently, I conclude that the contract referred to i entered into without authority of law, and is, there - ;, void. I Section 4604, Oobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1907, cx - ?ssly declares that a contract, either expressed or im - ed, entered into with the board of supervisors of any jnty, when there are no funds legally available to carry t the provisions thereof, is unlawful and wholly void as obligation against the county. Section -MO.") makes blic officials personally liable for the full amount nded contrary to the provisions of section 4l!04. &gt;n 4606 prevents a court from rendering judgment fa on contracts of that character, but it also contains an reption relative to the repairing of bridges damaged by dden casualty. I, therefore, conclude that the members of the board would have no right to enter into such a contract until the levy for 1909 has actually been made, and should they nndertake to carry out the provisions of the contract in question they would become personally liable for the ex - penditure of all county funds thereunder.

Under the emergency exception in section 4606, and the previous holding of this department (Report and Opin - ions of Attorney General, 1907-1908, p. 16), I think the board would have the right to declare an emergency and to proceed to repair a bridge damaged by sudden casualty, even though there is no money in the bridge fund to pay for the same at the time, but the county board should de - clare emergencies in only such cases as require speedy action in order to prevent inconvenience or damage to the traveling public.

If this easement has escaped taxation, is it not the fault of the state board in accepting the list of taxable property furnished by the corporation owning said right of way, for taxation purposes, without this easement therein included? Is such right of way an incumbrance on the fee of the land, as would give the county assessor and his deputies in respective precincts through which it runs the right to value and assess, as real estate, said light of way, as it effects each particular parcel or tract of land, deducting Its value from value of assessment on the whole tract, so that the right of way might be offered for sale after advertisement, and sold to buyers at tax sales, in order to collect taxes by compelling corporation owner to redeem and thus save the easement? Where such right of way has escaped taxation what authority and whose place is it to see that taxes are extended on such right of way, for thÂ« years it has so escaped, and collect the same?" In answer to the questions propounded I will say: 1. That fees for transcripts in appeal matters from judgments of the county board are fees for which the county clerk is required to account. 2. Fees received by the county judge for transcripts in appeals from judgments of his court, whether in civil or in criminal cases, are fees for which ho is required to jvcinnt. 3. I am of the opinion that the right of way in ques - tion should be assessed by the deputy assessors of the pre - cincts in which it is situated. Under the former revenue law it was held that a right of way owned by a railroad company, on which no track was laid, was properly sessable by the local authorities. {H. T". &amp; II'. R.

While the revenue law in force at that time and the revenue law in force at the present time differ in many respects, they are substantially the same so far as the provisions for the assessment of the right of way of railroad companies by the state board of equalization and the assessment of real and personal prop - erty of railroad companies lying outside of the right of way by the local authorities are concerned.

He was re-elected and is now serving his second term. During his first term the earn - ings and income of the office did not reach the amount allowed him in compensation. During his second term, the office it seems has become more profitable and for the last two years there is an item of trom 9150 to $250 left over and above the amount that he is allowed for his own service as clerk of the district court and for the services of his assistant or stenographer. He now insists that he is entitled to hold, and is justified in holding, the overplussage for the years during" the last and present term and apply the same to the shortage In pre - ceding years." You ask for an opinion from this department upon the matters involved. I have been unable to find any case where this matter has been passed upon by our court, and the decisions of other courts upon the subject do not seem to harmonize. It has been held in a Pennsylvania case, as follows: IiVhere one was elected to the offices of Prothonotory of the court ommon pleas, and clerk of the courts of Oyer and Terminer, etc., Quarter Sessions of the peace, for two consecutive terms of three s each; and the fees received in each of the three years of his term, and in the first year of his second term, did not reach the of $1,500, and those received in the second and third years of second term exceeded that sum; ho cannot, under the act of the i of March, 1818, appropriate the excess over $1,500, of fees ived in the last two years of his second term, to supply the de - ncies in that sum, which occurred in the four preceding years." mmonwealth v. Steel. 8 Pa. St. 128.) In Missouri a different rule seems to prevail. "A circuit clerk is entitled to receive of the fees earned by him a sum equal to the amount allowed him by law, although such fees may not be collected during his term; and the clerk receiving them (as his successor in office) would hold them in trust for this purpose. The fees earned by a clerk belong primarily to the county, and out or which the clerk is allowed by law to retain a certain Bum, the amount depending upon the population of his county; and the clerk holds such fees as trustee for the purposes for which the law has destined them. receipts of &amp; former ye&amp;r to cover expenses &amp;nd s&amp;l&amp;ries.

( | Volff. 4 5 Mo. App. 489.) In the absence of any decision of our own court upon the matter, and in view of the conflicting decision - other states, the question which you ask is not free from difficulty. This department has heretofore held as fol - low r Where fees earned by a county judge do not aggregate the mu - m amount allowed by law for his annual compensation, he may, to extent of the deficiency, retain feeÂ« collected by him but earned by predecessor, whose salary was paid in full." (Opinions of Attor- General, 1907-1908, p. 3.) Earn inclined to believe that a fair construction of the regulating the compensation to be paid to clerk district courts will lead to the following conclusions: 1. That the maximum amount of compensation allowed by law is in effect a salary, contingent, of course, upon the fees earned by him or collected by him being sufficient to pay same. 2. That the clerk is entitled to receive for each year of his term the maximum amount of compensation allowed by law, if the fees earned by him during his term, includ - ing the fees earned by his predecessor and collected by him after his predecessor has been paid in full, amount to enough to pay same.

            <seg id="p183">81 Dear Sir: I have your favor of April 2, in which you submit the following questions ami request an opinion "1. Is it a violation of the statutes of the state of Nebraska for the proprietor of a hotel, having a cafe which is connected by doors with a room where there is a licensed saloon operated in the name of a person other than the proprietor of the hotel, to allow his employees to receive money from the guests in the cafe for the purpose of purchasing intoxicating liquors at such saloon and to allow his waiters to deliver such intoxicating liquors to such guests in the cafe to be there drank in connection with their meals?" From the al&gt;ove statement of facts it is almost im - possible to answer this question. If the proprietor of the hotel or cafe is acting in good faith in al - lowing his employees to occasionally receive money from his guests, and to go into an adjoining saloon and purchase liquors for such guests, it might not 1*' a viola - tion of the law. On the other hand, if such proprietor de - signedly countenances such conduct on the part of his em - ployees, or instructs and |&gt;ermits them to do this for the purpose of securing trade and inducing people to patron - ize the cafe, I think such conduct would be a device dis - countenanced by the law and such a one M would render him liable to prosecution for either keeping for sale or selling intoxicating liquors. It is the settled policy- of the law that any kick, subterfuge, device or pret shall not be permitted to shield violations or evasions of the liquor law. (Peumer v. CommonweeUh, 111 Ky. 604; State r. Morton. 42 Mo. App. M; Hartgntr, (Tex.) 43 S. W. 331.) "S. Under the facts stated in my first question, where is the place of sale?" Limited entirely to the facts enumerated in your first question, and assuming that the proprietor of the cafe is acting in good faith, the place of sale would be at the bar of the saloon. On the other hand, if, as suggested in my </seg>

"3. If such sale is in violation of the law, is the proprietor of the hotel and cafe a guilty party?" He is guilty of a violation of the law if it is shown such conduct is a trick or device resorted to for the pur - pose of evading the law. "4. Is the waiter who takes the money, purchases the liquor and delivers the same to the customer guilty of violating the law?" The waiter or employee at the cafe would be equally liable with the proprietor, if he knowingly engages in these acts for the purpose of evading the law. "5. Is the liquor dealer who sells the same, knowing the man - ner in which it is to be used and the purpose for which the sale is made, guilty of violating the law?" fhe liquor dealer who sells the liquor and takes the pay same over his bar would not be guilty of a violation of law, unless he has constituted some one to deliver and serve the liquor at a place other than the one for which he holds a license. If the liquor dealer has an under - standing with the proprietor of the cafe, knowingly en - gages in the conduct suggested by you, and does it for the purpose of evading the law and dispensing liquors in a place for which he has no license, he also would be equally guilty with the proprietor of the cafe and his employees. "6. Would the proprietor of the cafe, if he is the holder of the license, violate the law by making a sale under such conditions as are herein enumerated?" The proprietor of the cafe, if he is the holder of a license, would have the right to sell the liquor and serve it in the </seg>

In the case of Coifâ„¢ Covnip v. Butler ('mint,,, 120 X.

While the court did not definitely decide the question raised, it held that such contention was a strained construction of the word "repairs" and that the word "repairs" as used in section (i417, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1!HÂ»7, relating to contracts between counties for the repair of bridges, is used in its ordinary - and does not include ice-breaks. Furthermore, I do not think that an emergency should properly be declared with reference to a bridge which has become impassable by reason of usual wear and nat - ural decay.

In case there is no money available the proper fund, I think the county board would still re the right to repair a bridge damaged by sudden ualty, as provided by section 4606, chapter 11, Cob - y's Annotated Statutes of 1907. (Report and Opinions Attorney General, 1907-1908, p. 16.) ii answer to your second question, I think that inas - h as the county board properly adopted plans and lifieations, advertised for bids, and for good reasons cted all the bids submitted for such work, it still has right, under the provisions of section 85g, chapter 78, ipiled Statutes of 1907, without contract, advertise - lt or competitive bids, to purchase the necessary Ige material and employ the necessary labor to con - ict the same. Our court has held that the provisions section 85p, relating to emergencies authorizes the nty board to proceed and expend large sums of money n bridges without advertising or competitive bidding. I late v. Smith, 108 N. W. 173.) If the court gives this struction to section 85p, which does not include any Â»ress authority to purchase materials, it certainly uld give a similar construction to section 85g, where h authority is conferred upon the board by language ich unmistakably authorizes it to purchase material 1 employ the necessary labor to construct bridges, wever, I think if your board proposes to construct two v bridges it would be advisable to advertise for com - itive bids under the plans and specifications already &gt;pted and let the contracts in accordance therewith.

Sections 2a and b, paragraph 2, amended by-laws of the Nebraska State Historical Society, adopted January 12, 1909, are in con - flict with article 5, constitution of said society, which relates to the duties and authority of the secretary. Mr. Robert Hurra/, First Viet President, Nebraska State Historical Society, Lincoln, Xeh. Dear Sir: You submit to this department the follow - ing question and request an opinion thereon: "Are sections 2a and b, paragraph 2, amended by-laws, adopted at the annual meeting held January 12, 1909, in conflict with article 6. constitution of the Nebraska State Historical Society, relating to the duties and authority of the secretary?" Article 5, constitution of the society, provides that the society shall have a president, two vice presidents, a treas - urer and a secretary, who shall be elected by ballot at the annual meeting and shall hold their offices until their re - spective successors are elected and qualified, and that a vacancy in any office may be filled by the board of direc - tors for the unexpired term. Then follows a statement of the duties of the respective officers. With reference to the duties of the secretary the following provision is made: "The secretary shall have the custody of the society's property and the general supervision and management of its work, subject to control by the board of directors." Then follow other provisions that are not material to this inquiry. The amended by-laws in question are as fol - lows: </seg>

He â– hall keep the records of the meetings cf the society, and conduct the correspondence of the board, preserve all correspondence la proper files, and keep copies of all letters written by him. He shall see that all employees of the board perform their duties and carry out the rules and orders of the board. For his services as secre - tary he shall receive such compensation as the board may determine. "(b.) The board shall appoint a superintendent, who shall have general charge and administration of the property and work of the society and such other employees as it may deem necessary. The board shall have power to make rules for their government and to pre - scribe their duties and compensation. The superintendent and all other employees shall hold office at the pleasure of the board. The sec - retary may be appointed superintendent." Efhe first section of the amended by-laws, above set forth, almost in the exact language of the provision of the ist it ut ion relative to the duties of the secretary herein - ore set forth, and, in my judgment, is not in any man - 1 in conflict therewith. A different situation, however, is presented when we come to consider the provisions of section b, amended by - laws. Section 6, constitution, provides as follows: "The board of directors is made the governing body of the society, with power to manage, administer and control the disposition of ita moneys, property, effects and affairs, subject to this constitution and by-laws annexed. They may adopt such rules as they see fit, not contrary to this constitution and by-laws, for the administra - tion of the society's affairs." It will be observed that the control of the society's &gt;perty and moneys and the general management of its airs in the last analysis are vested in the board of di - tors, but with reference to such control the secretary the society is made the officer through and by whom it ill exercise such control.

The provisions of the constitution defining the duties of the secretary are unambiguous, and little, if anything, is left to construction. It is contended in support of section b, amended by - laws, that the same is in accordance with a practical and contemporaneous construction of long standing placed by the board of directors upon the provisions of articles 5 and 6, constitution, pertaining to the duties and powers of the board of directors. My opinion is that such con - struction cannot be successfully urged as a reason for sus - taining a by-law that is in direct contravention of the pro - vision of the constitution defining the duties and powers of the secretary. This conclusion is based upon the hold - ing of the supreme court of this state in analogous ques - tions of construction. In State ex rel. Platte County v. Sheldon, et al., 113 N. W. 208, the court had occasion to consider and comment upon the effect to be given a con - temporaneous construction placed upon a revenue statute. In that opinion the court said: "In the construclion of constitutional provisions some courts bar* held that the practical construction adopted and long continued by the legislative department will be followed, even when clearly er - roneous. This court has not generally adopted this doctrine. It was said in State v. Cornell, 60 Neb. 276, that: 'While a practical Interpretation of the constitution by the legislature will not be lightly disregarded in doubtful cases, yet, when the language of the consti - tution is free from ambiguity, an interpretation thereof by the legis - lative department cannot be invoked to nullify the fundamental law.' In some jurisdictions long-continued, contemporaneous and practical construction by the legislative and executive depart - ments have been followed, even though the courts believed the lan - guage under consideration clear and unambiguous. This court has stated that such construction will govern only where the language of the statute is doubtful." It is, therefore, my opinion that section b, amended by - laws, is in direct conflict with that provision of article 5 t constitution, defining the duties of the secretary of the so - ciety, and is void to the extent that it undertakes to give </seg>

In nearly all of said intervening sections the managing body for the normal schools is termed the "board of education." To this board of education, by the terms of section 11. is given control of all funds appropriated for the use and benefit of the normal schools, together with the income arising from the leases and sale of endowment lands belonging to the said school, and the treasurer shall pay out the proper funds on drafts for moneys to be ex - pended under the provisions of said subdivision, such or - ders or drafts to be drawn by the auditor on certificate of the secretary countersigned by the president of the board of education, and no such certificate shall be given ex - cept on accounts allowed by the board in open meeting. The amendment makes a radical change in the preexist - ing section 1, in that it undertakes to create a board to be known as the "normal board of education," which shall have the control and direction o* "he normal education of the state, including normal schools and junior normals, and shall succeed to, take the place of and exercise the powers of the present "board of education" as "herein provided." It provides that the five members of the board shall be appointed by the governor by and with the ad - vice and consent of the senate, and that such five members 6hall be appointed within ten days after the act takes ef - fect and before the adjournment of the present session of the legislature.

            <seg id="p195">OPINIONS. 93 "An act to amend sections one (,1) and twenty-two (22), of subdivision thirteen (13), chapter seventy-nine (79), of the Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska for 1907, and to repeal the said original lections as they now exist, and to provide for an emergency." If the authority of the board of education, ;is created [ established under the provisions of section 1 prior to amendment, and the authority conferred upon such rd by the terms of section 11, of said subdivision m it v stands, has been taken away and conferred upon the r "normal board of education" as defined in the amend - at to section 1 provided for in House Roll 2Kb", author - lg the issuance of certificates on which you, as auditor, ill issue warrants on the state treasury, it is because the ended section has had the effect of amending the qs intervening between sections 1 and 22 by practically mging the term "board of education" to mean the "nor - 1 board of education." Section 11, article 3, constitution, provides as follows: Eo law shall be amended unless the new act contain the sec - or sections so amended and the section or sections so amended bo repealed." I louse Roll 286, is in terms an amendatory act purport - to amend sections 1 and 22, subdivision 13, chapter 79, npiled Statutes of 1907, only. It would seem clear that suld not have the effect of amending sections from 2 to 21, lusive, of said subdivision, without doing violence to the istitutional provisions above quoted. This legislation, I view it, is an indirect attempt to amend sections 2 to inclusive, in a different manner than that commanded the constitution. It is elementary that what may not donfe directly may not be done indirectly. In Smoils White, 4 Neb. 353, the supreme court of this state laid wn the following rule: "Where an act is not complete in itself, but is clearly amenda - tory of some former statute, it is within the constitutional inhibi - tion above cited. Nor would it make any difference in this re - spect, whether br its title, or in the body of the act, the sew statute </seg>
            <seg id="p196">94 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL assume to be amendatory or not; it is enough If it clearly have that â€¢ffect." This rule has been reaffirmed in all subsequent cases where the question arose. In Armstrong r. Mayer, 60 Neb. 423, the court held as follows: "Where the title to a bill is to amend a particular section, no Amendatory legislation not germane to the subject-matter of the orig - inal section proposed to be changed is permissible." It has been the policy of the executive state officers to consider all acts passed by the legislature as constitu - tional and valid until declared otherwise by the courts. In this case, however, we are confronted with the situa - tion of being called upon to determine which of two acta of the legislature is valid and shall be followed. Section 11, as it now stands in the statute, requires you to issue warrants upon certificates by the secretary of the "board of education" and countersigned by the president, while the amended section 1 says that the "normal board of education" shall succeed to, take the place of and exer - cise the powers of the present board of education as *' herein provided." Section 1 does not undertake to pro - vide how the "normal board of education" shall exercise its powers. The exercise of its powers and duties are all defined in sections from 2 to 21, inclusive, which are not in terms undertaken to be amended by House Roll 286. In view of the questionable constitutionality of this act "of the legislature, the conflicting provisions of the statute, and the fact that the question here presented in - volves the expenditure of public funds, I think you would be warranted in refusing to issue warrants on certificates of either the "board of education" or the "normal board of education" until an adjudication may be had on this matter by the court.* Very respectfully, W.

I doubt not that the same ding would be made by the court if it were called upon constrtie the provisions of section 81, that the tax on gross premiums is not to be taken in lieu of all other I am, therefore, of the opinion that a domestic life inance company, such as you describe, is required to ' a tjix on its gross premiums and also should be as - sed for and pay taxes upon any other property which company owns within the jurisdiction of the county "2. Suppose I have one company in my county having a capital Stock of $100,000 paid up and having $5,000 surplus and during the year it has received $10,000 as gross premiums, making a total of $115,000 which it returns to me for taxation, what is the proper RrBe to pursue in the case of the second company having $100,000 1 up and advertising as having over and above all capital stock liabilities $375,000 as surplus as well as having received $10,000 premiums? If it is right to assess one of them on capital stock and surplus, it 1b also right to assess the other. Now, the question Â» which is right? If it is right for the companies located in Las* ter county to be assessed on such a basis, why not see that it is ic In Douglas county as well?" I copy the above proposition from a letter submitted to you by a county assessor. While these questions are not entirely intelligible, yet I take it that what is meant is reasonably plain. In determining the assessed value of the capital stock of an insurance company it is proper to take into consideration any and all of the facts stated in the Question. In other words, the object of the assessor </seg>
            <seg id="p199">97 true value of the capital stock of these corporations. The value of the capital stock would represent the surplus or undivided profits, franchise and tangible property of the company. The tangible property of the company would necessarily be separately assessed. Therefore, after hav - ing ascertained the actual value of the capital stock, there should be deducted from such valuation the value of the tangible property otherwise assessed. After deducting its value from the actual value of the capital stock the bal - ance would be the taxable value of the shares of capital stock. In arriving at the value of the capital stock the ssor should not take into consideration the gross pre - miums which are otherwise assessed. With reference to what is said about such property be - ing assessed differently in different localities, beg leave to say it should be assessed alike in all counties. The law is general and extends to all companies in every county in the state. The rule hereinbefore suggested should, in my judgment, be followed throughout the entire state in the assessment of this class of insurance companies. Very respectfully, W. T.

Demurrage â€” Interstate Shipment. r murage charges on interstate shipments fall within the juris - diction of the Interstate Commerce Commission rather than that of the State Railway Commission. Nebraska 8tate Railway Commusum, Lincoln, Neb. Eentlemen : I am in receipt of your communication of il 28, submitting the following proposition and re - iting an opinion thereon: "An interstate shipment arrives at destination, is accepted by the consignee and freight charges are paid. Subsequent io the payment of the freight charges demurrage accrues on the ship - ment. </seg>

"In this connection, your attention is specifically directed to the fact that car service rules are a part of the tariff provisions under which interstate shipments are made." rthe car service rules are a part of the tariff provi - s under which the interstate shipments are made, the contract of shipment is made with reference thereto and the same must necessarily form a part thereof. The ship - ment is an interstate shipment and the railway company lias fully performed its part of the contract, in my judg - ment, when it has transportated the goods to the place of destination and set out the car at a point where the ship - per is enabled to unload the same. The shipper's con - tract, however, is not completed simply by the payment of the freight charges, since the freight charges are only a part of his obligation. The demurrage charges that ac - crue after the free time has elapsed for the shipper to un - load the car, so accrue by virtue of the contract of â€¢ship - ment, which is interstate in character. In the case of Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Texas, 204 V. S. 403, the supreme court of the United States held: "An interstate shipment â€” in thi3 case of carload lots â€” on reach - ing the point specified in the original contract of transportation ceases to be an interstate shipment, and its further transportation to an - other point within the same state, on the order of the consignee, la controlled by the law of the state and not by the interstate coru - merco act." But, in my judgment, this decision is not authority on the proposition stated in your communication. The de - murrage charges accruing on an interstate shipment are easily distinguishable from the transportation charges from point of destination of the interstate ship - ment to another point within the same state accruing under a separate and different contract and under dif - ferent laws than those under which the interstate ship- </seg>

In the case quoted the contract for in - terstate shipment was completed, so far as the common carrier was concerned, when it was delivered to the con - signee at its original point of destination. In the involved in your question the railway company performed all its obligations at the time it transported the car to the point of destination named in the bill of lading and ten - dered delivery. The payment by the shipper, however, of the freight charges might or might not amount to a complete fulfillment of his contract obligations to the car - rier. The duty to unload the car was upon him and alao the obligation for the payment of demurrage in case he failed to unload the car within a given length of time alter tt appears that the Interstate Commerce Commie taken, and is exercising, jurisdiction over demurrage rges on interstate shipments by the adoption of the fol - ing into: i Demurrage rules and charges must be observed as strictly ax isportation rules and charges.

Hon. Ashton C. Shallenberger, Governor of Nebraska, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir: In response to your request for an opinion as to the legal status of the appropriations for the main - tenance of the Home for the Friendless at the presept time, beg leave to say that I have examined Senate File 350, also House Roll 465, being the salary appropriation bill, and House Roll 463, being the current expense appropria - tion bill, of the late legislature. Senate File 350 is entitled, "An act providing for the creation and location of a State Public School for de - pendent children, and providing for the government of the same and providing for the care and custody of all the dependent children within the state, and repealing sec - tions four (4), five (5) and six (6), chapter 35, of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska." Chapter 35 is the chap- </seg>
            <seg id="p203">101 for the Friendless. The first section of that chapter is as follows : "That a home for the friendless shall be established in the lUti of Nebraska-" Section 2 provides as follows: E'he location of said home shall be under the supervision of board of public lands and buildings, and shall be located at city or town which shall, after duly advertising for bids for it* ion, donate the largest amount to said home." Section 3 of the act carried an appropriation of $5,000 for the erection of said home. Sections 1 and 2 are unre - pealed by Senate File 350. It is a matter of history that the Home for the Friendless was located at Lincoln, Ne - braska. It follows, therefore, that at the present time we have a Home for the Friendless established by law. I Senate File 350 is an act complete in itself and seen ve been intended to sui&gt;ercede or supplant the functions the Home for the Friendless provided for in chapter 35. ind in examining the appropriation bills above referred that no appropriations were made for the Home for the iendless, either for its maintenance or the salaries of officers, but that appropriations were made for tin es of officers and for the maintenance of the State I'ub School created by Senate File 350. Senate FilÂ« Ties no emergency clause, and consequently does not go o effect until July 2. This situation, therefore, presents itself, that the Home for the Friendkss, as defined in chapter 35, Compiled Stat - utes, is a legally existing institution, with its functions and duties at present unimpaired by Senate File 350; that it will so remain until July 2 of this year; and that there are no appropriations made by the legislature available for the pay of its officers or for the maintenance of the institution and its inmates.

It was evidently the assumption of the legisla - ture that the appropriation bills and Senate File 350 should take effect simultaneously upon their passage and approval, but Senate File 350 contains no emergency clause and, of course, would not take effect until the lapse of three months after the adjournment of the legislature, in accord - ance with the terms of the constitution.* Very respectfully, W.

It is my opinion that under the statute and under the isions of the supreme, court it is the duty of the ap - â€¢ant to publish notice of his application for liquor use in a newspaper published in the county, having the iot circulation therein, even though such newspaper s not have as great a circulation in the city or village ?rc the business is intended to be carried on as some er newspaper in such city or village.

Gentlemen : I am in receipt of your communication of recent date, calling my attention to the provisions of subdivision g, section 14, railway commission act, provid - ing that, "nothing in this act shall prevent the carriage, storage, or handling of freight free of charge or at reduced rates for the state, or for any city, county or town govern - ment, or for charitable purposes, or to and from fairs and expositions for exhibition thereat," and requesting an opin - ion on the proposition as to whether the action of any rail - road company in the carrying, storing or handling of freight free of charge or at reduced rates, under the pro - visions of this section, can be made the basis of a com - plaint or discrimination, and whether the commission MM on its own motion, upon complaint, compel a railroad com - pany to transport, store or handle any particular class of freight free of charge or at a reduced rate for the state, or for any city, county or town government, or for charitable purposes, or to and from fairs or expositions for exhibition thereat. I am inclined to the belief that this provision was en - acted for the purpose of enabling railroad companies to carry or handle freight free of charge or at reduced rates for the government, municipalities, charity or exhibition, at its option. As an abstract proposition I do riot think the railway commission would have a general authority in the premises. There might be cases, however, where the conduct of a carrier would not be justified while pretend - ing to operate under the authority conferred by the statute above set forth, and its conduct might amount in certain s to an unjust discrimination. I would not feel like hold - ing that a case might not arise where the commission would be without authority to act in the premises to prevent any unjust discrimination where the carrier might be pretend- </seg>

Where the carrier, however, is acting in good faith, I think it is doubtful if the commission could intervene and prevent the carrier from exercising reasonable discretion in granting concessions or advantages enumerated in the statute, in the exercise of its option. The question you submit is an abstract one, and, until a concrete case arises and I am advised of the cognate or at - tending facts and circumstances, I would not be able to give an opinion that would be satisfactory either to the commission or to myself.

I find, however, upon investigation, that a long-continued, con - temporaneous and practical construction, both by the legis - lature and by the executive department, differs from what I would be disposed to hold on this question were it inde - pendently or originally presented to me for interpretation. For instance, I find that the salary named in the statute for the private secretary to the governor in 1879 was fixed at $1,500 per annum, ;ind remained so until amended by the legislature of 1903, when the salary was raised from $1,500 to $2,000 per annum. I find that notwithstanding this sal - ary was fixed by statute at $1,500, the legislature of 1883 appropriated, and the private secretary drew, upon vouch- M1 duly audited by your department, $1,600 per annum. The legislature of 1885 appropriated $1,600 per annum, and the secretary drew, upon vouchers duly audited by your de - partment, $1,600 annually. The legislature of 1887 appro - priated $1,700 per annum as salary for the private secre - tary to the governor, which he drew upon vouchers duly audited by your department. The legislature of 1889 also appropriated $1,700 per annum for this officer, which wa3 drawn by him upon vouchers duly audited by your depart - ment. The legislature of 1891 appropriated $2,000 per an - num as the salary for the private secretary to the governor, which, upon vouchers duly audited by your department, was drawn by him. The legislative sessions of 1893, 1895, 1897, 1899 and 1901 each appropriated $2,000 per annum as the salary for the private secretary to the governor, which was drawn by him upon vouchers duly audited by your de - partment. I find also that the salary of the deputy superintendent of public instruction has been for many years prior to 1909 fixed by statute at $1,500 per annum, but that the legisla - ture of 1903 appropriated, as the salary of such deputy, the sum of $1,700 per annum, which has been drawn by him upon vouchers duly audited by your department. The </seg>
            <seg id="p209">107 legislatures of 1905 and 1907 each appropriated the sum of $1,800 per annum for the salary of this deputy, which waa drawn by him upon vouchers duly audited by your depart - I further find that the salary of the deputy secretary of te for many years last past has been fixed by statute at K)0 per annum, but that the legislature of 1901 appro - ated for such salary the sum of $1,(500 per annum, which I drawn by him upon vouchers duly audited and allowed your department. The legislature of 1903 appropriated sum of $1,700 per annum as the salary for the deputy retary of state, which sum was also duly audited and &gt;wed by your department. The legislatures of 1905 and 7 each appropriated the sum of $1,800 as the annual sal - for this deputy, which salary was duly audited and &gt;wed by your department. Thus, it will be seen that with respect to the salaries of these officers the legislature and the executive department have, for twenty-six years, placed a construction upon these appropriations and given them the force and effect of amendments. I Confronted with this long-continued, contemporaneous 1 practical construction by the legislative and execu - e departments I am inclined to hold that you are war - lted in auditing claims and drawing warrants in ac - dance with the amount expressed in the appropriation these statutory officers' salaries. I am inclined to nk the courts, as well as this department, should now governed by the construction given to these appro - ations by the legislature and your department. In the &gt;e of State ex rel.

The prohibition in the section to which you refer is directed against the change of any rate, schedule or clas - sification.

Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your communication of May 13, wherein you request the opinion of this depart - ment as to whether the county board, of a county having a population of less than 30,000, can expend the inheri - tance tax fund under the proviso of section 19, article 8, chapter 77, Compiled Statutes of 1907, without letting a contract therefor by competitive bids after plans and specifications therefor have been made and filed. rhe provisio referred to in section 19, article 8, chapter Compiled Statutes of 1907, is as follows: "Provided that it shall be lawful for the county commissioners of any county having a population of not more than thirty thou - sand to use said fund in the manner herein provided for the im - provement of any grade, bridge, cut, fill or dirt road leading into any city or village within said county." It will be seen that the general purpose for which the expenditure of this fund may be made is for permanent improvements on county roads. The proviso above quoted seems to have been incorporated into the original section </seg>
            <seg id="p212">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 110 as an amendment and modified the law so as to allow im - provements of any grade, bridge, cut, fill or dirt road of a temporary character. I do not think it was the inten - tion of the legislature by this proviso to dispense with the letting of contracts by competitive bidding, but rather to authorize the expenditure of such funds for other than permanent improvements. Therefore, I am disposed to hold that the work and ma - terial used for the repair of highways in counties having a population of less than 30,000, where the same is to be paid for out of the inheritance tax fund, must be let by contract under competitive bidding as provided for in the forepart of section 19.

Food products are to be sold on their intrinsic merit, and if there be contained in, or attached to, any package of food products liny prizes, slips or coupons which are the evidence of prizes or may be used to pay for articles in the nature of prizes in connection therewith, it would be a violation of law. The label on salad dressing, which is a compound food, should bear a statement of the ingredients that compose the com - pound. Hon. S. L. Mains, Deputy Food, Drug and Dairy Com - missioner, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your communication of May 18, wherein you request the opinion of this depart - ment on the following questions: 1. Is a premium ticket attached to a can of maple syrup, pro - viding that one of these tickets, with the name of the dealer thereon, and ten cents entitle the holder to a teaspoon, violatlve of that pro - vision of the pure food law providing that it shall be deemed mis - branding in case of food products if there be contained in the pack- Age any gifts, premiums or prizes? 2. Is a food package containing a library slip, which slip mar </seg>
            <seg id="p213">111 b6 used in payment of &amp; magazine, ft violation of the pure food law above mentioned? KIs a food package containing a coupon, forty-eight of which pons and eight two-cent stamps will entitle a party to an Indian , a violation of the pure food law? tMust salad dressing, which is a compound food, bear upon label a statement of the ingredients that compose the com - d? Answering the first three questions will my it is ray opinion that the spirit and intent of the act which de - clares that in case of food products if there be contained in any package any gifts, premiums or prizes it shall be deemed a misbrmndina;, is to require food products to be sold on their intrinsic merit and not by virtue of any prizes, slips or coupons which are the evidence of prizes or may be used to pay for articles in the nature of prizes in connection therewith. These coupons or dips art' cal - culated to furnish an inducement to purchase these food products independent of the intrinsic merit of the prod - ucts themselves, and the use of the same, either inside of the package or attached thereto, is a violation of the spirit of the law and the intent of the legislature clearly inferable from the language of the act. Your construc - tion holding that they are violations of the law, in my judgment, is sound and should be adhered to. t Answering your last question will say the statute ap - icable thereto provides as follows: Â§ 'Provided, that an article of food which does not contain any led poisonous cr deleterious ingredients shall not be deemed to adulterated or misbranded in the following cases: "First. In the case of mixture of compounds which may be Bow or from time to time hereafter, known as articles of food, under their own distinctive names, and not an imitation of, or offered for sale, under the distinctive names of another article, if the name be accompanied on the same label or brand with a state - ment of the place where said article has been manufactured or pro - duced, and the ingredients composing said food." (Compiled Stat - utes of 1907, ch. 33, sec. S.) Bit seems the objection raised against your construction the law is that it requires the disclosure of the formula </seg>
            <seg id="p214">112 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. used by the company who compounds the salad dressing for sale. There is nothing in the statute to indicate that it is necessary to disclose the formula. The statute re - quires that it shall state the ingredients composing said food. The statement of the ingredients composing the food entering into the compound is not necessarily a dis - closure of the formula, as it does not require the propor - tions to be stated. I am, therefore, of the opinion that your construction of the law that these compounds or mix - tures of food products should contain a label or brand with the statement of the ingredients composing said food, is correct and should be adhered to. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, May 19, 1909. Attorney General. Insane Asylums â€” Charitable Institutions. Insano hospitals and insane asylums are not "public charitable In - stitutions" within the meaning of section 10005, Cobbey's Anno - tated Statutes of 1907. Hence, the state is required to bear the â–  burden of paying the cost for board, care and treatment of all patients in the insane hospitals. t. M. W. Baxter, Superintendent of Nebraska State Hos - pital, lngleside, Neb. Dear Sir: I have your favor of May 19, in which you say: R'WIll you kindly give me your opinion of section 10005, Cobbey's )7 Statutes, the section in question bearing upon charitable instl - lons of the state? In my judgment, under that section, it has been customary for the superintendents of the Hastings asylum, and Is also with me, where we have inmates that are absolutely paupers, kcall upon the counties from which the inmates are received to ply them with the necessary clothing. During my charge of this itution it has only been questioned in one instance, and before lg any more along this line I would prefer that you give me your opinion in the matter." KTie section of the statute to which you refer reads as ows: </seg>
            <seg id="p215">113 'That whenever any person who may be an inmate of the Ne - braska state institute (or the deaf and dumb, or any other public charitable institution shall be unable to provide suitable clothing for himself or herself, and shall have no parent or legal guardian able and legally bound so to do, it shall be the duty of the county com - missioners of the county where such person last resided, before entering or applying for admission into such institution, to adjudge and declare such person a pauper, and thereupon the proper officers of such institution shall provide suitable clothing for such person, and tend the bill thereof to the aforesaid county commissioners, who shall forthwith audit and allow the same and cause a warrant there - for to be drawn upon the general fund of such county in favor of said officers of such institution." (Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of EChe question to be decided is, of course, whether or t insane asylums and insane hospitals are "public char - ble institutions" within the meaning of said statute. I have been unable to find any case in which this pre - cise question has been decided either by the courts of this state or of any other state. Hence, it is di&amp;cult to de - termine just how the courts will hold if the matter is ever submitted to them for decision. However, I doubt very much if insane hospitals and insane asylums are in - cluded within the term "public charitable institutions," as same occurs in said section 10005 herein quoted. I think it more probable that the term "public charitable institutions," as therein used, has reference only to insti - tutions where the attendance is voluntary and where the main object of their maintenance is to benefit the inmates thereof, such as asylums for the blind and for the deaf and dumb. In the case of insane hospitals the inmates are confined without their consent and against their will, and while one of the objects of such an institution is doubtless the welfare of the persons confined therein, yet another and perhaps the chief object and purpose of their maintenance is the protection of society. The supreme court of this state has said: "Chapter 67 of the Compiled Statutes, entitled paupers, and which provides that the persons named shall be supported by their rela- </seg>
            <seg id="p216">114 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. care of insane persons confined in the insane hospitals at public charge." ( County of Richardson v. Frederick, 24 Neb. 596.) Section 24, chapter 67, Compiled Statutes, entitled "Paupers," is identical with section 10005, Cobbey's An - notated Statutes, and reads as follows: "That whenever any person who may be an inmate of the Ne - braska state institute for the deaf and dumb or any other public charitable institution shall be unable to provide suitable clothing for himself or herself, and shall have no parent or legal guardian able and legally bound so to do, it shall be the duty of the county commissioners of the county where such person last resided, be - fore entering or applying for admission into such institution, to adjudge and declare such person a pauper, and thereupon the proper officers of such institution shall provide suitable clothing for such person, and send the bill thereof to the aforesaid county commis - sioners, who shall forthwith audit and allow the same and cause a warrant therefor to be drawn upon the general fund of such county In favor of said officers of such institution." From the reading of this section of the statute I infer that the "public charitable institutions," for whose pauper inmates the respective counties are required to provide clothing, are those public institutions where the parents or legal guardians, if able, are legally liable to furnish clothing for the inmates. The insane hospitals are not such institutions, the court having held in the said case above cited, County of Richardson v. Frederick, 24 Neb. 596, that the provisions of statute requiring "every poor person who shall be unable to earn a livelihood in consequence of any bodily infirmity, idiocy, lunacy, or other unavoidable cause" to be supported by his father and other enumerated relatives, had no reference to the support and care of insane persons confined in the public hospital without charge. At one time it was held, by a divided court, Judge Maxwell dissenting, that each of the counties was liable for the board, care and attendance furnished to patients from that county in the insane asy - lum. (State v. Douglas County, 18 Neb. 601.) . This de - cision was based upon an express statutory provision re-i quiring each county to pay the expense of the support </seg>
            <seg id="p217">115 and maintenance in the insane hospital of insane per - sons having a legal settlement in that county. After - wards, in 1891, the statute was amended so as to cast upon the state the burden of paying the cost for board, care and treatment for all the patients in the insane hos- Ehe records of the auditor's office, I am informed, do show any certified amounts due the hospital for the ne from the several counties since July 1891. I do not know that any attempt has heretofore been made during the thirty-four years that said section 10005 has been on the statute books to have the respective counties pay for the clothing of the paupers in the insane asylum, from which I infer that the several departments have heretofore always construed said phrase '"public charitable institutions," as it occurs in said section 10005, not to include insane hospitals.

If an adjourned session of one of the regular terms of the dis- trict court intervenes between preliminary and jury term, and If preliminary examination of the accused has been held since the commencement of the regular term of which the equity session forms a part, then the information need not be filed until the next regular term of the court. Where an information has been filÂ«d, accused has given bund, and before trial a grand jury is called, an indictment need not be re- turned by a grand jury in order to try defendant. Frank A. Anderson, Esq., County Attorney of Phelps County, Holdrege, Neb. Dear Sir: I have your favor of the 26th instant, in which you submit the following questions and ask for the opinion of this department thereon: EL. Should information be filed during equity term, if one inter - s between preliminary and jury term, or will recognizance be ing until next jury term?" "2. If information be filed during equity term and defendant ap - pears at that time and gives bonds, but a grand jury be called for the next jury term, must an indictment be returned by that grand Jury In order to try defendant?" Section 302, Criminal Code, as amended, provides that when a recognizance of a defendant is taken it shall be conditioned that the accused appear forthwith before the district court, if then in session, and if not in session then on the first day of the next term thereof, and that he shall </seg>
            <seg id="p219">117 not depart tli6 court without leave. It the ccjuity term of which you speak is the next regular term of the court I think the information should be filed before the final ad - journment of that term. But, if it is merely an adjourned session of one of the regular terms of the court, and the preliminary examination of the accused has been held since the commencement of the regular term of which the equity session forms a part, then the information need not be filed until the next regular term of the court. Similarly, if the equity session comes at the beginning of the regular term, and there is an adjourned session later on for jury work, then the information need only be tiled at sometime during the term. "Where an information has been filed and the accused has given bond, and before trial a grand jury is called, I do not believe that an indictment need be returned by a grand jury in order to try defendant. So far as I can learn this qâ€” tic has never been passed upon by the su - preme court of this state, but in the state of Washington it was held as follows: "Bal. Code, sec. 6813, which provides that the grand jury ghall inquire into the cases of parties in custody or under bail, charged with commission of offenses against the laws of this state, and duly returned by a committing magistrate, or upon a complaint sworn to before an officer authorized to administer oaths and presented by the prosecuting attorney, or under the instructions of the court.' Is inapplicable in cases where one is in custody under an informa - tion filed by the prosecuting attorney." ( State &gt;â– . Cnniey, 31 Wash. Similarly it has been held in Wisconsin. I "Sec. 5, eh. 140. Laws of 1889 (amending sec. 2545, R. &amp; and ovirting for the summoning of grand jurors to attend each term the circuit court unless the judge shall make an order to thÂ« atrary), does not affect the provisions of law authorizing prose - tlons by information."

A county is not liable for necessaries furnished persons not paupert while quarantined in their residence for the time being. C. E. Sandall, Esq., County Attorney of York County, York, Neb. Dear Sir: I have yours of the 28th ultimo, in which you ask the question as to whether certain persons named constitute a de facto board of health, and, if they do, as to whether or not they have the power to bind the county for the payment of expenses incurred in quarantining per - sons to prevent the spread of small pox. I do not see the necessity of determining the question as to whether or not the persons designated by you prop - erly constitute a board of health. The vital question seems to be as to whether a properly constituted board of health has the power to incur expenses in quarantining persons afflicted with small pox and fumigating the homes of Â«uch persons, and to lawfully obligate the county for the payment of the same. I! am of the opinion that neither a properly constituted trd of health nor the county board, nor any member â€¢resenting either of such bodies, has power to incur ex - lses in quarantining persons in their homes or to obli - ;e the county for payment of such expenses, unless it it be shown that such persons are paupers.

He owns no real property in the state. His per - sonalty has been assessed for the present year but no levy has yet been made. Is there any method by which the payment of the taxes on such personalty when due can be secured? "I should like also your opinion on the following: A grocer of this county has within the last few days sold his stock to another resident of the county. The grocer now has no real or personal property, except money, which he expects to take with him out of the state. The grocer has been assessed as of April 1, at which time he owned the grocery stock, and it was assessed to him. The person purchasing the stock was also assessed as of April 1 as to the property he owned at that time. No levy of taxes has yet been made. Is there any way by whicn the payment of me taxes on said grocery stock can be obtained when due, and if so from whom?" In the first case mentioned by you I know of no way by ich the payment of the tax can be secured at this time, lile the property has been assessed the tax against same i not yet been levied, so it is as yet uncertain what the ount will be.

The purpose is to employ the owner of building to act as steward to take care of the liquors and serve i to the individuals. The owner is not to purchase or sell any </seg>

Your question is: "Is the owner of the building, being the one who acts as steward for the others, guilty of a violation of the liquor laws of this Btate?" The main question to be determined in inquiries of this kind is whether the parties interested are doing it for the purpose of evading the liquor law. In a previous opinion by this department it was said: "It is the settled policy of the law that any trick, subterfuge, device or pretense shall not be permitted to shield violations or evasions of the liquor law. (Penner v. Commonwealth, 111 Ky. 604; State v. Morton, 42 Mo. App. 64; Hartgraves v. State, (Tex.) 43 S. W. 331.)" Under section 11, chapter 50, liquor law, it is a mis - demeanor for any person to give away intoxicating liquors upon any pretext without having first procured a license therefor. Section 20, of said law, provides that the pos - session of intoxicating liquors under circumstances similar to those suggested by you shall be presumptive evidence of a violation of the law. Consequently, it would be a question for a jury to deter - mine, under all the circumstances surrounding the case, whether or not the law was being violated. If a building of this kind were searched and liquor found therein, it would be incumbent upon those having them in possession to show they were kept for a lawful and not for an un - lawful purpose. I think a public prosecutor is justified in instituting prosecutions in all cases where the conduct of those hav - ing liquors in their possession indicates that a device is being employed for the purpose of circumventing the law.

(Compiled Statutes of 1907, ch. 77, art. 1, sec. 109.) You will note that no definite date is fixed at which the improvements become assessable, and I can find no case where the question has been decided by our court. In the absence of any decision to the contrary I am inclined to the opinion that the assessment should be made with ref- Bnce to the value of such improvements on April 1 of year when the assessment is made. r'eisonal property is assessed with reference to its value that date and if the value of ]&gt;erinauent improvements another and subsequent date were to be taken it would result in many cases in a double assessment of the prop - erty of the person assessed. To illustrate, a man has on, April 1 $1,000 in money, which directly after April 1 he commences to disburse in placing improvements upon his real estate, and before the assessor calls upon him to as - sess him he has the $1,000 invested. It is apparent that if t improvements were to be assessed according to their ue at the time the assessor called upon the owner thereof, 1 the money was to be assessed as belonging to the owner on April 1, the owner would be virtually assessed twice on the same property or its equivalent. I am, therefore, of the opinion that where buildings or other improvements have been commenced prior to April 1 of any year, but said buildings or other improvements have not been completed by April 1, the value of said im - provements on April 1, if in excess of $100, should be assessed and that where the improvements are not com - menced until after April 1 they should not be assessed for that year. You will bear in mind, of course, that the value of the improvements is the additional sum it is believed Eland or lot on which such improvements have been le would sell for at private sale by reason of such im - vements. </seg>

            <seg id="p228">126 The view of the law herein expressed coincides with an opinion of this department heretofore rendered. (Report &amp; Opinions of Attorney General, 1907-1908, p. 78.) Prior to 1903 a different rule prevailed. (State ex rel. Lincoln Land Co. v. Edwards, 31 Neb. 369; Suydam v. Merrick County, 19 Neb 155.) But this was due to a statutory provision which forbade the county board of equalization to make any increase in the aggregate valuation of all the townships, precincts or districts, except in such an amount as might be actually necessary and incidental to a proper and just equalization. This limitation upon the power of the board of equalization to raise the aggregate assessed value of the county was not, either in form or substance, embodied in the revenue law passed in 1903, and there is now no statutory inhibition upon the power of the board of equalization to raise the aggregate assessed valuation Very respectfully, W.

It is desired now to vacate and re-establish that portion of the road within the corporate limits of R. Under whose Jurisdiction will it come, the county or the vil - lage board?" </seg>
            <seg id="p229">OPINIONS. 127 the county board has jurisdiction to act in this matter. It is true the statutory provisions regarding this &gt; '.in - ject seem somewhat conflicting. In 1871 a law was pi giving county boards power to vacate streets, alle\ - public grounds when petitioned to do so, and after notice of such proposed action had been duly given. (Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1907, sees. ."&gt;, 4. ."&gt;.) This law has never been expressly repealed, but in 1887 the legislature provided by statute, among other things, that each city and village might enact ordinances or by-laws. "To open, widen, or otherwise improve or vacate any street, avenue, alley, or lane within the limit of the city or village, also to create, open and improve any new street, avenue, alley, or lane; Provided that all damages sustained by the citizens of the city or village, or of the owners of the property therein, shall b&lt;Â» ascertained in such manner as shall be provided by ordinance; Provided further, that whenever any avenue, street, alley or Ian* shall be vacated, the same shall revert to the owners of the adjacent real estate, one-half on each side thereof." (Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1907, ch. 14, art. 1, sec. 69, subd. 27.) I think there can be no doubt but that this later provi - sion of the statute impliedly repealed the sections of the statute above cited, giving county boards authority to va - cate the streets and alleys of an incorporated village.

J do not think it was the intention of the legislature to undertake to make this legislation retroactive or that you would be required to investigate the origin of fires which occurred prior to the taking effect of said act. Nor do I think any one could demand, as a matter of right, that you investigate fires occurring prior thereto. I think a fair inference from an examination of this stat - ute is that your duties regarding investigation of fire3 would be confined to fires that occurred on or subsequent to July 2, 1909. If you could go back ten days prior to tho taking effect of the act and investigate tho origin of fires vou could likewise investigate fires that occurred five or ten years before.

            <seg id="p232">130 "In 1907 a high school levy was made for one pupil. The pupil did not attend high school, so the amount raised by the levy of 1907 is still in the county treasurer's hands to the credit of that high school district. This year, 1909, there is another applicant for free high school from the same district. Can the tuition be paid from the balance remaining in the fund for the 1907 levy, or v.ill It be necessary for the county treasurer to transfer this balance to the district school fund and have levy made this year for the pres - ent applicant for high school privileges?" I think the county treasurer would be justified in pay - ing out the levy referred to, which was made in the year 1907, upon an order signed by the director and counter - signed by the moderator of the district, drawn against the free high school fund. I do not see the necessity for the county treasurer to have the money raised by the levy of 1907 transferred to the general school fund of the district and a new levy made in 1909 for substantially the same pur - pose, although the latter course perhaps would comply more strictly with the letter of the law. tnasinucli as there is sufficient money in the free high ool fund to pay the tuition of the present applicant, I think it would be proper to use it for that purpose without going through the formality of making a transfer and a new levy.

State Board of Equalization and Assessment, Lincoln. Gentlemen : I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication of July 2-\, submitting the follow - ing propositions and requesting an opinion thereon. Your first proposition is as follows: Elas the state board, in equalizing values, the authority to ralsÂ« &gt;wer the valuation of real estate belonging to railroad companies, assessed under the terminal tax law, at any other time than that ided by law for the assessment and equalization of other real e?" My opinion is that it has. By the provisions of section 3, terminal tax law, the term "local property" includes all the tangible property of a railroad company in any cit\ 01' village, except rolling stock. By other provisions of said law the railroad companies are required to make and Hie an - nually with the assessor of each city and village in the state, a report of all land outside of the right of way and all the right of way within the corporate limits of each city and village, for taxation. By the terms of section 9 it is made the dutv of the assessor, between the first day of March and the first day of May of each year, to value and assess all of the local property of each company in the city and village in his jurisdiction, as of the first day of March of the current year. By section 10 it is made the duty of the BMT to enter on the assessment roll prepared for that purpose an itemized assessment of each of the companies to be assessed, showing the value separately of (1) the land constituting the right of way of each railroad compain . the improvements thereon, exclusive of fuel and water sta - tion, buildings and bridges, (3) the land outside the right of way, (4) improvements thereon, other than fuel and water stations and buildings, (5) each building with its appurtenances, including platforms, (6) each bridge, telegraph and telephone instruments, together with all the </seg>
            <seg id="p234">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 132 wires and poles connected therewith, (8) fuel and water stations, together with their appurtenances, and (9) all other tangible property, except rolling stock. It will thus be seen that these assessments are to be made by the local assessors annually and reported to your board. Section 11, among other things, provides as follows: "It shall be the duty of the board at its annual session as a board of equalization, which shall convene at the state capitoi at Lincoln on the third Monday of July each year to review and equalize or change, as hereinafter provided, the several assessments made by the various assessors under the provisions of this act. The board â– hall be in session at least five days and may adjourn from day to day until its work is completed, provided, its findings and re - turns shall be made not later than its returns on the annual state and county assessments under the provisions of the general revenue law. Any company shall Ijave the right to appear and oe heard In relation to the raising or lowering of the assessments made on be - half of such city or village. The attorney general shall attend at such hearings and represent the board. The board shall have power. In reviewing the assessments made by the local assessors, to raise or lower any assessment in any city or village for the purpose of giving the property of each company a full and fair valuation in the sev - eral cities and villages. To the final assessment of the local property of each company shall be added the board's assessment of all other property in each city and village, and the resulting amount shall â– tand as the final assessment of the property of such company taxable under the provisions of this act." (Compiled Statutes of 1909. ch. 77, art. 10, sec. 11.) From the foregoing I am led to the conclusion that the state board of equalization and assessment, while in session as a board of equalization, has the authority to annually raise or lower the valuation of real estate belonging to the railroad companies and assessed annually under the ter - minal tax law, in order that the assessment may be equal and just. Your second question is as follows: "At what time can the state board of equalization equalize real estato values?" My judgment and opinion is that the state board of equalization is not authorized to disturb or equalize -the </seg>
            <seg id="p235">133 values ot real estate assessed under the general revenue law in any year other than the year in which real estate is valued and assessed under said law. The third question you submit is: "Has the state board the authority in a case of evident error of assess - ment or apparent gross injustice in over-valuation or under-valuation of real property to correct the same by raising or lowering the value thereof, the same as county boards may do, in years other than those in which the assessment of real c-3tate is made?" I The authority given a county board of equalization to ;r or change the assessed value of real estate in any er year than the year in which assessment was made, 3 conferred by an amendment to the revenue act of 13, which constituted an enlargement ot the powers ich the county board of equalization previously had, 1 which authorized such board to correct the same "in es of evident error of assessment 01: apparent gross nstice in overvaluation or undervaluation of real prop - y." The statute denning the power of the state board equalization contains no such provision and confers no Therefore, I am disposed to hold that, as touching the assessment of real property under the general revenue law, the state board of equalisation and assessment has not the same authority as a county board of equalization and may not, in a case of evident error of assessment or apparent gross injustice in over-valuation or undervalu - ation of real property, at any of its annual meetings, cor - rect the same by raising or lowering the I 1 valua - tion of individual tracts or parcels of land. In the ab - sence of specific authority, the right to raise or lower the assessed valuation of particular tracts of land assessed does not exist in the state board of equalization, but, under our statute, it is my opinion that the county boards of equalization have the exclusive jurisdiction of that mat- Very respectfully, W.

In commenting on the provisions of this section of tho code, Judge Reese says; "By this it would seem that it is the province of the district court to examine and allow the account or bill for such services, but the same shall be audited by the county board."

Said license shall state that such company has complied with all the requirements of the statutes of this state and is duly authorized to do business therein; that the person therein named is authorized to act as agent or solicitor of â– aid insurance company for the period therein mentioned. The auditor may, for good and sufficient cause, refuse to issue such license to any person or revoke the same after being issued for such cause " This section merely provides that it shall not be law - ful for persons, other than agents licensed by the auditor to act for such company, to act for any company or com - panies transacting the business of insurance in this state.

The particular matter treated of in this section of the statute is "a mail or express train carrying passengers, whose regular equipment consists of more than five cars."

Section 4 of said act provides as follows: I That the officers or agents of any railroad company doing busi - i in the state of Nebraska who shall Bend out on its road, or Be or suffer or permit to be sent out on its road or any part â– eof, outside of the yard limits, any passenger or freight train ch is not manned in accordance with the provisions of sections one, and throe of this ac-t shall bo euiltv of a misJomeanor and upon viction thereof shall be fined not less than one hundred dollar* 00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each Ot - se and shall stand committed until such fine and costs are paid, any railroad company in the state of Nebraska whose officer or ers, agent or agents or any servant or servants, shall be found ty of such misdemeanor, shall be liable for any damages caused the violation of the provisions of this act."

The auditor of public accounts is justified in issuing warrants for such claims as may be presented by old soldiers who can show the actual amount deducted from their pensions, as disclosed by the books of the institutions or approved by the commandants of said institutions, under any and all rules or orders whether of the board of public lands and buildings or of the commandants of the homes. Hon. Silas R. Barton, Auditor of Public Accounts, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir: I have your communication of recent date, in which you submit the following: "I hand you herewith voucher for William T. Triloff, relative to refunding the money that was taken from the oid soldiers by the state board. You are quite conversant with the facts and I would kindly ask you for directions as to the proper procedure to disburse this money to the old soldiers, as per the bill passed by the last legislature." The last legislature passed an act, which, so far as is material, is as follows: "That there be appropriated out pf the general fund of the state of Nebraska, the sum of three thousand dollars or so much thereof as may be necessary to fully reimburse all old soldiers, who nave been admitted to the Soldiers' Home, for all pension money, which has been retained from their pensions by the state board of public lands and buildings, under what is known as rule 17 of said board." (Session Laws of 1909, ch. 189, sec. 1.) ]t is difficult to determine .}ust wiiat rule is referred to in this act as rule 17 of the published rules and regula - tions of the Nebraska Soldiers' &amp; Sailors' Home is as fol- </seg>

It is quite clear that rule 17, as published and quoted above, is not the one referred to in the act of the legisla - ture. In the case of Houell r. Sheldon, 117 X. W. 109, which was an appeal from an action commenced in the dis - trict court of Hall county, reference is made to a rule des - ignated as rule 17, which is as follows: "All who arc members of the home at the time of adoption of these rules or who may hereafter become such, who are receiving or who may hereafter receive a pension in excess of $12 per month and not more than $19 a month, shall pay into the cash fund of the home 10 per cent of the amount. Those receiving or who may here - after receive $20 and not more than $23 shall pay into the cash fund of the home 20 per cent. Those who are receiving or who may here - after received $24 and not morÂ» tiun ?29 pÂ«r nionth, 30 per cent. In case where any member is receiving $30 or more he shall pay such amount as the commandant and the board may deem just. Provided, further that where a man on application is helpless cr afterwards be - comes helpless so that he requires consideration and special atten - tion, he shall be required to pay any portion that the commandant and the board may deem equitable, except in case of dependent wife and children." I am unable to find this rule anywhere in the records or &gt;ceedings of the board of public lands and buildings, but is quite clear from the discussion in the opinion iu â– icell v.

I county treasurer has authority to issue a distress warrant for taxes levied prior to the revenue act of 1903 and forward same to the county treasurer of a sister county, whose duty it is to serve said distress warrant and collect the taxes thereunder. M. D. King, Esq., County Attorney of Kearney County, M'indcn, Neb. I Dear Sir : I have yours of the 7th instant, in which you ite that a firm of Douglas county is indebted to Kearney unty for delinquent taxes for the year 1892, that your county treasurer lias issued distress warrant, that lie mi tme to the treasurer of Douglas county for service, and at the treasurer of Douglas county returned said war - rant unserved, claiming it was illegally issued and that there is no authority in law for him to serve it. Your ques - tion, in substance, is as follows: Had the treasurer of Kearney county the authority to issue a distress warrant for taxes levied prior to the revenue act of 1903, and should the treasurer of Douglas county have served it? You refer to an opinion rendered by this department, re- Taxation â€” Distress Warrant. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">OPINIONS. 143 ported in Report &lt;Sc ( )piuions of Attorney General 1903- "The statutory provision applicable is as follows: " 'Distress warrants shall be issued against all persons having de - linquent personal tax for the year 1903 and for each year thereafter, and each such warrant shall include all delinquent personal taxes of the persons against whom issued, unless such person shall, on or before February 1, file with the treasurer an affidavit that he is unable, by reason of poverty, lo pÂ«y any such tax, in which case distress war - rants shall not issue until ordered by the county board.' (Compiled Statutes, art. 1. sec. 154.) E'his statute distinctly says that 'each such warrant shall include all qutnt personal taxes of the person against whom issued.' a.i&lt;i â– fore the warrant must include all delinquent personal taxes, re - less of the year during which they were levied." I am satisfied with the conclusion reached in the forego - ing opinion and can see no reason for refusing to adhere to the same. The law as it existed prior to the act of 10&lt;t.!, and as it existed at the time the taxes in question were levied, is as follows: [In case any person owing taxes remove, the treasurer shall among er steps to collect such tax, forward when necessary such tax m to the treasurer at the adopted residence or place of abode such tax debtor, and such taxes shall be collected at the latter ce, as other personal taxes by distress or civil action, as the casÂ« y require, and return to the proper county, less such charges for lection, as are hereinbefore provided. And such treasurer, to whom h tax claim shall be so forwarded, is hereby authorized to com - nee and prosecute to judgment such civil action as may be neces - y in the district court of such county, in the name of the board county commissioners or the board of county supervisors of the nty from which such tax claims shall be forwarded." (Compiled tutes of 1901, ch. 77, art. 1, sec. 89.) Hence, it will be seen that there was full authority for the forwarding of tax claims against tax debtors who had removed from one county to another. The above would be authority for the course pursued by your county treasurer in the case stated by you, for the reason that in the revenue act passed in the year 1903 there was a saving clause, which is as follows: E 'Nothing in this act shall be construed to release, discharge, or in ' manner affect the validity or trtaÂ© collection of any tax hcretoforÂ© </seg>

(Compiled Statutes of 1903, ch. 77, art. 1, sec. 242.) I, therefore, conclude that you were right in the advice given to the county treasurer of your county, that he had authority to issue a distress warrant for the taxes in ques - tion, and that it is the duty of the treasurer of Douglas county to serve said distress warrant and collect the taxes thereunder.

State Railway Commission â€” Jurisdiction â€” Injuries From The state railway commission has no authority to entertain juris- diction over complaints to the effect that railroads running through, private lands have been so constructed as to prevent the free and natural flow of flood waters, causing them to back flow and result- ing in injury to the premises of certain individuals. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Gentlemen : I am in receipt of your communication of August 18, stating that there have been filed in your de - partment numerous complaints to the effect that railroads running through private lands have been so constructed as to prevent the free and natural flow of flood waters, causing them to back flow and resulting in injury to the premise^ of certain individuals. You request my advice as to whether or not the commission should assume juris* diction in cases of this character. Flood AVaters. </seg>
            <seg id="p247">145 injury to another, is an actionable cause for which indem - nity may be recovered. It has been declared by this court that the rule of common law that surface water is a com - mon enemy and that the owner may defend his premises against it is the law of this state, and if damages result to adjoining proprietors by reason thereof he is not liable therefor. This rule, however, is a general one and is sub - ject to another common law rule that a proprietor must use his own property as not to unnecessarily and negli - gently injure his neighbor, and if, in the execution of an enterprise affecting surface or flood waters, he is guilty of negligence, which is the natural and proximate cause of in - jury to his neighbors, he is accountable therefor. (Lincoln &amp; B. H. R. Co. v. Sutherland, 44 Neb. 526.) The right of action for such injuries is a private right. Adequate damages may be recovered in such cases in the courts of law. If the damages resulting from the negli - gent construction of an embankment, which causes the surface or flood waters of a stream or natural outlet for surface waters to back up and flood the premises of an owner of real estate, are oft-recurring such negligent con - struction might constitute a private nuisance, which could be abated by injunction in a court of equity on private suit of the injured person. There are two classes of nuisances â€” private and public. A private nuisance is one that af - ftcts a single individual or a determinate number of per - sons in the enjoyment of some private right not common to the public; a public nuisance is one that affects the peo - ple at large, and is a violation of a public right, either by a direct encroachment upon public property or by doing some act which tends to the common injury or by omitting to do, in the discharge of a legal duty, that which the com - mon good requires. Over the latter, which may be occa - sioned by the negligence of railroad companies, I am in - clined to think the railway commission has jurisdiction and may properly make orders that have for their object the </seg>
            <seg id="p248">146 removal of the causes which produce the nuisance; but, over nuisances that are only private in character I have serious doubts of the authority of the commission. The complaints that you mention in your letter do not, in any event, involve more than private nuisances. There is no express authority to be found, either in the constitutional amendment creating the state railway com - mission or in the statute passed by the legislature defining its powers and duties, giving the commission authority over cims of this kind. When orders are made by your commission it is incumbent upon you, and the legal depart - ment, to defend and enforce the same. This has to be done at the cost and expense of the state. Therefore, before any matter is taken jurisdiction of by your commission, in which orders are to be made, the authority of the com - mission to act should be clear and orders should be made for the most part only in cases affecting the public, an distinguished from those affecting private, rights. From all orders made by the commission against railroad com - panies an appeal may be taken by the companies to the district court. Experience has taught us that such an appeal is almost universally taken. The taking of such appeal, except from orders fixing rates, has the effect of suspending the order until the appeal is determined by the court. To me it seems unfair that the public should be compelled to pay the costs and expense of litigation incident to the orders made by the commission, where the rights sought to be established thereby are private rights and affect private interests as distinguished from public rights or rights which affect a considerable por tion of the public. Viewing the matter from the standpoint of expediency or ability, I may add that no sufficient appropriation has been made either to your department or the legal depart - ment to take care of litigation that would naturally arise from the procedure incident to such cases as you men vIUIm </seg>

Steuteville filed as a candidate for the dem - atic nomination for county judge. No one filed for the ublican nomination for that office, and, consequently, one had his name printed on the republican ballot far t office. No one ran against the democratic candidate county judge at the primary, and he received a large jority of the votes of the democrats, there being only a â–  scattering votes for others. About fifteen or twenty ublicans wrote in the name of Mr. Steuteville in their </seg>

If it were not for the very positive and unambiguous guage of the statute on this subject I would be inclined give the statute a liberal construction and say that Mr. suteville was the person nominated by the republican rty at the primary election, he having received a plural - over any other person voted for in the republican col - n.

This provision of the law excludes the possibility of Mr. Steuteville being the nominee for county judge of the re - publican party. Any votes cast for him would be, under this provision of the law, illegal and should not be counted. Therefore, it seems clear to me that if the other person whose name had been written in by the electors did not appear as a candidate in any of the other party columns on such ballot, and if these five votes thus written in gave him a plurality over any other person whose name had been written in as the candidate for county judge, he would be the regular and legal nominee of the republican party for that office, and his name, instead of Mr. Steute - ville, should be placed upon the ballot at the general elec- </seg>

James A. Clark, Esq., County Attorney of Burt County, Dear Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication of August 25, requesting my opinion on certain propositions. You say that Burt county is not under township organization, that it has no cities of more than 4,000 population, that it has about fifteen assessment districts with the same number of MMsaon, and that it has only seven precincts. You submit the following ques- E Should there be only seven assessors elected, or can the law be strued to mean an assessor for each assessment district as deter - ed by the county board?" 1 House Roll 215, which amends section 20, article 1, chup - r 77, Compiled Statutes, commonly known as the revenue w, contains the following definitions: "The words 'township' and 'precinct' shall each include the other and shall also include 'towns' in counties under township organiza - tion. The phrase 'precinct assessor' shall include also 'city assessor,' 'district assessor' and 'township assessor." " I The amended section 20, above referred to, contains the llowing provisions: Tekamuh, Neb. </seg>
            <seg id="p252">150 "At the general election in 1909 and every two years thereafter, there shall be elected in each precinct, ward or township one precinct assessor whose term of office shall be for two years, and who shall not be eligible to hold two terms in succession. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ "At the first meeting of the county board after this act takes effect said county board shall divide all cities having a population of more than 4,000 into suitable assessment districts, apportioning as nearly aa possible by voting wards or precincts 4,000 inhabitants to each as - sessor." These provisions of the statute would seem to make it certain that a precinct &lt;&gt;r was to be elected for each ward in every city having not more than 4,000 inhabitants, and one for each township in counties under township or - ganization. But the same session of the legislature that made this amendment to the revenue law enacted another bill amending the election law, being House Roll 214, wherein it is provided as follows: "In the year 1909 and every two years thereafter shall be elected In each city and each village having 1,000 inhabitants or over, one k assessor, and in cities having a population above 4,000 one addl - al district assessor for each 4,000 inhabitants or major fraction thereof." There is thus produced a conflict between the amenda - tory provisions of the revenue law and the amendment to the election law above quoted passed by the same legisla - ture, each act having apparently the same author. The language of amended section 120 of the revenue law plainly (â– ays that an assessor shall be elected in each ward. I would be compelled to hold that in cities having from 1,000 to 4,000 inhabitants an assessor should be elected for each ward therein, but for the fact that the same legisla - ture in the amendment to the election law provides for but one assessor in cities of that size. I can hardly conceive it to have been the intention of the legislature to provide for an assessor for each ward in cities from 1,000 to 4,000 inhabitants. The statute governing cities of the second class, to which such cities above mentioned belong, requires that cities be divided into not less than four nor more than six wards. To say the legislature intended that a city of </seg>

F disposed to tile belief that the legislature intended that every rural voting precinct an assessor should be elected, 1 I would so recommend. If this method, under existing iditions, does not gWe your county a sufficient nun assessors to do the work, I would recommend that your mty board increase the number of precincts as it has the lit and authority to do. Your second question is as follows "At the primary election one of the candidates for sheriff, whose name was printed in the republican column, did not receive enough votes to nominate him for sheriff, but his name was written in the republican column and marked a sufficient number of times, as pre - cinct assessor, to nominate him as precinct assessor. Is he entitled to the nomination as precinct assessor?" Since the new primary law requires blank spaces to be left in which the elector may write in the name of a candi - date whose name is not printed on the ballot for that office, I think it is clear that the voter has the right, under this new law, to write in the name of some other person whose name does not appear upon the printed ballot for </seg>

Hon. Silas It. Button, Auditor of Public Accounts, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir: I have yours of the 31st ultimo, in which you ask further information regarding your duties Bfl to the payment of claims filed by old soldiers against the appio - priation made by the last legislature for reimbursing them for all pension moneys which have been retained from their pensions by the state board of public lands and buildings, under what is known as rule 17. </seg>
            <seg id="p256">154 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. You have furnished me with a report of an investiga - tion, made by your examiner, of the books of the Soldiers' &lt;Jc Sailors' Homes at Grand Island and Milford. From this report I observe that some of the old soldiers parted with a portion of their pensions under an agreement, that some of their pension! were taken under what is indicated OH the hooks as rule 17, and that a large portion thereof, as shown by the report, has been refunded. The report also shows that others paid into the institution various SUBaa from their pensions without any designation as to whether it was done by agreement or under rule 17 so - called. The question which you submit is, in substance, as fol - lows: How shall it be determined what claims are properly payable out of the appropriation made by the legislature? I stated in an opinion rendered to you on August 17 that rule 17 referred to in the case of Howcll r. Sheldon, 117 X. W. 10!), cannot be found in any of the records of these institutions or in the printed rules and regulations thereof; that rule 17 of the printed rules and regulations of 1907 refers to an altogether different subject; that rule 17 as published in 1903 is not the one referred to in the act of the legislature; and that it is quite clear, from the discussion in the opinion in Hoirell r. Sheldon, that at sometime in the past a portion of the pensions of the old soldiers was taken and appropriated toward the mainte - nance of the institutions. The law in relation to the government of these homes provides that old soldiers shall have the privilege of pay - ing their own board, or any part thereof, if they so de - sire. It is quite probable that some of them voluntarily consented to the payment of a portion of their pensions for the maintenance of the homes. If they did so, it is not likely they will now ask to be reimbursed for the same. However, I am inclined to think that those cases in which it is said an agreement was made on the part of </seg>
            <seg id="p257">155 the old soldiers to pay a portion of their j&gt;ensions to the maintenance of the homes had its origin in rule IS of the printed rules and regulations of 190.!, which is as fol- "No applicant shall bo admitted to the home who is drawing a pension of more than $12 per month, unless in extreme cases of help - lessness where either a husband or wife are totally dependeir when in the judgment of the commandant and visiting and examining board the circumstances call for a more liberal application of the rule in the interest of justice and mercy." If I Jim right in the above, the agreement referred to - would be more or less compulsory on the part of old soldiers, and would, in the true sense, be involuntary on their part In any event, I am inclined to think that what is known as rule 17 grew out of rule 18, and for some rea - son there lias been more or less confusion with reference to the actual rule under which these pensions were ob - tained. The act of the legislature is broad and provides for re - funding all moneys taken "under what is known as rule 17 of said board." If this act be given a technical &gt; â– â€¢in - struction no claims can be filed which would be valid as agninst the appropriation. I think it should have ;. lib - eral construction for the reason that the legislature ivi - dently intended to reimburse the old soldiers for all moneys which they paid under color of any rule, order or regula tion whatsoever. My view in this respect is fortified by the further fact that the same session of the legislature provided that neither the board of control of these homes. nor any one having charge or the management thereof, should adopt or enforce any rule or regulation which should deprive the members of the homes of any part of their pensions received from the government of the United States. For these reasons all old soldiers, in either of these homes, or their legal heirs, are entitled to file claims against this appropriation for such sums as they paid for the maintenance of the homes under any rule or regula - tion which was made a condition of their reception into- </seg>
            <seg id="p258">156 the homes. If they were induced to sign an agreement as a condition of being received into the homes this would be a contract of doubtful legality, one in the nature of a compulsory regulation or requirement and not, in the true sense, a voluntary surrender of their money. I am in - clined to think that the practice of requiring them to agree to contribute to the maintenance of the homes grew into what was finally designated, and commonly known, Permit me to suggest, however, that each old soldier, or his legal heirs, ought to personally file a claim under this appropriation. In other words, I do not think that the law contemplates that the auditor or commandant of the homes distribute the same. I suggest this for the reason that if any of the old soldiers have voluntarily contributed to their own board or maintenance, no doubt, they would not be inclined to ask for reimbursement therefor. Hence, I conclude that it is your duty to issue warrants for such claims as may be presented by old soldiers who can show the amount actually deducted from their pensions by rea - son of the practice of requiring it as a condition of their reception into the homes, whether it be under a pretended agreement, or rules or regulations, of the management. In other words, I take it that any old soldier who freely and voluntarily paid in his money without any compulsion whatever will not, at this late day, make oath that it was taken under coercion.

Harper, Esq., County Attorney of Fttmas County, rEAB Sir : I have your favor of the 30th ultimo, in which say: "I desire to ask your opinion on the following subject: Where Iienalty for violating a law, such as unlawful taking of fish from public waters of the state, may consist in a fine or imprison - at, or both, which penalty under authority of State v. Yates, 3* &gt;. 287, and Keeshan v. State, 46 Neb. 155, puts the case beyond criminal jurisdiction of a justice of peace or county court, so far trying and sentencing on conviction, yet. if defendant plead* lty to such an alleged violation, has the justice or county judge rer to fine defendant or imprison, provided he does not exceed own statutory or constitutional jurisdiction in the amount of â€¢ or time of imprisonment, or in such case is it the duty of the tice to bind defendant to district court on such plea of guilty, he would be required to do on taking a plea of guilty to a charge felony?" I am of the opinion that a justice of the peace has no jurisdiction to sentence a defendant who pleads guilty to a criminal charge, where the punishment may be by both fine and imprisonment. But the limit of the power of a county court in such a case is not quite so clear. Sec - tion 313, Criminal Code, reads as follows: "When the complaint is for a misdemeanor only, of any grade of punishment whatever, if the cause is pending before the probate judge of the county, before whom the defendant enters a plea of guilty to the complaint, it shall be lawful for such judge, in his discretion, to render judgment of fine or imprisonment, or both, according to the law of the case, and pass sentence accordingly, and enforce the same according to law." It will thus be seen that the legislature undoubtedly at - tempted to clothe the county court with jurisdiction to sentence in every case of misdemeanor where the defend - ant pleads guilty. Construing this section of the Code, In re Maule, 19 Neb. 273, the court said : tl'hen a defendant is arrested upon a complaint filed with the ty judge charging a misdemeanor, and such defendant upon Bearer City, Xeb. </seg>
            <seg id="p260">158 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Arraignment before such judge pleads guilty to the charge preferred, the county judge has authority, under section 313 of the criminal code, to render judgment of a conviction, within his jurisdiction, And enforce the same by imprisonment, as in other cases of a con - viction of misdemeanor." At first glance this would seem to be decisive of the question. But an inspection of the ease above cited shows that the question there involved was the power of the â€¢aunty court to impose sentence on a defendant who had pleaded guilty to the charge of unlawfully selling intox - icating liquor without a license. I In that class of cases there is no provision of statute for nishing by both fine and imprisonment, and while the ixinnun fine permitted is so large as to bar a county dge from trying such cases, as the law now stands, there no constitutional inhibition upon his power to try such ses. In other words, the want of jurisdiction of the unty court to try such cases arises because the legisla - te has not conferred jurisdiction and not because juris - â€¢tion is barred by the fundamental law of the land. I -Jut, the supreme court of this state has repeatedly held it county courts have no jurisdiction to try criminal les, where the punishment may consist of both fine and prisonment, because of the constitutional limitation upon â– ir power. While the question may be regarded as still open one in this state, I am of the opinion that the safe e to follow is to have the county judge act only as an imining magistrate in all cases where the punishment y be both fine and imprisonment and leave the matter imposing sentence to the district court.

Hon. Silas R.

Eou submit a policy of insurance issued by the (Jerman - erican Life Insurance Company, containing a clause cli reads as follows: "On the first anniversary of this policy, and annually thereafter, for nineteen years, the insured shall be accredited with a dividend from the company's Agency Renewal Commission Expense Fund, upon the following basis: (provided this policy is then in force aa determined by its provisions.) An Agency Renewal Commission Ex - pense Fund shall be created annually for twenty years, ncpilfaH January 1, 1907, and shall be computed at the rate of 3evea per cent of all renewal insurance premiums annually collectei on all insurance issued during said period and in force at that timi aa shown by the company's books and records. The amount of such di\idcnd shall be the insured's pro rata share of said fund, in the came proportion that the amount of this policy or bond bean to the total amount of profit sharing plan, limited payment life add bond policies then in force, on which such dividends have matured."

            <seg id="p262">160 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Young, for the company, and N. Z. Snell, contra, I havo come to the conclusion that this provision of the policy may, or may not, be contrary to your ruling, depending largely upon the facts in the case. If the brief of Mr. W. W. Young, attorney for the Ger - man-American Life Insurance Company, correctly sets forth the conditions under which the German- American Life Insurance Company has been, and is now, conducting its business, and if, as claimed, all the policies issued by the company contained section 14 in full, as hereinbefore" quoted, then the company is well within your ruling and the law, and such clause constitutes no special contract which could be interpreted as discriminatory or as being a special contract entered into with certain of its policy - holders to the exclusion of others. So long as the policies issued by it shall contain section 14 in full, as hereinbefore quoted, so that the division of the company's agency renewal commission expense fund shall be equitably and proportion - ately divided between all its policy-holders, the retaining of said clause in the policies cannot be construed as being tipecial contract to the advantage of one policy-holder one class of policy-holders as against others. It is not set out that any other than profit-sharing plan, limited payment life and bond policies are now issued or in force, and Mr. Young contends that this is the only class of policies that has been or is being issued. If other policies than profit-sharing plan policies were being issued then section 14 might be susceptible of other interpreta - tion; that is to say, it would then appear that the agency renewal commission expense fund would be a levy of seven per cent on all renewal premiums collected on whatever class of policies that might be issued, but that the distri - bution of these funds would be only among profit-sharing plan, limited payment life and bond policies at the time in force and for the twenty years succeeding January 1, 1907. If that were the case, then it would be a discrimination subject to regulation under the law, because a certain class </seg>
            <seg id="p263">161 oi policy-holders would, in thai case, l&gt;e '*harijed with seven per cent of their premiums tor the benefit of t favored policy-holders who held the profit-sharing plan policies. But, notwithstanding this possible chance for discrimination, if it shall appear that no other policies are outstanding or issued, or to be issued, then no harm can come to any of the policy-holders, nor can there be any advantage to one class .or disadvantage to another i The conditions stated make it impossible to have more than one class of policy-holders. i' it develop that, us Mr. Bneli claims, other policies e been issued that do not contain section 14, as above out, or that contain this section in different verbiaire lifted, as claimed, so that certain of the policy-holders er the contract, in the sample policy submitted, shall iive a pro rata of seven per cent of all renewal premi- I and other policy-holders sJiall receive a pro rtita of per thousand on all insurance then in force for the nty years succeeding January 1, li)07, then unless the $2 thousand of all insurance in force is equal to seven per t of the renewal premiums there would be a discriminn - i as contended. It is claimed by Mr. Snell that companies of the class erred to have no right to provide for extended paid - insurance or loan and cash surrender values, because s class of companies is not required to maintain re - ves. We find no actual prohibition in the statute against s class of business, and it would appear the companies y carry on their business, if they elect, on the same plan companies working under the reserve provisions ; so, companies of the class referred to charac rates "com - ted on the basis of the terms of the policy and the nerican table of mortality, and four and one-half pÂ«r cent erest," which contemplate the carrying of reserves ereby a company is enabled to make promises and cal - ate with reasonable certainty in advance cash surren - â€¢ values, loan values, extended and paid-up insurance </seg>
            <seg id="p264">162 values, and if such companies referred to did provide and keep up the reserve thereby contemplated, then, in my opin - ion, there is no valid reason why they should be prohibited from making the promises referred to. This same reasoning generally applies to the dividend coupons complained of. There can be little question ol' the accuracy of the claim that the dividend coupon, which is an unqualified promise to pay a certain and definite divi dend, is, as claimed by Mr. Snell, nothing more than a fUlir antee that the premium charged is too high and that a part will be returned each year, and that it is deceptive as well as not expressly authorized by statute. But, this same argument would apply to not only this but all classes of life insurance companies, and if the premium is enough higher than is necessary to carry the insurance to justify the dividend promised, it would seem as reasonable for one class of companies to make the promise as for another. While, as stated, there is no express authority in the stat - ute, there seems on the other hand to be no prohibition against this condition. I cannot see where any special harm is done to the policy - holders of the company in the verbal promises or induce - ments that may be held out to them that this particular policy was only to be issued for a while and that others, not so favorable to the insured, would be thereafter substi - tuted for future policy-holders, so long as this is not actu - ally done and so long as the privileges given in these policies are held out equally to all persons solicited for insurance. The matter of interpreting this as a special contract could, in any event, not be taken up or considered until after it was definitely learned that the company was actually issu - ing other and less favorable contracts of insurance and assessing or taxing one class of policy-holders for the bene - fit of another class. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, September 7, 1909. Attorney General. </seg>

Needkam, Esq., County Attorney of Boone County, Albion, Neb. I Dear Sir : I have your letter of the 3rd instant, in which ii. say: I Will you please advise me whether section 199, chapter 19, Crim- I Code of Compiled Statutes of 1907, was repealed in implication section 14, chapter 50, of the same statutes and year? This ques - i is a serious one with me just now for the reason that the last slature repealed section 14, chapter 50, but failed to include a ing clause in the repealing enactment, same being Senate File , chapter 82, Session Laws of 1909, and I have several criminal â€¢s pending on charges for violation of the law forbidding sales or 8 of liquor on election days, the act having been committed last tion. It is therefore apparent to me that these violations must prosecuted, if at all, under section 199, chapter 19, above re - â– ed to. Kindly advise me as soon as convenient." IPhe question which you ask is not altogether free from ibt. Section 199, Criminal Code, is a part of the original imittal Code adopted in 1873. In 1881 the original n 14, chapter 50, was passed as a part of an act entitleu, in act to regulate the license and sale of malt, spirituous 3 vinous liquors and to repeal chapter LIII of the Code Criminal Procedure of the general statutes of 1873, en - ied 'License and sale of liquors,' and to repeal an act on led, 'An act to regulate the issuance of licenses for the e of malt, vinous and spirituous liquors in the state of braska, approved February 25, 1875.' " Election 199, Criminal Code, and the original section 1 4, pter 50, each provide a penalty for the sale of intoxieat liquor on election days, but the latter act does not ox - ssly repeal said section 199, Criminal Code, and it is a 1 recognized rule that "repeals by implication are not ored.

(De France v. Harmer, 66 Neb. 14.) I am, therefore, inclined to believe, in the absence of any decision to the contrary, that section 199, Criminal Code, was repealed by implication by the passage in 1881 of a general law upon the subject of liquors, which, among other things, provided a penalty for the selling or giving away of any malt, spirituous or vinous liquors or any intoxicat - ing drinks on the day of any general or special election. I am not, however, of the opinion that the repeal and re - enactment in 1909 of said section 14, chapter 50, Compiled Statutes, need hamper you in any way in the matter of prosecutions for said offense.

            <seg id="p268">166 A party committee has no authority to make nominations which were not made at the primary. M. L. Corey, Esq., County Attorney of Clay County, Clay Center, Neb. Dear Sir: I have yours of the 15th instant, in which you ask for an opinion upon the following questions: "1. A person who was not a candidate for the nomination re - ceived a plurality of all votes cast for county supervisor upon * certain party ticket. He failed to file an acceptance within the time limited by law. Is this a vacancy that may be filled by a party committee, as provided by section 58S8, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1907?" "2. There was no candidate on the ticket of a political party at the primary for a certain county office, and the name of no per - son was written in. Can the party committee fill th â–  place on the party ticket?" The law relative to your first question is as follows "If any voter elects to write in the name of any other party than the one on the ballot printed and vote for such person instead of the regular candidate, it shall be the duty of the election board to can - vass and return such vote, and should any such person receive the highest number of votes of any one voted for for that office, and shall within ten days thereafter file with the county clerk an accept - ance of same, he shall be deemed the regular candidate." (Compiled Statutes of 1909, ch. 26, sec. 1171.) A strict construction of this law would require us to hold that one receiving a plurality of the votes cast for a particular office by the voters writing in his name must also file his acceptance within the ten days before he could be considered a party nominee. This should be the rule so far as the candidate is concerned. By failing to file his ac - ceptance he becomes ineligible to election. But, I think a different construction should apply to this law so far as the electors are concerned. The party electors saw fit to write upon their ballots the name of this candidate for a particular office; he received a plurality of the votes cast for such office; the party electors thus made him the choice of their party for that office; and having made him their party choice for that office I do not think that his refusal </seg>
            <seg id="p269">167 to hie his acceptance ought to defeat the political party naming; him from having a party candidate at the go: election if it sees fit. I, therefore, conclude that his ret to file an acceptance is in the nature of a resignation, pro - ducing a vacancy, which may be filled by the party com- Answering your second question, I do not think that a party committee has the right to name a candidate for an office in a case where there was no candidate for such of - fice at the primary and the name of no person was written in for the same. This is in accord with a previous holding of this department, which is as follows: I 1 'Vacancies occurring upon any party ticket after the 'loldin.? any primary shall be filled by a majority vote of the part;- com - toe of the city, itistrict, county or state, as the case may be, I a certificate of such nomination shall be filed as required by tion 5776 of Cobbey's Annotated Statutes, 1903.' (Compiled Stat - 8, ch. 26, sec. USa.) "The word 'occurring' evidently means 'happening' or 'taking place" after the primary. If so, this section cannot be construed to authorize the party committees to make nominations which were not made at the primary. I take it that under this section part/ committees are empowered to fill vacancies occasioned by the death, re - moval or resignation of persons nominated at the primary. Party organizations cannot refuse or neglect to see that candidates for the various offices are presented at the primary and then take ad - vantage of such refusal or neglect by making such nominations through the instrumentality of a committee. To so hold would enable those in control of party machinery to prevent or discourage nominations by the primary and bring them about by the party com - mittee. Such practice would eventually undermine the whole prim - try system." (Report &amp; Opinions of Attorney General 1907-1908, Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson-, Attorney Qeneral, By Grant G.

Deab Sib : I have your letter of the 20th ultimo, in which you state that the school board of district 85, in Thayer county, has refused to set apart a sum for a district school library as by law it is provided it shall do, and ask the opinion of this department upon the following proposi- "Has the county superintendent power to reject the report of this district and of all other districts that fail to show compliance with statutory enactment, when upon the face of such report compliance Is possible?" The statutory provision relative to the setting apart of a library fund is as follows: "The school board or school trustees of every school district within this state shall, and it is hereby made their duty to set aside annually from the general funds collected for the use of the district the sum of ten cents per pupil as shown by the total number of pupils within the school district at the last annual school census. Said amount so set aside shall be known as the district library funds, and shall be by the school board or school trustees of such district annually Invested in books other than the regular text books, which books so provided shall be suitable for the district school library." (Compiled Statutes of 1909, ch. 79, subdiv. 18, sec. 11.) As will be observed, this provision of statute allows the school board no discretion in the matter. It provides, in positive terms, that a certain amount, definite in the sense that it is readily ascertainable by a numerical computation, shall be set apart each year as a district library fund. Doubt - a performance of the duty thus enjoined upon them could be enforced by mandamus. "A positive official duty imposed upon a board of directors, which Is not discretionary, may be enforced by mandamus." (Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, Vol. 25, 2nd ed. p. 61.) The statutory provisions relating to the duty of the di - rector of a school district to make a report to the county </seg>
            <seg id="p271">169 Ierintendent are found in sections 17. subdivision 4, ehap - 79, Compiled Statutes of 1901).

I think there is no question but that the superintendent I a right to require the director to show in his report amount of money set apart each year for the district *ary fund, and in case the report is silent on that sub - t to return same for correction. In case a school district Is or refuses to make the census report properly or to ke the proper financial report required by law, the dis - â€¢t treasurer is not entitled to a certificate from the county &gt;erintendent that such report has been made. In that â– nt the district treasurer cannot draw the amount of the te apportionment from the county treasury.

Harper, Esq., Count if Attorney of Fionas County, Beaver City. Neb. Dear Sir: I have your favor of the 9th instant, in which you Bay that â–  certain party has been convicted of a misdemeanor in your county and that two parties there - upon entered into a recognizance for an appeal of the case, the defendant himself not joining in or being â–  party to the recognizance. You ask the opinion of this depart - ment as to whether or not the fact that defendant is not a party to the recognizance will prevent the appeal from being effective. In the case of Zobel r. State, 72 Xeb. 427, the supreme court of this state lias said: "To render an appeal to the district court effective in a misde - meanor case, where conviction has been had in an inferior court, the defendant must enter into a recognizance, and with sureties, to be fixed and approved by the court or magistrate trying the case, as is provided by section 324 of the criminal code. A recognizance entered into by the defendant alone is insufficient to perfect a valid appeal." In the case above quoted Zobel had entered into a recog - nizance without sureties, so that the question involved in that case is not quite the same as the question raised by you. But the principle involved in the two cases is very similar, and in the course of the opinion written in the Zobel case Judge Holcomb took occasion to say: "If the sureties alone attempted to enter into a recognizance for defendant's appearance in the appellate court, it can hardly be doubted that the failure of the defendant to become a party thereto would invalidate the attempted appeal."

In the case of any one treated as a private patient, 'he commissioners shall appoint some suitable person as special cus - todian, who shall have authority and whose duty it shall be, in all suitable ways, to restrain, protect, and care for such patient, In such manner as to best secure his or her safety and comfort, and in such manner as to best protect the persons and property of others, in the case of public patients, the commissioners shall require that they be in like manner restrained, protected, and cared for by the com - missioners of the county or overseers of the poor, at the expense of the county, and they may accordingly issue their warrants to such commissioners of the county, or overseers of the poor, who 3hall forthwith comply with the same.

In this connection I will suggest that there is more than one insane hospital in the state, and if you find it impossible to get patients admitted to the hospital at Lincoln, because of lack of room there, it may be possible, if you will communicate with the board of public lands and buildings, that such board can arrange to have such pa - tients kept in some one of the other state hospitals for the insane.

Deab Sir : I have your favor of the 16th instant, in which you make a statement of facts and ask for the opinion of this department thereon, as follows: "The county treasurer has asked me for an opinion relative to -Motions 11114, 11116, Cobbey's 1909 statutes, in regard to whether or not the purchaser after the two years' of redemption period has ex - pired can publish a notice as required under section 11114, and then apply for a deed any time within the three years as provided by section 11116. In other words, must the notice be published within </seg>
            <seg id="p277">175 "The proposition in question is, where a party purchased at tax sale certain land in the county, and has allowed the two years to expire without publishing notice as required under section 11114. During the third year he publishes said notice as requireu by said section, fixing date of redemption three years from date of sale, he then applies to county treasurer for a deed under section 11116. Should the treasurer issue a deed under such circumstances?" I am of the opinion that it is not now necessary that notice be published within two years from date of e. Prior to 1905 the statutory time Tor the redemption land from tax sale was two years. (Compiled Statutes 1903, ch. 77, sec. 119.) When the time for redemption s thus limited by statute to two years, it was necessary it notice to the owner of the land be given prior to the )iration of the two years. But in 1905 the statute was ended so as to provide that the owner or occupant of d sold for taxes or any person having a lien thereon or erest therein may redeem the same at any time before &gt; delivery of tax deed by the county treasurer. (Cob - r's Annotated Statutes of 1909, sec. 11111.) It is further provided by statute that before the pur - ser at any sale for taxes shall be entitled to a deed shall at least three months before such deed is applied serve, or cause to be served, upon the person in the iial possession or occupancy of such land, and upon the son in whose name the record title of said land ap - rs to be, a notice which the statute provides shall con l certain things. (Cobbey's Annotated Statute- tt is further provided by statute that if no person is in actual possession or occupancy of said land, and Hhj ord owner of said land cannot, after diligent inquiry, found in the county in which same is situated, said no - i may be published. (Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 9, sec. 11114.) It is further provided by statute, as follows: Eany time within three years after the expiration of two from the date of sale of any real estate for taxes or special nents, if the same shall not have been redeemed, the county </seg>
            <seg id="p278">176 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. treasurer, on request, and on production of the certificate of pur - chase, and upon compliance with the provisions of this act, shall execute and deliver to the purchaser, his heirs or assigns, a deed of conveyance for the real estate described in such certificate." (Cob - bey's Annotated Statutes of 1909, sec. 11116.) Construing these various provisions of the statute to - gether, it seems clear to me that the notice may be given after two years from the date of sale, for the time for redemption does not expire until the tax deed is delivered by the county treasurer and the section of statute provid - ing for notice does not require that it be given within two years from date of sale, but only that it be given at least three months before applying for a deed. (Cobbey's An - notated Statutes of 1909, sec. 11113.) Hence, if the proceedings have been regular in all other respects and the only question involved is the question whether a notice given more than two years and within three years from date of sale wjis given too late, I am of the opinion that the county treas - urer may lawfully issue the tax deed. You will under - stand, of course, that the notice must be given at least three months prior to the expiration of the five year period from date of pale, as the deed can only be issued within three years after the expiration of two years from the date of sale, and it is a statutory requisite that the notice be given at least three months before tax deed is issued. By the way, inasmuch as the notice in this case was given by publication, it would be well to have it shown in some way, to the satisfaction of the treasurer before he is - sues the deed, that no person was in the actual possession or occupancy of the land and that the record owner of the land could not upon diligent inquiry be found in the county, in order to show that the case is one where notice by pub - lication is admissible.

Dear Sir: I have your favor of the Kith instant, in which you ask the opinion of this department as to the construc - tion to be given that part of section 5753, Cobbey's An - notated Statutes, wherein it is provided that a vacancy in office shall occur whenever the incumbent is convicted of an infamous crime, or of any public offense involving the violation of his oath of office. I have been unable to find any decision of our court erein the term "conviction" has been judicially defined, 1 the decisions from other states are conflicting, some ding that Itya conviction is meant only a finding of guilty a jury and others holding that a judgment of court tencing the defendant in a criminal case is m order to constitute a conviction. "Conviction." as d in section 235, Criminal Code, providing that each 1 every person convicted of certain crimes shall be tmed infamous and incapable of holding office eta, ans the judgment on a verdict of guilty and not the diet alone. (Fnunce r. People, 51 111. ."111.)

I do not think, however, the fact that an appeal is taken from the judgment of the trial court will operate to prevent the occurrence of a vacancy. "As often used the word 'conviction' includes both the ascertaining of the guilt of the accused and judgment thereon, by the court; and such is its use in Code 1873, sec. 364 8, which permits evidence of &amp; conviction for a felony to be given as affecting the credibility of % witness, but the taking of an appeal from the judgment does not annul it so as to prevent evidence thereof from being given to affect the credibility of &lt;he convicted person."

Previous to the levy of taxes for the current r, following the provisions of section 6188, Cobbey's Annotated tutes of 1909, a majority of the resident freeholders in two road :ricts in said county petitioned the county board for a tax levy of mills for use in improving the highways of the respective dis - ts, which levy was accordingly made by the board at the same e as other levies.

M. Needkmm, Esq., County Attorney of Boone County, Albion, Neb. E)ear Sir : The attorney general has referred to me, for wer, your letter of the 13th ultimo, addressed to him, in which you make a statement of facts, and ask the opinion of his department thereon, as follows: EOn March 14, 1909, a search warrant was sworn out of the nty court of this county against one A. D. White, cnarging him with the unlawful keeping of intoxicating liquor. The next day the search was made and liquor found, but the said \\ hue was not ar - rested by the officer, not then being in the village where the liquor was kept though the return of the officer indicates ne was then in possession, at least constructively. The next week following the grand jury found an indictment against White for illegal keeping of liquor on the same days in which the search was made under the warrant. At the same term of district court the indictment was quashed and the county attorney directed to file an information or complaint before the county judge. The reason for the quashing of the indictment had nothing to do with the sufficiency of the indict - ment. Mr. White appeared in the county court and waived pre - liminary and was bound over to the district court on the charges of keeping intoxicating liquors among others, and the case is now pend - ing on the information drawn in pursuance to the complaint. No proceedings have yet been had in condemnation of the liquors seized by the sheriff and still in his possession. The warrant and return to the search warrant show the liquors taken, but do not show the man White was ever arrested. "The question I wish to ask is: Can an alias warrant of arrest for White now issue or could the proceedings for condemnation be had without an arrest but on proper notice? "Also can the condemnation proceedings be had independent of the case now pending in the district court, without first dismissing the counts for illegal keeping? In other words, must the case on thÂ» </seg>

Ehe questions propounded by you are not easily an - red. I do not find where they have been passed upon ctlv either bv our court or bv anv other. I think the examining magistrate might have entered order that the liquors be destroyed when White ived a preliminary examination on the complaint and s bound over to the district court, but as this was not M matters are soÂ»newhat complicated. However. 1 MM the opinion that the best you can do, under the cir - nstances, is to hold the liquors seized pending the trial White, without taking any further steps to have them idemned, and at the trial show their intoxicating ehar - er and that they were found in the posses-ion of de- Ilf White is acquitted they will be turned back to him course. If he is convicted, it is probable the court will der them destroyed. If no such order is made they 11, of course, have to be turned back to White, even ough he be convicted. But I do not think the court will sitate, if the defendant is found guilty to order them stroyed, neither do I think the defendant can suceess - lly urge against an order that the liquors be destroyed, he be convicted, that no such order was entered at the eliminary examination, for the fact would remain that e order should have been issued at the conclusion of the eliminary and the fact that it was not so iÂ»ued could Â» in no way prejudicial to defendant.

These cities now ask, can they renew these applications now with the 'Board of Education?' " Eou request an opinion of this department on the fore - lg questions. The title to House Roll 232 is as foi - st "An act to establish and locate an additional State Normal School at some suitable place as hereinafter provided and to provide for the erection of buildings, payment, maintenance and receiving donation for same, and to provide an appropriation tuerefor." Irhe foregoing title and the act thereunder make it cer - n that it was the intention of the legislature to create I establish a new normal school. It is an act complete itself and does not purport to amend any existing stat - i. It is true, as suggested, that section 2 directs the formal Board of Education" to select the site, etc., but ake it that it was the intention of the legislature to con - this power of location upon the legal board charged til the duty of managing and controlling the state nor - &gt;1 school. The board charged with that duty is the legal ard. It having been determined by the supreme court it the old normal board is the legal board, that board the one that has authority to consider applications for ation and to act thereon. IV our second question is, does the pendem-y of that suit any way extend the time, or has the tim^ for filing ap - cations and the locating of the school expired. In my igment, the time was not extended for the filing of ap - cations, by reason of the litigation pending to determine lich of the contending boards was the legal one. I think was incumbent upon the parties or localities competing r this school to file with the one or the other of the boards </seg>
            <seg id="p287">185 their applications therefor within the time fixed in the statute, but that the location of the school by the board may properly be considered as extended. It has been re - peatedly held by the courts that where an act is to be per formed by a board or a tribunal within a specified tine. the failure to act within such time does not divest it of the authority or relieve it of the duty to Bnbseqvently form the act enjoined upon it. It is a matter of common knowledge that early after the passage of this normal school act the authority of the new normal board of edma tion was challenged in the courts and that the old normal bound was claiming authority to continue the exer - cise of its former functions. By rt-ason of this situation it became incumbent upon localities competing for this new school to judge for themselves which board was the proper one with which to file applications. I think it is only fair to assume that these localities filing proposals with either the old or the new board did so in good faith. In my opinion they ought not be foreclosed of the right to have their applications considered when it was finally de - termined which of the two boards was the legally consti tuted one simply because they may have made a mistake in judgment as to which was the legal board, since no one could determine definitely which of the two boards wa&gt; the legal one prior to the decision of the supreme court in the matter. I four third question is whether the officers of the so - led Normal Board of Education having failed to turn ?r or deliver to any member of the Board of Education r or all of the applications filed with them within the le prescribed by law, such city or applicant is entitled have its application refiled with and considered by your ird.

Dear Sir : I am in receipt of your letter of January 3, submitting the following proposition and requesting an opinion thereon : "Assuming that for a county whose population does not exceed 18,000, the fees of the office of county clerk amount to $2500 or more, may the county clerk, without any action by the county board, retain $1,000 for deputy's salary, or could that amount be retained even against the adverse action of the county board?"

IOear Sir: I am in receipt of your letter of January 8, erein you say that under section 6213x1, Cobbev's Anno - ed Statutes of 1909, the county board made a levy of &gt; mill "as a special emergency bridge levy," but that tre was no estimate made for this levy at the January 19 meeting of the county board; that the act under ich the levy was made did not take effect until July 1909, but that while the county board at its January 19 meeting made no estimate for a special emergency dge lev}' it did make an estimate for $15,000 for bridge â€¢poses; and that the combined levies for bridge pur - including the special emergency bridge levy, uld not equal or exceed the $15,000 estimate made by â–  county board for bridge purposes. at the January 19 meeting. You submit the following questions: "1. Is this levy legal?" B2. Are the members of the county board personally liable for ting the same?" "3. Should the amount of tax paid under protest be refunded?" Section (1213x1, to which you refer, was an act passed by the legislature of 1909. It appear* to be an act inde - pendent in itself, is not amendatory of any other act, and purports to repeal no other act or section of the statute. It is also an act that is calculated to meet emergencies that may arise for the reparation or reconstruction of bridges. While its terms are apparently antagonistic and repugnant to the provisions found in section 4443, Cob - bey's Annotated Statutes of 1909, with reference to the power of the board in making estimates, yet I am of the opinion that the courts would sustain this statute and construe the same as being in pan mater'ui or supple - mental to the apparently repugnant provision found in the section of the statute defining the duty of county I am, therefore, of the opinion that the county board </seg>
            <seg id="p295">OPINIONS. 193 had the authority to make this levy of one mill, pro - vided the total levies made did not exceed the constitu - tional limitation for county levies. Even though the act of the legislature &lt;&gt;t' 190!). embodying section 6213x1, may be declared unconstitutional, I am still of the opinion that the levy may be sustained on the ground that it was within the estimate fixed by the county board for bridge pur - poses at its January 1909 meeting. My conclusion, there - fore, is (1) that the levy is legal, (2) that the members of the county board are not personally liable for making the same, and (3) that the taxes paid under protest ought You submit the further proposition that a taxpayer appealed from the allowance of a claim for building bridges and defeated the same; that he employed his own attorney and has now filed a claim for $50 for the attor - ney fees he paid; that you, as county attorney, assisted in prosecuting the appeal; and that neither yourself nor the county board asked that counsel be retained. You ask my opinion on the following question: KIb the county board in duty bound to allow this claim of $50 (or rney fees?" I know of no law that would authorize the county board to allow this claim, and am of the opinion that the claim should be rejected as constituting no valid claim against the county.

            <seg id="p296">194 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Dear Sir: I have yours of the 12th instant, in which you state that the register of deeds in your county paid out in the year 1906 the sum of $276.45, in excess of the income of the office for that year; that this amount so paid out included his salary of $1,500 and clerk hire of *320; that in the year 1907 he paid out $76.35 in excess of the receipts of the office for that year; that in the year I'.'OB he paid out an amount exactly equal to the receipts of the office; and that in the year 1909 the income of the office for that year was $91.40 in excess of his salary and clerk hire, and that he paid this excess into the county treasury. In substance your question is : Has the register of deeds, under these circumstances, a fair and just claim against tne county for the excess of $91.40 which he paid into the treasury in the year 1909? Heretofore this department held that where the fen earned by a county judge did not aggregate the maxii/ium amount allowed by law for his annual compensation he maj. to the extent of the deficiency, retain fc?s collected by him or earned by his predecessor whose salary was paid in full. (Report &amp; Opinions of Attorney General 1907-1906, p. . -&gt; Â».) In an opinion dated April 14, 1909, this department held that a clerk of the district court who does not earn oi take in during any year of his term a sufficient amount of fees to pay the maximum amount of compensation allowed liim by law may retain enough out of any excess of fees received by him during any subsequent year of the term to make up such deficiency. These opinions would seem to be decisive of the ques - tion submitted by you and would seem to call for an af - firmative answer thereto. I would have no hesitancy in so holding if it were not for the fact that the statute gov - erning the compensation of register of deeds is worded in such a way as not to permit of a similar construction applied to the statutes governing compensation of county judges and clerks of the district courts. I dislike to have one rule for one class of county officers and a different </seg>
            <seg id="p297">195 rule for another class, but I am compelled to make the distinction on the statute as I find it. E action 9593, Cobber's Annotated Statutes of 1909, in scribing the duties and fees of the office of register of ds, also provides as follows: "And each register of deeds whose fees in the aggregate exceed the sum of Fifteen Hundred ($1,500) Dollars in any one year after tho payment of the necessary deputy and clerk hire, shall pay Bnch excess into the treasury of the county in which he holds Ml tJYom this it seems plain the legislature intended that excess in any one pear should be paid into the ti r. This was the course pursued by the register of deeds erred to by you, and his action in that respect was in ict compliance with the law. E, therefore, conclude that the register of deeds of your nty would have no valid claim against the county tor excess paid by him into the county treasury in the r 1900. Very respectfully. W. T.

I Dear Sir: I have yours of the 13th instant, in which you bmit the following question and request the opinion of is department thereon: KCan one who is holding the office of precinct assessor also legally 1 the office of justice of the peace?" The general rule is well settled that one person cannot hold two offices, the duties of which are incompatible, and </seg>
            <seg id="p298">196 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. conversely where the duties are not inconsistent one per - son may hold two offices. The office of justice of the peace is a constitutional office, and, under section 1, article 2 r constitution, belongs to the judicial department of the state government. Said section of the constitution pro - vides as follows: "The powers of the government of this state are divided Into three distinct departments, the legislative, executive and judicial, and no person or collection of persons being one of these departments, shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as hereinafter expressly directed or permitted." The office of precinct assessor is in the nature of an execu - tive office, and there is respectable authority supporting the contention that for one person to hold a judicial and an utive office at the same time would be a violation of the above quoted constitutional provision. {State r. Hutt, 2 Ark. 282; State v. Cumin, 10 Ark. Ui\) Considering the actual duties of the two offices in counties not under town - ship organization I fail to see wherein there would be any serious conflict between them, but it will be observed that in counties under township organization the town assessor and justice of the peace, together with the town clerk, con - stitute the town board. (Compiled Statutes ol 1909, ch. 18, art. 4, sec. 19.) For this reason and the one mentioned above I think it would be unwise, and productive of more or less confusion, to establish the precedent of permitting a precinct assessor to also hold the office of justice of the peace.

Falls City, Neb. Dear Sir: Your letter of January 13 received, wherein you state that at the general election in your county a man was duly elected as township assessor for Muddy town - ship and has qualified for that office; that after his election the county board divided Muddy "township into two town - ships. East Muddy township and West Muddy township: that the person elected at the general election now lives in that part constituting West Muddy township; that Jan - uary 10 was the time set for the two townships to com - mence as separate municipal corporations; that no as^. has been appointed by the county board for East Muddy township; and that it was suggested, if lawful and proper, the assessor elected before the division would act now as assessor for both townships. You submit the question as to whether this could lawfully be done. Section 20, revenue law, as it now exists, provide - ows: Erhat at the general election in 1909 and every two years there - â€¢ there shall be elected In each precinct, ward or township, one inct assessor whose term of office shall be for two years, and shall not be eligible to hold two terms in succession." By section 9, revenue law, it is provided as follows Erne -words 'township' and 'precinct' shall each include the other shall also include 'towns' in counties under townsnip organiza- The phrase 'precinct assessor' shall include also 'city assessor,' rict assessor' and 'township assessor.' " By section 20, revenue law, it is further provided as fol - low- KAny vacancy occurring in the office of precinct assessor, from cause, shall be filled by appointment by the county assessor and county board in a regular or special session." From the foregoing I am of the opinion that each of </seg>
            <seg id="p300">198 REPORT OF THE ATTOXEY GENERAL. these townships is entitled to an assessor, and that the one that is not now provided with an assessor is entitled to have one appointed by the county board, as provided by section 20. While I am not prepared to say that, should the one elected act for both townships, the assessment would be illegal, yet I think the safer course to pursue and the one which is really demanded by the statutes as they now exist would be to appoint an assessor for the town - ship not already provided with one. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, January 17, 1910. Attorney General. Justice of the Peace â€” Filling Vacancies. In a city with a population of about 3,000 which is in a county under township organization, a vacancy occurring in the office of justice of the peace should be filled by the mayor and city council. A\ T. Gadd, Esq., (Jaunty Attorney of Custer County, Broken Bou , Neb. Dear Sir: I have yours of the 14th instant, in which you state that your county is under township organiza - tion, that your city has a population of about 3,000, and that in your city there is a vacancy in the office of jus - tice of the peace. In substance, your question is as fol - low What body has power to fill the vacancy in the office of justice of the peace? During the incumbency of Attorney General Prout this department held that a town board in a county under town - ship organization was the proper body to fill a vacancy in the office of justice of the peace. In this opinion it was said: "Though the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace is co-extensive with the territorial limits of his county, I am of the opinion that in respect to his election and appointment, he is a township officer within the meaning of the section cited, and that therefore a vacancy in that </seg>
            <seg id="p301">199 office in a county under township organization should be filled by the township board." (Report &amp; Opinions of Attorney General, 1901 - 1902, p. 75.) He said he was confirmed in his views by the ruling of tht' supreme court in State r. Taylor, 26 Xel&gt;. 580, ami State v. Planibrck, .'5(i Neb. 401. Of course, this ruling would be decisive of your question if it related solely to the filling of vacancies in the office of justice of the peace in a town - ship properly so-called, but the law under which your city is entitled to two justices of the peace contemplates their election within the boundaries of the city. I take it that your city and certain territory outside thereof constitute the township proper. In some localities the authorities permit all the electors within the township proper, including the city, to vote for the justices of the pence. This, however, does not comply with the strict let - ter of the law. At one time when the law provided for the election of justices of the peace in each ward of cities of the second class, I think such officers were considered precinct officers, and the county board would be the proper party to fill the vacancies by appointment, but under the law applicable to your city, as it now exists. I think yon are right in holding that justices of the peace are city otn eeva and that vacancies occurring in such offices should bo filled by the mayor and council of the city. Very respectfully, W.

Dear Sik : I have yours of the 15th instant, in which you State that the court-house in your county, together with the furniture therein, has been destroyed by fire, but that the foundation remains intact. Your question is : "Has the county board the right to rebuild or reconstruct thiÂ» building to its former condition, without submitting the proposition to a vote of the people?" Section 2388, Compiled Statutes of 1909, authorizes the county board to erect or otherwise provide a suitable court-house, jail and other necessary county buildings, and for that purpose' to borrow money and to issue bonds of the county to pay the same. This portion of the section contemplates the erection of an entirely new court-house. This section also authorizes the county board to keep the said buildings in repair. Â»The question submitted by you involves the determina - m as to what is to be considered the proper meaning of the word "repair," as used in this section. I do not lnink it can be interpreted to mean the power to rebuild or re - construct an entirely new edifice. The word "repair" im - plies the existence of a thing to be repaired. The author - ities pretty generally hold that "repair" means to mend, to restore to a sound state, after decay, injury, dilapida - tion or partial destruction. If it can be said that noth - ing remains of the court-house but a portion or the whole of the foundation, I think it would be a strained construc - tion of the word "repair" to hold that it implies the power to reconstruct or rebuild an entirely new edifice, although the county board followed precisely the plan of the orig - inal. If, however, there is enough of the original structure re - maining so that mechanics skilled in the construction of buildings would deem the portions remaining of substan - tial value and use in reconstruction, in such case power is conferred by this language upon the county board to pro- </seg>

En the case of Colfmx County r. Butler County, 120 X. W. , the court said : "It is shown by the proof that less than $300 worth of material oC the old bridge was used by Colfax county in the construction of the new bridge (costing $23,000) and it is fairly inferable from the record that such old material was so used for the purpose of making the work appear to be 'a repair job' rather than new work." In the above case the court held that the word "repair" n&gt; used in section (5417. Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1907, relating to contracts between counties for repair of bridges, was used in its ordinary sense. " 'Repair' means to mend, add to, or make over, and differs from 'reconstruct,' which means to construct again or rebuild; so that, where a Sidewalk was reconstructed rather than repaired, and sucu reconstruction, under a notice to the owner to repair or that the sama shall be repaired by the city, does not authorize the city to recovtr for such reconstruction."

I[ find that on August 7, 1882, an act of CongrtM WU ai&gt; - &gt;ved, which provided for allotment in peveralty of the ds of the Omaha Indian Reservation in Nebraska to the mbers of that tribe of Indians. (22 Statutes at Large, , 342, '.\V.\.) It appears that, under the proviuoi d act, allotments were made by the approval of the allot - nt schedule dated July 10, 1884, that trust patents of ;&gt;tment wore issued under the date of December 29, 1^ S 4. 140,000 acres of land in Thurston county, that the indi - â– ual allottees entered into the immediate possession reof, and that they have ever since retained po&gt;si - such individual allotment It is provided by said act of Congress as follows: "Sec. 6. That upon the approval of the allotments provided for in the preceding section by the Secretary of the Interior, he shall cause patents to issue therefor in the name of the allottees, which patents shall be of the legal effect and declare fhat the United States does and will hold the land thus allotted for the period of twenty-five years in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indians to whom such allotment shall have been made, or in case of his decease, of his heirs according to the laws of the State of Nebraska, and that at the expira - tion of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian or his heirs as aforesaid, in fee discharged of said trust and free of all charges or incumbrance whatsoever. And if any con - veyance shall be made of the lands set apart and allotted as herein provided, or any contract made touching the same before the expira - tion of the time above mentioned, such conveyance or contract shall be absolutely null and void; Provided, That the law of descent and partition in force in the said state shall apply thereto after patents therefor have been executed and delivered. "Sec. 7. That upon the completion of said allotments and the pat - enting of the lands to said allottees, each and every member of said tribe of Indians shall have the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the state of Nebraska; and said state shall not pass or enforce any law denying any Indian of said tribe the equal protection of the law." (22 Statutes at Large, 341, 342, 343.) </seg>
            <seg id="p306">204 I find that it is provided by the act of Congress of June 21. 1906, as follows: "That prior to the expiration of the trust period of any Indian allottee to whom a trust or other patent containing restrictions upon alienation has been or shall be issued under any law or treaty, the President may, in his discretion, continue such restrictions on aliena - tion for such period as he may deem best; Provided however, that this shall not apply to the lands in the Indian Territory. (34 Stat - utes at Large, 326.) It appears that the Secretary of the Interior in June, 1909, made an order to the effect that the trust period over the Omaha Indian lands, above referred to, would expire July 10, 1909, and by an executive order, dated July 5, 1909, it was attempted to extend the trust period over these lands for a period of ten years from July 10, 1909. You say there are several hundred thousand dollars held by the United States under trust, which is the proceeds of sale of inherited Indian lands and over which the govern - ment exercises the same trust and control as it claims to exercise over the lands above referred to. To reach a correct conclusion regarding these questions it is necessary to determine, if possible, what rights the In - dians secured under and by virtue of the trust patents under date of December 29, 1884. Happily this question was before the court in case of United States r. Rickert, 188 V. S. 4."&gt;2. Justice Harlan, delivering the opinion iÂ»f the court, said as follows: "What interest, if any, did the Indian allottee acquire in the land allotted to him? That question is answered by the fifth sec - tion of the allotment act, which provides: 'That upon the approval of the allotments provided for in this act by the Secretary of the Interior, he shall cause patents to issue therefor in the name of the allottees, which patents shall be of the legal effect, and declare that the I'nited States docs and will hold the land thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made, or in case of his decease, of his heirs according to the laws of the state or territory where said land is located, and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said </seg>

"The word 'patent,' where it is first used in this section, was not happily chosen to express the thought which, it is clear, all parts of the section being considered. Congress intended to express. The 'patents' here referred to (although that word has various mean - ings) were, as the statute plainly imports, nothing more than in - struments or memoranda in writing, designed to show that for a period of twenty-five years the United States would hold the land allotted, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the allottee, or, in case of his deatn. of his heirs, and subsequently, at the expiration of that period â€” unless the time was extended by the President â€” convey, the fee, discharged of the trust and free of all charge or incumbrance. In other words, the United States retained the legal title, giving the Indian allottee a paper or writing, improperly called a patent, show - ing that at a particular time in the future, unless it was extended by the President, he would be entitled to a regular patent conv. the fee. This interpretation of the statute is in harmony with "he explicit declaration that any conveyance of the land, or any con - tract touching the same, while the United States neld the title in trust, should be absolutely null and void. So that the Unit- d States retained its nold on the land allotted for the period of twenty-five years after the allotment, and as much longer as the President, in his discretion, should determine." It is further held in said case, as follows: I If. as is undoubtedly the case, these lands are held by ttv; ted States in execution of its plans relating to the Indians â€” with - any right in the Indians to make contracts in reference to them to do more than to occupy and cultivate them â€” xini'A a regula* Â»nt conveying the fee was issued to the several allottees, it would ow that there was no power in the state of South Dakota, for e or municipal purposes, to assess and tax the lands in question il at least the fee was conveyed to the Indians."

All subjects over which the sovereign power of a state ids are objects of taxation; but those over which it does not id are, upon the soundest principles, exempt from taxation. The sovereignty of a state extends to everything which exists by its own rority, or is introduced by its permission; but does not extend to ; means which are employed by Congress to carry into execution powers conferred on that body by the people of the United States." It was farther held in United States v. Rickert, supra, as follows : "To tax these lands is to tax an instrumentality employed by the United States for the bene'fit and control of this dependent race, and to accomplish beneflcient objects with reference to a race of which this court has said that 'from their very weakness and helplessness, so largely due to the course of dealing of the federal government with them and the treaties in which it has been promised, there arises the duty of protection, and with it the power. This has always been recognized by the executive and by Congress, and by this court, whenever the question has arisen?' " In the case of United States v. Thurston County, 143 Fed. 287, the question was squarely presented as to whether or not the funds arising from a sale of trust lands were im - -sed with the trust character that exempted them from taxation. It was held by the circuit court of appeals in that case that these funds were impressed with the trust character and were exempt from taxation. The answers to the first four propositions you submit aro dependent upon the validity of the executive order made extending the trust period ten years.

If Congress, in the first in - stance, had the power â€” and it will be assumed that it had â€” to make the trust period thirty-five instead of twenty-rive years, the act of Congress of June 21, 1906, would be con stitutional and valid. The impairment of the obligation of contract cannot, in my judgment, be successfully nrged against an act of Congress. The constitution of the United States only denies to the state the authority to enact hiws impairing the obligation of contracts. The United Stales government is not included within the constitutional prohi - bition which prevents states from passing laws impairing the obligation of contracts.

Corporations â€” Indebtedness â€” Per Cent of Capital Stock. torporation is not authorized to create an indebtedness in excess of 66 2-3 per cent of the aggregate of both its paid up and sub - scribed capital stock. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Eentlemen : I am in receipt of your recent letter, direct - my attention to section 4120, Cobbey's Annotated Stat - of 1909, winch provides as follows: "The articles of incorporation must fix the highest amount of Indebtedness or liability to which the corporation shall, at anv onÂ« time, be subject, which must in no case exceed two-thirds of the capita! stock." You request my opinion on the following question: E7an a corporation, under this statute, be permitted to issue its Is or create an indebtedness in excess of two-thirds of tha unt of capital stock actually issued?" Eour inquiry involves the meaning of the term "capital k," as used in this statute. In a large number of idicated cases relating to the subject of taxation, </seg>
            <seg id="p311">209 whcr6in tins term has boon judicially defined, it has been almost universally held to mean the "capital" or "a-xi-' of the corporation. It will be observed, however, that this statute is found in the law governing the organization of corporations, and should be construed in thai light. The purpose the legislature had in the enactment of this pro - vision was doubtless the protection of members of the public in their dealing with them, by restricting corpora - tions in their right to contract indebtednes It is a natter of common knowledge that a great many porations are organised with an authorized capital ck far in excess of the issued or paid up capital stock, must, therefore, determine, if possible, whether the m "capital stock" was to be taken to mean the capital the corporation which might consist of its assets, tan - le and intangible, its issued and paid up capital stock, its authorized capital stock. The members of the pub - would not get that protection the legislature intended gire, .were corporations permitted to contract an in - ttedness to the extent of two-thirds of its authorized ital stock. The authorized, but unissued or un&gt;ub - ibed, stuck is not an asset of a corporation, and it aid, therefore, be of no benefit to creditors of a corpor- As hereinbefore suggested, the courts in considering the meaning of this term, in connection with the revenue laws, have quite uniformly held that it means the entire capital or assets of the corporation, and have used and construed the term "capital stock" as synonymous with the words "capital" or "assets." 1 do not think, however, that this is the meaning of the term "capital stock" that should be given in the connection it is used in the statute abov. out, but that as here used it has a more restricted mean - ing. It is the subscribed and issued capital stock of a cor - poration through which it receives its actual capital or assets, and this constitutes a trust fund for the security and the benefit of creditors. </seg>
            <seg id="p312">210 In Savger v. Uptutt, 91 U. S. 60, it was held: "The capital stock of an incorporated company is a fund set apart for the payment of its debts. It is a substitute for the personal liability which subsists in private copartnerships. When debts are incurred, a contract arises with the creditors that it shall not be withdrawn or applied, otherwise than upon their demand, until such demands are satisfied. The creditors have a lien upon it in equity. If diverted, they may follow it as far as it can be traced, and sub - ject it to the payment of their claims, except as against holders who have taken it Unnn M for a valuable consideration and without notice. It is publicly pledged to those who deal with the corporation, for their security. Unpaid stock is as much a part of this pledge, and as much a part of the assets of the company, as the cash which has been paid in upon it. Creditors have the same right to look to it as to anything else and the same right to insist upon its payment as upon the payment of any other debt due to the company." Viewing the term "capital stock," used in the statute under consideration, in the sense that the act was intended for the protection of creditors or persons contracting with the corporation, it is reasonably certain that it was in - tended to mean, and does mean, the capital stock paid in or subscribed and not the authorized capital stock. In the case of CommotHoeoltk r. Lehigh Avenue Rail - nay Co., 129 Pa. St. 405, the Lehigh Avenue Railway Com pany, with an authorized capital of $1,000,000, was given power to borrow money not exceeding an amount equal to "one-half of the par value of the capital stock." Only ten per cent, or $100,000, of its capital was paid in when it resolved to issue its bonds for a loan of $'250,000, or two and one-half times the amount of its paid in capital stock. A bill in equity was filed by the Commonwealth to enjoin the issuance of these bonds as contravening section 3 of the act of May 7, 1887, and the court held that the words "par value of the capital stock," used in the incorporat - ing act, were to be construed to mean capital stock paid up and not authorized capital stock, and sustained the judgment of the lower court enjoining the issuance of bonds to an amount in excess of $50,000, or one-half the paid up capital stock. The case of Slater r. Taylor, (111.) 89 X. E. 271, was an </seg>
            <seg id="p313">211 action to recover from t lie defendant the indebtedness of a corporation in excess of the amount of its capital stock created in violation of the limitation of the statute, which provided : "If the indebtedness of any stock corporation shall exceed the amount of its capital stock, the directors and officers of such cor - poration assenting thereto shall be personally liable for such excess to the creditors of such corporation." In that case it was held as follows: {The amount of the 'capital stock' of a corporation is the amount tributed by the shareholders for the prosecution of the business, . as the term is used in the revenue act it includes the assets of corporation, and the value of the capital stock depends upon the j ts and property of the corporation and their amount: but as the n is used in Laws 1871-72, p. 300, sec. 16, making the directors officers of a corporation ass&lt;ntinc; to an indebtedness exceeding amount of the capital stock liable therefor, it does not include the ;ts of the corporation." ( rflrtm r. IMr, II N. K. I'Tl.) In the case of London k Lancashire Fire Ins. r&lt;Â». v. Luduig, (Ark.) \Y1 S. W. 1!&gt;4, it was sought to recover from the secretary of state an amount paid under pro - test for filing the articles of incorporation of a foreign insurance company. The act providing for the filing fee of such articles of incorporation provided, among other things, as follows : frhat all corporations hereafter incorporated in this state and all ign corporations seeking to do business in this state shall pay into treasury of this state for the filing of said articles a fee of $25 re the capital stock is $50,000 or under; $75 where the capital k is over $50,000 and not more than $100,000; and $25 additional each $100,000 of capital stock." The- authorized capital stock of the corporation was $1.-U)&lt;)0,000; its paid in capital stock was $11,400,000; and the secretary of state had based his charges and exacted his fees on the basis of the authorized capital stock rather than on the paid up capital stock. In constniing the term "capital stock," as used in this statute, the court held it not to mean the authorized capital stock not subscribed, but the paid up capital stock. </seg>
            <seg id="p314">212 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY OENERAL From the foregoing I am lead to the conclusion, and give it as my opinion, that the term "capital stock," as used in. this statute, means the subscribed or paid up capital stock and not the authorized capital stock, nor the "capital" nor gross assets of the corporation, for this may fluctuate as the value of the property may fluctuate in which the as&gt;ets of the corporation arising from its stock sales have been invested, and that a corporation incorporated under the laws of this state may not create an indebtedness in excess of 66 2-3 per cent of the aggregate of both its paid up and subscribed capital stock.

Dear Sir: 1 have yours of the 20th instant, in which you submit the following questions and ask for the opin - ion of this department thereon: "1.

"2. What is the measure of damages to a rauroad company upon the establishment of a highway across its right of way and tracks?" Section (5070 provides for notice of the establishment, vacation or alteration of highways. Section 6071 provide! that no objections or claims for damages shall be filed or made after noon of the day fixed </seg>

If this section stood alone the natural vould be that one who failed to file a damages for land taken for a public li eularly when personal service had 1 i him, would thereby waive his right tc ;es. Bat, in construing: this section our c bly construed it with reference to the constitu - ision of section 121, article 1, which is as fol- r'he property of no person shall be taken or damaged for public without just compensation." The trend of the decisions is to the effect that, regard - of the nature of the service of notice upon the land owner, his property cannot he taken by the public and wed for a public highway, unless be donates or dedic the land to the public, or unless the public has acquired a prescriptive right thereto. In the case of Kimc v. Cass Count ii, 71 Neb. &lt;&gt;77, the court said: [In this state, the county cannot take possession and use land a highway without assessing and paying or providing for the ment of damages to the land owner.

"Under the provisions of this section of the statute, a railroad com - pany cannot recover damages from a county for the cont of putting in cattle guards, erecting sign posts, building wing fences, planking the track, and constructing the necessary approaches at a public crossing. "Compensatory damages should be a. .owed for the lana taken from the right of way for a public road. "Where, in making the proper approaches to the railroad track.

Inheritance Tax â€” Lien on Real Estate. An action may be maintained in equity to enforce an inheritance tax lien against real estate within five years after such tax is due and â–  payable, even thougu the title to the real estate has passed to subsequent purchasers. </seg>
            <seg id="p317">215 |)ear Sir: I am in receipt of your communication of mary 27, stating that in November 1905 one Jens An - son, a resident of Kearney county, died testate, be - â– athing to five nieces, residents of Denmark, 240 acres land; that this land was appraised and an inheritance assessed against each legatee of $20; that the land s sold long ago to third parties; that the estate, in due e, was settled and the executor discharged; and that inheritance tax was not paid. You inquire what can done in the premises, and whether or not this tax is h a lien on real estate as may be enforced by law. Efind it is provided by section 4 of the act in ques - l that this tax "shall remain a charge upon such real ite until paid." Section 21 of said act provide! ows : "The lien cf thr inheritance tax shall continue until the said tax is settled and satisfied; Provided, that said lien shall be limited to the property chargeable therewith; and Provided Further, that all in - heritance taxes shall be sued fcr within t'\c vcais after they are due and legally demandable, otherwise they shall be pnsumed to be paid and cease to be a lier as against any purchaser of real estate." En the ease of State ex rel. v. Vinsonhaler, 74 Neb. 675, ;vas held that this tax was not a property tax but a tax the right of succession to property by inheritance or will. I do not think this decision goes to the extent holding that it may not be declared by the legislature ien on real estate. I take it to Im? within the power the legislature to declare that such a tax may be made ien on real estate. From the statutes quoted it is manifest that the It â€¢_ lature undertook to make this tax a lien on the real estate and to make the same enforceable as such lien against subsequent purchasers, or perhaps, more cor - rectly speaking, against the real estate in the hands of subsequent purchasers, provided an action is brought to ML, JJ. t\.i)ifj, r,sq., ( ounty Attorney of Kearney County, Minden, Xeb. </seg>

The situs of the personal property on the Xuckolls county farm might, of itself, be considered sufficient to determine the place of the assessment of this property, and render it assessable in Xuckolls county, independent of any fur - ther provision of the revenue law. But, in this case, it i&gt; not necessary to hinge this question upon the language of section "_'!&gt;. Section 30 specifically provides that when the owner of live stock or other personal property &lt;:&gt;n - nected with the farm does not reside thereon, the same shall be listed and assessed in the county, township or pre - cinct where the farm is situated. The property in i tion is connected with the Xuckolls county farm and brings it within the provisions of the statute which declares that such property shall be listed and assessed in the county where the farm is situated. The farm being in Nuckolls county, that becomes the place where it shall be listed and assessed. I Were this property to be stolen from the Xuckolls mty farm, it is clear the venue of. the offense would be Xuckolls county.

I unincorporated association may make a complaint challenging the unreasonableness of rates on commodities over which the railway commission has jurisdiction. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. (ientlemen: I have yours of the 4th instant, in which you ask, in substance, the following question: Eas an unincorporated association, such as a commercial club, the t to make a complaint challenging the unreasonableness of cer - rates on commodities mentioned in the Aldrich act? E0 far as material to this question section 2, chapter Session Laws of 1907, commonly known as the Aldrich is as follows: I The state railway commission shall have the power to hear and ;rmine whether or not the freight rate upon any article or articles uch schedule or classification of rates is either so high as to be un - . to shippers, or so low as to be unremunerative or unjust to any imon carrier affected thereby, and upon complaint, in writing, of person or corporation affected thereby, particularly specifying the cle or articles upon which such rnt.es are either too high or too low the facts in connection therewith, said railway commission shall such cause for hearing and upon a trial thereon and a full hearing it notjee thereof, shall either raise or lower the rate herein fixed n such article or articles to the end that tne same snail be just reasonable to all parties concerned." I have examined the original complaint filed by the Omaha Commercial Club before your body, upon which your question is founded. I observe it contains the alle - gaiion that the Omaha Commercial Club is duly incor - porated. If so, the only question to be determined in con- Etruing this section is whether or not such commercial </seg>
            <seg id="p321">219 club has on interest such as is affected by tliG rate question, and this is true for the reason said section pro - vides that any person or corporation may make com - plaint. The allegations of the complaint are to the effect that the Omaha Commercial Club is composed of a large number of persons, companies and corporations whose in - terests are directly affected by the rates sought to l&gt;e II liberal construction of this section would, in my opin - permit even an unincorporated association to make complaint. I do not understand that the provision Alilrich act were designed by the legislature to in any 7 restrict or modify any of the provisions of the rcil - r commission act which prescribed the procedure to be owed in presenting matters to the railway commission, airraph a. section f&gt;, chapter 00. Session Laws of 10&lt;&gt;7, imonly known as the railway commission act, is a&gt; fol - o &gt; I When any railway company. con:r.icn carrier, cr any person b behalf, or in behalf of any class of persons similarly situated, or firm, corporation or association or any mercantile, agricultural or tufacturing society, or any body politic or municipal organization, 1 make complaint to the railway commission that any rate or rates i by said commission in said schedule, or in any subsequent revised nodified schedule, or the rate charged or published by any railroad pany, is unreasonably high or low, unjust or discrimin \vr a, the rd of railway commissioners shall immediately fix a day for near'-.g same." Section 10 of said act also provides as follows: Ifcny person, firm, corporation or association, or any mercantile, cultural, or manufacturing society, or any body politic or municipal inization, complaining of anything done or omitted to be done by railway company or common carrier, subject to the provisions of act, or any of the laws of this state, relative to the control and ilation of railway companies or common carriers under which said mission has authority to act, may apply to said commission by peti - , briefly stating the fact, except as to the fixing, establishing and ilating of rates and charges for the transportation of freight other - â€¢ provided for in said act; whereupon a copy of the complaint shall ierved upon such railway company or common carrier in the same ner as process in civil cases is served, who shall be required to </seg>
            <seg id="p322">220 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. satisfy the complaint, or file a written answer thereto within a reason - able time to be fixed by the commission." (take it that these provisions of the law were designed the legislature to provide a procedure by which com - ints might be made and petitions filed by all sorts of Delations and all kinds of persons. I think the word â€¢ciation" is broad enough to include unincorporated bodies, such as commercial clubs. I also think that the Kd "person" includes an unincorporated association, it is well known that the courts, as a general rule, have held that it included corporations. "The term 'association' usually means an unincorporated organization composed of a body of men, partaking in its general form and mode of procedure of the characteristics of the corporation." (' h'niyhl r en*. 72 N. Y. Sup. 815.) "Under laws 1849, c. 437, the term 'association' includes every individual doing business alone for some purpose, under the banking law." ( lUmk Â«i ffimii r. Wirklmui (N. Y.) 7 Abb. Prac. 134, 138.) Evidently the legislature used the word "person" in the acts referred to in the same sense as that word is used in the statutes of the state. Under the trust laws of this :-tate the word "person" is deemed to include all corpora - tion, associations, combinations or concerns whatsoever. (Compiled Statutes of 1909, ch. 91a, art. 2, sec. 19.) Tiider ihe Criminal Code of Nebraska whenever any property or interest is intended to be protected by a provision of the penal law, and the general term "person" is used to designate the person whose property is intended to be protected, such term includes all public or private corpora - tions. (Criminal Code, sec. 252.) Hence, I conclude that a fair construction of the mc tions of the railway commission act and of the Aldrich act would permit an unincorporated association to make a complaint challenging the unreasonableness of the rates on commodities over which the railway commission has jurisdiction. However, I concede there is ground for de - bate on this question, and, in my opinion, it would be </seg>

Section 20 of the revenue law provides as follows: "At the general election in 1909 and every two years thereafter, there shall be elected in each precinct, ward or township one precinct assessor whose term of office shall be for two years." House Roll 214, passed by the last legislature, amended the election law on this subject to read as follows: "In the year 1909 and every two years thereafter shall be elected in each city and each village having 1,000 inhabitants or over, one city assessor, and in cities having a population above 4,000 one additional district assessor for each 4,000 inhabitants or major fraction thereof." From the statement contained in your communication I take it that Franklin county is under township organiza - tion and that Bloomington precinct and East Bloomington precinct arc subdivisions of one township for voting pur - pose: 1 . Section 19, article 4, chapter 18, Compiled Statutes of 1909, provides as follows: "The town clerk, the town assessor and the justice of the peace who shall have received the largest number of votes for that office shall be and constitute the town board." If possible these provisions of the law hereinbefore re - ferred to should be so construed as to give force and effect to each and at the same time harmonize with one another. It is impossible to harmonize the provisions of the elec - tion law with the provision relative to the composition of the town board and hold that a township can have more than one assessor unless it contains a city or village with a population sufficient to authorize the election of an as - or for such city or village. In that case the assessor that is provided by statute for a city or village would not be the township assessor, within the meaning of the stat - ute denning the composition of the town board. I am of the opinion, therefore, that this township which </seg>

At the beginning of each month each deputy inspector shall forward to the state inspector of oils, a true copy of such record with all money received by him for his inspection. ' (Compiled Statutes of 1909, ch. 64, art. 1. sec. 8.) In Kerf, p. DohhcU, (Me.) 42 AtL 345, it was held that a record is not a public one unless it can he inspected by any person interested. The converse of this proposition is frue, that a record which is open to the inspection of the public and is required by law to be kept is a public word. Chapter 74, Compiled Statutes of 1909, provides as fol - lows: "All citizens of this state, and all other persons Interested In the examination of the public records, are hereby fully empowered and authorized to examine the same, free of charge, during the hours the respective offices may be kept open for the ordinary transaction of business." In my opinion, this statute gives the records required to be kept in your office, according to the provisions of section 8, article 1, chapter (i4, Compiled Statutes of 1909, the character of public records. As to the duty of your department to furnish certified copies of records, will say that section 409, Civil Code, provides as follows: "Every officer having the custody of a public record or writing is bound to give any person on demand a certified copy thereof, on payment of the legal fees therefor."

There is a provision of law which author - izes the county board to strike from the tax list all per - sonal taxi's which, from any cause, it is impossible to col - lect after the expiration of two years. If, under the facts stated by you. the tax debtor should pay the $400 to the treasurer and take his receipt for that amount, I think your County board would then be justified, under section ]'&gt;"). article 1. chapter 77, Compiled Statutes of 1909, in ordering the county treasurer to strike from the tax list the amount of all of this tax remaining unpaid. You also state that a citizen of your county returned to the assessor for the year 1909, personal property â€¢ i" the value of $"_',. "iOO; that assessment was made on that amount; that in July following said tax debtor took ad - vantage of a bankrupt law; that a trustee was appointed, â– rho claims to have only received $1,100 worth of prop - erty; and that said trustee now refuses to pay more than the taxes upon the $1,100 which came into his hands. Your question is: "Is Burt coÂ»nty entitled to the entire tax based on the $- valuation returned by the tax debtor, and, if so, what procedure would you advise?" State, county and municipal taxes are liens upon the estate of a bankrupt, which take precedence over the rights of ordinary creditors.

            <seg id="p330">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 228 subjects for losses they claim to have sustained. In your communication you request advice as to the proper course to pursue in connection with the proposed claims. I take it from this you desire advice upon the liability of the state of Nebraska to make good these losses by way of an appro - priation by the legislature. In the first place the large aggregate of these claims i* enough in itself to excite inquiry, if not suspicion, as to its accuracy. It is quite probable that the actual dam - age sustained, either to persons or to property, in this called riot, if investigated would appear to be hut a small percent of the amount claimed. This, however, lias little, if anything, to do with your present inquiry. I understand from the communicr.tions before me that when information was brought home to you, of threatened mob violence at South Omaha, at the time in question, you tendered the service of the militia of the state and that this tender was refused. There appears to be nothing in the situation that would have required you, as the execu - tive officer of the state, to do more than you did on that oc - casion. By your conduct in the premises you placed the state of Nebraska, as a sovereign beyond the pale of just criticism. But, were it conceded that the state had committed any wrong or negligently suffered any wrong to be committed, it would not amount to a tort, because no suit can be brought against a sovereign state without its antecedent permission. In the treaties made by the government of the United States with foreign nations not more is promised by the signatory powers than 1 hat protection and security are guaranteed by each nation to the persona and property of the subjects of the other, and that they shall enjoy in this respect the same rights and privileges as are. or shall be, granted to the na - tives on their stibmitting themselves to the conditions im - posed upon them. I know of no obligation that the federal government has entered into witli foreign nations which in - sures to the citizens (if such nations residing in this country </seg>
            <seg id="p331">229 jiieaioi j &gt;i otect ion jinn noughts than are accorded l)v our own government to its own citizens. No one. I think, would seriously contend that a resident of South Omaha, and a citizen of the state of Nebraska and of the United States, would have any just or valid claim against the state of Ne - braska for any damage which he might have received to his person or his property by reason of the conduct of an unlaw - ful combination of men or of a riot. I cannot conceive that an alien would have any greater right. There is, in my opin - ion, no liability against the sovereign state nor against the municipality to which the sovereign may have delegated the power of preserving public peace, unless the sovereign granting or delegating the power has also, by statute, de - clared and fixed a liability ui&gt;on its municipal delegate. fn the case of City of Nor Orleans r. Abbafjnato, 10 C. A. all, it was held: I'WhenT^ by the action of the state, a municipal corporation it irged with the preservation of the peace, and rmpowered to joint police boards and other agencies to that end, the corporation lantu is charged with governmental functions in the public in - est and for public purposes, and is entitled to the same im - nity as the sovereign granting the power for negligence in pre - ving the public peace, unless such liability is expressly declared the sovereign. This proposition is so well recognized that not veil-considered, adjudicated case can be found in the books where, the absenre of an express statute, any municipality has been held !&gt;le for the neglect of its officers to preserve the peace." iPhe case above quoted was an action by the' widow of tonio Abbagnato against the city of New Orleans for nages for the death of her husband. At the trial the y found for the plaintiff and judgment was entered on verdict. Error was prosecuted to the circuit court of &gt;eals, and the judgment was reversed. It was held in t case as follows: I In the absence of a statute giving a remedy, a city Is not liable damages for taking a human life by a mob. although its officers have been negligent in preserving the public peace." In the case of State r. Mayor, ex al. of Xew Orleans, 109 S. 285, it was held as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p332">230 "In giving or withholding remedies of this kind, it is simply a question whether the public shall, or shall not, indemnify those who sustain losses from the unlawful acts or combinations of indi - viduals; and whether it shall, or shall not, do so, is a matter of legislative discretion; just as it is whether the public shall, or shall not, indemnify those who suffer losses at the hands of a public enemy, or from intestine commotions or rebellion." In this state the legislature has fixed no liability upon the city of South Omaha, nor on Douglas county, to make good losses or damage! sustained by individuals through mobs or other unlawful combinations of individuals. Secretary Bayard in his note to the Chinese Minister, under date of February IS, IKSlJ, touching the liability of the federal government for damages claimed to have re - sulted from attacks on Chinese subjects in the territory of "Wyoming in 1NK5, said: "The system of government which prevails in the United States, and which their public written constitution had made well known to the government of China at the time of our entering into treaties with that country, creates several departments, distinct in function, yet all tending to secuie justice and to maintain law and order. The question of liability for reparation or indemnity for losses to individuals, occurring in any way, must be settled by the judgment* of the judicial branch, unless the act complained of has been com - mitted under official authority in pursuance of governmental orders to that end. â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ "I am compelled to state most distinctly that I should fail in my duty as representing the well-founded principles upon which rests the relation of this government to it3 citizens, as well as to those who are not its citizens and yet are permitted to come and go freely within its jurisdiction, did I not deny emphatically all liability to indemnify individuals, of whatever race or country, for loss growing out of violations of our public law, and declare with equal emphasis that just and ample opportunity is given to all who suffer wrong and seek reparation through the channels of justice as con - ducted by the judicial branch of our government." What is litre said with reference to the non-liability of the federal government applies, in my judgment, with equal force to the state of Nebraska with reference to the claims in controversy made by Greek, Austria-Hungarian and Turkish subjects who claim to have sustained dam - ages in the South Omaha riot of 1909. </seg>

This department, as I am advised, under a law which directed you to charge a filing fee based on the authorized capital stock of the corporation, furnished an opinion to the effect that on the authorized capital stock you should base your charges. Since that opinion was rendered, how - ever, the law has been amended and the word "authorized" was omitted from the amended act. 'Phis rendered the opinion of no authority under the amended statute which omitted the word "authorized" from the term "capital stock." tYou request an opinion now as to whether you should your charges for filing articles of incorporation on the authorized stock or the paid Dp capital stock.

In this state 1 am unable to find any statute that prohibits one person from holding both of these offices. \\ e are, therefore, remanded to the common law to determine the question you submit. At common law there seems to be no limit to the number of offices which may be held simulta - neously by the same person, provided that none of them arc incompatible with the others. The question as to when two offices are incompatible with each other is not always easy of solution. 1 think the rule laid down in Dillon on Municipal Corporations, section l(&gt;(i, note, is perhaps the correct one. It is there stated that incompatibility in offices exists where the nature and duty of the two offices are such pa to render it improper, from considerations of public policy, for one incumbent to retain both. This incompati - bility is an inconsistency between the functions of the two, mich as judge and clerk of the same court, or an officer who presents his personal accounts subject to audit and an officer whose duty it is to audit them. Where one office is not subordinate to the other, nor the relations of the one *the other such as are inconsistent and repugnant, there not that incompatibility which the law declares makes the acceptance of the one is the vacation of the other. In State eat rel. r. Weston, A Xeb. 243, on a question M whether or not one holding the office of secretary of state is eligible to hold the office of adjutant general, it was held: KNor do we see any reason why the person who happens to hold the e of secretary of state, may not, at the same time, hold that of adjutant general.

There is reason in the position that even though the secre - tary of the board, being a member of the board, who is denied compensation as such member, would still be en - titled to compensation for clerical services performed at the request of the board. Under the laws of the territory of Oregon a board of commissioners, whose duty it was to erect a penitentiary, selected one of their own number as secretary, and for such services allowed him the sum of $250, A suit was brought to recover it back. The statute did not provide for his compensation. The court held that the duties of the secre - tary might be performed as effectually by the same person as by different persona and that under the agreed state - ment of facts the compensation received by him having been reasonable he was entitled to retain it as against the territory. (Territory r. Norris, 1 Ore. 107.)

It was argued that the whole of his time should he devoted to the duties of commissioner of the supreme court. Our supreme court held that neither upon principle nor upon statutory grounds was such commissioner properly denied compensation for lectures delivered to the law class of the state University, since such extra services were not incompatible with his duties as commissioner of the supreme court. (Cornell V. Irvine, ."&gt;(&gt; Xeh. (&gt;.~)7.) IVhile neither of these cases is strictly in point, both are ful in determining how the courts would regard similar 'stions. However. 1 do not regard the question as to ether a member of this board may draw salary as Beers y as controlling in the disposition of this matter. To the real question is, has the hoard of education author - . under the law, to pay the actual and necessary expenses Hired in carrying on its work. I am informed that while â€¢ vouchers are issued in the name of the secretary, the ney is used largely in paying for clerical services which â–  legislature evidently never intended should he rendered ituitously. I It must not he forgotten that this hoard has burdensome ities to perform. Under the law all funds appropriated i- the use and benefit of the normal schools, together with e income arising from the lease and sale of endowment nd belonging to said schools, are under the direction and ntrol of said hoard, and all expenditures are made on counts audited and allowed by this hoard.

From this it will be seen that the board nni&gt;t necessarily keep extensive records of its varied traiisac tions, and it would require considerable time on the part sf some one to keep the same. It cannot be that the legis - lature intended the secretary of the board to assume the detail drudgery of this work without compensation or without the right to pay some one a reasonable sum for performing these services. In this I am borne out by the appropriation nuule for this board by the legislature. The legislature appropriated the sum of $2,(HM) for the expense ithe board of education of the state normal schools at u and Kearney. The law provides that the board shall hold only two regular meetings in the months of June and December, and as many special meetings as may be found necessary. The growing business of the board and its multiplying duties K'ssitate it holding many special meetings. The legis - re. no doubt, would not have made an appropriation of $2,(100 if only two meetings were had in mind. The I. lature fully realized the work devolving upon the board, and the records necessary for it to keep, and made this appropriation of $2,000 to meet its legitimate expense-. Besides, as 1 understand, it has been the custom for a long term of years for this board to allow the one who performed these clerical services to receive a small monthly compensation for the same. The legislature no doubt was aware of this and made the appropriation in contemplation of such custom. This act. in making the appropriation, was an acquiescence in, if not direct authority for, such practice. The law makes it the duty of this board to pass upon claims of this kind. The board having passed upon the claim submitted by you to this department and allowed the same, and the legislature having made an appropriation to meet the expenses of the board. 1 conclude, therefore, you </seg>

In recognition of this situation the legis - lature, at its first session after the adoption of this amend - t-nt and tlie election of the state railway commission, icted chapter 00. Session Laws of 1007, creating and do - inj; the powers, duties and qualifications of the coinniis - fn. Certain other acts have been passed by the leis - ure conferring additional specific powers and duties m the commission. Among other acts is an act passed the legislature of 1909, bein^ chapter 108, Session Laws for that year, the title of which is. "An act regulating the issuance of stocks, bonds and other forms of indebtedness of common carriers and public service corporations, and providing penalties for the violation thereof.'" Neither in the railway commission act. the constitutional amendment, nor in the act of 190!) above referred to is direct authority attempted to he conferred upon the commission to cancel, or order the cancellation of, stocks issued by a corporation. The powers conferred upon the commission, by the consti - tutional amendment, the railway commission act, and the act of 1909, are powers that partake more peculiarly of the nature of legislative and administrative than of judicial powers. PJpon a careful examination of the constitutional iimend - nt and the acts of the legislature referred to, it would in reasonable to conclude that the powers conferred upon the railway commission were for the most part admin - istrative or supervisory. The amendment itself confers upon the commission the legislative authority to regulate, which includes the right to fix and establish nites to be charged by railroad companies, but the other legislative or judicial powers which the commission may have the right to exercise are onlv such as are ancillary or incidentally â€¢ * * * necessary to carry into effect the other powers which are expressly granted. Section 1, article 2, constitution, provides as follows: "The powers of the government of this state are divided into three distinct departments: the legislative, executive, and judicial, and no </seg>

Having due regard for this provision of the constitution, it necessarily follows t,hat the railway commission i&gt; authorized to exercise such legislative powen as are con - ferred upon it by the constitutional amendment, supple - mented by the action of the legislature, and Mich other legislative and judicial powers only as are incidentally necessary to enable it to perform the duties for which it was created. I lie power to cancel the stock of corporations is distinct - ly a judicial function, and is to be exercised by the icial department rather than by a department of the â– eminent whose main function is executive or adinini&gt; the and clothed only with a limited or quasi judicial hority. It has no express authority from the const i - ion or the statutes to cancel stock.

It was contended thai so much of section 55 .is (undertook to authorize the judges of the district court to appoint park commissioners was un - constitutional and void as violative of the section of the constitution above quoted. This contention was sustained by the court, and in a very elaborate and well-reasoned opinion .Judge Reese discusses the question at length. It is doubtful if the reasoning therein can be excelled or even equaled. On this account, and because it may serve the commission as a guide in the future in its action, the same is here reproduced and is as follows: "In the investigation of this question we are confronted with the unusual and anomalous condition of meeting with many apparently well-considf red cases sustaining every contention of either side, and it will be absolutely impossible for us to follow any line of decisions which will not be antagonized by holdings in many other cases, for there is a sharp conflict of authority upon every conceivable feature and phase of the case. It could serve no good purpose for 113 io discuss and attempt to harmonize the views of Montesquieu. Jefferson. Madison. Hamilton, Stevens. Wilson, Goodnow and others upon the question here involved, for the reasons that it would be impossible to bring harmony out of the chaos produced by their divergent opinions, and that such discussion would extend this opinion to an unreasonable length, ending where we begin, and for the further reason that the time at our disposal is not adequate to the task. We will, therefore. be content with a brief reference to some of the later decisions, and an effort to arrive at the spirit and meaning of our own constitution as interpreted by the courts, the legislature and the judicial and administrative history of the state. "The provision of the constitution (Art. II. Sec. 1 ) that "the powers of the government of this state are divided into three distinct depart - ments, the legislative, executive and judicial, and no person or collec - tion of persons being one of these departments, shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as hereinafter expressly directed or permitted,' is not a new one in the constitutions of this country. It has been handed down from the beat thinkers and greatest statesmen of the nation to nearly all slate constitutions in one form or another, and, even win re not adopted in terms, it has been almost uniformly recognized as a part of our governmental system (Slult m. Hrill. IN Minn. 49!' Â» but has never been strictly applied, and indeed could not be, to all the ramifications of state or national government. The duties of the officers of the several depart - ments have, to some extent at least, overlapped and interlaced until It is hard to say in some cases where the one leaves off and the </seg>

While this definition has been api roved and sanctioned by all, yet the fact remains that the fmmttitm of the act itself is rilht â–  administrative or judicial, and there can in reality be no middle or half way ground between them. This being true, we are brought to the conclusion that many executive or administrative acts performed by judicial officers, and many judicial aces performed by ministerial officers, are an/1 must be held valid, notwithstanding the section of the constitution above quoted. Thus, it often becomes necessary to the full and proper discharge of the duties imposed upon an official belonging to one class to perform an act, the function of which, strictly speaking, belongs to anoihtr. The performance of such duties being, to some degree at least, essential to the full discharge of the duties imposed and properly within the power of the actor, the power conferred must be held to be valid: otherwise a condition of chaos would arise. We therefore conclude as all have done, that the constitution must n a liberal and general, rather than a strict, construction and application, and that every case must stand or fall relying upon its own merits. In theory the constitution is accepted as stating the one inflexible and unbending rule: yot in practice it is found impossible to obey its â™¦-very mandate." "It is unnecessary to cite the statutory provisions conferring this 'fMM? authority, which is. strictly speaking, an evasion of the rule, and which are sustained, for the statutes of all the states, as well aa of the general government, are full of them. An apt illustration of this may be found in the office of the state superintendent of public instruction. By Section 1, Art. V of the constitution, it is declared: "The executive department shall consist of a governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, auditor of public accounts, treasurer, superintendent of public instruction, attorney general and commis - sioner of public lands and buildings:' thus clearly classing the super - intendent Of public instruction with the officer .* of the executive department. Yet it is within common knowledge that lie is clothed not only with executive, but judicial and to some extent with legis - lative powers, the judicial to perhaps as full extent as the executive. His decisions (judicial) upon all subjects determinate by him within his department are binding upon county superintendents, teachers and school boards, unless reversed or overruled by a court having the required jurisdiction. Many other executive officers possess these same judicial powers, but in a less degree perhaps, among which might be mentioned the auditor of public accounts, sheriffs, coroners, county superintendents, and the various state, county and other boards. The conferring and exercising of the powers prescribed are seldom, if ever, questioned, and are recognized as legal. Were such not the- case. it would be practically impossible to execute and enforce the laws applicable to the various departments. If there is 'a limitation upon </seg>
            <seg id="p348">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 246 the authority of the legislature to confer these powers, it must be found in the well-known rule that an authority conferred carries with it all other powers necessary to the discharge of the general duty imposed, and that the power is limited to that extent; in other words, that the conferring of judicial powers upon an executive or administra - tive officer can. extend to such acts as may be necessary to enable the proper discharge of the duty, or to set in motion such other agencies as may be necessary to the complete discharge of xht* duty required to be performed. The appointment of an officer might properly, we think, be classed as the exercise of an executive or administrative function, at least not judicial. Yet courts and judges frequently find it necessary to make such appointments in order that the judicial functions of the courts ma'y be freely exercised. It often happens that courts or judges are clothed with this appointing power where the appointee may not be required to discharge any duty which could be in any way ancillary to the exercise of the judicial functions of the court or judge making the appointment, ani yM the validity of the appointment could not be successfully questioned, for the reason that the person appointed would exercise judicial functions in the dis - charge of the duties imposed under the appointment. We think, how - ever, that we may safely say that the appointment of park conimis - sioners for cities of the metropolitan class is not the exercise of a judicial function. It may not belong to either clnss. but it is clearly not judicial. We think also that the duties Imposed upon the park commissioners cannot be said to call for the exercise of judicial functions." ( Stutc is id. Thtmpmm r. StUe, *&gt;2 Neb. 2 7 ' &gt; - 2 7 :&gt; . &gt; t In the foregoing the limitations upon one department of government to perform functions that in a measure pertain to the duties of the other are properly stated, and furnish a reasonable gmkfo in the solution of the question presented by your inquiry. The cancellation of the stock of a railroad company by the commission is not an incidental necessity to the general powers of the commission to properly regulate and control such company. Even in the exercise of its power to fix rates the authority to cancel stock is not incidentally in ces - sary, since it lias become a well-established proposition "that the basis of all calculations as to the reasonableness of lates to be charged by a corporation maintaining a high - way under legislative sanction must be the fair value of the â– rty being used by it for the convenience of the pub - (Snu/tli &gt;-.

Before the 1905 amendment he revenue law the state board of equalization was with - specilied authority to raise or lower, by pereentum pease or decrease, the value of different elflsart of prop - y ill a county, and the only method it had of adjusting valuations among the different Â«mntieÂ« was by per - tum increase or decrease of the total. value of the prop - s' of the county. iln the case of Hacker r.

It occurs to me that if the. appeal can be taken and dis - posed of before an extension is necessary the county clerk would be warranted in deferring to make the extension on the assessment books until after the appeal was determined. If, however, it would not be likely the appeal could be settled and determined in court before the time it was neces - sary for the clerk to turn over his books to the treasurer, lie would be warranted in making the extension showing the increase.

Where a person has been arrested upon a complaint tiled in county court, charging him with either an unlawful sale or an unlawful keeping for sale of intoxicating liquor, and pleads to such charge in county court, the judge of such court has jurisdiction to pass and enforce sentence. It is not obligatory upon the county judge to pass sentence in such a case. He may, if he elects to do so, bind the defendant over to the district court. Sidney Dodge, Esq., County Attorney of Bed Willow Count*, UcCook, Neb.

County judges are by statute given the same juris - diction as justices of the peace "'in all matters relating to the enforcement of the criminal laws of the state, except ;Â»s otherwise provided." (Criminal Code. sec. 260.) It is provided by the constitution that justices of the peace shall not have jurisdiction in any criminal case "where the pun isliinent may exceed three months' imprisonment, or a fine of over one hundred dollars." The jurisdiction of county judges is. therefore, limited to those criminal cases in which the punishment cannot exceed a fine of one hundred dollars or three months' imprisonment, except where the statute expressly provides otherwise. The statute expressly pro - vides otherwise in misdemeanor cases when the defendant pleads guilty. "When the complaint is for misdemeanor only, of any grade of punishment whatever, if the cause is pending before the probate judge of the county, before whom the defendant enters a 'plea of guilty to the complaint, it shall be lawful for such judge, in his discretion, to render judgment of fine or imprisonment, or both, according to the law of the case and pass sentence accordingly, and enforce the same According to law."

In other words, 1 apprehend that there is a distinction between trying a case which necessarily implies a plea of not guilty upon the part of the defendant and imposing sentence upon the defendant in a case in which he has pleaded guilty.

How- ever, 1 do not think it is obligatory upon it to do so. tion 313, ( 'riminal ( 'ode, hereinbefore quoted, seems to make it discretionary with the court whether he sentences the defendant or not.

"Can they vote more than five per cent of the assessed valuation for water extension, and if so, can they make them optional after five years, the same as provided for water bonds and still call them water extension bonds?" fin addition to the facts stated in your letter. 1 find from e history of these bonds presented to me for inspection that the city of llavelock is a city of the second class with a population of three thousand, and that there are no bonds of any description outstanding against the city. The statutory provision regulating the power of cities of the class of Ilavelock to vote water bonds reads as fol - lows: "Such cities or villages may borrow money or issue bonds for the purpose, not exceeding twenty per cent of the assessed value of the taxable property within said city or village, according to the last pre - ceding assessment thereof, for the purchase of steam engines or fire extinguishing apparatus and for the purchase, erection or construction and maintenance of such water works, mains, portion or extension of any system of water works or water supply or to pay for water fur - nished such city or village under contract." (Compiled Statutes of 1909, Ch. 14. Art. I, Sec 69. Subdiv. IS.) The statute further provides: "The bonds shall be the bonds of such city or village and called 'Wattr Bonds' to become due in twenty years from the date of issue, but payable any time after five years, drawing interest, not exceeding â€¢ix per cent per annum, payable semi-annually or annually." (Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska. 1909, Ch. 14, Art. I. Sec. 69, Subdiv. 15.) I am clearly of the opinion that, under the facts as above stated, the city of Haveloek had a legal right to vote bonds in excess of five per cent of its assessed valuation for the purjM)se of extending its waterworks system, and to make the payment of such bonds optional after five years. In fact, so far as the optional feature of payment after five years is concerned, the law just quoted seems to require that thev be drawn in that wav. </seg>
            <seg id="p359">OPINIONS. 257 The only respect in which the proposed bonds seem to differ from the statutory requirement is in the name. They are denominated "Water Extension Bonds" instead of "Water Bonds" as the statute provides. While it would lÂ»e better to have them denominated "Water Bonds," H the statute provides, I do not regard the variation of suf - ficient importance to invalidate the bond*. However, to avoid any question, it would he well to have them reprinted if necessary, so as to leave out of the name the word "Ex - tension." I am not unmindful of the fact that a second provision of the statute provides that bonds may he issued by cities of the second class owning their own system of waterworks for the purpose of extending their waterworks system, that bonds issued under said section of the statute are properly denominated "Water Extension Bonds,*' and that such bonds cannot exceed live per cent of the assessed valuation of the municipality ipgning them and should he drawn t&lt;&gt; become due in twenty years from the date of i^sue. hut payable at any time after ten years. (Compiled Statute - of Nebraska of V.nv, eh. 14. art. 1. sec. 132.) But, it is quite dear to my mind, from a reading of the history of the bonds in question, that they are issued under the provisions of the section of the statute above quoted and not of the lant section cited. Hence, 1 am of the opinion that they very properly provide for optional payment after five years. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, August â€¢"&gt;. 1910.

The question you submit involves the meaning of the expression "internal improvements," as used in the above &lt;|iioted statute. The term "internal improvements," as used in its broad and â– â– restricted sense, includes "public improvements," but as applied to statutes of the character of the one above set forth it has a more restricted meaning.

If a city can by ordinance establish maximum rates, it has the power to oust the railway com - mission of the jurisdiction given it by statute to fix rates and charges for common carriers of that class.

In other words, is the Canton Bridge Company, whose conduct is guaranteed by this insurance, located in the state of Nebraska! In order to build this steel bridge across the Platte river at Valley, Nebraska, the agents of the company are com - pelled to come into the state and remain here for a consider - able time in order to complete its construction.

Knage districts are public corporations, and under the I rule come within the designation of persons. I. &gt;ie, conclude that this section is controlling in this matter and is direct authority for holding drainage districts liable for the construction, as well as the maintenance, of bridges necessarily erected over ditches intersecting the public highways.

Where the name of a candidate for county commissioner has been certified to the county clerk but is omitted from the primary ballot by reason of being received too late by the county clerk, and such candidate receives the nomination for the office by the voters writing in his name, he is required to file an acceptance of such nomination and his expense bill within ten days after the primary. L. A. DcYoe, Es(f., County Attorney of Keith County, Of/alalla, Neb.

At the pri - mary election the voters wrote in the name of the candidate on the hallot, and he received the nomination for the office. Your question is: "Is the candidate required to tile an acceptance of this nomination and also file his expense bill?" Section 117i, 'chapter lilt. Compiled Statutes of 1909, authorises tlie nomination of candidates by the voters writ - ing in the names thereof, and provides that should any prow receive tlie highest number of votes of any one thus voted for that office he shall be deemed the regular candi - date. There is one condition attached to this, however, and that is he shall file his acceptance of such nomination within ten days after the primary. Excluding the primary election day, it is my opinion that August 2(i, 1910, is the last day in which such acceptance may be lawfully filed. 1 also think the candidate should file an expense affidavit. This also should be filed within ten days after the primary election. The filing of such affidavit might not be required of one who was in no sense a candidate and who was Aoted for by the voters without his knowledge. But. where he has taken steps to become a </seg>

This question involves a construction of section 10033, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1909. I think this section properly construed means that parents, guardians or those having legal control of children sent to the Feeble Minded School are required to provide suitable clothing, necessary expenses of transportation, necessary expenses in case of death and all other incidental expenses. In case they are financially unable to do so, the county supervisors or com missioners of the county from which the inmate is sent, upon a proper order being made by the county court, shall pay to the superintendent the sum of $40 for each person so ad mitted, which money shall be used only for the expenses mentioned.

Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. (Jentlemen : 1 liave yours of the l'ith iiistiiiit , enclosing informal complaint No. l.'il", of W. ('. Fleury against Chi - cago, 6t. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company. You also enclose copy of a report of Henry T. Clarke, Jr., chairman of your commission, in which the facts in rela - tion to the land of complainant arc set out in detail. I rely solely upon the facts in said report in arriving at a conclusion in this case. In brief, the complainant owns land, which is located about one and one-half miles south of Fort Calhoun, near the right of way of the Chicago. St. Paul, Mil neapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company. In order to reach the public highway from his farm complainant is compelled to pass through land belonging to one Couchman. Com - plainant and his grantors have used this private way for a period of over ten years, and claim an easement in said Couchman's land to that extent, which complainant says said Couchman has always acquiesced in. Heavy rains, and perhaps the acts of said railway company in diverting cer - tain natural waters, have contributed to the formation of a pilch and the impairment of the passageway across the railway company's right of way. The private crossing is now almost impassable, and continued rains will prevent </seg>

Your question, in substance, is: Is complainant entitled to have a suitable crossing maintained by the railway company at this point? This question, of course, involves a construction of the provisions of our statute in relation to railroad rrmwingH Section 10575, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes for 1909, is as follows: "When any person owns land on both sides of any railroad, the corporation owning such railroad shall, when required so to do, make And keep in good repair one causeway or other adequate moans of crossing the same." Taking it for granted that complainant has an easement over said Cuuehman's lands, as shown by the report of Com - missioner Clarke, then the question arises as to whether or not this easement is "land" owned by any person, as re - ferred to in the above quoted section. Had complainant possessed this easement prior to the time the railway com - pany's right of way crossed it, I have no doubt but that it would be such an interest in the land as would entitle him to compensation for damages caused by the construction of the road. Consequently, I conclude it is "land" within the provisions of the section above quoted. But whether or not that be true, there is another provision of our law which is ;i^ follows: "Any railroad corpo-ation, canal company, mill owner or any person or persons who now own, or may hereafter own or operate any mil - road, canal, or ditch that crosses any public or private road shal' make and keep in good repair good and suincient crossings on all such roads, including all the grading, bridges, ditches and culverts that may be necessary, within their right of way." (Cobbey'a Annotated Statutes of 1909, Sec. 6162.) If complainant has used this means of egress from his farm over said land of Couehman, and said Couchman has acquiesced in the use thereof and consented thereto for a period of ten years, complainant undoubtedly has acquired </seg>
            <seg id="p378">276 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. a right of way by prescription and now has a private road across the lands of said Couchman. The section last quoted is full authority for holding that the railway company should maintain and keep in good repair a crossing over such private road. Of course, the same rule would apply if complainant's right to the private road had been acquired from said Couchman by purchase, gift or contract. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, Attorney General, By Grant G. Martin, Deputy Atty. General. September 27, 1910. Free Transportation â€” Checkmen â€” Transfer Company. I railroad company is authorized by law to issue free transportation to checkmen of local transfer companies whose duty it is to moet passenger trains at points near large terminals and to go through the trains, arranging for the transfer of passengers and their baggage. Nebraska State Railicay Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Gentlemen : I have yours of the 28th ultimo, in which you request this department to give a written opinion on the question as to whether uniformed checkmen of a local trans - fer company may ride on trains free, for the purpose of ar - ranging for the care of baggage, under the exceptions of the anti-pass act of 1907. From the communications accompanying your letter I learn that a request lias been made by one of the railroad companies of this state for this information, and that said company is desirous of issuing free transportation to such uniformed checkmen as may wish to ride on its trains not to exceed 150 miles west from the the city of Omaha, to take care of baggage of passengers who go to attend large con - ventions or gatherings in that city.

There is another class, however, Mich as officials and linemen of telegraph companies; ex-empln retired from service on account of age, and their widow-; necessary caretakers of live stock, poultry, vegetables and fruit; employees of sleeping car companies and express com - panies; railway mail service employees; newsboys on trains; baggage agents; persons injured in wrecks, and physicians and nurses attending them. The decision of this question depends upon what construc - tion shall be given the words "baggage agents." Do these â– words apply to regular baggage agents riding on trains only, or do they apply as well to checkmen or baggage agents who act for local transfer companies, who get upon trains near large terminals and ride into large cities while taking care of the baggage of passengers.'

If the petitions contain the Dfimes, without the designation of the residence or address, and the county clerk knows such per- MM are hmta fide residents of the district or county, in such case I should think that the failure to state the rau - dence or address would not invalidate the petitions, although I have no hesitancy in saying that the provisions of this statute should be complied with in all cases.

I do not think that the provisions of tion 3326c, Compiled Statutes of 190!), requiring such petitions to be verified, are now applicable as, if I am cor - rect in my memory, that section of the statute has been declared unconstitutional by our supreme court. You further ask whether such petitions should be signed by the electors of the county or those of the co:nmis&gt;ioner district.

Dear Sir: Your letter of the 19th instant, addressed to Hon. W. T. Thompson, attorney general, has, in the absence of Mr. Thompson, been referred to me for answer. I note that you say: "Kindly give us an opinion as to whether or net real estate should be assessed in 1911." The only direct provision of statute, with one exception which will be referred to hereafter, providing for the assess - ment of real estate is found in section 11004, Cobbey's An - notated Statutes of 1909, which reads as follows: Taxation â€” Real Estate. </seg>
            <seg id="p383">281 "All real property in this state subject to taxation shall be assessed on the first day of April, 1904, and every fourth year thereafter. Which assessment shall be used as a basis of valuation for taxation until the next quadrennial assessment except as hereinafter provided." the exception referred to is foi;nd in section 1KM Â»s. Cob - 's Annotated Statutes of 1909, wherein it is provided: "Each assessor shall annually, at the time of taking the list and valuation of personal property, also take a list of all real property that shall have become subject to taxation since ihe last previous list - ing of the property in the county, with the value thereof, and of all buildings and all other improvements of any kind, if over one hundred dollars in value, which shall not have been previously included in the value of the land and lo.s on which such improvements have been made, and shall make return thereof to the county assessor at the same time he is required to make his returns of personal property." I find no other provision of statute providing directly for an assessment of real estate. Hence, am constrained to be - lieve that except in exceptional cases covered by the la.-t provision of statute quoted assessments of real estate are only to be made every fourth year, beginning with the veu 1904. It is true that in section 11020, Oobbey'i Annotated Statutes of 1909, we do find the following provision: K'At its meeting in 1911 and every second year thereafter equalize real property of by raisin? the valuation of such tracts and lots are assessed too low, and by lowering the valuation of such tracts 1 lots as are assessed too high." !t will be observed that nowhere in this section of statute t provided that there shall be an assessment in 1911, 01 h teeond year thereafter.

A vacancy filled by the state executive committee, with authority of the state central committee, is valid. Hon. George C. Junkin, Secretary of State, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir: I have yours of the 26th instant, in which you say that a protest has been filed in your office against the placing of the name of Ralph A. Clark on the general elec - tion ballot as the nominee of the People's Independent Party for lieutenant governor. I am unable to find, in the files of your office in relation to this matter submitted by you, any written objection or protest, as contemplated by the statute. At the recent primary election W. II. Green was selected by the electors of the People's Independent Party in this state as its nominee for lieutenant governor. Mr. Green filed his declination. The executive committee of the Peo - ple's Independent Party met in the city of Lincoln, and on October 24 filled the vacancy by appointing Ralph A. Clark as its candidate for lieutenant governor. I understand the objection to this appointment is based upon the fact that the executive committee of the People's Independent Party made the appointment instead of the state central com - mittee of said party. You desire the opinion of this department as to whether you shall place the name of Mr. Clark upon the official bal - lot for the coming general election as the nominee of the People's Independent Party for the office of lieutenant gov - ernor. </seg>
            <seg id="p385">283 x ne Hies wincn you present with vour inquirv show that the state central committee of the People's Independent Party met in the city of Lincoln on September 20, 1910, that it accepted the resignation of several candidates who were chosen by that party as its nominees, and that it filled such vacancies. Said state central committee also author ized the state executive committee of said party to fill any further vacancies that might occur upon its party ticket. Ehe question you submit involves a construction of 118a, chapter 26, Compiled Statutes of 1909, which Is as follows: "Vacancies occurring upon any party ticket after the holding of any primary shall be filled by a majority vote of the party committee of the city, district, county or state, as the case may be, and a certifi - cate of such nomination shall be filed as required by section 5776 of Cobbey's Annotated Statutes, 1903." It is probable the legislature had in mind the party state itral committee, although the law does not read in that y as it now stands, as it simply provides that vacancies ill be filled by a "majority vote of the party committee." e state executive committee made the appointment, iming it was authorized so to do by the state central coni - ttee. The appointment having been made by the party nmittee, whether designated as "central committee" or xecutive committee," is in compliance with the letter the law. An executive committee is the governing board whom is referred any matter or business by any col - tive body of men acting together. I Without going into the question of whether the state cen - committee would have the right, if it were the proper imittee to fill the vacancy designated, to confer that r er on the executive committee, I am inclined to think i the executive committee that made the appointment a state party committee, and in view of the fact that primary election law expressly provides that its pro - ons shall be liberally construed and not be defeated by e informalities, I think you would be justified in holding </seg>
            <seg id="p386">284 that Mr. Clark is entitled to a position on the official ballot as the party committee nominee of the People's Independ - ent Party for lieutenant governor. Furthermore, I am led to this conclusion for the reason it is likely that had the executive committee realized its acts in making the appointment were void under the law it would at least have made an effort to convene the whole membership of the state central committee and have it fill the vacancy. It is true that since the declination was filed the time has been very short, and perhaps it might have been impossible for the state central committee to have been gotten together, but in any event the state execu - tive committee is looked upon as the body which acts for the party. Inasmuch as the statute does not define what is meant by the state party committee, the acts of the execu - tive committee ought, under the circumstances, to stand, so far as the filling of this vacancy is concerned. The law expressly provides that all nominations which are in ap - parent conformity with the provisions of this act shall be deemed valid, unless objections thereto shall be duly made in writing within three days after the filing of the same. t think this law requires the presentation of a formal com - aint in writing, setting forth the grounds of objection relied upon. In the absence of such written objection the nomination being in apparent conformity to law should be deemed valid. Very respectfully, W. T. Thompson, Attorney General, By Grant G.

All the foregoing sections should be construed together, and, if possible, effect should be given to all these provi&gt; ions. They should be compared, harmonized, if possible, and should be made to co-operate together as far as pos - sible, consistent with the evident intention of the law - makers. All these provisions have a general application to the filling of vacancies in state offices. They should be construed, each in the light of the other, as they constitute a system regulating the filling of vacancies in the system of our government, and should be construed so as to make that system consistent in all its parts and uniform in its operation. As was said in Sheldon v. Boston &amp; A. R. Co., 172 Mass. 180: "Where statutes are part of a general system regulating the same class of subjects, and rest upon the same reason, they should be con - strued, if possible, as to be uniform in their application and in the re - sults which they accomplish." </seg>

Vacancies in the office of railway commissioner, like other state officers, are to be filled by appointment by the governor. The general law with reference to filling vacancies in state offices ap - plies to railway commissioner the same as to other state officers. To segregate section 1, article 8, chapter Tl2Â» Compiled Statutes of 1909, from the other provisions regulating the filling of vacancies and to construe that section separately would contradict and nullify the general provisions of the law regulating the subject of filling vacancies at elections. To hold that a vacancy in the office of railway commissioner should be filled at the general election immediately follow - ing the creation of the vacancy, without reference to the time when the vacancy occurred, would, in effect, defeat the provisions of the general election law. If the provisions of the general election law do not apply to filling vacancies in the office of railway commissioner, a vacancy o&lt; riming in that office any time before a general election should be filled at the next succeeding gvneral election. A vacancy occurring the day before the general election would have to be filled the succeeding day. In this way half a dozen electors in the state, by writing on the ballot the name of some person for that office, could elect that important officer. In this instance the vacancy occurred twenty-four days before the general election, too late for any of the political parties to nominate a candidate either at the primary or by their respective political committ&lt; It is difficult to ascertain just what the present law is with reference to running for office by petition. Without going into an extended discussion of this subject, the view of this department is that section 130, chapter 26, Compiled Statutes of 1905, has never been repealed. </seg>
            <seg id="p390">288 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. To hold that the vacancy in this instance should be filled at the general election in November, 1910, would impede and hinder the exercise of the elective franchise, in this that it would prevent the nomination of a state officer by polit - ical parties and would leave the selection of candidates for Â§it office to a very small portion of the people of the state, would be in violation of section 22, of the Bills of Rights, which declares as follows: "All elections shall be free, and there shall be no hindrance or im - pediment to the right of a qualified voter to exercise the elective franchise." This question was discussed at length in the case of State v. Junkin, 122 N. \V. 473. Speaking of the right of the legislature to limit the number of signers on a petition to 500 in any one county, the court said: KFor want of the signature of the supporters who are deprived of the it to sign the nominating certificate of the candidate of their choice he may not be nominated. In such an event his name would not be printed on the official ballet for the November election, and their right to vote for him thereat as a regular nominee would be lost. Un - der these circumstances the empty privilege of writing on official bal - lots in blank spaces the names of persons who have not been nomi - nated, with the prospect of having such voies classified in the election returns as 'scattering,' is not the full measure of an elector's righ.s within the meaning of the ctnstitution. Electors who desire to vote for a particular candidate for judge of the supreme court at the Novem - ber election should be allowed to take part in nominating him or in whatever preliminary step the law requires as a condition of allowing his name to be printed on the official ballot. This privilege is protected by the following section of the Bill of Rights: 'AH elections shall be free; and there shall be no hindrance or impediment to the right of a qualified voter to exercise the elective franchise.' Const, art. 1, sec. 22. 8 "When the lawmakers enter the party caucus, the party convention, e party committee, and the primary to make regulations, they must act within the limits of the foregoing provision. The elective franchise may be invaded by such regulations, when they prescribe the forms of the official ballots to be used at the general election and establish the methods of making nominations. These forms and methods may be as effective to deprive the voter of his rights as direct legislation relating to the November election. Chief Justice Holcomb, in discussing a pri - mary law, said: 'It is a part of the election machinery by which is de- </seg>

To say thit the voters are free to exercise the elective franchise at a general election for nominees, in the choice of which unwarranted restrictions and hindrances are interposed, would be a hollow mockery. The right to freely choose candidates for public offices is as valuable as the right to vote for them after they are chosen. Both these rights are safeguard - ed by the constitutional guaranty of freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise.' stati &gt;-. lhu&gt;l."\ Neb. 790, 105 N. \V. 179. In the case cited Chief Justice Holcomb adopted the following language of Prof. Wigmore; 'Nomination for public office may be considered in two aspects: First, it involves the right of every eligible person to t&gt;e voted for by any elector who desires to do so; secondly, it involve* the right of each elector to exercise choice among all who are eligible. The two rights may be protected by the same legislation, but it is im - portant to remember that there is involved not merely the right of an individual to be a candidate, but the right of every other person to select him for the office; practically the feasibility of independent political movements depend upon the second right.' 23 American Law Review, 730."

Forrest Lear, Esq., County Attorney of Keya Paha County, Sprlngcieic, Neb. Deaf. Sir : Your letter of November 30, asking for infor - mation regarding the procedure and necessary vote to carry bonds, was received a few days ago. You speak of voting bonds for the purpose of taking up certain judgments against your county, and also for the purpose of building bridi; IVliile the plan of voting these bonds is similar, still re are separate provisions governing the voting of said ids. The provisions of chapter 45, Compiled Statutes of 9, govern the voting of bonds in aid of internal improve - uts. Sections 2fi to Ml, inclusive, article 1, chapter 18, npiled Statutes of 1909, outline the method of voting ids for the purpose of funding the indebtedness of the nty. Still other provisions are made in sections 32 to inclusive, chapter 9, Compiled Statutes of 1909, for the ianee of bonds for the purpose of compromising indebt - less of a county. I An examination of the law discloses that there is doubt id uncertainty as to the number of votes necessary to rry bonds in aid of internal improvements. It is plain </seg>

It has been settled that bridges are works of internal improvement. (Union Pacific R. Co. r. Commissitmet Coifax Count if, 4 Neb. 45i&gt;; South PlatU Lund Co. v. Buffalo Count if. 7 Neb. 260; State r. Keith Count if, 16 Neb. 509.) I Some kind of provision has always been made by the laws this state for the voting of bonds to aid in the construc - n of internal improvements. These provisions are found the territorial statutes. (Revised Statutes of 1867, eh. pp. 38, 39, 40.) Under the provisions of that act theM ads would be carried by a majority of the people voting favor of the proposition. This provision was a part of i statute law of the state at the time it was admitted into i Union in 1867. In 1869 the legislature passed a part of lat is now chapter 45, Compiled Statutes of 1909. This t provided that bonds could be issued in aid of internal provements in case a majority of the votes cast were in .'or of the proposition. tV.t the time the act of 1869 was passed the constitution 1866 was in force. That constitution having placed no triction on the legislature to make provisions with refer - â– e to the power of the county to contract debts and to lie bonds in payment thereof, the legislature clearly had â–  right to prescribe the limits of the indebtedness and o to prescribe what vote would be necessary to issue ids in aid of internal improvements. February 17, 1875, the legislature passed an act amend - ing section 4 of the act of 1869. The amendatory act changed the number of votes necessary to pass the bonds from a majority to "two-thirds of the votes cast at any such election." This act by its terms was to go into effect on December 1, 1875. It did not contain an express repeal- </seg>
            <seg id="p396">294 ing clause of section 4 of the act of 1869. At the time this amendatory act was passed the constitution of 1866 was still in force. The provisions in that constitution with reference to the amendment and repeal of statutes arc such that there is grave doubt of the necessity of including a specific repealing clause in an amendatory act. The court in Reynolds v. State, 53 Neb. 761, held in effect that a re - pealing clause was necessary, but an examination of that opinion will show that the court based its decision on the proposition that the provisions governing the amendment and repeal of statutes in the 1866 constitution and in the 1875 constitution were substantially the same. A compari - son of these two constitutions will show there is a material difference between the provisions in them dealing with the subject of the repealing and amendment of statute I Under our present constitution, which took effect Novem - r 1, 1875, certain limitations are placed on the county th reference to the voting of bonds for internal improve - â– nts. one proviso requires a two-thirds vote to inmw i indebtedness more than ten per cent. As the amended t of 1875 was to go in operation one month after the con tution took effect, it is apparent that it was the intention the framers of the constitution to require a two-thirds te to carry bonds in aid of internal improvements. hether or not a repealing clause was necessary in the act 1875 the courts have interpreted this law as being in rce and have given it effect. In at least two decisions b court has pointed out that the issuance of bonds in aid internal improvements is governed by this section. 'eineman r. Covmgton, C.&amp; B. H. R. Co., 7 Neb. 310, 313; ilbur v. Wyatt, 63 Neb. 261, 262.) When the former opinion was written by this depart - ment these decisions of the court were, no doubt, over - looked. While there is doubt as to what interpretation the court vrill finally give this section, still it is my view that the safe procedure is to have a two-thirds vote in favor of the bonds. In that eyent there can be no question about </seg>

Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your letter of Decembei asking for an opinion regarding fees for publishing the delinquent tax-list. The view of this department is that where no contract has been entered into between the county board and the printer, the printer is entitled to the full fees given by the statute for the publication of the delinquent tax-list. I find upon investigation that this department, on No - vember 23, 1904, gave an opinion that the provisioi. section 10595, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes, fix the amount which should be made for publication fees.

            <seg id="p398">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 296 examination of the decision rendered by the supreme court in the case of Miles r. County of Holt, 123 X. W. 527. I have, however, looked over the opinion very hurriedly, and it appeal* to me that the court intended to allow Mr. Miles compensation for the services rendered to the county. After an extended discussion of the services rendered to the county by Mr. Miles, in publishing the notices and the bene - fits accruing to the county by reason of the publication, the court makes this significant suggestion: I But, plaintiff having rendered the services, and the county having lived the benefit of the same, and having received a sufficient lunt of money in payment for the publication of the notice from layers to pay the reasonable value of the services rendered, it cannot take the benefit of the plaintiff's labor and material, and escape liability upon the plea of lack of authority upon the part of the aurer. To allow it to deprive the plaintiff of his property in the iner sought, and under the circumstances shown, would be to coun - ince action on the part of a county which would be considered ;sly reprehensible upon the part of an individual, we cannot permit i spoliation." In another place the opinion refers to the fact that no proof was made by Miles as to the value of the service ren - dered, and in the last paragraph of the -opinion the court said: r.'e are of the opinion that where there is no contract, the statutory cannot tfm laclo be taken as the measure of damages." Now just what the court meant when it said "the reason - able value which the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this case would seem to be the actual cost of rendering the ser - vices and furnishing the material necessary, including all expenses incurred but excluding profits," is not plain. As I view it, the reasonable value of the service is not the mere cost of setting up the notice and the expense incident to the actual publication of the same. Many other things enter into it, the cost of publishing a valid legal notice in a newspaper, the cost of maintaining the printing plant, the interest on the investment, and the maintenance of a legal newspaper, are some of the elements that enter into </seg>
            <seg id="p399">297 the consideration of what is the value of the ren dered. Just what view the court will take on the neasvit damages in this case is difficult to ascertain. One feature of this case has been entirely overlooked, and that is that Miles published two notices, one in .Inly and another in October. The niandamu &lt; case involved the July notice only. There was room for difference of opinion aa to whether or not the county hoard had lrtiide a designation. â– The district court decided that no designation had been made. The supreme court decided that there was a d - nation, fast, as I understand it, the only question presented was regarding the notice published in July. The county board met in its regular meeting in July. It had notice and knowledge of the action of the treasurer in designating a newspaper other than the one that the county board had attempted to designate. With this knowledge before them, with knowledge that the district court had decided that no designation had been made by the county board, and with full power to act in the premises, the county board did not make any further designation of the paper in which the October notice was to be published. If the board had acted there could have been no question regarding the notice that was to be published in October. It looks to me as though their failure to act estops the county from claiming that the treasurer did not have the right to designate the paper in which the October notice was to be published. At the time the treasurer made this designation in October the judgment of the district court with reference to the first notice was in full force and effect. It cannot be said that the treasurer acted in bad faith in making this second designation. Neither can it be said that Mr. Miles was not warranted in accepting the work and performing the I No matter what view I may take of this matter, the facts e that Miles made a legal publication of these notict e county.

Nobody but Miles rendered this service. The court has decided that he is entitled to compensation. It ought not to be difficult for the county board to ascertain the reason - able value of the service rendered. The county has col - lected full legal rates, and if it can settle with Miles for tthan full legal rates the difference between what it pays and what they collect is clear profit to the county.
