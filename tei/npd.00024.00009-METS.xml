Shallenberger Governor of the State of Nebraska Dear Sis: In conformity with the provisions of Section 4554 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for the year 1909, I have the honor to transmit, here - with, a detailed statement of the affairs of the Oil Inspection Department for the year 1909, beginning January 1st, and ending December 31st, of said year. Very respectfully, Arthur F. Mullen, State Inspector of Oils </seg>

            <seg id="p005">STATE INSPECTOR OF OILS 5 Report of State Inspector of Oils for the Year 1909 During the year, all the old oil inspection laws were repealed. An entire new law on this subject was passed by the last legislature. It is not necessary to discuss at length the reasons for remodeling the oil inspection laws. It is sufficient to say that the old law, imperfect and deficient when passed, had been amended and patched up until it was contradictory in its provisions, uncertain and indefinite in its meaning, inadequate to the needs and wants of the people and the state. While no notice has been taken, and but little has been said about the changes made in the oil inspection laws, those who are advised, know that the new inspection law is one of the most important acts of the last legis - lature. The general public do not know that this act saved more money to the people of this state than any other single law passed by the legislature. The new law preserved all that was good in the old one. It added additional provisions, making the law capable of enforcement. It nearly doubled the revenues derived from this department. Among the important changes are the following: It made this a real executive department of which your Excellency is the head. In the opinion of leading lawyers, the oil inspection department never legally existed until the present law was passed. It has been urged that the old law was an attempt to create an executive depart - ment by legislative enactment. The present law imposes the same reg - ulations and rules on this department that are common to the other executive departments of the state. It provides that all claims shall be audited before the same are paid; requires that monthly and annual reports be made; provides when the surplus inspection fees shall V&gt;f paid ti&gt; the State Treasurer. The powers and duties are made clear and plain. Under the provisions of the new act, the officers of this department have power to make the necessary inspections and to enforce the rulings made by the department. For many years, the railroad companies in the state, with one exception, refused to pay any inspection fejes. Generally, these companies refused to allow the inspectors to inspect any of the od» used by them. Their con - tention was that the inspection law provided tor the inspection of oil that was to be sold. As these companies used the oil brought into the state by them, they contended that the law did not provide for an inspection of it. The records of this department show that no inspect! 0 " 8 were made of the oils used by the following companies; Chicago »fe Nortf! wes tern. Missouri Pacific, Chicago, St. Piul, Minneapolis A Omaha, and tliP Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad ariowei! the in - spectors to make inspections, but refused to pay the inspection fees. T ne Union Pacific Railroad Company, under an agreement with this depart- </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 ANNUAL REPORT merit, allowed the inspectors to inspect one car each month. The com - pany paid for the inspections made. Because of a lack of power in the law, this department was unable to compel these companies to comply with its provisions. The question of whether or not the inspection fees can be collected has not yet been settled. During the year 1909 only one car was inspected for a railroad company prior to the time that the new inspection law went into effect. This in - spection was made on January 5th, 1909. for the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, car No. 7361. The inspection fees, amounting to $19.20 have not been paid. All other inspection fees for the year have been paid. On December 14th, 1909, a statement of the uncollected in - spection fees due to this department from the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company and the Union Pacific Railroad Company was trans - mitted to W. T. Thompson. Attorney General. The statement included the car mentioned above and all other delinquent inspections that appeared of record in this office. This statement shows that the amount due from the Chicago. Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company is $590.50 and from the I'nion Pacific SI 1.70. The Attorney General has been requested to in - stitute proceedings to collect these amounts, if, in his judgment, these fees can be recovered. The present law went into effect on April 1st, 1909. Since that time, the railroad companies have allowed all oils used by them to be inspected and have promptly paid the inspection fees. From April 1st to December 31st, 1909, the various railroad companies in the state paid to this depart - ment, the sum of $1271.15 for inspections made. The old law provided for a flash test of kerosene and a gravity test of gasoline. The flash test is, in effect, a safety test, while the specific gravity test is in the nature of a quality test. The present law preserves the flash test of kerosene, but, in addition, requires a specific gravity test. At the present time, there is not only a safety test of kerosene, but a quality test as well. Experience has shown that both of these tests are necessary. Kerosene may have a very high flash test, and at the same time be of a very poor quality. The tests provided for in the present law require not only that kerosene can be used with safety but at the same time, that it be of at least a fair quality. The specific gravity of oils is ascertained with an instrument known as the Beaume Hydrometer. This instrument, in effect, registers the weight of the oils. The heavy oils are of low gravity; he lighter oils of a higher gravity. The specific gravity of kerosene vari«* from 42 degrees to 50 degree*; the gravity of gr.soline varies from 62 degrees to 85 degrees. The law providing ior the inspection of gf*ft*»» was passed in 1897. That law provided thi;t gasoline, to be sold in this ntate, must have a specific gravity of at leant 68 degrees as measured by tne Beaume Hydrometer. The present law provides for this same inspectior . but changes the test from «8 dagNBs to 62 degrees. This change is the important part of the new Uw. By reason of this change, the great oil fields of Kansas and Okla - k'jnia have been opened to the gasoline users of this state. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">STATE INSPECTOR OF OILS 7 The petroleums in the different oil fields differ in weight. Generally speaking, the petroleums from the Kansas and Oklahoma oil fields are heavier than those of the eastern states. Because of this difference in the petroleums, the gasoline and kerosene made from Kansas and Oklahoma petroleums are heavier than the gasoline and kerosene made from the petroleums of the eastern states. It is difficult to make a gasoline out of Kansas or Oklahoma petroleum, in paying quantities, above 66 degrees. Ordinarily, these gaso - lines have a specific gravity of from 62 to. 65 degrees. Gasoline, in paying quantities can be made out of eastern petroleums up to and even above 70 degrees. The former gasoline inspection act provided that no gasoline of less than 68 degrees could be sold in this state. This provision absolutely prohibited the sale of Kansas and Oklahoma gasoline in Nebraska. The test required was so high that these oils could not comply with it. As a result of this, all of the gasoline used in Nebraska prior to the first of April, 1909, was shipped from the eastern part of the United States, most of it from Pennsylvania. This meant a long freight haul which added from two to five cents a gallon to the original cost of the gasoline. The law, in effect, directed all users of gasoline to purchase eatsern oils. It prohibited our neighboring state of Kansas from selling one of its principal products in the markets of this state. It compelled the people of this state to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnecessary freight charges. By requiring all gasoline users in the state to use 68 degree gasoline, it created a demand and increased the value of 68 degree gasoline. By closing the markets of this state to Kansas gasoline, it in effect, reduced the value of that product. Your attention is called to the effect the present law had on the price of gasoline. The day it went into effect, the wholesale price of gasoline was reduced 2|c per gallon. Since that time, the average reduction in the whole - sale price of gasoline in this state has been 2Jc less per gallon than it was for the same period in 1908. As shown by table No. VII, from January 1st to March 31st, 1909, none of the gasoline used in this state came from Kansas or Oklahoma. Since the present law went into effect, practically all of the gasoline used came from those states. From April 1st to December 31st, 1909, 6,332,829 gallons of Kansas and Oklahoma gasoline were inspected by this department. The public saved 2Jc on each gallon. The total saving for the period of nine mouths is $158,320.72. This amount is an actual saving to the gasoline users of Nebraska. All things considered, the present inspection law will save at least a quarter of a million dollars annually to the people of this state. In view of the results of this law, it is surprising that there was op - position to its passage. Certain lobbyists appeared before the legislature and attempted to defeat the change in the tests of gasoline. These men made an effort to convince the legislature that it would be detrimental and injurious to the people of Nebraska if a law was passed allowing western gasoline to be sold in the state. Table No. VII shows that practically all of the gasoline sold in the state, after the law passed, came from Kansas and Oklahoma. The ratio in favor of these states was 74 to 1. The work - ngs of this law is a complete answer to the arguments made against it. The </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 ANNUAL REPORT policy and the wisdom of the legislature in passing this law has been vin - dicated. No other single law passed by the legislature has been so beneficial to the public. In addition to the saving made to the public, the revenue feature of this office is important. Tables No. V and VI show the comparative amount of inspections made and the comparative amounts paid to the State Treasurer. During the year 68,763 more barrels of oil were inspected than in 1908. The total amount paid to the State Treasurer during the year is $17,425.60. This is $3,926.45 more than was paid in 1908. Adding to this amount, the cash on hand derived from inspections for 1909 makes a net increase in the receipts of the office of $5,174.70 over the year 1908, about thirty-nine per cent. In addition to the net increase in the earnings during the year, it was necessary to purchase a new supply of books and blanks. The old records and blanks could not be used because of the changes in the law. It was also necessary to make permanent improvements. These items are as follows: Cost of printing new books and blanks, est $200.00 Map 2.55 Glass for desk 4.00 Door sign 3.00 Chairs for office " 33 60 Stencils 199.73 Hydrometers and Foster cups 191 .46 Wiring office 60.00 Carpeting office 70 . 51 New filing case 70 . 50 $844 15 Including the foregoing as a part of the earnings of the office during the year, the net increase over 1908 is nearly $6,000.00. Present information indicates that this department, after paying all expenses, will contribute more than $40,000.00 to the revenues of the state during the present bi - ennium. During recent years the inspection of barrel oil has increased materially. In nearly all cases the inspection' of barrel oil costs the department more than the inspection fees. An effort was made to compensate the state in part by increasing the inspection on single barrels to 25c. Table No. Ill shows that twenty-five cent inspection fees were paid on sixty-nine barrels and fifteen cent inspection fees on 848 barrels. By reason of having an additional inspector, the department has been able to promptly inspect the oils shipped into the state. This is very important, especially to those who have no storage tanks. If the inspection is made promptly, demurrage charges are reduced and the necessity of unloading and storing the oil is avoided. While it costs the department something to make the inspection of barrel oil, no changes should be made in the law in this respect. Primarily, this department is not for the purpose of producing revenue. The pro - duction of revenue is merely an incident. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">STATE INSPECTOR &lt;&gt;K OILS 9 During the year but few accidents have Ixt-n re|&gt;orted. Matt of these were caused by the thoughtless and careless mm of gasoline It ought to be borne in mind that all gasoline is dangerous. The higher the test, the more dangerous the oil. Our laws prescribe the methods of handling gasoline. All barrels, casks, packages and cans containing gasoline should lx&gt; painted a vermilion red and have the word "Gasoline ' plainly printed thereon in English. In several instances, our attention has been called to the fact that those dealing in gasoline have neglected to comply with these provisions. The law governing this subject is a general statute. It is the duty of all citizens of the state to see to it that these provisions are complied with. The present oil inspection law has made ample provision so that this department will have notice before any uninspected oil is sold or used. One section makes it the duty of all persons, firms, partnerships and corporations receiving uninspected oils to immediately notify the State In&gt;|&gt;eetor of Oils. Another section imposes a penalty on vendors, manufacturers and dealers who sell or attempt to sell unins[)ected oil anil still another section provide - a penalty for any person who knowingly uses uninspected oils. The public, generally, do not know of the existence of these provision- \ 'hese are known, it will be impossible for any uninspected oils to be used in the state. It is probable that these provisions are. in a large measure. rt&gt;s|M&gt;nsible for the increase in the revenues of the department. The change of administration in this department took place on January 20th, 1909. On that day the present state inspector succeeded A. B. Allen. At the same time R. E. Harmon, T. J. O'Connor. K. .1. Pratt. M. ,1. Bouse and Francis Colfer were appointed deputy inspectors. All but Mr. Harmon immediately assumed their duties. Owing to the illness of Mr. Harmon, he has been unable to act. On the 25th day of January, 1909, L. B. Arnot was appointed in his place. On May 13th, 1909, A. J. O'Malley was appointed a deputy inspector. He immediately began the discharge of his duties. During the month of January, 1909, Miss Nina Ryan was appointed secre - tary and stenographer. While the new law has been of great value, still the splendid record of this department could not have been made without the honest, efficient and careful assistance of those connected with it. Tables I to XIII following give a summary of the business of the depart - ment for the year. A copy of the monthly statements, approved by your Excellency, and which have been filed with the State Auditor are attached. All the original accounts and receipts have been filed with the monthly statements in the auditor's office. Respectfully submitted, Arthur F. Mullen, State Inspector of Oils. </seg>
