Mr. George Jackson, Secretary, State Board of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Jackson: My son and I planned to drive to Lincoln for the annual meeting' of the State Board of Agriculture but owing to the heavy snow fall and bad condition of the roads we are afraid to risk it and ask that I be excused from attending this meeting. I stand . ready to do anything possible to help solve the big problem that confronts the Board of Managers and Officers. I trust that a way will be found to continue without interruption the great work the State Fair has done for the people of Nebraska. </seg>

I have been laid up for four weeks myself with an injured leg and may not be able to attend the annual meeting, however, I haven't given up hopes of attending, &lt; and if it is possible for me to be out will be there. Kindly excuse my absence if I'm not able to attend. Yours truly,' GATES LILLEY. ■ Minden, Nebr., Jan. 4, 1932. Nebr. State Board of Agriculture, Geo. Jackson, Sec., Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sirs: Please accept my resignation as a member of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, as I am getting too old to be of any assistance to you. I feel it is the obligation of a member to attend the meet - ings and being not physically able I deem it my duty to ask- acceptance of my resignation. It seems to me it would be better to have younger . men take hold and help the program along as we did thirty-flve years ago, when the State Fair had no home and was bankrupt; but we cook hold with courage and by cutting expenses here and there we managed to pull through, thus helping to make the Fair what it is today. I do not wish to criticize the management of the past as we all live and learn but I do think you are making a wise move when you cut out paying expenses of board members at meetings, etc. How - ever, I do not think this is the only place a saving could be made inasmuch as there seems to be a goodly number of leaks in the whole proposition. As you know I have always been a booster of Class F and have always thought of it as the foundation of the State Fair. I believe a complete revision of the premium list in Class F could be made so as to save the board a considerable amount of money and still have more contentment in Agriculture Hall, but such revision would require some study and reconciliation by men of experience from the three agricultural districts. </seg>

            <seg id="p010">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By MR. DWIGHT P. GRISWOLD: Mr. President and Gentle - men: I think all of you appreciate the fact that the newspapers of this state have been some of the best friends of the State Fair, and the State Board of Agriculture. I am very glad to be privileged to bring you just a brief message from the Loup Valley Editorial Association, which met in its district convention at Grand Island. They passed a resolution in which the newspaper men of that part of the state expressed their desire that their part of the newspaper fraternity and other newspapers take steps in 1932 to see that the newspapers of this state, referring especially to what we call the "country papers" to take steps to carry publicity for the State Fail - without any charges, and that there be expressed to the State Board of Agriculture and the officials of the State Fair their best regards. I want also to say that the Nebraska State Press Association will meet in its convention next month, and while I don't know exactly what attitude that convention will take, I would, not be at all sur - prised but what the State Association will adopt the same kind of a policy and expression toward you men who have this problem in hand and send you their best wishes and aid for this coming year. I thank you. By PRESIDENT REED: While we are waiting for the Creden - tials Committee to report, so we can go ahead with official action on various matters, I might explain — as perhaps some of the men don't understand — a situation that has arisen. During the last Legislature — in that session — there arose a neces - sity for having the state re-districted for election of Congressmen, to conform to the new Federal decennial re-apportionment by Congress. In this task one district (The Old Fourth) was cut off, which makes it likewise necessary for us to change our Constitution; so we can take the members out of one district, as heretofore grouped, and scatter them into the other (new) districts as now arranged by State Statutes. So I will read to you the distribution of the present member - ship as it groups through the new districts. FIRST DISTRICT: W. B. Banning; W. T. Parkinson; L. C. Chapin; R. C. Johnson; C. H. Gustafaon; T. H. Wake; and Frank Shubert — seven. SECOND DISTRICT: A. H. Miller; Gates Lilley; and E. V. Noyes — three. THIRD DISTRICT: Chas. Graff; A. W. Lamb; J. S. Golder; R. Widle; and Henry F. Kuhl — five. FOURTH DISTRICT: H. J. McLaughlin; Perry Reed; E. Sinner; E. J. Mitchell; R. R. Vance; Chas. Newcomer;- (and seat held here - tofore by T. B. Keedle); and George Jackson — eight. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 11 FIFTH DISTRICT: C. S. Hawk; Irl D. Tolen; Chas. Dobry; A. W. Atkins; E. R. Purcell; and J. A. Boyd — six. Total — 29. Next you will probably be interested m a review of how those whose terms expire this year group into the various districts: FIRST DISTRICT: Banning; Parkinson; Chapin; Johnson — four. SECOND DISTRICT: Miller and Lilley — two. THIRD DISTRICT: Golder and Reed — two. FOURTH DISTRICT: McLaughlln; Reed and (Keedle) va - cancy — three. FIFTH DISTRICT: Atkins; Purcell and Boyd — three. Total to elect — 14. There will be necessity of electing some one m the place of Mr. Keedle, but it happens his term expired at this, time, so that will fall m with the regular grouping. By PRESIDENT REED: I would say that the Revision Com - mittee has spent considerable time on this subject and we have viewed it from a good many different angles, but we finally came to a con - clusion, we have ready a proposal to present that we think will rem - edy one inequality as it now presents itself; that is: as now lined up the Fourth District would have seven members — including m its boundaries the vacancy m Mr. Keedle's post, and the Third District now has but five members. We talked this over, as I said, from many angles and came to the conclusion that as Mr. Keedle's term expired at this time and some new man will be elected to succeed him, per - haps the best way to equalize this situation at this time, without affecting the re-election of any present member would be to change the number, as between Third and Fourth Districts at this time, and we propose the future distribution as between various districts m this manner: FIRST — seven. SECOND — three. THIRD — -"six (instead of five as now). FOURTH — seven (instead of eight as now). FIFTH — six. Total — 29. We must wait for the Credentials Committee to report before we can proceed to any action on this, or other matters. We are not m position to transact business until we have their report. Announcement made of meeting of Short Circuit m Room 335. By MR. EMERSON R. PURCELL: I haven't anything to say ex - cept words of endorsement for the action of the Revision Committee </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 12 as to this re-districting of membership of our Board. I have given the matter such a small amount of study, but it seems to me vhe Committee have done a pretty good piece of work. ' They have dis - tributed m a very fair and just manner. The present location of ihe Board is unfair and I don't know how it would be possible to revise this and make as small a changing about as has been thus made. It seems to me to be pretty well done, and as I look it over I feel the committee has done a pretty good piece of. work. By PRESIDENT REED: I admit there has been quite a little bit of discussion here m regard to where Hall County should be sit - uated — as to whether it should be m the Fourth District or the Fifth District. I think Mr. Purcell went to the office of the Secretary of the State and found a map there which placed it m the new Fifth District; but we find the Session Laws provide it belongs m the Fourth District. By MR. PURCELL: Yes, I found a map on the wall that had it m what has proven to be the wrong district. I suggest we might ask the Secretary of State to change his map to place this county In the correct district. By PRESIDENT. REED: If anyone elße has any suggestion he wants to get out of his system, now is a good time and we would like to hear from you at this time. Or if there are any questions you want to ask. By MR. E. R. PURCELL: Why can't we have the Committee on Credentials report now, and have a motion to adopt their report as far as it can go now, and they can later finish up their work and make a supplemental report? By MR. CHARLES GRAFF: On behalf of Credentials Commit - tee, I will state that we find a number of counties where, so far, we haven't received the Credentials. We can report on what we have and as we reach those various counties, if the gentlemen representing them are present they may come up and show they are entitled to seats m this convention. We will try and give you the names of those who are regular delegates, and their alternates, as the same have been reported to us, and perhaps any necessary corrections can be offered as we proceed: (The roster as called, and as corrected during course of the pro - ceeding, constituted the following roll call and roster of delegates and alternates, to-wit: ) </seg>

            <seg id="p015">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 15 Now, Mr. Chairman, we have the same situation again we had last year m regard to Frontier County. The Eustis Agricultural Society and Corn Show, at Eustis, Ne - braska, have filed a report here, showing they held a fair this last year, 1931, paid out considerable money m premiums, and this was all done a year ago, but this organization at that time denied their request and refused them, and the proceedings of the annual 1931 meeting of the State Board of Agriculture m this matter shows, and I believe I will just read you what transpired here at that time In regard to this matter. In connection with this, that report shows: By PRESIDENT LAMB: Has the Credentials Committee any further report to make; if so, we would like to hear from them at this time? By CHAIRMAN CHAS. GRAFF: Mr. President of this conven - tion, the Credentials Committee has nothing to report m addition to what it reported yesterday, with one exception. There is a report m here from a fair called Agricultural Society and Corn Show of Frontier County, located at Eustis, Nebraska. I understand a similar report was made a year ago. There was nothing done then about it. I believe, gentlemen, that this convention should take some action on that report. I understand this Board has not the right — no auth - ority legally, to admit any dual agricultural society of any county m the State of Nebraska, where there is one already existing that has been recognized by this Board. But I think our organization should go on record as to what disposition has been made or should be made of this Frontier County Agricultural Society and Corn Show. There is also a protest from Stockville, stating that the Society there is a member of the State Board of Agriculture and they pro - test against the Eustis Society being admitted to this Board. The Stockville people also tell us that the matter is now m court, so I think it is up to us to make some disposition of that report from the Eustis fair. I do not like to make that motion but we should take action. By PRESIDENT LAMB: We should have a motion before the House, m order to act upon it. By CHAIRMAN GRAFF: Then I would move that the applica - tion of the Eustis Society and their report filed here be rejected, and that they be so notified. Motion duly seconded. The same was put to a vote and carried. Again we feel that this year we must recognize the protest of Stockville and recognize also the provisions of law upon this subject. So our report is that this application and their report be likewise rejected. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 16 By MR. CEDAR, of Boone County: Mr. Olsen does not seem vo be here today. Mr. Widle and I are here. By MR. MCLAUGHLIN, of Hall County: I notice there is no report for Hall County. I believe perhaps it is due to the fact vhat we just recently made a change m the office of secretary. That is followed the fact we have not yet been able to get hold of the old secretary's books. I supposed he had completed his report and sent it m. By MR. PURCELL, of Custer County: I move that Mr. Mc- Laughlin be seated as an accredited delegate for Hall County. Motion seconded. Vote taken and the motion was carried. By MR. LAMB, of Boone County: I likewise move that Mr. Cedar be seated as accredited delegate from Nance County. Motion seconded. Vote taken and motion carried. By PRESIDENT REED: I think, perhaps, there should be a motion to adopt the Credentials Committee report, and that they be continued m the harness longer. By MR. LAMB, Boone "County: I make the motion that the report of this Committee be accepted as so far made, and that they continue at their work for the remainder of these sessions. Motion seconded. Vote taken and motion carried. By MR. GRAFF &gt; Years ago we took action designed to prevent any further instances of a dual fair m a county where there is a fair m existence. A year ago we took that same action, now, we do so again. We can't follow that course and take their money. I move they (Eustis fair) be so advised, tTielr report and money be returned. Motion seconded. Vote taken and motion carried. By PRESIDENT REED: I think the next order Of business will be to take care of the change In the Constitution, m regard to re - districting. On Page 13, third section, it provides the "Members of the State Board of Agriculture shall be elected by Congressional Districts." Then the listing of proper number for each congressional district, as they now read: FIRST — five; SECOND — three; THIRD five; FOURTH — five; FIFTH — five, and SIXTH — six, be changed to con - form to the new apportionment. By MR. W. B. BANNING, Cass County: I move that Section Three of the Constitution be amended (m by-law, Page 13 to read as follows: m respect to number from each district) : FIRST — seven; SECOND — three; THIRD — six; FOURTH — seven, and FIFTH — six, making total of 29.

THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS Ladies and Gentlemen: The year 1931 was a momentious one in' the history of county and state fairs throughout the whole country. Few fairs found a balance on the right side of the ledger at the end of the season. While our own State Fair was one of the hardest hit, we were not alone among the state fairs of the middle west circuit. The Iowa State Fair wound up the season with a deficit of $67,000.00, but on Wednesday during the Fair when it was evident they were facing a deficit. Governor Turner called a meeting of the Board and trans - ferred $75,000.00 over to the credit of the Association so they could pay up their bills. The Secretary of the Arkansas State Fair writes us they went behind so far that they will be unable to hold a fair unless the governor calls a special session of the Legislature to ap - propriate money to pay up the deficit. Kansas State Fair run behind, also Oklahoma. When the figures were tabulated at the close of the Nebraska State Fair we found Instead of an attendance of 439,382 reached in 1930, the attendance fell to 250,382 and the receipts de - creased from $139,452.41 in 1929 to $62,369.15; concession receipts were reduced from $38,824.39 in 1930 to $26,227.53. While we had reduced the cost of our attractions and expenses $26,000 under 1930 we did not have the money to pay all our bills and on account of the financial condition of the country and an opinion of the Attorney General that the Board of Managers had no legal right to borrow </seg>
            <seg id="p019">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE money pledging the property of the State Fair, we are unable to raise the money to pay our bills. We feel that our condition has been brought about in a measure by our having to pay from receipts of the Fair— maintenance, grandstand, etc. In 1929 we found that parts of the. old grandstand was becoming unsafe and we undertook a plan of financing the building of a grandstand out of receipts owing to the falling off of receipts we find we are unable to keep up the payments. ■ Since its completion we have paid out of receipts 546,109.29 and we still owe some for 1931. We believe that this Is the only State Fair that has taken upon themselves the building of a grandstand out of receipts of the Fair. During the last seven years we have paid out of State Fair receipts for maintenance and per - manent improvements in excess of appropriations from the Legisla - ture the sum of $173,551.77. We have been criticized for' spending so much money during the last year. I think I am safe in saying that had the Board of Managers known a year ago what the receipts of the Fair would be that we would have been unable to buy attractions and keep our expenses down to a figure where we could have paid out Some of our state officials and others have criticized us for issuing passes This is a subject that has been cussed and discussed by state fair officials for years and I do not know of a state fair that has done away with them. In the past we have admitted all children under twelve years of age, many of the state fairs only admit them free one day We have issued passes to all 4-H Club boys and girls, entrants in the High School Band contest, the essay contest, rural school chorus and the spelling contest. These passes are given to these boys and girls so they may have the opportunity of visiting and taking part in this educational program for the upbuilding of our future citizenship While the use of these passes in some instances are abused we feel it is worthwhile. Tickets are Issued to the 392 newspapers in the state, we feel that we get many hundreds of dollars of advertising space in this way that would cost us much more if we paid for it at regular advertising rates. We also issue passes to the president and secretary of each county fair in the state and to the county agents, state officers and members of the Legislature. I think I am safe in saying that if we cut out these passes the advertising and support we receive in this way would cost several times what the tickets amount to. However, we must take steps to stop the misuse of these tickets. The next proposition I wish to mention is what steps must be taken towards holding a Fair in 1932. I feel that it will be neces - sary to make reductions in our expenses all along the line. The Board has spent four days in studying where these reductions might be made. First, we cut salaries and wages twenty per cent. We have worked out a proposal which we will offer you of a cut of twenty </seg>
            <seg id="p020">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to twenty-five per cent in premiums and purses in all classes. We believe we can, under present conditions of the country, reduce our expenses possibly $40,000.00. In doing this We hope to have the loyal support of every Fair man, exhibitor and employee. We have also considered the cutting of the Fair down to a six day Fair as we feel we can save considerable expense in that way. ■ In conclusion I wish to thank you county fair men, members of the State Board, the Board of Managers, our worthy Secretary and his able assistants for their loyal support and cooperation. By CHAIRMAN TOLEN: What will you do with the President's report, gentlemen? By MR. E. R. PURCELL: I move that the report of the Presi - dent be accepted. Motion seconded. Vote taken and motion carried. By MR. REED: Now as we come to the next order of business, on account of Mr. Jackson's recent illness, his reports will be incor - porated in the printed proceedings. By MR. GEORGE JACKSON: Mr. President and Gentlemen: 1 am sorry indeed it is necessary for me to ask for extension of time to print my report. This is ine first time this has happened to me, i.ut most of you gentlemen are aware that about the time I should have been busy on my report, I was confined to my room pretty closely. It would not have been a pleasant one if I had been able to present it today. On one side it would have showed that we put on the best State Fair that has ever been held in Nebraska. The people who were there will universally tell you that. On the other side of the page we have a sad story of how the attendance and receipts were both cut down; the latter from $124,000 to $62,000. But we know that we will recover from. that blow and get back again. Any fellow who says fairs In this country are on the downhill grade had better just stop and think. We live in an era — in a section of the country that consists of twelve agricultural states, containing one-ltfth of the population of the United States but which produces one-tenth of the rice; one-third of the corn and. grains; more beef and pork than they can use in ten years. And in this section, agricultural fairs will not continue to go downgrade. In five years from now we will be holding just as big fairs as we held in the past few years, say in 1929. I want to thank you people — all of these men that did so much, who have taken bo much work off my hands, when I seemed to be so sick. I didn't seem really to be so sick. I just couldn't breathe, but that is the last thing I was looking for. I didn't seem to be bo sick. When these fellows came down and visited me, it cheered me up, but I didn't know what kind of an excuse to make. I wasn't eating much, I wasn't sleeping so good, but I want to thank them </seg>
            <seg id="p021">REPORT "OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for they helped me a lot. I know people we are going to bear up through this hard jolt we got. We are getting out of it somehow. SECRETARY'S REPORT FOR 1931 The 1931 State Fair will be remembered as the most successful Fair ever held from an educational viewpoint, the exhibits were most outstanding and to the satisfaction of our guests, but the financial success was disastrous, the total indebtedness at this time is about $88,217.95. Of this amount was an item of $20,000 carried over from 1930; $12,500 due on the grandstand debenture bonds; $2,092.59 due on the automobile building; $15,828.55 due on maintenance bills not covered by state appropriation and $37,796.81 State Fair deficit. The gate receipts were cut at least fifty per cent, the grandstand receipts were cut from $48,646.55 In 1930 to $19,572.40. The extreme heat was responsible for the most part, temperature averaged 98 degrees throughout the entire Fair. While we will prepare our budget for the 1932 Fair under quite a handicap, the Board of Managers are inspired with the cooperation received from those we are indebted to and many others, and will go on in a spirit of enthusiasm that will succeed under any conditions. We may look forward to the State Fairs in the agricultural sections of the country to make progress according to the growth and pros - perity of the state it represents. As we travel over Nebraska we are inspired with its wonderful resources and its production record of table commodities. We pro - duce 7.29% of the wheat of the United States, 6.74% of corn, 8.5% of the hogs, 5.2% of cattle, almost 10.% of the sugar and after providing our people the allotted amount we still have a large surplus of each. When the depression is over and prosperity strikes around the corner it will meet agriculture on the main highway, holding the right of way. It has taken the politicians a long time to find out that permanent prosperity must start with agriculture. A somewhat studious investigation of the history of agriculture never fails to show this undeniable fact that there is more of agri - culture recorded in the literature of the world from the seventh day of creation down to the present time than all other business and pro - fessions combined. The world began with agriculture and all was agriculture in the beginning. Agriculture was God's own handiwork and throughout the ages of this planet it has been ever fundamental, first in importance, first in dignity and should always be first in the respect and the affections of all human beings in town, city and country. Before we can gain permanent prosperity it will be neces - sary for the farmer to be prosperous, start at the bottom and build </seg>
            <seg id="p022">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE up and not at the top and slide down. Under the present economic conditions I have no faith in legislating prosperity to the farmer, it is difficult to make a success of any proposition with about 60 r /r .of the politicians working against you. It takes too much of your energy to combat the opposition. With the Bible filled from Genesis to Revelations with the narra - tives of farm resources and farming methods covering thousands of years it is strange that any human being, politician or not, with sufficient brain power to keep him out of the bug house could fail to recognize the sterling worth and up-standing dignity of farming and farmers. Every thinking person knows that an intelligent pro - ductive people on the land is very much to be desired in this country, that a prosperous people on the land strengthens the entire fabric of national life, that prosperity on the land transmits prosperity to all the people and that unless the farm people of America are intelligent, productive and prosperous the nation can not permanently prosper. Ultimately we all go up with the farmer or we all go down with him. I will now present the Nebraska State Fair in the various depart - ments as it appeared this year. Horse Department Arrangements made to stable the draft horses on exhibit were wholly inadequate and when the entries began to flock in the superin - tendent of this department went scurrying for more space. It was the best exhibit made in many years. There were 100 more entries than in 1930. The patrons were well pleased with the exhibit and the judges were very complimentary in their remarks about the quality of the show. "A fine show," was their verdict. Belgians and Perch - erons predominated in the show. The number of mules shown evi - denced the growing popularity of these animals on the farm. Pony Department One of the places of interest is the Pony Barn, both for children and grownups. It was one of the strong classes this year. Horse Pulling Contest The Horse Pulling Contest was held In front of the grandstand in the forenoon so as not to interfere with the racing program. Very strong competition in this class. The winners this year Were as fol - lows: Light Class — team weighing less than 3,000 pounds — 1st and 2nd to P. H. McGill of Wlsner, 3rd to Lawrence Clark of Benson, 4th to August Frank of Walton, 5th to Donald McGuin of Union. In the heavy class for teams weighing more than 3,000 pounds — 1st to W. M. Hunt of Chester, 2nd to O. M. Scherer of Pllger, 3rd to Walker Brothers of Waverly, 4th to Arthur Hansen of Aurora; 5th to Clarence Campbell of Trumbull. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Cuttle Department . A few years ago when the cattle barn was built the management took a good deal of good natured criticism for building such a large barn. Their vision of what was to come was eminently justified this year when the exhibit of cattle overflowed all exhibit space. Naturally such a large gathering of the cream of Nebraska and other state herds drew great attention and gave the 1931 show the name of being the best ever held on the Nebraska grounds. Altogether the revelation of Nebraska wealth in cattle was a fine tribute to a great state whose resources are great and even if the prices are poor and some of the people are depressed, according to the report. from our State Agricul - ture Statistician over a ten-year record of Nebraska's gross farm income reveals that 28.2% came from the sale of cattle and calves, 27.6% from the sale of hogs, 14% from the sale of wheat, 10% from the sale' of corn, 6.1% from the sale of butter fat, 5.9% from the sale of eggs and chickens and the balance from the sale of minor crops. Cattle and hogs alone contribute 55.8% of the- total gross farm income. The drastic reduction in price of these meat animals is the leading factor in the depression In Nebraska: Swine Department ' The exhibit of swine far exceeded last year. There were a total of 207 more pens needed to take care of the additional number of head brought this year. Some idea of the size of the exhibit can be gotten from these figures of pens used — Poland China 181 pens, Duroc Jersey 133 pens, Chester White 118 pens, Spotted Poland China 109 pens and Hampshire 105 pens. . Sheep and (ioat Department It is just in the last few years that Nebraska has become inter - ested in sheep but it has and it Is now one of the largest sheep feed - ing states in the union. So important a growing industry must be well represented at the Fair and it was this year with as fine a gathering of sheep as ever were exhibited on the grounds. The goats made a good showing although not as large as 1930 but the quality made up for the loss in number. Considerable atten - tion is being paid in this state to milking goats and were well shown in several classes. Poultryt Pigeons and Rabbits Poultry at the Fair has always been a good show and it was again this year, nearly every breed was represented. There was an increase In reservation of pens over last year and the quality of the show was excellent. Rabbits have been coming to the front In recent years; there was a wonderful exhibit of all breeds. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The pigeon show always attracts a good deal of attention. The superintendent said it was the largest and best show ever seen at the Fair. Agriculture and Horticulture There are a great many people who make a bee-line for Agricul - tural Hall when they enter the Fair Grounds. This year when they arrived at the huge building they got their usual thrill. The spaces wore all full and the annexes on the north and south had been com - mandeered to give additional space. County exhibits were unusually good and well shown. Many counties find the preparation of these immense exhibits valuable as advertising material. If there were drought conditions in Nebraska this year they were not reflected in the grain exhibits. The samples in the immense show window were as fine .as in other years and more numerous. The. dis - plays of apples, grapes and peaches were very good indeed. Each year the building gets smaller. The time will arrive soon when the imperative need foT the Fair will be increased show space for agricultural products. Already the spirit of competition in Nebraska agriculture has outgrown the quarters that a few years ago were thought adequate for many years to come. 4-H Club Work The outstanding feature of the Sunday program was the dedica - tion of the new 4-H Club Building, in fact it was the center of attrac - tion through the entire Fair. The program was as follows: W. H. Brokaw. Director of Extension Service, presiding. Invocation by Rev. E. A. Smith. Song — "America the Beautiful." led by Theodore Diers. Address — "Our Youth,"' by George Jackson, Secretary State Board of Agriculture. Song — "Follow the Gleam." by Seward County 4-H Clubs. Address — "Nebraska Is Proud," by Governor Charles Bryan. Song — "The Plowing Song," by Otoe County 4-H Club. Address — "University's Interest," by Chancellor E. A. Burnett. Song — "Dream - ing Song," by Lancaster County 4-H Clubs. Dedication of Building — George E. Farrell. Director Extension Work Mid-Western States, V. S. Department of Agriculture. Song — "My Nebraska," led by Theodore Diers. This wonderful building was made possible by an appropriation of $150,000 by the 1929 Legislature. This is conceded to be the largest and best equipped 4-H Club Building in the world. The 4-H Club Building was a bee hive throughout the entire Fair where over 447 beef calves were exhibited. 233 dairy calves, 500 swine, 58 head of sheep, and 591 head of poultry. Much interest was shown again this year in the Team demonstrations, judging contests, canning, cooking, and clothing exhibits. The song contest, style show and the health contest were strong classes in this department of the Fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The 4-H enrollment has been growing rapidly the last few years: The goal for this year is 10,750 members carrying 19,000 projects. Educational Department The Educational department has been demanding more space for several years. They got it this year. The west balcony of Agricul - tural Hall has added to the space used last year and year before. The results was a better displayed exhibit and more room to see it, And it was needed, we pause to remark. Give Nebraska schools a little better chance and they just step right up and take it. Superintendent Myers, with customary aggression, is now demanding the entire balcony space and we would not be a bit surprised if she got it before the Fair gets to be many years older. Nebraska schools never displayed to better advantage. It was a magnificent exhibit of the work of Nebraska youth. High School Hand Contest This department started out auspiciously several years and the management thought it would be a very popular feature of the Fair program. This year the competition was limited to two bands in Class C, one in Class B and one in Class A. Annual Kssay Contest The first annual essay contest was held in 1929 with fifty-six contestants representing about one-half of the state. Since that time much interest has been created in this contest. The prize winners for the first year were — Helen Morgan of Lincoln, first prize; Hazel Larson of Holdrege, second prize; Zola Baade of Ceresco, third prize; Edith Robertson of Eagle, fourth prize; and Alta Buckingham of Beaver Crossing, fifth prize. In 1930 the prize winners were William Spoon - hour of Fremont, first prize; Ruth Anderson of Walton, second prize; Loretta Obradovsky of Schuyler, third prize; Georgia Howe of Schuyler, fourth prize; and Cora Mae Briggs of Seward, fifth prize. In 1931 the winners were — Georgia Howe of Schuyler, first prize; Robert Spoonhour of Fremont, second prize; Mary Louise Winter of Beatrice, third prize; Lorene Ketterer of Lincoln, fourth prize; and Helen Roberts of Filley, fifth prize. Rural School Chorus On Sunday a great company of people were delighted with the first appearance of the Rural School Chorus. About 600 children appeared on Sunday afternoon and evening and delighted the com - pany who heard them. There were picked singers from rural schools from ten years up and the effect of their appearance was excellent as well as the harmony they made. Health Department Over six hundred patrons of the Fair were given a free health examination. This department is handled by the Nebraska State Medi - cal Association and much interest is being created. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Dairy Kxliibit Probably one individual exhibit which attracted as much atten - tion as any was the butter statue erected annually in the ice box at the east end of Agricultural Hall. The butter statue was in the form of a large butter map of Nebraska with the individual counties out - lined and their names inserted. "Nebraska Ranks 4th in Butter Pro - duction" was placed upon a large placard over the map. State Institutions People have come to look for the exhibits of state institutions. Samples of handiwork were shown at each booth and courteous attend - ants — frequently the- superintendent of the institution — was there to greet visitors and make them feel that they have or should have a vital interest in the work these state-owned and controlled places is doing. To many people this is the only point of contact with institu - tional work and management and it is a valuable one. Railroad Exhibits The Missouri Pacific again this year had a very Interesting exhibit showing their Utopia in the South and in Mexico. This was in the form of booth displays and pictures that were unique and effective. The Burlington showed one of its immense engines and three ot its modern passenger coaches. The coaches showed the modern methods of luxurious travel. Stock Yards Teams The six and eight-horse teams of the Chicago and Omaha Stock Yards have come to be as much a part of the Fair as the horse races. This year both teams were there and never failed each day to draw a big hand when they appeared in demonstrations on the track. The magnificent animals entertained hundreds of admirers every day in their quarters in the stables. Fish Exhibit Every year people visit the fish exhibit in Increasing numbers. The State Game and Parks Commission had a very complete display of Nebraska fish in their wall tanks and In the large open pond at the rear of the building. It never missed having a crowd during the busy periods of the day. Machinery The usual showing of farm implements and machinery was made. Superintendent Lilley said that he noticed fewer* of the old type of horse-drawn things, like, plows and cultivators, and more attention to engine-propelled or drawn implements. The size of the exhibit was about as usual and the hundreds of farmers looked in the show window and went home with the newest ideas in doing the farm work easily, economically and well. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Automobiles ' The taking over of the Automobile Building by the Fair manage - ment and the renting of space to exhibitors did not have the effect of reducing the number or quality of the displays. The large build - ing was lined as usual with new models of all the prominent makes and gave a fine chance to prospective purchasers to see the newest things for their inspection and choice. Bees and Honey Department The growth of bee culture in this state was reflected this year in the display of bees and honey which required greatly increased space in the Lincoln Building. A feature of the exhibit was daily demonstrations by an expert sent out by the national association of honey, producers. These focused attention on methods of using honey in the preparation of food. Honey is a rapidly increasing Nebraska product and a source of much income in a state where alfalfa, sweet clover and other honey yielding crops are being in - creased. Domestic Products Department The thrifty housewives of Nebraska still ply their domestic art in modern kitchens and display a degree of culinary skill that draw many exclamations of pleasure and wonder at the Fair this year. An unusually large amount of canned goods was shown and made a lovely display on the north balcony of Agriculture Hall. Needlework Long ago this department outgrew its space and this year addi - tional space was given on the north balcony of Agriculture Hall. All space was well filled with a fine display of needle work. Quilts pre - dominated and made a lovely showing of the art our grandmothers loved and excelled in. Some of the granddaughters displayed their ability this year to match the skill of their accomplished forebears. Fine Arts The Fine Arts Department was removed this year from the balcony of Agriculture Hall to the Lincoln Building. The move was none too soon. All the additional space available in the new place was utilized and an extensive showing of the work of Nebraska painters and artists was made. This department grows in size and popularity. It is a great incentive to young artists who are just starting the road to success and fame. Bird Show While the exhibitors in this department were all Lincoln fanciers, there was a better show than common and the number of birds shown was larger than in 1930. A larger number of people visited this show and liked it. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Camp Grounds Several thousand people proved again this year that camping on the grounds is the best and most economical way to see the Fair. There were seen cars from every neighbor state. Good friends and neighbors made* up a happy eight-day city and enjoyed the privileges provided for their comfort by the Fair management. Gates It is conceded that one of the most trying jobs of. the Fair is management of the gates. New problems arise there which take a high order of executive judgment. Superintendent Shubert and his helpers got things well organized early and the crowds were received and discharged with courtesy and efficiency, which added much to the success of the"l931 show. Auto Parking The addition of considerable parking space at the northeast corner of the grounds afforded a good deal of relief from parking congestion. The automobiles were handled very expeditlously as they entered the grounds and there were very few complaints of minor damages. A well organized parking force was responsible for the good record made in this department. Hoy Scouts Boy Scouts were on duty during the Fair and were a good' addi - tion to the public safety force. The youngsters never fail to get a courteous response to the courteous way in which they issue com - mands and enforce parking and police rules. Public Safety Department Men of the Public Safety Department are again to be congratulated for the courteous and efficient way they handled the crowds and reduced danger, congestion and confusion. They are a most important part of the Fair work. Hl-Y Boys Again the Hi-Y boys ushered in the amphitheatre. These boys came from all over the state, being hand picked for this work. They were efficient, courteous ushers. And while they were serving the Fair, they were also being entertained and instructed by Hi-Y leaders and treated to visits to Lincoln institutions. The boys look forward eagerly to duty at the Fair. They have a lot of fun and get some very important and useful instruction while they stay in Lincoln. Horseshoe Tournament Barnyard golf continues to be a popular, pastime in Nebraska, if the interest taken in the state horseshoe tournament is any criterion. This year there were about the us'ual number of pitchers .and their play was witnessed every session by an interested gallery. The crown </seg>

Midway Attractions Again Beckmann and Gerety's shows were on the midway. This is one Of the largest and best companies on the State Fair circuit and the quality of its entertainment and the variety of its rides and other features is unusually good. They served the midway visitors very well indeed. Nebraska State Fair on Wheels Lack of space forbids a detailed description of the magnificent parade — Nebraska State Fair on Wheels — that was the feature of Thursday, the seventh day. In a long line of these spectacles, this one was outstanding both for size and quality. For an hour and a quarter this parade moved before the grandstand and presented a rapid and striking picture of Nebraska — its soil, climate, livestock and human resources. Two outstanding features are mentioned. The Modern Woodmen of America turned out a large number of drill teams and marchers and presented a most interesting and inspiring evidence of the vigor of this fraternal order. The International Harvester Company had a procession of farm machinery which showed the development of harvesting from the cradle, sickle and first crude reaper down to the modern combine. Altogether the parade was outstanding for the quality of exhibits shown and for the precision with which it moved and displayed itself. The disappointing thing was that there was not a grandstand full of people to see this wonderful spectacle. Auto Knees The people who come to the Fair seem to continue to take to auto races and so for three days this year this form of entertainment was provided. No track records were broken but the drivers showed class and speed and gave the crowds many thrills. Horse Racing Best racing program ever held on the Nebraska State Fair Grounds, was the opinion of all horse loving people present. Con - tests were close and the time faster than ever before, seventeen heats were made in 2:10 or faster which is the best record ever made on the Lincoln track. The running races were pleasing to everyone. The jockeys were given to understand at the start that the races were not to be poky. Each race was pulled off without a moment's delay and all in all it was a very successful race program. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Entertainment For three years until this year the major entertainment number was a circus. This year the management chose to return to a miscel - laneous program. Thaviu's musical performance, "The Follies of Life," was the chief evening attraction and gave universal satisfaction. It was rich in color and beauty. This talented director exceeded his former pre - sentations in the one he gave this year. A number of acrobatic, circus, vaudeville and comedy acts were given during the afternoon racing programs and were added to the Thaviu evening show. The evening show closing with spectacular fireworks from the Lyck Fire Works Company of Omaha, Nebraska. The management was pleased with the amusement offering of 1931.

The debenture bonds to Lincoln Trust Company represent pay - ment on the Grand Stand. Then there is the item on the Automobile Auditorium, and the amount due on the purchase of that building, with other accounts run to $53,925.38. With these totaled up we find the liabilities at this time, as I gave them before totaled $88,217.95. The deficit with which the year opened up on January 1st, 1932 was $18,901.78 and the deficit on January 1st, 1932: — which means the deficit for this year, was $69,316.17, making around $88,000. Of the accounts pay - able as listed therein, total $56,017.97. Of this amount $35,301.65 ie covered by notes. This leaves at this time $20,716.32 not covered by notes. We have tried to make this as clear as possible. It is a mess of figures, but I believe when analyzed and cross-analyzed it is under - standable. You can so analyze the statement that will be printed. We want to thank those who gave us such competent help in the Secretary's office, and we went through the audit made by certified accounts. When we got through that we found a most thorough set of books. So there was a double check on this. Your committee feels in making this report it has been done with a great deal of care. We do want to at this time bring the word to you that the books of the State Fair office are splendidly kept, and I believe will more than compare with any books to be found in the Capitol Building. Report signed by Purcell, Boyu and Snubert. Move the adoption of this report. Motion seconded. Vote taken and the motion carried. By PRESJDENT REED: I might say the Board has tried every way in the world to get money to pay up some of the obligations still noted as unpaid, but on account of the financial conditions prevailing, we have been unable to do quite that well. But we have had fine co-operation all along the line and for that we feel very thankful. The next report will be that of the Committee on Premium Re - vision. We will call on Mr. Tolen to read the first part of it. By MR. TOLEN: It is with deep regret that your Committee find necessary to submit a report that calls for an almost complete revision and recommends some drastic reductions for reasons that are very obvious to you and your committee has no apologies for offering these. I will read the report, and 1 suppose you will want to adopt It by sections and make comments, objections or amendments as we go along. </seg>

TOLEN: I move the adoption of the foregoing part of the report as to Beef Breeds. Motion seconded. Vote taken. Motion carried. By MR. TOLEN: The report on the Dairy Department has been prepared by Prof. H. P. Davis, working with Mr. Daft. We called them in and told them just what we wanted to do in that department, how much we wanted to cut down and asked them to take that amount and distribute it through that department. By MR. H. J. MCLAUGHLIN:. I think If you are going to keep first prize on horses at $20.00 it is hardly equitable to pay Shetland Ponies $10.00. ) By CHAS. GRAFF: It was just said here that you are reducing 20% on the Dairy show. I don't remember how many dairy breeds we have as a rule In this Fair, but I believe your figures show only a reduction of some $1,400.00. By MR. TOLEN: Yes. By MR. GRAFF: It isn't enough when compared to the pro - posals on Beef breeds. Before you get through with this matter, I think that discrepancy will require serious attention. The special dairy cow is not the farmers' cow in Nebraska. In this country and state it is the general purpose, utility cow thai is the farmers' cow. We have a lot of specializing dairy men in Nebraska who cannot make it go with their special dairy cows on the average farm. I am willing to stand for all the cutting that ought to be made, you can cut clear to the bone, but I protest against such a discrepancy. By MR. R. C. JOHNSON, Saunders County: I want to take issue with Mr. Graff, although I am a beef type man myself. I am also rather representing the Dairy Interests of Nebraska; a basic Industry in this state. We must admit, that almost every farmer in Eastern Nebraska is deriving his only ready income especially in the Eastern part of the state from this source and Nebraska is essentially a dairy state. Being President of the Nebraska State Dairymen's As - sociation this past year, I am very much interested in what is pro- </seg>

            <seg id="p048">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE posed as to this department. Mr. H. P. Davis and Mr. Daft were here in Lincoln, our Committee invited them to make a survey of this section of the premium revision work, they made proposals to cut in the Dairy section sufficient to reach the total suggested by the Committee. I happen to have been Superintendent of that Depart - ment — of Class "B," the Dairy Cattle division — for the last few years. Ten years ago you didn't find these dairy cattle so prevalent and almost universal on Eastern Nebraska farms, as one does now. By MR. CHARLES GRAFF, Cuming County: I am sorry to say I oppose the Revision Committee. I feel you are asked to put too much money into the dairy breeds of cattle in the State Fair and that we should be more concerned with the beef breeds — with the general purpose cattle of this country. I am here to say— again to you that the Bureau of Animal Industry of the Federal Govern - ment is beginning to recognize the fact that the farmers' cow in this great grain growing section of the country is not the special dairy animal, but is the all purpose animal, the animal that will make good beef and can be so used when you are through with it. The special dairy animal will grow up to five hundred or six hundred pounds — calves. You milk the second cow. The Bureau of Animal Industry recognizes that fact and there is a movement on foot now — and one of their leading milk technicians in that Bureau, the authorities in state departments and at state colleges are looking into these matters; and they have already taken action in three of the big colleges now to establish herds of from six to eight or ten cows, selected for their adaptability to general and varied purposes. When they have ten or twelve of such herds scattered over this interior section of the country, then they are going to compare notes. They are beginning to recognize the fact that a cow will produce in less than a year, one calf, her sister calf — is now the cow for the average farmer, in preference to a cow that must be a nurse cow. Now, gentlemen, this is an important matter. As a breeder watching Red Polled for over thirty years I have been interested in watching this movement. Go to the International and watch the Tellow ex - hibiting the Red Polled and the fellows who display the Shorthorns, and you will say those cattle both have their place. The Federal Bureau says too now — they are trying to develop those strains of cattle which adapt themselves to the average farmer better than the special breeds do. It is recognized this general purpose cow may not come up to the special dairy cow as a milker. " It may not be able to produce calves as readily and easy, but the beef animal rates Jirst class by the packer and he doesn't know much difference in these cattle — he doesn't know the dairy animal from the beef animal when they get on the scales, for he only takes them by the poundage. I don't believe you fellows will listen to the kind of stuff Conrad John - son and such fellows are putting out — they should be made to eat </seg>
            <seg id="p049">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It. I wouldn't care a continental about this, but I believe honestly when making such an inequitable cut — where you are not making a cut nearly so deeply as you do on the beef breeds, you are being unfair to the dual purpose breeds of our state and this part of the country. You have four or five dairy breeds represented here and classified, you have as many in the beef breeds in this catalogue, par - ticularly recognized in our show, so when you take off as much on Red Polled in this show as you take off from four or five breeds of special dairy cattle, it isn't fair. Your reduction of one is way out of proportion when you come to figure it out as compared to the treatment of the other. What Mr. Davis has proposed about dairy cattle is of course to their Interest. That is his business; he naturally tries to favor the special dairy cow and tries to put her through with a grand gee-whiz ballyhoo, but that doesn't make her the best investment for the average farmer. By MR. H. C. MEAD, Garfleld County: If I understand cor - rectly what has just been said, I believe this fellow has got things kind of mixed up. Davis proposed to milk this milk cow. Graff proposes to make a good special milk cow out of a cow that don't do either one. By MR. R. C. JOHNSON 1 : I believe we are taking up too much time on one item in the vast task that is facing us. I am sorry I don't have the eloquence of my friend Graff. I don't blame him for standing up for his own decided preference. He used to be President of the National Red-Polled Association — By MR. GRAFF: I am yet. By R. C. JOHNSON (continued) : I am not connected with the Hol - steln-Frlesen or any particualr breed of dairy cattle. But I am in - terested in the general welfare of the dairy business in this state. When a cow of the dairy breed produces five hundred pounds of butter fat, -and you want to compare her to a cow that produces a calf, that brings no more than six or eight weeks, 1 think you better take the comparative records. Take the records of thirty-one herd im - provement associations in this state. If a Red Polled herd produces one hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds of butter fat it does well. Especially as against other breeds of milkers that can do six hundred pounds. By MR. H. J. MCLAUGHLIN: I make a motion Mr. Graff and Mr. Johnson be barred from any further discussion. I think we better pass this whole thing to the Board of Managers to complete this premium revision list. I think this whole matter will require too much definite study for us to ever get through here within any rea - sonable time. We have been here a couple hours and haven't hardly got started yet. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By MR. W. B. BANNING: I think maybe we have gotten a little bit ahead of ourselves on this thing. I believe when you sit down and figure this over, you will find a 27% to 30% cut In Jersey cattle, and when you look it all over you will find there is more than a 20% cut In Dairy stuff. By MR. IRL TOLEN: For your information, I would like to say it has only been in the last few years that the Dairy men secured very much increase. The beef breeds had their increases from time to time, and while the proposed reductions here may make it look like beef breeds are sort of getting it in the neck and that perhaps we are out of Joint, the cuts that are being made on the Dairy breeds is a considerable cut when you figure that- running along year after year up until just a few years ago they got tnelr raise. I sat around the table in Linden Hotel after midnight working out the Dairy Associa - tion figures into an equitable program raising premiums in the Dairy departments. By MR.

By PRESIDENT REED: I might say we have worked this out and submitted it for the approval or amendment of this body. You might make any changes you see Tit. However, the motion is made and seconded that the matter be referred to the Board of Managers. Are there any remarks on the motion? By MR. SMILEY of Seward: If the motion goes through that is going to leave unsettled a prejudicial proposal to the Poultry in - terests. ■ i By PRESIDENT REED: Of course, if the motion carries, your interests or any other groups or persons will be at liberty to present your objections or proposals to the Board, of Managers. All in favor of this motion, signify by Aye, contrary minded the same. The motion is carried.

MITCHELL: If there is nothing else up now, I would like to suggest we consider having a six-day fair this year. By PRESIDENT REED: I would like to .hear some discussion on that matter. I have never been so strong on this eight-day fair. I know some of the 4-H club workers say it is pretty hard to come down here and stay so long, but that on the other hand it is hard to get through all their various activities in a six-day period, but since we have the new Club Building completed, perhaps they can speed up and double up their events, run a two or three-ring circus and get through their program faster. I will be interested in hearing from some of you on this subject. By MR. E. L. HUNT, Otoe County: In our county, since the eight-day fair was adopted there have been complaints raised by those handling the 4-H club work and they -want it restored to a six - day fair and asked that we use our influence, if any, here to accomplish that. If this was done they would be very much pleased. It is quite a burden on the 4-H club workers and exhibitors to have to be here eight days. By MR. CHAS. GRAFF: I am glad this matter was raised. ' 1 was pleased to hear that the Board* had decided to go back to the six-day fair. I have heard a lot of complaint of people giving dif - ferent reasons why they think eight days is too long and drawn out. Right in line with that, we are facing heavy problems here and recog - nize we must economize and it costs money every day the fair is In operation. I don't believe we can increase our receipts in the extra two days in proportion to the Increase in expense, and do not get enough more people to justify the additional expense. I think It was a wise move on the part of the Board to take this action. By PRESIDENT REED: Mr. Graff, this matter was simply mentioned in the talk I gave yesterday. No action has as yet been </seg>
            <seg id="p055">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE taken. The matter hasn't yet been decided. But that is the reason we brought the subject up for discussion as we would like to know the sentiment of this body of men. By PRESIDENT REED: Is there anyone else? By MR. IRL D. TOLEN: Mr. President and Gentlemen: There is another angle to this eight-day fair matter. Most of the schools in the state start on Labor Day. If the State Fair stands for what we hope it does, Education, and is an educational institution, there are a number of counties that can best be served by an eight-day fair. We feel that in the eastern part of the state, the holding open on Saturday and Sunday Is quite an advantage to many scholars and teachers, who can come within a radius of one hundred miles on those days and avail themselves of the fair being open. I think this is a matter to be given serious consideration before we decide whether or not to go back to the six-day fair. By MR. GEORGE JACKSON: As soon as we get back into the office and get settled down, we are going to take up this six or eight day fair matter and see whether it is costing ub too much for the extra days. There are several things to look at — both ways. We would find it quite a relief at the office to go back to the six-day proposition. We want to take whichever plan we get the most money from. When we started the eight-day plan we raised the price on concessions twenty per cent, which made us about $8,000.00 there. If we put it back to six days we must take off that increase. Then the phase . Mr. Tolen spoke about, considering the advantage to the school people. Then when we had Billy Sunday here he put 37,000 people on the grounds on a Sunday. It is a question in the minds of the Board I am sure which is best, six days or eight day fair. But we want first to know on which we make the most money. Other state fairs around us, of our size and class, are practically all eight day fairs. Minnesota has ten days. Iowa has eight. Dallas, Texas, of course, has sixteen days; Oklahoma has eight, and I think Topeka, Kansas, has eight; Hutchlnson, Kansas, starts on Sunday; almost every fair of our size has at least eight days. By HENRY SUNDERMAN, Madison County: I don't know as 1 can say anything additional on this. I doubt very much whether a check up of this in the office will throw sufficient light on the subject. For this reason. In the past two or three years many people have come on these earlier days and do not find sufficient exhibits have arrived, especially in the live stock and swine divisions, to make a good showing. By MR. JACKSON: The total receipts will show, the expense will be evidence and can be analyzed. By MR. E. R. PURCELL: I wasn't very much in favor of the eight-day fair when the change from six days was made. I felt It </seg>

            <seg id="p057"/>
            <seg id="p058">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE was perhaps a step forward. I don't know whether we really bene - fited, but my thought now is this; I wouldn't want to say an eight day fair should be abandoned permanently. I think Nebraska Is big enough to have an eight-day fair, but I don't believe this year, when we are facing economy, in fact, as necessity, and pyschologically and from expediency, we ought to go that far, and we might adopt a six - day fair for those reasons for this year. By MR. PURCELL: I think we had better go back to a nix - day fair for this year. I think we might well do that for one year. We don't need to do so permanently. Of course, we can and prob - ably must leave it with the Board members. But this year we might well go back to a six^day fair and later we can put it back vo an eight-day fair. By MR. R. J. JOHNSON: As someone hinted here a moment ago, we may have had an eight^flay fair on paper but we have really only had a six-day fair in live stock departments. There is almost no live stock in the barns on Saturday and Sunday. They come in from Des Molnes and don't get here so as to be ready until Monday. Many people came on those first days and went back home and said there just wasn't any stock down there this year. By MR. OTTO PFEIFFER: In regard to what has been said here about schools, it is a general rule in many counties that all those of school age can attend the fair without being marked absent on any day during the fair, and 4-H boys and girls can attend like - wise without being called absent. By MR. LAMB: I would like to hear further from Mr. Pfeiffer what he thinks about the eight-day fair. . By MR. PPEIFFER: I think exhibitors don't like to bring their stuff down so long. It is true the last three or four days It is pretty hard to keep ' vegetables in good condition. After melons, squashes and some of those have been around about three or four days they commence to spoil and soon you haven't got any melons and such things on display you dare leave out in sight. The same may apply to tomatoes and cucumbers. Iii a six-day fair they do not lay so long in the opening stages. It takes time before the opening and from the standpoint of spending ten or twelve days here, and in face of reducing the premium lists, the expense may not justify exhibiting for many people. By PRESIDENT REED: We would like to- have a further slant on the viewpoint right here in the city of Lincoln. For that reason I would like to. hear from Mr. ChapTn. By MR. L. C. CHAPIN: I am of the opinion that the fair in Lincoln is of great Interest to the people of this city but that the falling of attendance of the city of Lincoln was "n part due to the length of time. The busy man says it is here for a longer time than </seg>
            <seg id="p059">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE it used to be and we will go the next day. I am of the opinion that a six or seven day fair is long enough. I think a great deal more attendance could be brought about if the Board of Managers would arrange each day for a short parade to De made over the principal streets of the city. A different one every day could be arranged with very little expense. Arranged upon different subjects and different periods they would interest people. Have one say at nine in the morning, they could cover some of the residence portion of the city. Supplied with bands and banners they would arouse attention. We seem to need something here to arouse tTie interest of the people and call their attention to the presence of the fair. I also have an idea of a campaign that could be put on in Omaha r;nd Lincoln perhaps thirty days before the fair followed by a sale of tickets and in which business houses could buy them in lots and distribute to their employees. You take for instance around the stock yards in Omaha a great deal of interest could be aroused lor Omaha Day. In Lincoln and Omaha it might get the Chamber of Commerce interested. I think this year is going to be a better year before it is very old. Better times are perhaps just around the corner, though we do not know just which corner but we are certainly going to come back in agriculture. I am trying to give you just a little thought as to how we might Increase interest in attendance on the fair. This summer I drove up into Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana and Idaho and I saw through those same arid areas vast tracks of fine land that had been broken out, some crops raised and then practically either reverted to a wild unused state or having about the poorest yield possible. They had perhaps produced some good crops of wheat when it was from a dollar or two dollars and a half wheat. But the mere reduction of acreage can't help us much until the supply and demand can be better adjusted. I have perhaps not put this picture very clearly but I rather feel optimistic about this coming fair. We may not reach normal times but one of the best indications we can find is that people are beginning to look into the future to get down to work, to forget the easy years of the past, to jerk up their belt and get down to facing present conditions and I believe that the people of Nebraska are just in about the best condition of anybody on earth. By PRESIDENT REED: I think the next thing is the election of the president for the ensuing year. I will call Mr. Tolen to vhe chair. Who will you have for. president next year, gentlemen? By MR. CHARLES GRAFF: Mr. Chairman, we now proceed to elect the head of this organization who will be the leader in this work that faces the State Board of Agriculture of this state for vhe coming year.

Perry Reeu Is one of those everyday kind of fellows. He has peculiar traits of his own that are original with him.

By SECRETARY JACKSON: It affords me much pleasure to announce the vote of this convention for Mr. Perry Reed for Presi - dent the ensuing year. By PRESIDENT REED: I appreciate the honor that you have conferred upon me for the second time. While Mr. Graff is a little in error as to where I began work on this board and I appreciate his kind remarks. For the first three years that I was on this board I served as superintendent of the Swine Department. However, I have been connected with fairs for ten or twelve years before I was put on this board. I wasn't in attendance at the meeting at the time I was first elected. I didn't know anything about it and had not given it a thought until someone told me they had seen It in the paper that I was put on as a member. ' Some time ago I looked over the list to see who the members were when I went on the Board and now there are only five men connected with the organization at this time who were on the Board at that time. Many of the others have gone to their rest. Some have dropped out and as I said five of them are still with the organization. One of the best things that I can say is that this organization is a body of men of all political faiths and while we may talk politics among each other sometimes in the proceedings of this board there is no political action. It gives me great pleasure to again head this organization. The next order of business will be to receive nominations for First Vice President. By MR. E. R. PURCELL: This year marks the twentieth anni - versary since I came on this board. Like Senator Reed, I have seen many changes and quite a good many of those with whom I have served, step by step, have risen to the highest honor that this board can confer. Senator Reed just spoke of his coming on the board. </seg>

I take great pleasure in placing Irl D. Tolen before you for First Vice President. Nomination seconded. By PRESIDENT REED: Are there any other nominations? By MR. WAKE: I would like to second this nomination and 1 move that the nominations be closed and the secretary be instructed to cast a unanimous ballot of- this meeting for Mr. Tolen for First Vice President. Motion seconded. Vote taken. Motion carried. By MR. JACKSON-: It affords me much pleasure to announce the vote of this convention for Mr. Tolen for First Vice President the ensuing year. •By MR. TOLEN: Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Convention: It goes without saying that I appreciate the honor you have again conferred upon me. It has been a pleasure to serve with this Board. While the duties have been strenuous and perplexing to say the least it has been a real pleasure. I hope I may continue to be of service to the Board and that I may merit some of the complimentary things that have been Bald about me today. I thank you. By PRESIDENT REED: Next will be nominations for Second Vice President. By MR. J. A. BOYD: I wish to place in nomination for Second Vice President a man who has been acting on this Board for several years and had done a good deal of work. I understand that he is not a married man so he can devote almost all of his time for being Second Vice President. So I place Mr. A. H. Miller in nomination for this office for this year. By MR. A. W. LAMB: I move that the nominations be closed for Mr. Miller as Second Vice President. Vote taken and motion carried. </seg>
            <seg id="p062">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By MR. JACKSON: I hereby cast the entire vote of this con - vention for Mr. A. H. Miller as Second Vice President for the ensuing year. By MR. MILLER: I guess you all know that I appreciate vhe honor you have given me upon this particular occasion. I only trust that I may grow In usefulness and become as helpful as some of my old friends, Charley Graff, H. J. McLaughlin, Emerson Purcell, and others. And that I won't be like a steamboat upon the Mississippi River that had a five foot boiler and a seven- foot whistle and it took all the steam when they blew the whistle and then the boat stopped. By PRESIDENT REED: The next will be nominations for Treasurer. By MR. FRANK SHUBERT: I wish to place in nomination i'or Treasurer of this organization a man whom I believe is one of the most valuable members of the organization. His work with the Fair Board has been extremely valuable and it has given me pleasure to work with him. So I place him in nomination for Treasurer, Mr. Thomas H. Wake, for the next year. By MR. SMILEY: I move that the rules be suspended, the nom - inations be closed and the vote of the convention be cast for Mr. Wake. Motion seconded. Vote taken. Motion carried. By MR. JACKSON: It is a pleasure Indeed for me to cast the entire ballot of this organization for Mr. Wake for Treasurer i'or the ensuing year. By MR. WAKE: Mr. President and friends, I know you fellows don't expect me to qualify for the standard my friend Shubert has set up for me. I want to thank you for the honor and I hope to be able to make a better report next year than I made this year. By PRESIDENT REED: Next will be nominations for Secretary. By MR. H. J. MCLAUGHLIN: I have in mind a man who has grown up in the fair business, first, in the county fair, and then as a member of the State Board and a President one term. A man I think with whom I have had closer contact than I have had with any other man during the six years that I lived in Lincoln. I lived in the same house with him the greater part of these six years, we were pretty close together. Our offices were in the same corner of the capitol building. I think I was with this man more than anybody else. It gives me great pleasure to nominate George Jackson. Nom - ination seconded. By MR. A. H. MILLER: I move you that the rules be suspended and the President be instructed to cast a unanimous ballot of this meeting for Mr. Jackson as Secretary. Vote taken. Motion carried. By PRESIDENT REED: On behalf of this organization I now cast its entire ballot for Mr. Jackson as Secretary. </seg>
            <seg id="p063">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE By MR. JACKSON: I sure- appreciate the continued confidence you have shown in me in retaining me in this responsible position. I also deeply appreciate the most gracious introduction of Mr Mc- Laughlin. We did live in the same house. We ran around together a great deal. I want to say without fear of contradiction that every member of this Board is going out this year determining to make the 1932 Fair a finer and better Fair than 1931, and to make it the best Fair we ever had. I am sure with these men back of us, and I want to promise you and I am coming back fast, and I am not a dead one and already coming back to myself fast and we are going to put every ounce of energy we have into this fair business next year. Take it from me you will have a bigger and better fair than we had this past year. By PRESIDENT. REED: At this time it devolves on me to select four members to serve on the Board of Managers. I again select R. R. Vance, W. B. Banning, W. T. Parkinson, and R. Widle, and it gives me pleasure to appoint these men who served so well with us last year. By A. W. LAMB: I make a motion that the four gentlemen just named be confirmed by this organization. By MR. MCLAUGHLIN: I second the motion. Vote taken Motion carried. By PRESIDENT REED: I don't know of any further business. Meeting adjourned sine die. </seg>

            <seg id="p091">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS PltESIDKNT'S ADDKESS This is the twenty-third consecutive time the Nebraska Associa - tion of Fair Managers are in session. Under conditions that are significant and call for an economical program, and for a ie-adjust - ment in every line of business and industry, and the sooner we recog - nize the fact and act accordingly, the better it wHl be for all concerned. It is time to be optimistic, it is also dangerous sometimes to be over-optimistic. We should never get so optimistic that we get lo thinking we can buy a commodity from a Scotchman and sell it to a Jew at a profit. It can't be done. So It is with fair managers. We are having a tough time to select a program to fit our pocketbooks and the means of our patrons. Whatever line of action and scope of program we select now, perhaps in six months from now will be entirely upset. We may find our - selves having selected a program that calls for a larger expenditure than our incomes will permit at the time when we come to give the program. It Is like W. B. Estes, former secretary of an Oklahoma Chamber of Commerce, who is now farming in Colorado, related. He raised sheep and sold them in Denver for $3.30, after paying for yarding and commission he netted seventy-five cents for seven sheep, while according to the Agriculture Department the products of these seven she^p cost the consumer $83.70. In commenting on this incident Hiram A. Rubee, the National Farm Columnist, says: "Any economic system that makes the consumer pay $11.95 1'or eleven cents worth of sheep needs changing." I have remarked before and I repeat it, that the farmer is like an old pump; they prime us with eleven cent sheep and pump out $11.00 in profit from our labors. That is about the condition we are in; we are trying to operate our fairs with an eleven cent income and we have an eleven dollar expense. We will have to make readjustments to fit in with the times. I do not blame anyone In particular for the conditions we are facing. Agriculture was the first to feel the depression and I think it will be the first to come out of It. Apparently the year 1932 holds more of promise for Agriculture than either 1930 or 1931, for the very reason that the deflation has already carried farm products down to the lowest level that has pre - vailed for more than a generation, and any further shrinkage in values is hardly to be expected. We, as county fair managers, are not the only ones having grief. It seems the State Board of Agriculture has perhaps much more serious problems to solve. I believe that the Nebraska Association of Fair Managers should give the State Boafu all the assistance pos - sible, to help these men solve their problem. We know how difficult </seg>
            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ' it is to work when you are in financial distress. While we are having plenty of trouble in our respective tasks, let's all get our uhoulder to the wheel and we are going to be able to push out of our dif - ficulties, and when the depression begins to break away, we will be right out on top ready to take on the load in a constructive agri - cultural program. We will now proceed with the program prepared, except we will first divert back to where we met our first "detour." I would like at this time to introduce Mr. Frank C. Zehrung, Mayor of Lincoln, who will address you at this time. ADDRESS OP WELCOME By MAYOR FRANK C. ZEHRUNG, Lincoln Gentlemen: I am rather embarrassed In interrupting this pro - ceeding with my presence. I am afraid that what I have to say may not be very interesting to you. The city of Lincoln, of course, is very much interested in the State Fair. That goes without saying, and I am given to understand from Mr. Jackson that the State Fair and Countj? Fairs throughout the state bear almost the same relation - ship to each other that the high schools of the state occupy toward the university. You know that means a great deal. In your fairs at home you educate the people to go to fairs, you educate them to come to the State Fair at Lincoln; then you come here each year for your own deliberations. In that way the State Fair lias been built up. for year after year. I have been a continuous resident of the State of Nebraska :or more than sixty years. I have attended, I think, every State Fair that has been held, both in Omaha and in Lincoln, in all those years. Naturally, I have the same interest that an old man has in a younger man; that an old man has in something that he has seen grown up during his residence. Of course, the State Fair is in the same condition that the rest of the country is in at the present time. I truly think that in racing the problem that is before the officers of the State Fair it will not be necessary to break the long chain of successful State Fairs, and that the State Fair will be held again this year. The State Fair has been a wonderful educational institution and of ever increasing value in education to the people of the State of Nebraska. Especially since the 4-H Clubs that you have sponsored have grown to such propor - tions. Of course, the average man like myself who goes to the State Fair may not know all about many of these things that interest the </seg>
            <seg id="p093">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS average farmer but he doeB see a great many things that are of inter - est to himself and thousands and thousands of people come here year after year to attend the State Fair at Lincoln. They wouldn't come unless there was something to attract them, that 'they thought was of educational value as well as of entertainment. The last year, of course, was a pretty bad slap but you must remember that you must average it in with the many years that have been good years. We hope that you won't get such a slap this coming year. No one knows whether the good times are just around the corner or not, but we hope they are. It seems that we have about tipped rock bottom and are on the up-grade, nothing that I know about means anything, for I am like Will Rogers, all I know is what I read in the papers, but we hope, and we believe, and we have faith that things are going to turn. We know what Nebraska was sixty years ago, and you can ready this story in Bess Streeter Aldrich's "A Lantern in Her Hand" and "White Bird Plies." There are a few men here who do remem - ber back in those days when we burned corn and did not burn coal. You remember back with the problems of that era and we still have prosperous conditions today compared to the times we had forty, fifty or sixty years ago. One trouble is that we have grown to consider the luxuries of forty years ago as necessities of today. We have grown so used to a higher standard of living, we have come to own better homes and grown so accustomed to these things that It has become pretty hard to adjust ourselves to getting along without any of them. We may have to give up a lot of things that we have become Used to in the last thirty or forty years, we are facing a situation that has affected the whole world, but I think we will come out of it all the better, we know that we are going to come out of it some way. There never was a time when things were so bad that they could not be worse. Things could be a deal worse in this country and in this state than they are now. But I don't believe they are going to be. I think that you should go. right ahead and woik out some plans for holding the State Fair this year. Some things may have to be curtailed. We don't want it said that Nebraska was so hard up that it couldn't have the State Fair. Even if you have to cut down a lot of things, still we must put It over and not break the links. It is up to you men here to work this out. It is a great pleasure to Lincoln to have you here. That may be a stereotyped thing that mayors always say to convention busi - ness. But Lincoln feels rather differently and more of a comradeship to the people of Nebraska than does the average citizen. Almost every man in this room • either has had the chance to attend the University of Nebraska or some members of his family have attended the University proper, or the Agricultural College or have some com - mon interest in this city. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We are very grateful to you for coining here; we are grateful to you for this capitol that has been built with your money, for vhe support of all these state institutions that are operated not with Lincoln's money but that of the State of Nebraska. We want you u&gt; come here more often. I am very grateful to you for appearing here before you, and for this opportunity of telling you that Lincoln wel - comes you and is very glad to have you here. I- hope that your business meetings will be of such interest to you that you will feel that your time has been well spent in coming here in this very "un - usual" weather for Nebraska. PRESIDENT CEDAR: We will now have a response to the mayor's address, and I am going to call upon our Vice-President. MR. OTTO PFEIFFEK: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am glad of this opportunity of saying a few words in response vo this address of welcome from the mayor of Lincoln. I want to say also that I am very proud of having so many Fair men present under these conditions that face us today. You men are here as representa - tives of the agricultural interests of the State of Nebraska. While there has been a great deal said about depressions and about fairs slipping and going down hill, I can't feel that way. I don't believe that any fair in the State of Nebraska is operating for the sole interest and purpose of making money. To my Idea the fair is an institution that stands for education and the question of whether it is making money or not should be secondary to its real purpose. I know we face a serious problem but I think some plan will be worked out whereby the State Fair will continue. I hope to get all fair men here to realize whether they have made or lost money, that from our deliberations, today, tomorrow and the next day, that some plans will be worked out whereby every fair in the State of Nebraska will benefit. I want to say we are more than pleased to be here in the city of Lincoln. Personally I am proud to be here once a year. I am proud of our state capitol and I want to ask any of you men who have never visited it while you are here to go and see it. I want to thank the mayor for all that he has said, and I know we have a lot of business ahead of us, so I will close. ADDRESS BY MR. THOMPSON There are many things to be taken into consideration in the successful operation of a County Fair, and not the least of these is the wise expenditure of money. Naturally before we can be in n. position to expend our money wisely, we must analyze the situation, for there are no hard and fast rules to govern, because every county fair board is working under conditions peculiarly its own. However, </seg>
            <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF KAIR MANAGERS in any event, we should not lose sight of the fact that the County Fair is primarily an educational institution. Here we are afforded an opportunity to learn by comparison. Exhibitors vie with one an - other by exhibiting the best they are able to produce, and by Buch friendly rivalry they are kept ever alert to discover new methods, better varieties of crops as well as better farm practices. However, no matter how laudible the purpose, it seems necessary to encourage competition by offering some sort of premium. While we feel i.hat it pays to be generous with the premium money, it is easily Bquan - dered in this manner. In making out our premium lists, we should study our local conditions and encourage the production of crops and livestock that have proven successful there, as well as to dis - courage exhibits of little value, and which are often entered for ihe sole purpose of getting some premium money. We were told here last year, that one county in the state was actually paying premiums on a half dozen varieties of noxious weeds. Why offer premiums on breeds of hogs and breeds of cattle in a county where there are but few if any such herds? Obviously here is a chance to save some money. Another way to encourage exhibitors Is to provide good com - fortable buildings for the livestock and convenient, suitable buildings for other exhibits. We have found that It seldom pays to put up temporary structures and in the past nine years we have spent over ?40,00*0.00 on permanent improvements exclusive of land. However, after we have built, commodious buildings, offered good premiums and secured a fine collection of exhibits our fairs can hardly be called a success unless we have a good gate. But I don't mean to convey the idea that a fair should be called a failure just because It has not made a financial profit, but the fact Is, It takes money to run a fair, and unless by some means, we are able to entice the general public Inside our gates where we can touch their pockets, sooner or later we will have to close the gates. The number of ways of accom - plishing this are legion, and just how far we aTe justified in going, is another problem. Personally I believe in a balanced fair; one where a reasonable relation between the amount spent for premiums and that, for other attractions exists. We should have an ample variety of good clean entertainment, but not so much that people are in - clined to neglect the exhibits. Whenever conditions come to such a pass that exhibitors make their exhibits solely to make money and everybody goes to the fair only for a good time, that fair has served its usefulness and can hardly be called a successful fair even though the books show a profit. I am inclined to think that sometimes we lose sight of the real object and purpose of a fair, and rely too much on horse races, baseball, carnivals, and other attractions \o attract crowds to our fairs. Let us consider for a moment some other things that might appeal to the public. One of the first things people demand is comfort, so we should provide shade and seats, so that </seg>
            <seg id="p096">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE they can rest and visit and listen to music when they become vired of viewing the exhibits. We should have the very best toilet facilities possible. In 1928 we spent $3,500.00 to build a modern toilet, tind we have a man and woman attendant in charge. So now mothers need not stay at home because of lack of facilities for taking care of liny babies. When mother stays at home it is quite likely that •.he rest of the family will too. Our buildings and grounds should be made attractive and inviting. The buildings should have plenty of light and ventilation, so that the exhibits may be placed with satisfaction and viewed In comfort, and their construction should embody such features as are necessary to place the exhibits to best advantage. I don't want to uphold our fair as a model of perfection, nor do I want to appear egotistical in what I say, but naturally I am more familiar with the things we are doing and I hope you will pardon me for referring to them to emphasize what I have to say. But a good illustration of the point I was trying to make, is the con - struction of our hog barns. We built them 'with cement flo.ors sloping toward the center. There is a drainage gutter running right down the center of the feeding alley. The roofs extend well over the Bides of the pens, so instead of being compelled to mill up and down a crowded entry way filled with swill barrels and bags of feed, one views the hogs in comfort from the outside, where the well extended roof protects one from the hot sun and rain. I think that some of our costly attractions could be replaced by cheaper forms of enter - tainment. The horse pulling contest has proven with us a relatively cheap, but very popular form of entertainment. StyTe shows by 4-H Club girls, and a livestock parade have proven popular with us. The past year we housed all our 4-H Club exhibits in our new club build - ing, where there were conveniences for giving canning, sewing, and other demonstrations, in which many took a great deal of interest. When there is the judging of hogs, horses, cattle, sheep and poultry, if we don't have too many other things going on, farmers particularly will take an interest in this form of entertainment, especially if we would feature it a little more. It is easy to get boys and girls inter - ested in such a program. A friend of mine, who is a business man in our town, but lives on the outskirts of the city, got his two boys Interested In the sow and litter club. Of course they showed their litters at the fair, and when the ball games were called my friend said he guessed he would have to go over and see how the boys were caring for the pigs. He told me afterwards that the boys were bo interested in judging and showing their pigs, that they didn't care about the ball games. They knew enough about the fine points of the game to become interested, and when one does become interested, it becomes as exciting as any other game.

People are interested in merchants exhibits, machinery exhibits, school exhibits, etc., which they are liable to neglect if there are too. many side attrac - tions, and this is neither fair to the people or the exhibitors. We can help patronage by running a good clean fair, eliminating all monstrosities and objectionable sideshows and carnivals for which we would have to make the slightest apologies. We allow autos free, and invite all to bring' their families and their lunches and picnic on the grounds, and we advertise our fair as a h*ome coming event. Only responsible parties are allowed concessions and our patrons are pro - tected by forcing them to sell at popular prices. When people realize that they are not being held up, they spend more freely and in the end we are all ahead. With such an environment our patrons are encouraged to bring their whole families every day of the fair, instead of coming one or two days. This swells our crowds, brings in more revenue and makes boosters; and after all, boosters are what we need about as much as anything else. Briefly the message I have been trying to bring to you is this: in too many instances we spend too much for high priced attractions and overlook the many cheaper, more substantial things that we could do to make our fairs attractive. We feature these to such an extent that our fairs are little more than pleasure resorts, and we lose sight entirely of the real object and purpose of a county fair. Perhaps our skirts are not entirely clean In this matter, but I will present some figures and you can judge for yourself. (Continued with ;lgures for nine years of operation of fair.) PRESIDENT CEDAR: We have one more number on the pro - gram for this afternoon, the subject Oi "Free Gate," which will be presented by Alfred Olson, Fullerton. * There were a number of Interesting talks here last year on free gate, that is, there seem to be a lot of men here who were in favor of that and quite a lot who were not. I might first say that Mr. Olsen, to whom this subject was assigned, was unable to come down because his father had a stroke, but we might go ahead and discuss this subject. I live in the same county that he does and I might Bay that he went to the county board a few years ago and asked them If they would give us the additional $2,000.00 if we would open our fair to a free gate. They agreed to do that. We agreed also that !f the plan was a failure never to come back again. If it was a success we would put it up to a referendum of the people of the county, which we did, and it carried three to two in favor of a free gate. That didn't give us very much to put out on premiums, but to this we added the proceeds of grandstand, quarter stretch and conces- </seg>
            <seg id="p098">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sinns and with this we paid the free acts. In addition to all this, last year we applied $1,700.00 and the year before $1,100.00 on an old account. We believe this is the only way to run a fair. I am per - haps a poor substitute for Air. Olson on this number so I'd like to have some of the rest of you complete this talk. MR. DAVIS, of Hastings: What was the total amount to be paid out for free attractions? MR. CEDAR: Something like four thousand dollars. MR. PFEIFFER: Do you charge for the grandstand, quarter stretch and bleachers? MR. CEDAR: Yes, and we usually get a little more on the con - cessions. MR. A. H. MILLER: Did you charge for night shows, and how much? MR. CEDAR: Yes, fifty cents. We found the night show cost us money. Question: Did. you give the same show at night that you did In the afternoon? Answer: We had a revue at night and in the afternoon we had a free act and ball games. Question: Fireworks? Answer: No, we didn't have fireworks? Question: Did you have races? Answer: No, we had local horse races, but no harness races. Question: Did you charge for the grandstand and quarter stretch? Answer: Fifty cents for both, and twenty-five cents for the bleachers. Question: What percentage of the amount appropriated did you pay out in premiums? Answer: That ran about forty per cent. DELEGATE. Question: You advertised your "fair as a free fair. Answer: Yes. We had no cTiarge at the gate and we made no charge for cars parking on the grounds. We give them good shows and don't charge anything to get in. Question: You give them a free gate but not a free fair. MR. THOMPSON: If they want to see a ball game they get in for nothing, but if they want to sit down It costs twenty-five or fifty cents to get in the grandstand or bleachers. MR. CEDAR: If they want to stand up and look over the fence they can see everything without paying. </seg>
            <seg id="p099">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS • MR. E. J. MITCHELL. Question: How much do you get for con - cessions? Answer: I can't tell you what those receipts were. Question: How much did it increase your attendance over years when you charged? Answer: Two hundred per cent. MR. E. L. HUNT. Question: Is a free gate fair more costly; does it cost more or less than it did before? Answer: In Nance County they appropriated fifty cents a quarter section, MR. CHARLES DOBRY. ■ Question: Did your gross receipts amount to as much as your free gate, including the appropriation? Answer: No, they don't, but the last two years can hardly be compared to other years. MR. CEDAR. Question: Are there any other such fairs? MR. SMILEY, Seward. Answer: We were entitled to $2,000.00 and we got $500.00 in addition and we put on a fair without any free acts purchased from outside. We put on a full program In three afternoons and charged twenty-five cents to get the cars in and twenty - five cents for amphitheater and we came out $2,lft0.00 to the good. We had a lot of local stuff along with stunts and games. MR. HUNT, Otoe County: The way we run our fair; and when we have a free gate and get $2,000.00 from the county. The way our fair came about was from a little different idea and may not be applicable to other counties. We are not iii the county seat and our fair grew out of the matter of having a county-wide achievement day for 4-H Clubs. That annual occasion grew into a fair. We do not so so very strong to entertain, but what we do have we use local talent. We put on a 4-H style show and we use school orchestras. We have a singing contest. I have wondered what experience other counties have had along that line. PRESIDENT CEDAR: If you have any other subjects or ques - tion's we have a little time left in which we might take them up. MR. DAVIS: In the past two years we have had a report that was. made up in Mr. Jackson's office in which was compiled statistics which answers a good many of these questions. PRESIDENT PERRY REED of State Fair Board: I think they are tabulating those figures up at the State House but some of the reports. have been so slow In coming In they will probably not have that ready until tomorrow. EARLE SMILEY, of Seward: I move that the dues of this Asso - ciation be reduced $10.00 to $5.00 for the coming year. MR. NEWCOMER: I second the motion. </seg>
            <seg id="p100">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. SMILEY: A few years ago, not many years ago, our dues were $5.00, in high times. Now we have $10.00 dues and I wonder if we are really getting $10.00 per county but of it and if there is any reason or any necessity for the extra amount. MR. C. Y. THOMPSON: Somebody should answer and show if we have any use for that other $5.00. If not, we should cut It. SECRETARY DAVIS: I might answer that for Mr. Smiley, and say that if we would go back over our records we would find that we have had $10.00 dues for about four years. If you will go over the tabulations that are given in our reports, you divided as between the County Fair Association and the State Boaru of Agriculture. We divided expense on reporting the annual meeting and printing the proceedings, and upon expenses of annual banquet. Last year we had a balance on hand of $580.00. We have enough, of course, to use; but when we have paid certain expenses that will be on hand when this meeting is. over, we will not have so much on hand as this report may indicate. Then I believe if we can have funds enough, that certain things each county cannot so efficiently and economically do alone, we should eventually take up a program of joint effort over a certain period. We should do something to help county fairs build up, and to keep this enthusiasm. Certainly $10.00 is not a burden for any fair which is running from $10,000.00 to $25,000.00 gate receipts. Like any other enterprise, everything isn't measured by the $10.00 paid in, .but you get out of it what you put into it. Then there are a lot of fairs this year that are back on their dues. More so this year than in previous years, before the depression. MR. E. J. MITCHELL: That motion would not apply to dues paid here, it would apply on next year, 1933? Answer: Yes. DELEGATE: Five dollars is not going to bust any association. If this $5.00 is going to close up any fair, it ought to be closed up. I don't believe this sum will handicap any fair. MR. SMILEY: We concede it is a small amount, and even if Jt only concerns $10.00 sometimes these small matters are the important ones, and it is all right for the Association to have it, if it has use for it. . PRESIDENT CEDAR: I believe the gentleman has overlooked one fact, that for some time before our dues were placed at $10.00 they have been $7.00, and years before that they were $5.00. HENRY SUNDERMAN, Madison: I might also call attention to the fact that before the dues were brought up to $10.00, they were at $7.00 and even then this Association had been in "the red." Some years ago, annually a delegate, usually the present or preceding Chair - man or President, went as a delegate to the National Convention at </seg>
            <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Chicago. McGaflin, when he was holding that position, reported back that he does not think the membership in the National Convention was worth $125. The last year I went there. I felt much the same way, and although 1 enjoyed it and confined myself strictly to the duties of observation that had taken me there, I did not feel it was worth $125 to this organization to belong to the National Association. 1 do think it is worth while for the State Board of Agriculture to retain its connection with the National Association and to keep ihe state body in touch with the progress of national affairs. Ten dollars isn't much, but if we don"t get $10.00 worth for it, it is a whole lot. MR. NEWCOMER: I understand Polk County hasn't yet paid its dues. We were left $400.00 in the' hole and perhaps haven't yet got hold of the money to send these down. I believe this is the first time we have had to be short on anything. DELEGATE: I think we ought to hold this motion open until tomorrow. MR. SMILEY: I will withdraw the motion with the consent of the second. MR. DAVIS: You might think the matter over between now and tomorrow and then you can pass on it. PRESIDENT CEDAR: The matter will stand that way; the motion is now withdrawn. The next matter to which we will address our attention will be the appointment of certain committees. Grievance Committee — Appointed with a hope there will be noth - ing or little for them to do. E. R. Purcell, Custer County; Henry I". Kuhl, Wayne County. Auditing Committee — Mr. Coates of Valley, and Alvah R. Hecht of Buffalo County. Credentials Committee: E. J.

            <seg id="p102">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE EVENING SESSION Convened at 7:30 I". M., in Hotel Cornliusker. Called to order by President Cedar, who presented the ilrst speaker. MR. THOMAS A. LEADLEY, Lincoln, Editor of the . Nebraska Farmer, of whom the Chairman remarked: He has had a lot of experience in advertising and is equipped to give us many Informa - tive and helpful suggestions upon his subject. COUNTY FAIR ADVERTISING The march of time and progress has brought its perplexing prob - lems to the institution of county fairs as it has to every other business enterprise. If these problems are to be solved and county fairs con - tinue to exist and grow they must become adapted to the new con - ditions. Failure to keep pace with progress forecasts deterioration and the ultimate downfall of an institution that has been an important factor in agricultural and community development. I know we are agreed that county fairs should continue to be the show window :'or the display of community resources and the medium for cooperation between towns and country In their respective areas. To justify the assertion that county fairs have been instrumental in community development, I need only to mention some of vheir accomplishments as indicated in the business and financial picture which they as a group present. For this information, I did not have the 1931 figures which admittedly will be less rosy than those of previous years, but the .1930 record which may be sufficiently dis - counted to apply to last year, is very significant. These figures are perhaps familiar to most of you, but I want to repeat them in order to emphasize the statement that Nebraska county fairs as a group have built up a business of tremendous magnitude which, if properly managed and developed, offers opportunities for permanency and expansion. In scanning the 1930 figures for the eighty county fairs in Ne - braska, I find they represent a total Investment in grounds and build - ings" in that year of $1,212,186.65. Fairly discounted to get them down to present-day values; they will still show a million dollar investment. To maintain and keep this investment in running order </seg>
            <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS these eighty fairs received county appropriations totaling $186,397.37 and $4,018 from towns or cities. Their receipts from attendance through the main gate totaled $193,249.56. From grandstand, con - cessions and other sources they received some $254,000 additional, or a grand total In receipts of $638,501. 10. . That 1b the life blood of your institution. It represents the interest in and loyalty to iairs on the part of the community. That in turn is governed largely by the kind of a fair you put on and how effectively you sell its features to your local people. The grand total expenditures for that year were $619,076.33. With the exception of eighteen of the eighty fairs all of them showed some net profit, while the total loss on the eighteen which had deficits was only $13,859.31. Your financial statement for. 1931 probably shows less satisfac - tory returns and is causing you some worry in considering fair pro - grams for another year. To some, these declines in revenue and increased losses may suggest drastic retrenchment and doubt as to what the future may bring. To others whose program in the past has been more successful, it will simply mean further adjustments and more new ideas to strengthen fairs and make them popular with the public. After all, the success of any county fair depends upon the sup - port given it by the people of the county and towns. It is not any great hardship for local people to support their county fair by attend - ing it, if they can be sold on the Idea that the fair is worth attending. Too many, fairs depend for their existence upon the support of the faithful few who, year after year, shoulder the responsibility, do the work, and probably get the blame. The big problem, as I see it in county fair success, is to secure the cooperation and loyalty of the entire county instead of these few. I want to present briefly a few of the things, some already in practice among Nebraska county fairs, that seem to be outstanding in making it' possible to carry on such a program. A carefully considered, well planned and dignified adver - tising and publicity program I believe to be a necessary avenue for your success. . I do not want to pose as a county fair expert, but there are some things in common between a county fair and a farm paper. We are both attempting to reach the same class of people, farmers, and the planning and projecting of an editorial program which appeals to farmers is in a good many respects similar to developing a county fair program which appeals to them. In both cases education, person - ality and human interest are important factors. Our common goal is the improvement of rural and 'community life through education, social development and the fostering and furthering of resources which are the basis of the state's prosperity. To answer specifically and satisfactorily the question assigned me, "What Advertising a County Fair Should Do," is the job of an </seg>
            <seg id="p104">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE expert advertising man who has made a detailed and exhaustive study of county fair activities and their results. Unfortunately, complete information on county fair advertising and policies, from which to draw analysis or conclusions, is lacking. I attempted to get some information for a discussion of county fair advertising by' sending to all county fair secretaries' in the state a questionnaire asking for specific facts about their advertising program and fair progress. About one-third replied, and sent some very interesting figures, a part of which I want to bring to your attention. Of the most significance to one who. believes in advertising, is the fact that all the county fairs from which I had replies are spend - ing money in advertising. I believe that 100 per cent of the fairs In Nebraska show their faith in advertising by spending a certain amount of money for it each year. So, I assume that you are all agreed that advertising of some kind is necessary, and a good thing. The problem you face is how much money to invest in advertising, how to advertise and what to advertise. All phases of this problem are important. According to the questionnaires, received from twenty-seven fair secretaries, the fairs included spent all the way from ? 50 to ?8(.)0 each for advertising their fair in 1931. The average amount spent by eighteen fairs which submitted complete figures, was $270 per fair. This is cash and does not include the advertising in premium cata - loges, merchant advertising and free publicity. It is interesting to note that the nine fairs which spent ?200 or more in advertising for 1931 are the fairs which, for the most part, had the greater attendance, or a total of 100,800 people with an average attendance of 11,200 persons per fair. The six fairs which spent less than ?200 each for advertising showed a total attend - ance of 25,400, or an average of 4,233 per fair. It should not be inferred, however, that advertising is solely responsible for the greater attendance of those spending the greater amount of money, Inasmuch as among them are some of the larger county fairs of the state, located in larger towns and in more densely populated communities. How - ever, advertising has, no doubt, been a factor in building up these fairs and their attendance. Some faiTs which spent .only normal amounts in advertising undoubtedly could have increased their attend - ance by more advertising. It also should be pointed out that the attendance records for 1931 were. In many instances, less than the previous year, due to economic conditions. Some exceptions in the questionnaires returned were In the case' of fairs which had free gate for the first time In 1931 and some which spent larger amounts in advertising. However, I think it is right to assume that fairs which did a better job of advertising lost less in attendance on the average than those which cut their advertising arbitrarily. </seg>
            <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS Let us make another assumption. Assuming that the average of ¥270 per fair spent In advertising applied to all of the eighty fairs in Nebraska, or a total of $21,600, consider what per cent that repre - sents of the jtotal receipts of these fairs. As I previously mentioned, in 1930 the receipts from attendance through the main gate, from the grandstand and all other sources, were $638,501.10. Probably in 1931 they were $600,000 or less. If they were $550,000 the amount of money spent in advertising a million dollar Investment was a trifle over four per cent of the total receipts. This compares very favorably with the amount of money spent by business institutions in merchandising their products, but it should be remembered that the product which county fairs have to sell — attendance — has a more unlimited market than the commodity which the average business institution handles. In other words, every indi - vidual in the territory surrounding a county fair is a potential attend - ance prospect, while the sales of commodities are more definitely re - stricted.' Moreover, an up-to-date business institution, in determining the amount of money spent for advertising its. product, generally establishes a sales quota in advance and advertises accordingly. Thus, while the percentage of money spent in advertising county fairs, as I have already said, compares favorably with business institutions, it does not mean that an additional sum spent in advertising would not prove a good Investment through increased attendance, and pos - sibly would even reduce the per cent of advertising expenditure. Further consideration of the questionnaires returned, indicate that the majority of fairs are using about the same kind of adver - tising mediums. These include local newspapers and bill posters, premium lists and catalogs, and automobile signs. One or two fairs emphasize the importance of booster trips throughout the county or trade area, and another one the value from personal contacts of a fair representative at all county meetings, and at rural schools. A few used a limited amount of radio. One of the larger fairs of the state distributed its advertising in seventy weekly papers within a radius of sixty miles. Automobile signs were used in many instances, but one secretary makes the comment that they are too expensive. Another fair which enjoys a large attendance looks with favor upon the passing out of 5,500 free tickets to school children including 4-H Club members, on the theory that if the children come they bring their parents or other members of the family with them. In response to the question about popular features of county fairs, numerous suggestions were made. Among them were the use of local talent for entertainment, school parades and pageants, rodeos, local or county-wide baseball tournaments. 4-H Club activities, rural choirs, local horse racing, pig riding contests and military events. Many of these features might be developed by county fairs with good results, and may well be used effectively in advertising copy. </seg>
            <seg id="p106">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In addition I would suggest the opportunity which county fairs have in depicting the progress of agricultural methods and the customs of people from the pioneer days to the present. The present generation knows little of that period of the covered wagon and prairie plow which was a fore-runner of our present-day life in Nebraska. To me the romance of pioneering is filled with a tremendous amount of human interest. I like to look upon what now seems primitive in farm implements, methods of transportation, relics, dress styles, and so forth. Nearly every community possesses some of these old time symbols which might be assembled and displayed at fairs. Such an exhibit not only holds unusual human interest but can teach more effectively than any other medium the lessons of history and progress. Within a good many counties of Nebraska events occurred in pioneer days which were a big factor in the history and further development of the state. To many of the younger generation these incidents are little known. Why not display and dramatize them at your county fairs? There is merit in the development of home talent for entertain - ment features, not only because of its human interest appeal, but because it brings into fair management and fair activities a larger number of people of the community, which is bound to increase the interest In the fair locally. It likewise reduces the expense, which is important now. In line with the program of reduced expenditures, these addi - tional suggestions were made in the questionnaires: Limiting the fair to a county-wide basis and restricting premiums to county ex - hibitors; lower premiums; more volunteer labor in fair management; bettter accounting systems; cheaper attractions and less advertising. This is a problem for each individual fair to solve, but I would express a word of caution against arbitrarily eliminating or cutting expenses that are worth while. Your opportunity lies in going for - ward and building a bigger and better fair to be attended by more people. I doubt whether this can be done without a definite, compre - hensive, fairly liberal advertising plan, which Includes an educational program directed toward selling the community on the value of fairs to it. In this connection I want to leave with you a suggestion that might merit your consideration and study. In addition to portraying through publicity and advertising the various individual features of your fairs, there is need .for a program to generate a greater fair consciousness on the part of the people and the community. By that I mean loyalty to and support of the fair by the community because it represents a community activity which is the people's to develop and support. I think any project that is worth having is worth advertising, and over its own name in a dignified and honest way. </seg>
            <seg id="p107">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS The suggestion I would make is the sponsorship of a joint edu - cational advertising program state-wide in coverage for the benefit of county fairs as a group. Such a program offers an opportunity to convince Nebraska people that they get out of a fair just what they put into it and that the fair is worthy of their support. At a fairly small expense a joint campaign on a state-wide basis would be projected. The expense might be pro-rated among fair associa - tions on the basis of their attendance record, and would be a nominal investment well worth trying to determine its value in the up-building of Nebraska county fairs. The appeal in such an advertising program should Include the economic importance of county fairs; the necessity of loyalty and pride by the people in the community in supporting their fairs, co - operation among all the towns and people of the county rather than jealousy in communities in which the fair is not located; and some of the standardized salient features of county fair programs. Coupled with this might be developed a publicity service for all the fairs which could be adapted for individual fair use in your local newspapers. I want. to leave with you one outstanding example of the value of repeated advertising and publicity with which I have had personal contact and experience. Eight years ago there was held for the first time in Nebraska, a cornhusking contest. The attendance was small, and the number of huskers few. During the eight years following, the husking contest idea has been fostered and developed by repeated publicity, both state and county-wide, with almost unbelievable re - sults. County husking contests have grown to a maximum of 35 to 40 in 1930 and 1931 in Nebraska, with 300 to 400 huskers competing each year in them, and several hundred officials assisting. The local contests were attended by approximately 50,000 people each year. The .state contest, which is the climax of the county husking competitions in Nebraska, has, in the last two years, attracted crowds of 20,000 to 25,000 people. Similar results have been obtained in seven other states, and they have been brought about through the support and advertising given by the publications which sponsor them. In my opinion county fairs can obtain results equally satisfactory. PRESIDENT CEDAR: Now we come to the second subject ar - ranged for presentation tonight. For this subject, "Revising the Premium List," we have selected two leaders, Mr. D. L. Gross of Lin - coln, and Otto Pfelffer of Douglas County. MR. PFEIFFER: I don't know why they picked on me for this particular subject. I think this is one subject that can be discussed in a thousand ways. I will start by agreeing it is a pretty hard matter to route a path, and will say further that in revising a premium list for a county fair, you are going to meet a multitude of problems. I believe the best way, though, for me to handle this sort of a subject </seg>
            <seg id="p108">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and stay within the confines of. brevity, will be to have you folks ask questions and I will answer them as best 1 can, or pass them on to someone here who perhaps can do so better. But I do want to Bay first, that our fairs have been paying premiums on a good many things and on a lot of stuff not worth the prices or the prizes. Stuff that is not standard stuff. It is foolish to pay on varieties that are not standard varieties and not found in the particular territory, nor worth encouraging to have brought in. Things even down to weeds, that are listed but not worth encouraging. In other words, we should revise a premium list so as to stress our standard varieties; in each line two or three varieties or breeds should be selected and standard - ized and then properly recognized. Now I want to request that you gentlemen ask questions and I will answer them to the best of my ability. If Mr. Gross were here, he could perhaps give you a connected exposition upon this subject. CHARLES GARDNER, Douglas County: What causes a county fair like Douglas County to set up prizes for varieties of grains and vegetables they do not grow there, and offer premiums for livestock like Tamworth hogs, they do not raise in that county? Answer: I don't believe they should set up high premiums for those, and let fellows bring in such stuff and draw money out of the county. A. H. MILLER: Along that line, what good is a county fair; just what is it for? Don't we stand for that very thing, to educate the people to newer or different things? Answer: Absolutely. Question: Would you cut those out entirely or set up small pre - miums for these more uncommon products? Answer: I wouldn't cut them out entirely, but I would put the premiums so small it would cut off the incentive to bring them in just to get the money; I wouldn't give such breeds as much money as the ones commonly raised in the county. Question: How about certain vegetables, as kohlrabi, that have good premiums offered, when they are not known here? Answer: I would say on agricultural products, and that is what you are now referring to, I would take off the premiums on the non - existents, such as you have mentioned. For instance, peanuts, okre, kohlrabi and perhaps a hundred more such varieties, I would offer very small premiums, either by points or by collections for that group. By small premiums you can bring them forth for informational pur - poses, giving them small premiums that will not hurt other things; not" enough to take away very much money, but enough to bring them out to the show; while not stressing them. </seg>
            <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS I know you can find instances where, it you look down the pre - mium list, yon can discover, as Mr. Miller says, where a half kohlrabi would bring as much as the best peck of potatoes. . MR. C. Y. THOMPSON, West Point: I don't know how others feel about it; but the Tamsworth hogs we've got I would cut out en - tirely. We had one exhibitor come to our fair, he came and pulled down the money. The same goes for Brown Swiss cattle. If people want to find out about such things let them go to the dictionary or some other place; don't provide facilities at your fair at the expense of other things that commonly flourish in your community. Let your exhibitors put their energy on the kind of stuff that has a chance of making them some money. MR. A. W. LAMB, Boone County: What would be your opinion on a uniform premium list? Answer: It cannot be uniform for the whole state. It perhaps can pretty much in livestock; but counties vary so much in grains, corn and stuff like that, to have much uniformity possible, but pro - ducts in particular localities can be made uniform over a given terri - tory. Eastern Nebraska has a distinct advantage over Central Ne - braska which makes it unfair to uniformly compete, say, in corn. This has been recognized by the State Board in dividing the state into three districts or divisions, Eastern, Central and Western, and having them compete within their respective boundaries. I think within those lines there are a lot of things that can be worked up in the way of balanced premium lists within the respective districts. MR. • PPEIFFER: There is another point I would like to say something about. I have gathered in the last two or three years as many county fair premium lists as I have been able to get together, and go through them, and I have found some of them are worded very loosely, ours included. I don't know but what ours was one of the . worst ones until we woke up and went through it. For instance, they may have forty or fifty varieties of apples, when they don't raise anywhere nearly that number, and if you pair down the number in this conglomeration you soon find a distinct improvement. DELEGATE: May I ask what you would do, or say, where you have entered in a class only a single entry with no competing entries? MR.- PPEIFFER: I might answer that this way; we have a rule where there is no competing animal in a class or breed, while they may not award a first prize, they may award only second money. Question: Have you ever made such a first award? Answer: No, we haven't, because It is so printed in our premium list. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">UEPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. A. H. MILLER: I wonder sometimes if that is not working a hardship on an exhibitor, because he is not to blame because he lias no competition. Answer: No, he really isn't to blame. But how can you get away from it; to get away from some fellow who comes into the county to get the money by bringing in something he knows will not have competition in that county. Question: Say a fellow brings in an article, collection or animal not really worthy of the money, but still the judges feel obligated to award him first premium; in that case your rule would protect him, but would you award him only second money? Answer: I think that is a good thing then, to. have a provision in your premium list to meet such contingencies; and permit the judges some latitude if they don't feel it is worthy of- such high money. Question: What do you do if a fellow brings in two animals, in the same class; do you let him compete with himself? Answer: No, there again you need a rule that will provide that no exhibitor can make competition with himself; only one entry in each class may be allowed to receive the money. MR. PAPLE, of Richardson: How do . you do in an Instance where you have one class in your premium list, for say something like barley; and a new variety of barley comes out? Answer: Probably in such a case you would find very few judges who could really distinguish the difference between that particular new type and the old type. Your listing can be so general, as just saying "white barley" that you can let them all compete. MD. P. P. CEDAR: How do you handle oats, the same way, by listing "white oats" and not listing the various varieties? Answer: List it that way and say also "late oats." Let one compete against the other. ALVAH R. HECHT. What about where the farmer lives out of the county and brings his exhibit into another county? Answer: That is something the county has got to decide what it wants to do. In our county it is limited strictly to the county, everything, livestock and agriculture. We believe a county fair should be a county fair and not a district fair and that the money should stay in the county. It is derived from the county and should stay in the county as much as possible. Question: If somebody outside of the county has something that is a lot better don't you think the farmers of that county should see it? Answer: Yes. Sure. But why offer a premium for the next county. Why advertise their county. That question came up in our </seg>
            <seg id="p111">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS county. Some farmers thought we were right, some thought we were not fair on it. We showed them our theory and we haven't had any complaint about it since. A good many of our farmers appreciate seeing something better but all in all it has worked out very nicely at our fair. MR. E. J. MITCHELL: That is the plan that we followed for eighteen years. This year we adopted a new rule and we are going to limit everything to the county. MR. HUNT, Oto'e County: Our fair had a new regulation about (hat, where there was no competition and what to do about it where the animal was brought in and in the opinion of the judges was not worthy of drawing money for the high premium, if it has no com - petition. That has happened several times that we would have ex - hibits that in the opinion of the judges were not worthy of drawing any premium money at all. But in our county we leave it to the opinion of the judges and if in their opinion the exhibit has such merit as to warrant some place he may give it back and if it does not warrant any award it doesn't get any even if it is the only exhibit. MR. PFEIFFER: We have that in our premium list. The judges can award first premium, second money or recommend no premium if the animal or article are not worthy of any award. I didn't go far enough in the first statement I made. MR. CHAS. GRAFF, Cuming County: I have discussed this mat - ter before, several years ago. It has never appealed to me or to my folks to bar worthy exhibits from showing at our county fairs. It is better to put them on an equality with any of our people. That is what we have our fairs for,, to learn things, that we lead to im - provement. I do not think it is fair to unload such a disagreeablp job upon a livestock judge at a county fair as to make him the sole judge as to giving a certain animal which is determined to be com - petent, second money when the first money is perhaps $5.00 when the second money is $3.00. That has happened so much in some of our counties. In such an instance it seems to me you are working against the building up of your own fair. You are driving people away from it and keeping them away from your fair. MR. PFEIFFER: It has been ourldea to protect our own county. MR. GRAFF: Mr. Pfeiffer says they bar everybody else from exhibiting in Douglas County, but I have noticed when I go to some of their neighboring counties I have seen some of their Douglas County exhibitors in these county fairs, especially in Mr. Miller's own county. MR. C. Y. THOMPSON: Yes, some of them have even been up In our county. DELEGATE: I would like to ask Mr. Graff if they continue this open competition on both livestock and poultry down to grains. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. GRAFF: I would rather C. Y. answer that. But I think bo. MR. C. Y. THOMPSON: Just livestock. We are trying to make our fair educational, we are trying to educate our farmers to produce better stuff and we want them to have the advantage of seeing good stuff that the neighboring counties can bring there to show. We feel that this brings our farmers in contact with the best that can be offered. MR. R. WIDLE, Nance County: I would like to bring out a point. Everybody says a county fair is an educational institution, but 1 don't see where the education comes in if you bar outsiders. It is like a school if the school must confine itself within its own borders. How will you educate if you must confine it to stock in your own county. How will you make broader contacts. I would Bay let stuff come in from other counties. MR. CEDAR: Graft and I have always been friends and we are both democrats but we haven't agreed on this. We have always been open to the world in Nance. We have been thinking of changing and close the gates to outsiders. Two years ago we had a man come from the western part of the state coming in from the state fair and he walked off with $360.00 and we have thought that we must limit the amount of money that an outsider can walk away with or keep him from taking too much. On the other hand we have always contended for open compe - tition. Dut.it would seem that you've got to limit your money come way or someone comes in from the outside and carries away all of it, in a class where there is no competition. It has also been found a good plan where there is no competition, to pay one-half of the money no matter -what class it is. I notice that now Mr. Gross is here and we would like to ask him to continue this discussion. DR. D. L. GROSS, Lincoln: I am rather unprepared to say any - thing. I just got in from North Dend and had a lot of car trouble. I don't know what you have discussed, but. I will try to give you something upon this subject. The only' part that I have had anything to do with this is that I have judged at many fairs. I believe there are some things about agricultural exhibits at fairs that could be revised and some improvement made. Some counties, of course, have a better line-up than other counties. In many fairs I find that vhe agricultural exhibit is not put in a place where it can be made attrac - tive, no matter what the people bring in. I don't find that enough attention is paid in such places to proper location or to proper light. In many places the light is so poor the judges could not do a good job of judging and the exhibitors are not or cannot put material up in the proper shape. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OK FAIR MANAGERS Then there is the matter of community exhibits. I think this is rather an important thing as a matter of getting more people u&gt; show. There again you run into some dilueultios that 1 have noticed in some fairs and I am thinking of one in particular where in ihe community there was a person who had exhibited for a long time. Here they had listed everything in one class, then they put everything in this community exhibit and there was a lot of stuff brought in that was never put. on the tables at all. I think the superintendent of an exhibit himself should not exhibit at all or he should be a person upon whom you can absolutely rely that everything will be taken care of. Another thing I've noticed where the superintendent is vitally interested in the exhibit, sometimes things have been put in the wrong class, perhaps where they could not get prizes. I 'think the type of superintendent is very important. A good superintendent can make or break an agricultural exhibit and determine its success. Whether a department, or class of exhibits, is going to be successful year after year depends not entirely on someone bringing in the stuff but whether it goes on the right table and is entered in the right class, and if it is put in proper containers. In some fairs the exhibits are not put in good containers, but maybe in just any kind of paste - board boxes, etc., and the whole exhibitions put up in an unattractive manner. Another thing is the condition of material. It does no good to have the material come in and then be allowed to decay, or to permit it to become covered with dust. It is a disgrace for a fair to have things of that kind to look after. Unless you have a good superintendent such things are liable to happen. Mr. Stewart was with you last year and discussed the matter of premium list revision. We looked over thirty-one premium lists and found lots of inconsistencies, according to our way of seeing. We find where the proper proportion or ration Is not carried out is be - tween major and minor crops as to the amount of money paid. There may be too little paid on one variety and not enough on another one. Another thing, in so many fairs where the first premium is seventy-five cents and they have fifty cents for the second. The amount of money may not be such an important thing as the way the money is distributed. You can get a lot more Interest by spreading what - ever money you have as far as it will go and perhaps having more premiums, or instead of having just a first and second, run it from first to fifth. Then an amateur can come in and get acquainted and you can get him interested. Where there is only a first and second in a project in which neither one gets very much money they don't want to compete for the purpose alone unless it is profitable. </seg>
            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE y Now with regard to scoring community exhibits, I don't Jind many of those fairs that 1 have recently judged, as 1 formerly did, that use score cards. When you ask a community to put up an exhibit there should be some kind of a score card to go by. This is an important feature. You should label the various varieties, not so much for the judges as to help educate those who view the exhibits. Now I know there are some things that concern the State Fair that should also be remedied. Mr. Jackson asked Mr. Stewart and myself to go over the State Fair premium list and work over some items. We made some suggestions there and the most of them were adopted. The main criticism that we found was that there was not enough weight given to some important crops and too many varieties were required. Now we don't want to work at cross purposes with the State Fair list in revising premium lists for the counties. Upon ait exten - sive survey I would recommend standardizing small grains and reduce as far as possible the number of varieties. In some places too much credit is given to minor varieties something like squash, melons or pumpkins being given sixty points,- and forty points to wheat or sixty to corn. This is an inconsistency that should be remedied in revision. The next speaker is one who knows his subject. For many years he was secretary of the Ak-Sar-Ben in Omaha, and I take pleasure in introducing to you Mr. Chas. R. Gardner, who Is now in the hotel business in Omaha, who will take the subject, "How the County Fair Can Help Its Community." HOW THE COUNTY PAIR CAN HELP ITS COMMUNITY By CHAS. R. GARDNER, Omaha, Nebraska Gentlemen: I have learned something here tonight. I came down here to make a speech and I find that Tom Ledley wrote out his remarks and then Otto Pfeiffer gets up and has everybody ask him questions, but I don't know whether to just talk to you or start Charley Graff out to asking questions of Otto Pfeiffer as to how Red Polled cattle ought to be classified. I was very much pleased when Elliott Davis asked me to say something on how the County Fair can best serve its community. I was very glad he called it Com - munity because I am one of those who believe the farmer is a part of the community and that these should still be Community Fairs instead of County Fairs or District Fairs. I have been convinced that county lines and state lines are for governmental purposes only and have no particular bearing as to exhibits or attendance at fairs. I don't believe that a county just across a line should be barred from exhibiting at a neighboring lair. </seg>
            <seg id="p115">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS I think one should be permitted to exhibit crops or animals and it he has better ones at our County Fair, even if he does live in the neighboring county. The purpose of a County Fair, like the State Fair, is education, and I don't, feel that we should deprive the people of our county from an opportunity to see everything worthwhile even if it is not produced in our own county. I believe it is our pur - pose to serve the people of our community rather than bar some exhibitors to protect others. I believe that the premiums should be as liberal as we can afford. I don't believe they should be so large as to encourage commercialism. It might do to bar professional ex - hibitors. Now I might come around to my subject, "How the County Fair Can Help Its Community." The biggest 'thing the County Fair can possibly do is to provide as many facilities as it can to display vhe products of its own community. I am convinced that the biggest job that a County Fair man or District Fair man or even a State Fair man can undertake is to sell his own fair to his particular community. I think that is absolutely vital. A manager or director of any lair can undertake nothing that is any more important. He has a big job ahead of him, and the first thing he must do is to get a lot of folks in his community interested to the extent of being a partner in the enterprises by getting them to put in some money. In the :lrst place you need money and in the second place don't forget the old adage that still rings true, that where a man's treasure is, there is his heart. If I have invested a few dollars in a certain fair then I am going to support it, and take a pride in having something invested in, say, your County Fair, and think of it as being better than any other institution. I remember an incident of meeting a couple of ladies soon after the eighteen-story building at Fourteenth and Farnam streets was completed. Their attention was called to this W. O. W. building. One of the proudly said, John has stock in that. He is a member in that. They took a pride in that. That is why we should have our people interested in the local fair, so they point, in and out of season, to a mutual interest. I genuinely believe you can serve your community in no better way than to thoroughly sell your County Fair to your own community. You say that conditions have changed as to County Fairs, like other things. A little while ago some of the older men like Mr. Graff, who live near Omaha, can remember coming down on especial trains to visit our old Ak-Sar-Ben and staying there for two or three days. Though there were crowds in town some of the business men would complain business was worse during that week than it was before or afterwards. The same is true in Lincoln as to the State Fair. But possibly many business men overlooked the fact that visitors may come in for the Ak-Sar-Ben, or the State Fair, or even to your town to the County Fair. They do not come right then to </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE shop or to transact business but they come back later during the year for those reasons and when they come to the fair they are getting acquainted with your town. So it is no excuse for the merchant or the business man to withdraw his support of the fair because he does not do a heavy business that particular week. He is contributing for the best welfare of the community and to build future profits when he Is helping to build an acquaintance with those who Indirectly support his community, and helping to build the livestock industry and agricultural pursuits. I think he should support the lair with all of his ability and bring about year after year a better support than the County Fair because of its educational value. The fair fur - nishes a show room and a place for agricultural industries to display their wares. And agriculture has been prompt to take advantage of the County Pair for this purpose. Now the next biggest asset that a County Fair can furnish, where the next most important task that a County Fair man can undertake, is to promote cleanliness in the fair. Any talr should be conducted so that a man will feel safe in bringing his family there and feel perfectly safe in having his children attend your fair. The County Fair can best serve a community by keeping a County Fair clean and having nothing there that a man wouldn't want his children or his neighbor's children to see. Fairs have come to the TJlace where it is going to be a survival of the fittest. In arriving at this purpose it does not mean that we are going to be unable to supply the desirable entertainment. Considerable can be accomplished with the use of home talent. I can not stop without saying something about the Boys and Girls work. To me that is the answer to many of the educational problems that you must meet. When it comes to the problems of the future we all appreciate that it is the boys and girls who are going to make this country and who are developing themselves along the lines that will prepare them to meet the future and we must offer them every opportunity to accomplish these things. The County Fair can serve its community in no better way than to exert every possible method of arousing the interest of the boys and girls in Its com - munity. I never ran a County Fair in my life so I can't tell you how to operate one, except to offer suggestions as an outsider. My business now is operating the Fontenelle hotel. My task is to sell it. But I have been interested in County Fairs along the side lines and I am just trying to tell you how the buyer looks at things in your line. </seg>
            <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS PRESIDENT CEDAR: I notice that among those present tonight Mr. L. I. Frisbee and he may have some message he can give for he has accomplished so much in the line just mentioned by the last speaker. MR. FRISBEE: I don't know as I have anything to add to this discussion tonight. I want to say that I appreciate the co-operation of the many County Fairs and of the County Fair association of Nebraska. You all know .that the 4-H Club work has made quite a phenomenal growth in the last ten or fifteen years in this state. I don't believe we have had anything that has contributed much more to this growth than the opportunities that have been given to us through the County Fairs and State Fairs. Something was said a few moments ago about professionalism. That has been a subject about which there has always been a lot of question and which is a question that has always been a problem and confronted 4-H Club activities. I was glad to know that you had discussed at some length as to the adult exhibitors. It is a matter that also affects 4-H Club exhibitors. The way it arises there is whether they should be allowed to come in and compete with open classes. That is a question and is probably asked of me more than of any in connection with fairs. I am not going to answer it except to submit a couple of remarks; one is that boys and girls showing as a 4-H Club exhibitor should limit his class of exhibit so that there is really no comparison with similar material with the open classes. I think there is too much encouragement and too much interest in premium money being given to boys and girls entering in both classes. Some fairs answer this question in this way by not letting champion - ship enter both open class and 4-H exhibits. I might illustrate one of these by an example in the state corn showing one exhibitor had a junior class, in 4-H Club division and an open class. When he wins the championship in one class he should hardly be allowed to pome into both classes. It becomes a question of what effect that will have on the showing in that class for it encourages and interests that border closely on the professional line. That comes to the ques-_ tlon that whether a boy in the 4-H Club work should be allowed to exhibit in more than one show. ■ For the. first thing he knows he will be making a circuit, then he will come back next year to compete against his fellow club members who have not had that advantage. I have in mind one instance where a representative from a certain county has shown in five different shows. I don't know what you think of it but I don't think that boy has any business in a 4-H class. He is getting pretty close to the professional line. As a result and similar experiences the Extension Service has made a rule this year that it will not certify such exhibitors for more than one show in the baby beef class and it will not certify individuals for more than two shows. We will be glad to have the reaction of this Association on a few. of those points and your reaction will serve to govern us </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to quite an extent in running this 4-H class. Again, before sitting down, I want to thank you very kindly for the co-operation you have given to the 4-H Club work in the state of Nebraska. MR. MEAD, Garfield County: Every year the 4-H Club work in our county has shown ever since it was organized twelve years ago. I have felt all that time that it was the greatest accomplishment our fair has made. Sometimes we have not had it in an official class and we may have sometimes violated the rules of the state organiza - tion. Whenever it verges upon the edge of professionalism then we may be doing more damage than good. Whenever they' get too 'much interest in the money feature then there is a loss in the educational value of this work. I know we can't be too careful about not getting over the line. MR. MARSHALL, of Washington County: I would like to ask Mr. Frisbee what he considers the right kind of a premium, and the right amount, so far as baby beef and swine exhibits are concerned with respect to the open class. We are giving the higher premiums in the 4-H Club cattle exhibits than we are in the open classes. Are we doing the right thing? MR. FRISBEE: I don't know how much you are giving. When you put the prizes up higher than where it will more than pay the expenses to the fair, ordinarily you are getting on dangerous ground with it. We feel that the average premium ought to come somewhere near the average expenses of showing at the fair and perhaps allow - ing the exhibitors to make a little money, but we do not want it to do any more than to encourage them to come to the fair. I do not know that the relationship between the open class and the club class makes so much difference and that they barely make expenses. At this point, the meeting was adjourned, at 9:27 P. M. o'clock, until the following (Tuesday) morning at 9:00 o'clock A. M. </seg>

            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE CLEAN SHOWS AND QUESTIONABIiK GAM MS TOR COUNTY FAIRS' By A. H. MILLER. Blair I am somewhat like a person who is talking about something because it is given to him, when I think the subject should be dis - cussed by a person who has had more experience with the topic. Here I am to talk about something that affects children, and I have no children. Like an old maid she is generally a better judge of how to bring up children than one who has them. But we always have this question of clean shows and questionable games with us. These are questions that have been discussed in practically every County Fair meeting we have had in one or other. It is well that it should be, because we are living in a progressive age; an age in which we cannot stand still. Just as Charley Graff said yesterday, most of us can remember of the joy we had as boys on the occasions of a holiday or when we went to the fair. I can remember when my father said tomorrow was the Fourth of July and we were all going to town. What a good time we . had and then what an occasion it was when we could go to the fair. As a child when I had ten cents I felt as rich as Croesus. I can remember then when I had fifty cents I was quite proud. 1 felt like when I was with a boy who had fifty cents whose father had given him that he should have somebody with him to guard that much money. Nowadays what would a boy think about fifty cents. He would probably say I can't even buy my cigarettes with that. In the old days we went to Omaha or to some city perhaps once a year or once in two years. By reason of this it gave a thrill to a boy or a girl who got such an infrequent trip to a town or a city. But what 2; has happened? Those times ha.ve all passed away and we have gone into a new era. Now coming to the next question. The questions of clean shows and questionable games are very closely related. First, can we risk rare and racy games to gain interest? When the automobile first began going around the track I remember the first time I saw the old death dealing 999 of Barney Oldfield. We stood aghast and saw them line up, and looked at them, and I can see that 999 yet and how that car looked. I was a young boy but I have never seen anything that looked as beautiful as that car did. Then we had the aeroplane and we stood and watched it with its wings spread out like a bird. To us it was a new marvel and wonder, and what a wonderful inspiration it was to us that we could have things like that. Then later on I remember when we watched one of these giroplanes. The people just stood and looked at it. But now that has lost its wonder and would no longer give a thrill.' Now the question arises as to what we are going to do to give them a greater thrill. What next are we going to display, or produce or </seg>
            <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS arouse them? It. isn't sufficient in this day and age that they have something that has excited them. So we wonder what a fair can offer them next. But I think we are coming to recognize now that a Fair is estab - lished upon two priciples; first, it is an educational institution, and second, it is for entertainment. We must not forget the fact that due to the educational feature, it is operated to a large extent by or upon the taxpayers' money. Every county in the state gets from $2,000 up of the taxpayers' money. You cannot spend the taxpayers' money without rendering a strict account of how you spend it. Of course, you spend it all it is true for premiums and the construction of build - ings, but we can't, on the other hand, be careless or unwilling to show the people just what we do with the money and what we get tor them for what we spend. Now we come to- the question of clean shows and questionable games and first we might ask what are questionable shows? Now they faced that problem at the State Fair and it was charged then, but, under certain circumstances, that it would be disastrous to limit the shows too closely. But the management cleaned them up and there has been very little complaint about It but a great deal of com - mendation. I think there is no question but what the day of the hootchy kootchy and the muscle dancer has gone. I remember at Omaha in 1898 they had such things, but they don't have them at fairs and expositions very much any more. But with these kinds of shows wiped out, we do have another problem left. This may not seem so bad but it deserves some atten - tion. What we are confronted with today is the questionable story, the smutty story, the parlor story. How you are going to clean them up is the present problem. The first course is to take the matter ■ up with the management of the show. I have always found that they can be reasoned with as individuals.. If they don't listen to reason then you can tell them that if they don't clean that thing up the whole show will have to get out. We haven't got the unclean shows that we had years ago, the problem now is in regard to these stories. We must admit that if we are going to consider the fair as an educa - tional institution we cannot tolerate these stories. We are not going to reach a Utopian condition or idea but we are not going to revert to the old conditions. Unless we build upon these ideals, our fairs are not to be a success, but if we hitch our ideals to a star we will get a little closer and closer. Of course, it is a question of whose judgment you can accept in looking at this problem and in determining what is clean and which Is unclean. That is a good deal a matter of locality. I spent a few years in Colorado among the miners and found that their ideas of what is an unclean show or a clean show is entirely different from that of people living in an agricultural community. You take with </seg>
            <seg id="p122">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE relation to the dancing girls such things as they tolerated and en - joyed, cannot prevail in an agricultural community. The same thing is true of dance halls. S'uch places in an agricultural community would be shunned and a woman who. would go down there would he shunned and shamed in the community. Out there they accepted anything and everybody on their face value. In such a community everybody tolerated the other person's attitude but that would not be true in our vicinity. Now as to Questionable Games. A few years ago we had games of different kinds at the State Fair. They were divided into two kinds. There were the games of chance and the games of skill. The big question in regard to games is where they place the line of demarcation between the games of skill and the games of chance. We say games of skill because they claim that distinction as being different from the games of chance. In the games of chance the chances were against the player with a result that those who patronize the games had a poor chance to win. We have in the past found many instances where by some manipulation the operator of the game would get the best of it. But it has been considered that, there was no sense of cutting out all the games of skill. What we tried to do at the State Fair was to create a situation where people would no longer come to us and say that their boy or girl came in with enough money to have a good time but I have been relieved of it at some game. Xow in the County Fairs there has been considerable improve - ment. In some places they still have the corn game while the roulette wheel is gone to some extent they still have the blanket game. In some of these games where there were clever manipulations the boys didn't care if they lost twenty-five cents but the temptation is to keep on bucking the game until they have lost every dollar they may have. This is something that should be eliminated in a fair. It doesn't avail a fair in such communities as ours to have these questionable games. What we want most of all to guard against is the use of these games of chance. They are not like where two men may play cribbage or play cards for the chances are we may run pretty even, but when you come up against these questionable games you generally find it is not a case of an even chance but the man running the game has about ninety-two and you have eight, and that is what we want to clean out. That is what our communities want us to avoid. It is a matter therefore for each individual to look at if they are going to accuse the fair management of being careless if you do not handle this In a way to safeguard the community. There may be some little things go on that you can overlook. You may say some of these are not serious, that you have got to have the money. When you have a fair almost on the bed rock it is tempting to permit some of these things to go on but you must not forget that the primary </seg>
            <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS purpose of our fairs is to make them an educational institution, and that entertainment must remain incidentally. Our fairs are not built in a day but by many years of hard labor. Only the final results show and not the days and hours of hard labor and the burning of midnight oil of those who built up the enterprise- in the still small hours of the night when all of the world sleeps about them. Some shows and some games might be made profitable but we must ask if these shows are proper for the community and if the games will harm the patrons. You must look out for the welfare of the games and have your shows clean and protect your patrons and your com - munity. . , PRESIDENT CEDAIt: Are there any questions that you want to ask of Mr. Miller on this subject before we take up the next topic? MR. PIPAL, of Richardson County: I have been very much inter - ested In what Mr. Miller has had to say. Since we started the Rich - ardson County Fair eleven years ago one of the things we especially impressed before starting out at all was that we wanted to make it a clean enterprise; presented in an improper angle would not be tol - erated at all. The worst we have was the corn or the blanket game. Last year there was some thought of cutting that out. But there was some difference of opinion. PRESIDENT CEDAR: The next speaker will take as his topic, "'Getting Your County Back of Your Own Fair" and this subject will be discussed by Alvah It. Hecht of Buffalo County. MR. HECHT: Mr.. Chairman and Gentlemen: I suppose I am called upon to tell you how you are going to dig out of trouble any county fairs that are in difficulty. A year ago our County Fair was in such difficulty that a committee of the Chamber of Commerce met with the board and it was almost deemed advisable to either abandon the fair or make a street carnival of it. Then the Farm Bureau Federation decided to make an objection. They felt that everyone would some day live to regret it if we abandon the county fair. They decided to undertake the job and they issued a challenge, so this last year the Farm Bureau managed our County Fair. I think ypu will find it of interest to briefly survey the results of their efforts. The first thing they did was to make a survey of why public opinion seemed to be against the County Fair. Because that is what it was. In the first place we had three communities adjacent to Kearney that seemed to be trying in every way to work to prejudice, and these town jealousies were working adversely to its ' interests. We began to wonder why this public opinion and we asked other organizations to come to a conference so we could get their reaction as to why the County Fair was not going over. We found that many people were objecting to the fact that the management had been allowed too much lee-way for a carnival, and that a lot of </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE people objected to all the money going to the races and other people felt that one year after another they were having the same stuff over and over again. Then they found again that no budget had been made. The management had no idea what the expenses or the income were before they started on their work. Therefore, the first thing we decided on was to make out a budget showing the anticipated income and probable expenses. We used as a basis the financial statements which had been, filed with the State Board each year, showing the amount of money that had been received from all sources, then we analyzed their expenditures. In that way we used figures based upon experience and put in everything which seemed applicable to a fair association. We decided that we could raise this revenue by the sale of Fam - ily Season tickets. Then it was necessary to decide what kind of a program we would have. It this is not prepared properly the whole thing is a flop. It doesn't matter if it is a vaudeville act or what it is you put on if it doesn't go over with the people it is a failure. If you put on a program and it doesn't go over with the crowd it is wasted effort. Why did your president bring your meeting up to this room yesterday instead of having it in one of the large rooms? You know that your crowd filled the smaller room and you were closer together. If you had spread yourselves around one of the big rooms you would have been lost and the program would not have gone over. In other words, it is a matter of mob psychology. That is what we decided, that we wanted to measure our crowds then find out what they would want. If we could get the sanve amount of money that has been used in other years we could use it to enter - tain and educate a larger crowd. So we decided upon the use of the Family Season ticket. We decided it would cost us no more to admit a family of twelve children than a smaller number. We knew the many large families had avoided attendance at County Fairs because they couldn't afford the money to take them all to a fair where there was a charge to every one down the line. So we put on a season ticket of two dollars and would admit the entire family Including the car. Some fellows were inclined to say you can't do it, it is impos - sible; you will go busted. We decided, however, to sell one thousand Family Season tickets before the gates opened and that would give us two thousand dollars and with that much the fair could be a success. That left single admissions at fifty cents, at twenty-five cents at night with the car free, and the quarter stretch . at a dime and the grandstand at a quarter. The year before the quarter stretch at twenty-five cents they took in nine dollars and it cost them twelve dollars to collect it. In our budget we decided on a certain sum that should be appropriated for advertising. That advertising money was turned over to a news- </seg>
            <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS paper man. Another thing this group decided was to cut out a com - plimentary ticket and that was done and even the directors bought their own tickets, and the President and Secretary; the whole outfit bought Family Season tickets at two dollars apiece. And only fourteen complimentary tickets were Issued; seven to supervisors and the others to newspapers, but we paid the newspapers for the material they ran in their papers. We sent them so much money and told them to use it as they saw fit. We only asked them to run what they thought best. At the annual meeting of the Farm Bureau we asked George Jackson to come up there and talk to us in regard to the management of the County Fair. He told us what he would do if he was in our position and how he thought it could be done. The local people were given a chance to say what the program should be and it was- decided very largely to use local county people. First, we decided to do away with the horse races on which they had spent from eighteen hundred on up the preceding • years. They de - cided to invite local talent to a very large extent. We had a parade every 'day with floats and these parades were quite successful. There was a live stock parade and the 4-H. Clubs had their parades. We had a base ball tournament between various organizations, largely fostered by the Legion, and the various posts among the Legion com - peted and furnished this feature for the County Fair. Then we had a horse pulling machine. This was such an attraction that one day it delayed the program over an hour because we couldn't start any - thing else until that was over. A band of Indians came down from a reservation. They proved to be quite an attraction. We saw them kill a beef and draw it, and they even butchered a dog and we had novelty races and a pig race and several acts, all high class stuff. Then when It came to the night show of which we had never had before, we also used local talent; the first night we had a glee club; the second, we put on an amateur, and the third night we had a style show. That night the grand stand was filled and the quarter - stretcli was filled. Then there was a county beauty contest and health show that didn't go over so well with us. We had sold nine hundred and seventy-two Family Season tickets. We paid $3,000 on premiums. This year everybody brought in some more exhibits. It cost us two hundred dollars more for premiums than we had fig - ured on but we had made $1,450 according to our budget, so we met the two hundred fifty dollars excess for premiums and three hundred dollars on an old account and six hundred dollars interest to pay, so that left only three hundred dollars to apply on a building. But we felt satisfied; we only made three hundred dollars; as we had molded public opinion back of the County Fair. We had cut out the carnival for we felt- that we couldn't afford to have it as long as some of the people felt they were getting gyped. I don't believe there is anything farther that I have to say. I think you can put across a successful County Fair in any county if </seg>

If you will only make a budget and then don't let anybody sell you on the idea of going beyond this budget and of buying more than you can pay for. 1 want to thank you. MR. SMILEY, of Seward County: I would now like to renew my motion of yesterday: that the dues of this Association, for the com - ing year (1933) be reduced from $10.00 to $5.00 per county. As I understand it, we now belong to the National Association, which takes $50.00 a year. Mr. Sunderman stated yesterday, that in his opinion the trip to Chicago by one of our officers costing around $75.00 is not worth while and thereby the organization pays out $125.00 a year and gets practically no good whatever out of that item. If. the dues can be reduced $5.00 a year, let's do It. If not, let's have them remain at $10.00. It seems to me we can elim - inate this and perhaps some other expense, especially by dropping out of the National organization. Motion seconded by Newcomer of Polk County. MR. SUNDERMAN, of Madison County: I would still like to know if Mr. Cedar attended the National convention in 1931. PRESIDENT CEDAR: I must reply there has been no such meet - ling as yet held. The Fair Association was booked to meet in Toronto, Canada, but the meeting was transferred back to Chicago, and then booked or put over until time of the International and then post - poned until February. I don't know whether this organization can get by with $5.00 a year or not. I remember some years ago the dues were $5.00 and then they were raised to $7.00 and then we got behind some and they were raised to $10.00. Motion was amended from the floor to make the dues $7.00, the last preceding former figure. MR. EKSTRAND, of Burt County: Again may it be asked what expenses there are, to meet this year, for this meeting? I ask that in order that we may get an idea what to do in this matter. MR. DAVIS: Last year the expenses were $342.46 (Secretary then read the specific items as shown in report rendered Monday). You understand that heretofore we have borne half of the expense of the evening annual banquet, with the State Fair Board. This year this task may fall upon us alone, and even handling it perhaps more economically we must prepare for that task. MR. DOBBS, of Perkins County: I think most of the men here are business men, and many of you belong to Chambers of Commerce and various civic organizations. You know this small amount of money is not going to break or make any fair affiliated with this association. 1 don't think if we feel we can afford to keep this </seg>

Box Butte delegate seconded $7.00 dues amendment. PRESIDENT CEDAR: That would be for 1933, not affecting this present year. Now, are you ready to vote upon this question? All in favor of the adoption of the amendment (four votes so cast). All against said amendment so signify (seventeen votes so cast). The amendment and the proposal are lost. i Now you will vote upon the proposal to reduce from $10.00 to $5.00.

GRAFF, of Ginning County: I think it has been the custom in the past for this organization, where we have elected a President and received good satisfactory service from him, to ask him when he has served one year and stayed out of jail, to stay with us another year. So I take pleasure in placing in nomination for President for the ensuing year P. P. Cedar. Nomination seconded. ' No other nominations being forthcoming, it was moved by Mr. Graff, that the nominations be closed, the rules suspended and the Secretary instructed to cast the unanimous vote of this Association for Mr. Cedar for President. Motion put to a vote by Mr. Graff, carried and Secretary followed instructions and Mr. Cedar was declared elected. PRESIDENT CEDAR: I thank you folks. I appreciate the honor and I am glad to work longer with you folks. I have enjoyed myself in this work during the past year. We will now proceed to the elec - tion of a Vice-President. HENRY SUNDERMAN: I would just like to adopt the speech Mr. Graff made and substitute the name of our present Vice-President, so I make the nomination of Otto Pfeiffer for Vice-Presldent. Nomination seconded. There being no other nominations, motion made by Mr. Henry Kuhi of Wayne that rules be suspended, nominations closed and unanimous ballot cast by Secretary for Mr. Pfeiffer. Voted and carried and ballot so cast and Mr. Pfeiffer declared elected. VICE-PRESIDENT PFEIFFER: I thank you for the honor; the duties have not been very heavy in the past year, but I stand ready to do all in my power to assist in every way possible.

MR. MITCHELL: There has already been some discussion here as to our having a representative in attendance at the annual meet - ing of the National Association. It seems that a number of the representatives who have per - formed this function of attendance in recent years are questioning the advisability of that expenditure. I had the pleasure of being that representative on two different occasions. I personally got a lot of pleasure, benefit and experience and I tried to bring back a report that would be of some aid to the association. I think there may be reason for the State Fair Board continuing this affiliation, but there seems to be a question in the minds of many here about this Associa - tion doing so. I agreed to make this motion, that we cancel our membership in the National organization. Seconded by Mr. Sunder - man. I told you yesterday how I viewed this matter. I feel the same as Mr. Mitchell, we perhaps can get along without this expenditure. MR. MEAD, of Garfleld County: I just believe we should con - tinue our membership in the National organization. It seems to me the same sound philosophy so dictates that rules the county fair can derive benefit from this organization, it goes also we can from the national.

Miller of Washington County briefly discoursed, and Irl Tolen of Ord preceded Dean W. W. Burr of the State Agricultural College. He brought both the greetings of the faculty and student body of the Agricultural College, with their thanks and that of the Extension service for the close co-operation and inspirational help of .this Association, and pledged the support of everyone toward meeting the present problems. • Otto Pfeiffer, Vice-President of the Association, gave a few serious remarks upon the earnest attitude shown by those present in tackling the present situation. The meeting was then turned back to Ted North, who rapidly presented a series of entertainment numbers presented by courtesy of some of the concession people who were present at the gatherings. Lyck Fireworks Co. of Omaha presented Bob Lee; Rainbow Rivitt; a little girl tap dancer; a singer; another girl tap dancer. Then a chorus gave a series of numbers; two dancers delightfully pre - sented several numbers. Little Billy Withers then displayed a series of marvelous athletic maneuvers and feats.

            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE ANNUAL MESSAGE OP THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEBRASKA CHOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION C. Y. THOMPSON, West Point; Nebraska I was very much surprised to learn at the Crops Day meeting last summer that 1 had been selected by your board of directors to succeed Mr. Magee as President of the Nebraska Corp Growers' Asso - ciation, and wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the honor bestowed upon me. While I do not expect to be able to till the shoes of my very able predecessor, Mr. Magee, who is now a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I will do my best to help further the interests of the organization, because I believe I fully realize the importance of the work so successfully carried on up to the present time. ' I was a member of the old Corn Growers' Association before the Crop Growers' came into existence, and conducted variety and ear to row tests for the Department of Agriculture before the State College or the Extension Service were organized to do such work. So, you see, I am an old dyed-in-the-wool crop grower, and while I have not taken an active part in the deliberations and activities of the organization in recent years, I have attended the meetings, and am still a firm believer in the value of the work to be accomplished. For as farming ad - vances from a mere speculative venture into the realm of a real honest to goodness business, our work becomes more and more valuable. In the early day farming was more or less a speculative venture. Land was cheap, taxes were low, we had no rural free delivery, and there - fore no need for daily papers and magazines, we had no automobiles, radios, or picture shows, to say nothing of modern conveniences such as furnaces, telephones, running water in the house, etc., and the need for education was not appreciated as it is today. To save was our chief reliance for success. As time went on, however, we felt more and more the need of modern conveniences, and we began to take pride in our homes and our calling. Fortunately at about the same time land values began to increase, so if we did not have the ready money to meet our needs, we. simply put a mortgage on the place. We got by with this method by financing ourselves so con - veniently that some of us sincerely believed that we were really a success as farmers, and felt that we did not need the county agent, the extension service or the experiment station, for the reason that we did not need anybody to tell us how to farm. However, since the speculative value of land has, like many of our liquid assets, evaporated into thin air, farming has become a real serious business. And, if we expect to continue in our calling, we will have to be up </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION on our toes and ever alert to grasp new ideas and put into practice up to the minute farm methods. Production Problems Still Important Practically every great industry has its research department and the highest salaried men in their employ are the research men. So let us not stand in our own light in such an important matter. Make two blades of grass grow where one grew before should be our slogan, which does not necessarily mean that we should produce more, but that we should by this means cut the cost of production. Our econ - omists tell us that a dollar saved in the cost of production is as good as two dollars added to the market price. So cutting the cost of production is good business.' But it is not only good business; when we have cut costs to the bone we can, with better grace, make demands for favorable legislation. Mr. Gross brought out this point very nicely last year. .He said, "If a farmer raised 35 bushels of corn per acre and sold it for 50 cents per bushel, he made just 6 cents per acre." Whatever he raised more than that would have been velvet. Xeed of Crop Standardization The work of developing high yielding hardy varieties of corn, grains, and grasses and their certification and distribution is in line with the progressive policy of big business. It is the chief aim and purpose of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association, and the work is of inestimable value to the farmers of the state. I will venture to say that farmers have lost more money by trying out new highly advertised untried varieties of crops than they ever lost in the blue sky. I would have been ?300.00 ahead myself one year if I had put my entire acreage into the tried and true Kherson oats which I had successfully raised for many years. But I yielded to the temptation of an eastern seed house, that agreed to furnish the seed, which was not to be paid for until the grain was harvested. I was to pay market price for the seed, and they were to get half the profits which were received over and above the market price when sold as seed. As I have alreadytold you, I lost J300.00 on the venture, which confirmed my belief that farmers generally, who raise grains and grasses as part of their farming operations can well afford to become life members of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association for the saving and pro - tection they receive from the trial and certification' of seed crops, which have proven their merits against standard varieties, before they are put on the market for distribution. New Crops Hare Been Profitable The distribution of the old Kherson oats is a fine example of the point I am trying to bring out here. Prof. F. W. Taylor, then Superintendent of Farmers Institutes in Nebraska, sent from Russia </seg>
            <seg id="p138">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the original yellow Kherson oats to the Nebraska Agricultural Experi - ment Station. Evidently after a fair trial with other standard varie - ties in those days, it gave a good account of itself for along about 1903 or 1904 Prof. T. L. Lyon, in order to find out its general adaptation and yielding ability, sent half bushel samples to farmers willing to co-operate in various parts of the state. I remember dis - tinctly, I seeded my half bushel broadcast on a half acre of ground and got 32 bushels of oats. The next year I seeded this 32 bushels on 16 acres and got 40 bushels per acre. In those days we stacked all our grain, and we had our Kherson oats all harvested and stacked before the old standard side oats commonly grown then were ready to cut. While we were waiting for our late oats to ripen, a storm took it down and we harvested 20 bushels per acre of oats that weighed 21 pounds per bushel. It Is needless to say that after that we never raised anything but Kherson oats. At first farmers were skeptical, because the kernels were small and the shock never seemed to stand as thick as the old side oats. However, the threshing machine furnished undisputable evidence of the superiority of the Kherson oats, and in a few years time this place became, a distributing point lor Kherson seed oats. It is hard to estimate the value of the introduction of Kherson oats into the United States but over a series of years this has no doubt amounted to millions of dollars. In Nebraska an improved strain of Kherson oats known as Nebraska 21 is now widely grown —-occupying, it is thought, about 65 per cent of the total oat acreage of the state. This variety as shown by tests outyields the ordinary Kherson by well over a bushel per acre and in addition has a better and stiffer straw and a more attractive color. The growing of Ne - braska 21 instead of the original Kherson means an annual increased yield of more than 1,500,000 bushels which, valued at 30 cents, would amount to approximately ?450,000 annually. This is but one example of the many ways in which our Agricultural Colleges and the Exten - sion Service has contributed to the welfare of us farmers, and makes it possible for us to cope with the new economic situation. Annual Reports Valuable The Nebraska Crop Growers Association has been doing valuable work and deserves the support of every progressive farmer in the state. Our annual reports so ably edited by our secretary, Mr. Stewart, are masterpieces of agricultural information and should be available for every farmer. Yet we must not rest on -our laurels, for inconceivable as it may seem we have farmers and other organizations resoluting against the county agent and trying to belittle the work of the Extension Service and our Agricultural school.

Certified Seed Work One of the most important activities of the Association during the 1931 year was the seed certification work. Under the new certi - fied seed law, passed by the last legislature, the Dean of the Agri - cultural College appointed the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association as the oilicial organization for the certification of small grain and alfalfa. Under the authority thus granted, standards for certification were followed as outlined in the 1931 annual report. Byron Tharp was hired by the association to do the field inspection work. One hundred and two farmers, living in 40 counties over the state, applied for the certification of one or more varieties of small grain.

A fund of $150.00 was given by the Association toward expenses of the Nebraska College of Agriculture Collegiate Crops Judging Team which competed at Kansas City and at the International Show. The sum of $100 was also contributed toward the expenses of the 4-H Crops Judging Team which competed at the International Hay and Grain .Show. The Association offered four trophies for the Voca - tional Agriculture Crops Judging and Crops Identification Contests held at the North Platte Experiment Station and at the Nebraska College of Agriculture. The Association offered $120 in cash prizes to winners in the 1931 Ten-acre Corn Yield Contest. Medals were also presented by the Association to winners in the Eastern, Central, Western and Irrigated sections and to the county champions. A total of 162 men finished the 1931 corn yield contest. In 1931, the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association initiated a new class of corn known as the Mar - ket Corn Class. This consisted of field run samples taken from the contest fields. Twenty pounds of field run corn was selected in the field in the fall and this was shelled and entered in the Market Corn Class without grading or any artificial preparation. These samples were judged from the standpoint of market corn. This contest created so much interest that it was continued again. in the 1932 show. The usual ten-ear and single-ear show was held during the 1932 Organized Agriculture meetings. </seg>

SNYDER Rural Economics Department When nature deposited huge beds of nitrate in Chile, she created the setting for one of the world's greatest monopolies. For many years the world was almost entirely dependent upon Chile for its supply or nitrate for fertilizer and for explosives. This monopoly was not disturbed until manufactured nitrates became important and even as late as 1913 Chile produced almost 55 per cent of the world's supply. The industry is even more important to Chile than to the rest of the world. As a source or revenue to the government, the industry lias been one of the most important, furnishing from 25 to 50 per cent or the total governmental revenue. For example, the exports of nitrates made up 51 per cent of the total exports of Chile and exceeded the next nearest product, copper, by 20 to 25 per cent. From 1897 to 1930 the government received an export tax of 56 cents per hundred pounds. The attitude of the government has varied from that of the tax gatherer to that of a partner in the business. During the years prior to 1919 the chief Interest of the government was in securing the export tax or 5 6 cents a hundred weight. This attitude changed after the government had formally approved the statutes of the Chilean Nitrate Producers Association in 1919. This association controlled the industry. When the government began to take an active part in the organ - ization in 1919 it exerted pressure upon the few producers who had refused to Join and rorced them into the association. The two Ameri- </seg>
            <seg id="p142">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE can owned companies never joined because of our Sherman Anti-trust Law, although they followed all the rules of the association and sold at the prices established for the year. The board of directors was. made up of eighteen members, four of whom were appointed by the President of Chile and represented the interests of the government. This board had power to establish rules, determine the quota each company should produce, and to set the price that should be charged the consumer during the year. Eighty per cent of the directors had to agree upon the price named before the association was bound. As an aid to the association the government reduced railroad rates on nitrates, petroleum and coal and granted members of the association exemption from import duties on bags for exporting nitrates. It also established a Nitrate Bank with government funds and was a great factor in establishing a joint selling agency in 1928. In May of 1928 the government announced that a bonus would be. given to the Chilean producer through the year 1928-1929. This bonus to be equivalent to any reduction of price which was agreed upon by the German Syndicate in its June meeting. In spite of all these provisions the organization was unable to carry on successfully. In 1929 an agreement was entered into with other nations which attempted to stabilize world prices. This agree - ment could not be renewed in 1930 because of the refusal to restrict output by certain countries that were not producing enough for their own use. This refusal made it necessary for further reorganization in the industry and on July 21, 1930, the president of Chile signed a law chartering a corporation for the production of nitrates. This company, known as the "Cosach," is to run sixty years and has 3. 000, 000, 000 pesos stock. The government of Chile received the 1,500,000,000 pesos of Series "A" stock and the balance (known as the Series "B" stock) was distributed among the producing compan - ies. In addition to membership in the corporation the government released the Cosach from payment of the export duties, while other producers who remain outside must pay these duties. The Cosach is managed by a board of twelve directors;- four are appointed by the government for four years and have l*ie veto power over all resolu - tions which affect national interests, seven are elected for one year by the nitrate producers who hold Series "B", common stock and one by the holders of Series "B". preferred stock. The corporation has received valuable concessions in nitrate lands from the government of Chile. In 1930 the corporation made another agreement with cer - tain-European companies by which each is to contribute toward a fund which will be used to reimburse producers who lose money by restricting production to 70 per cent of their capacity. Chile was not restricted In its quota of the world's output which was a big advantage. </seg>
            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS" ASSOCIATION The Effect of Price Fixing The Chilean government always considered the revenue producing powers of the industry of greatest importance. F.or example, since the government revenues increased only as the exports of nitrate increased, it meant more money for the government if the price was low enough to stimulate consumption and to increase exports. For this reason the four government representatives always voted with the group of producers whose production costs ware the lowest and who profited most by greater volume of sales. Now some questions arise concerning the control exercised in this industry. 1. How has it affected the consumer of nitrates? 2. How has it affected the producer of natural nitrates? 3. How has it affected the producer of manufactured nitrates? In the iirst case, the consumer has paid more for his nitrates than he would under free competition. If competition were free, more capital would move into such an industry and individual plants would .expand until costs and prices were brought down. Another evidence of monopoly prices was the price of quotas. Under the plan of organization, each company was allotted certain amounts of the yearly output of the country. These companies could either sell their quotas or produce them and for some years certain high cost com - panies found it to their advantage to sell their quotas to other com - panies whose costs were lower. Had the price of quotas been made less, these marginal producers would have made more money by pro - ducing their own quota and if the price was more, there would have been too few buyers whose costs were low enough to make it profitable to buy these quotas. Had free competition existed, it is probable that the lower cost producers would have expanded their production and lowered the price of their product. This would have stimulated con - sumption and lowered marginal costs and as a result the less efficient producers would have dropped out. The second question concerning the effect upon the producer has different answers. Those inefficient producers have been enabled to make some money and the more efficient ,a great deal of money. The most efficient firms have not been enabled to increase their output except in cases where they could buy quotas enough and as a result, they have been forced to operate with lowered efficiency. However, the worst effect has come from the stimulation of out - side competition as this table clearly shows: </seg>

Even the government of Chile suffered because of the loss of revenue through lower output and because of the bonus paid producers when - ever the Germans reduced prices below that established by the asso - ciation. As a consequence other industries were forced to make up these losses in government revenue and also suffered. In spite of almost ideal conditions for a monopoly, such as were faced by the producers of Chile, their efforts have not been entirely successful. Outside competition has increased rapidly and has finally forced them to include other producers in the monopoly group and eventually, to remove the export duties and to reorganize the entire industry into one giant corporation. </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA CROP. GROWERS- ASSOCIATION THE STEVENSON PLAN OF CONTROLLING THE PRICE OF RUBBER RICHARD COLE Rural Economics Department The Stevenson Plan of rubber price control was a plan by which the British hoped to control the price of raw rubber. During the post-war deflation the rubber plantation owners in the British colonies formed an association for the purpose of stabilizing rubber prices. This association failed and they called on the government for help. The government responded with the Stevenson Plan of rubber price control. The discussion of the subject may be divided into three parts: ( 1 ) History of rubber production up to the time of the Stevenson l'lan, (2) the Stevenson Plan, its organization and how it operated, and ( :: ) the reasons for its failure. (1) Rubber Production from 1008 to .1922 The quantity' of rubber used was not-very great prior to 1908. In the period, 1908 to 1910, the demand for rubber increased, due largely to its use for the manufacture of automobile tires. As a result, the price of raw rubber increased from 58 cents a pound in 1908 to $1.05 a pound in 1911. High Price Resulted in High Production The increase in the price of rubber to a dollar and more per pound affected rubber producers to about the same extent as a doubling of the price of wheat would affect Nebraska wheat producers. They increased their plantings in anticipation of continued high prices and large proiits. The production of rubber Is, however, very different from the production of wheat. The plantings which were made in 1910 to 1912 did not come into bearing until 1917 and 1918. Rubber plantings continue producing for a number of years very much like an apple orchard. As it happened, these 1910-1912 plantings came into production during the period of war-time inflation and as a result the market absorbed the increased supply without a decrease in price. More plantings were made In the belief that the high price would continue. Then came the post-war deflation and the price of crude rubber de - clined until it was selling for less than 20 cents a pound. A planter could either abandon his plantings and lose his entire investment or he could collect sap and sell rubber at a low price. Practically all of the planters chose the latter alternative, because a low rate of </seg>
            <seg id="p146">REPORT 01' NEBRASKA STATE BO AftDtH^Cjn CULTURE return with the hope of better prices at some future time was less distasteful than accepting a complete loss. When the price continued low, the plantation owners in the British East Indies followed the long established custom of industries facing disaster and appealed to the government for aid. The result of this appeal was the formation and consummation of the Stevenson i'lan of price control of rubber. (2) The Stevenson Plan, Its Organization, and How It Operated On Novemmber 1, 1922, the Stevenson Plan went into effect. The plan was an elaborate scheme whereby the production of rubber was controlled by the limitation of exports. Great Britain and her colonies produced 67 per cent of the world's rubber supply in 1922 and they believed that this was enough to control the world's market. The government assigned each plantation a standard, of produc - tion based on 1920 output and then provided that the quantity ex - ported should vary with the price in London. The quantity exported was to be a percentage of the assigned standard of production and was to be regulated every three months by the variation of price in London from a basic price for the preceding three months. That is, if the prices ranged above the basic price for the preceding three months, then the quantity to be exported was increased; if the price ranged below the fixed price, then the quantity "to be exported was decreased. The effect of the enactment of this plan was very pleasing to the plantation owners. The price of rubber increased to nearly 40 cents in the spring of 1923. The fixed price was about 34 cents. The increase in price was due primarily to large purchases of rubber by the tire manufacturers who feared that the supply was threatened and wished to accumulate a reserve. But the restrictions did not •reduce the supply and by the summer of 1924 the price was again down below 20 cents. The supply was not materially reduced because the act affected only 67 per cent of the production. The reduction of the quantity to be exported by British producers was cut still further by the act in the fall of 1924 and the advent of balloon tires increased the demand for rubber. The pressure of the act was being felt by purchasers and the price .began to soar until November, 1925, the price of rubber was 104.8 cents. These prices increased the production both in British controlled plantations and those outside British jurisdiction. The manufacturers began to exercise greater economy in their use of rubber and' United States manufacturers set out plantations of their own in Liberia and other countries. The use of reclaimed rubber was tremendous. The British allowed an increase in exports and all these factors combined </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA CROP GItUWEKS' ASSOCIATION brought about a price reaction, in tne spring of 1927 the price ot crude rubber was again below 4 0 cents. The operators of the Stevenson Plan made another attempt to raise prices by restriction of exports to about 50 per cent of the standard of production but the price did not react to restriction and in the spring of 1928 announcement was made that the act would be repealed in November, 1928. The price of rubber has continued to decline. In December, 1931, the New York price of crude rubber ranged from 4% to 5 cents per pound. (3) lteasoh for Failure of Stevenson Plan 1. The Stevenson Plan was an attempt to control the price of rubber without having control of all possible sources of rubber supply. The production of rubber increased from 301,000 tons in 1921 to 658,000 tons in 1928. In 1921 British production was 67 per cent of the world production, while in 1923 British production was only 57 per cent of the world's production. This shows that the Stevenson Plan actually stimulated production outside of British jurisdiction and that it could not control production because it did not have a monopoly on the producing possibilities of rubber. 2. The Stevenson Plan lacked flexibility and could not be ad - justed easily to shifting conditions. This lack of flexibility is shown by the extreme fluctuation of price while the plan was in operation. The plan called for a fixed price of 34 cents a pound, but in July of 1924 the price was 18 cents and in July of '1925, the price was $1.04 a pound. It dropped to 38 cents in July, 1926. This shows that the plan lacked flexibility and failed in its promise to both the producer and consumer. 3. The plan called for establishment of a fixed price that would assure producers a fair return and also assure consumers of a stable price and a good supply. The price was established as 34 cents but the price fluctuated 16 cents below to 70 cents above the fixed price within a single year. Thus it did not assure either producer or con - sumer a stable price'. After the repeal of the Stevenson Plan of price control of rubber, the British Colonial Secretary summed up the situation something after this fashion: "There is too much planting, especially in Dutch areas: Too much rubber is being reclaimed: We do not control suf - ficient percentage of the rubber production. In conclusion let me quote Herbert Corey from Nation's Business, September, 1930: "There are no panaceas for commercial ills. An overstuffed world must suffer its pangs until digestion cures them. When too much coffee or rubber or sugar is being produced, the price must come down. It may be jacked up and propped up for a time, but it will always fall. It always has." </seg>
            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE BRAZILIAN COFFEE VALORIZATION J. P. LAWRKNUE Kural Economics Department The valorization of coffee by Brazil, now covering a period of almost thirty years has become an economic classic. Having its inception in a period of low level world prices, it rode with the rising tide of price levels, into the boom period. Almost twenty years of profits to both producer and government blinded the eyes of the pilots of the ship, and when the tide went down, she was found weltering in the shoals of depression and revolution, with no master able to save her from ultimate destruction. Coffee is a variable crop. Some seasons the yields are high, other seasons the yields are low. It looks logical to so organize the industry that the crop of the years of plenty may be carried over to help out in the lean years. Joseph tried it in Egypt with wheat and so far as we know his venture was successful. But this was not the full aim of the Brazilian engineers. Brazilian coffee is and was popular. People liked it, and wanted it. Why not make them pay all the traffic could be made to bear? In 1900 Brazil produced 81% of the world crop. Her soil, climate and producing skill, added to the popularity of her product, was cet over against the unevenness of annual production, and the fact that a plantation requires six to eight years to be brought into production; so the decision was made to go into the governmental valorization scheme. Beginning in 1905 the state of Sao Paulo started limiting the amount of coffee exported, bought and stored the surplus, increased the export duty, and secured additional finance from the Federal gov - ernment and from foreign loans. These loans were secured by an agreement to restrict plantings, and by the stored product: In 1914 these loans were paid and the plan had seemed mar - velously successful. Coffee had maintained an average higher price, the growers had made more money and the state had made 50 millions. The best customer had paid from three to three and one-half cents more for the coffee, totaling about 35 millions per year. This cus - tomer had objected, seriously, until international relations became strained, but that was all. The growers and the state profited. In the eyes of the Brazilian, it was a success. By 1917, large crops, falling prices, and decreasing demand be - cause of the war, produced another problem calling for solution. Again Sao Paulo as a state stepped into a repetition of the former program. World war, smaller crops, greater demand, higher price </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION levels again brought seeming success to the scheme. And again by 1!I2O Sao Paulo showed a profit, this time of '20 millions of dollars. Then a third period came to an end in 1923. The same story; short crop, increased demand, more stable prices, and a larger profit to the state. By now the Federal government was- taking the lead, and the governmental profits came to about 40% of their investment. In the meantime other regions were waking up to the possibilities of profit in coffee. In Brazil the plantations were increasing in extent and in number. In other countries, where coffee raising was possible, plantations were established. Whereas in 1900 other countries than Brazil were furnishing 19% of the world's demand, by 1923 they were furnishing 28%, an increase in their portion of the business of . r i0%. The actual full results of the plantings in other countries was not yet in evidence, but they were to show in a very few years. In only six years, or by 1929, other countries furnished 9,150,000 bags Of coffee of 132 pounds each, as against 14,281,000 furnished by Brazil, or 39% of the export business. The beginning of the century showed a world consumption of 16,000,000 bags of coffee, which had increased by growth of popula - tion, an more use of coffee to 25,000,000 in 1930. In that same period the exports from Brazil had grown only from 12,400,000 to 14,300,000 bags. Up to 1923, the carry-over or coffee in storage was of not much consequence. The two or three or four million bags had been merely an evener for the crop fluctuations in that country. The operations of the Coffee Institute since the marketing of the 1923 crop, are worthy of note. On the one side may be found, over two decades of apparently successful operation, success measured by maintained prices, profit to the producer and to the state, and an increase in world consumption. On the other side, and mitigating against the valorization scheme, were: heavier plantings at home, a vast increase in the development of coffee plantations in other coun - tries, a world economic uneasiness, lessening demand, and finally a world slump in prices. But these elements were insidious in their attack. Thpy were in evidence only after irreparable damage had been done. Through the years . the state and federal governments of Brazil had been involved to such an extent that even though the federal government withdrew in 1924, it was still held responsible by the planters, six years after. All of the elements which are known as safeguards or any price fixing or price control plan were used by the Coffee Institute In its basic operations: regulation of supplies, government purchases only in emergencies, carry over from fat years to lean years, advance to the planter of a part of the price and placing in storage, an export tax, sometimes known in one of its forms as an equalization fee, loans to planters, and borrowing from the state and from foreign bankers on the coffee In storage. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This was the set-up for the protection of a product which Is grown only in a limited area In Brazil, and of which Brazil was furnishing 71% of the world supply in 1923. And what was the outcome? High prices mean increased production. New plantations were coming into bearing six and eight years after planting. World production was 16,000,000 bags in 1923 and increased to over 37 million in 1930. The price of 11.5 cents per pound in 1923 was good. It increased to 20.4 cents in 1925 on a short crop, but in 1930 had dropped lo 8.8 cents. And coffee in storage in Brazil which was four and one - half million bags in 1924 became eleven and one-half millions in 1923 and over 21 million in 1930. And world consumption at the best is now only 25 million bags. Then what of the Coffee Institute? It had advanced too much to planters, it had over-borrowed on its coffee in storage, it could not sell enough coffee to continue its payments. Coffee exchanges closed, banks closed, and finally a political revolution, based on dissatisfac - tion with the coffee control plan overthrew the federal government. What can be said further of the coffee valorization plan? Brazil had 80% of the world business. She planned to equalize the annual supply of the world. This led to the next easy step, price control. With the price high other countries came into the picture, and even the home plantings could not be controlled. Increased competition, increased supplies, broken credit, bankruptcy. Brazil has enough trees coming into bearing to supply the complete world demand in a good crop year, and yet she has now but 61% of the business. Her fine plantations will be depleted, her labor is seeking work, her banks are closed, her whole economic and political life is hurt. She dumps coffee in the sea, she burns it in her locomotives, and just last month she ordered 12,000,000 additional 132 pound bags destroyed that they might not remain as a menace to her trade. WHY SOME COOPERATIVES FAIL G. B. NANCE Extension Economist, University of Missouri I am aware of Nebraska's long and successful cooperative history. One of the first things I learned when I started to study cooperation was that a livestock shipping association was organized at Superior, Nebraska, in 1873. I am also mindful of the recency and brevity of the only well known cooperative marketing association in Kentucky, the state in which I have had most of my experience with cooperatives. Consider- </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ing these things, it seems very like carrying coals to New Castle for a Kentuckian to attempt to talk to Nebraskans about cooperative marketing. However, in Kentucky, we take our cooperative marketing like we used to take our politics and like we still take our liquor — straight. In 1920, we had no cooperative marketing association large enough to be generally .known outside its own little locality; in 1925 the Hurley Tobacco Growers Cooperative association was organized with 10,800 members which boasted of being the largest cooperative mar - keting association in the world. In 1927 tobacco marketing in Ken - tucky was right where it started in 1920 — not a pound of tobacco was sold cooperatively. Perhaps states with longer but more gradual cooperative growth may find some lessons in such shorter but more hectic effort in the newer state. There is another possible justification for my appearing on this program. My subject is "Why Cooperatives Fail." Perhaps all Nebraska cooperatives thrive and flourish and suc - ceed, if that is a. fact, examples of failure must need come from some other state. When a person who has had his cooperative experience in Kentucky is asked to talk on cooperative marketing, he is expected to talk about the cooperative marketing of tobacco, so they talk about why the Burley failed. I, at least, am perfectly willing to fulfill that expectation, because I have given more thought to that commodity than any other. The Purpose of Burley Association It is true that the Burley ceased to operate, but even then we people who' know most about it do. not consider it as complete a failure as others who are not as well acquainted with its work. Let me read you some of the purposes for which it was organized. 1. To establish standard uniform grades and to sell tobacco on those grades. 2. To minimize speculation and stabilize the market. 3. To eliminate unnecessary expense in the handling of tobacco. 4. To develop new markets. 5. To sell their product through salesmen as skilled as the buy - ers of the product. In order that we may realize the gravity of making those same mistakes which have been made by this association and later, we will dwell a little more fully on the accomplishments that these mistakes were more than enough to offset. What the Association Accomplished This would appear to be a rather worthwhile program, one worthy of any cooperative organization, and yet that association that failed accomplished every one of these purposes. It also made some mis - takes. It established a uniform system of grades that was recognized </seg>
            <seg id="p152">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE by growers and buyers alike throughout the Burley belt. Prior to . this time, every company buying tobacco had its own private grading system, understood only by those associated with those companies. Comparisons of grade and prices are therefore impossible. It stabilized the price. During the ten years before the organiza - tion, the average changes in price from one year to the next was about 35 per cent. During the five year period of operation of the associa - tion the average change in price from one year to the next was about 15 per cent. Under the association plan of selling, all tobacco of the same grade brought the same price. Under the old method of sale, some baskets of tobacco have brought two or three times as much as other baskets of the same grades. I myself saw one basket of tobacco sell for 17 cents and another basket of the same grade or the same crop bring 37 cents the same day with the same auctioneer. Certain grades of tobacco sold one year at 50 cents per hundredweight, and the next year the same tobacco sold at $8.50 per hundredweight. Such senseless and unfair variations were not permitted during the operation of the association. The association eliminated unnecessary expenses in handling to - bacco. By operating its own redryers which they built, it saved 60 per cent in the former cost of redrying tobacco. By constructing their own storage houses, it reduced its insurance rates and shrinkage by enough to pay for those warehouses in a single year. The revenue from the shattered tobacco, swept from the floors of warehouses, which had formerly gone to the owners of those warehouses, was sufficient to pay the executive officers three times over; The association established representatives in foreign countries and doubled the consumption of Burley tobacco in those countries. These sales were entrusted to as able a tobacco man as there was in the tobacco industry — Mr. James C. Stone, now chairman of the Federal Farm Board. The association handled tobacco, even with the added services, at a cost of slightly above the amount charged by private warehousemen for merely selling the crop in the usual manner. For example, the association charged 97 cents per hundredweight for handling the 1923 crop of tobacco with the added services of maintaining uniform grades, and prices, stabilizing markets, establishing new markets, maintaining field services, etc. Private warehousemen that same year charged 90 cents per hundredweight for furnishing an auctioneer and a place for the basket of tobacco to set while it was being sold. These benefits were reflected back to the producer in increased returns for his tobacco. During the five year period the association operated on its original plan, from 1921 to 1926, the average price received was approximately twice the average of any similar five year </seg>

Why the Association Failed Yet, notwithstanding the attainment of these benefits, when the live year contract expired, less than 10 per cent of the people who had been members refused to sign another contract. I doubt if 10 per cent of the entire number of producers could have been induced to join, whereas 70 to 80 per cent hau been members a few years previously. In respect to a re-sign up, the Burley Tobacco. Growers Association was a Hat failure. Now why did these tobacco growers, who .by their own free admission, had profited by the organization, refuse to continue their membership? There have, of course, been many reasons advanced tor this failure, but to my mind there are four major reasons. I mention them in the reverse order of their importance: 1. The evangelistic, high pressure method of securing member - ship. 2. The long time, iron-clad contract. 3. The ignorance and misinformation oh the part of the members in regard to their organization. 4. Last and most important, their mistaken price policies. Like the raisin growers, the sugar growers, the coffee growers, and the rubber producers, they tried to arbitrarily fix the price of their produce. I doubt if the first three of these handicaps, — contracts, member - ship securing methods, and the uninformed membership — would have proven disastrous if the price policies had been sound. But the unwise price policies, and the conditions produced thereby, offered an oppor - tunity for all these mistakes to do the utmost harm. The Evolution of Contracts We will discuss these points in order. You people are familiar with the evolution of cooperative contracts. You remember that the first association considered that no contracts were necessary — that .'•gentlemen agreements" were all that were needed. They organized on that basis, and were later shocked and surprised to discover how ■ few gentlemen were among their members. One of my first recollec - tions of cooperative effort is of going to a schoolhouse with my dad, where the tobacco growers of the community solemnly agreed not to sell any tobacco under 10 cents per pound. Five cents per pound was what the buyers were then offering. The next day several of those entering that agreement sold their tobacco at prices ranging from 5% to 7 cents per pound. I know of a peach marketing association that failed within the last two years on account of having no contracts on which to estimate volume of business. </seg>
            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE After it was found that gentlemen's agreements would not work, the pendulum swung too far the other way. They wanted contracts that would bind people, "long time, iron-clad contracts with teeth in them, with provisions for restraining and mandatory injunctions, penalties, heavy liquidated .damages to insure its performance. This innovation came in from the successful cooperatives of the west and was hailed as the solution of all membership problems. The Burley Tobacco Association organized when this contract was in its heyday in that territory. The dominant influence in the organization was a lawyer who took credit for much of the develop - ment of that type of contract, and placed undue reliance on the legal enforceability of it. They fondly believed that once a man's name was secured to the contract, that instrument would insure his being a good member during the life of the contract,, and that little concern need be given further to that member. They appointed field men to discover violations of the contract, and a staff of attorneys to put the fear of God into those weak-kneed brethren whose moral stamina might need that support. They welcomed litigation and you know when you dare somebody to do something, they are mighty apt to do it. They soon found that this would not work, that a contract could not be enforced if public sentiment was overwhelmingly opposed to its enforcement. The contract breaker demanded a jury trial, and the jury, composed of or containing men who also wanted to break their contracts, or were in sympathy with those who did, refused to convict. Each of these law suits added to the bitter enemies of the organization. Since undue reliance was placed on the signed contract, too little was placed on the methods of securing signatures. There seems little doubt that those joining the association expected too much of it, and that those in charge of securing memberships either used extravagant statements as to what could be accomplished or made such use of true statements as would lead the members to expect too much. There were sign-up days in the different counties on which day bankers, garage men, feed dealers, doctors and preachers, lawyers, merchants, and county officials closed up their places of business and canvassed the counties to secure contracts. These canvassers were good, honest, substantial men, but they did not have much knowledge of cooperative marketing and did have lots of enthusiasms They secured the con - tracts, but I would like to know all the things that were promised in order to get these contracts. I was with one group of these can - vassers, and the most effective solicitor said that all classes were organized except school teachers, farmers, and lunatics, and that the farmer was now about to withdraw from that unholy alliance, to arise in his manhood and demand a fair share of the proceeds of his labor. Nothing was said about the effect of supply on price or price </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION on supply — the idea advanced being to "hold till we get our price." The least that some of these members so secured expected from the association after listening to this talk was for it to assure them a profit and guarantee them against loss on any amount of tobacco they might produce. Their ideas were vague or non-existent as to how the association was to do this, but they considered this a detail to be left to the association ofllcials, — one the members did not need to worry about. These were their expectations when they signed their live year contract. Lack of Information The lack of information on the part of the members was a third stumbling block. The members did not know what the cooperative association could do — and what is fully as important — what it could not do. They did not know the problems the association had to solve, or the methods the association was using to solve those problems. Since the members did not have the actual facts, they were ready to believe any wild tale of mismanagement or extravagance that the enemies of the association cared to circulate in regard to it. The association ofBcials were not blameless in regard to this ignorance. The officials were bankers and tobacco men — not schooled in cooperation. The financial status and efficiency of the organization received their major attention and were never questioned. The mem - bership relation received much less attention. If there was discontent in a certain territory they said, "That is all right, we will send out a check next week. They will be all right." And they'd send out a check, a good sized check too. No matter how big it was, the member thought .it should be bigger. The members of the association were widely scattered and about their only authentic source- of information was the organization paper which many did not receive and still more could not read. Moreover, full statements of some conditions were withheld from this paper for fear of giving information to the enemy. However, the enemies of the association, with their insidious propaganda, were ever present to poison the minds of these uninformed. In a few counties there had been organized county locals, where the members of the association met monthly to discuss the purposes of the association, its problems, and the steps being taken to meet these problems. These local meetings were well attended and ren - dered real service. The counties that had these locals secured a re - sign up of 75 per cent without exception and without outside solicita - tion. Compare this with the 10 per cent sign-up in counties having no locals. I want to say right here that I believe a cooperative, even one that makes mistakes, that takes Its members into Its confidence, tells them what it is trying to do and why, how it plans to do it, and </seg>
            <seg id="p156">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE does not even cover up its mistakes, can hold the loyalty of its mem - bers better than an association that makes no mistakes but permits its members to remain in ignorance in regard to its policies and actions. Furthermore, I believe that an informed membership means a loyal membership in any cooperative that merits loyalty. Price Policies Then came their most serious trouble — mistaken price policies and the evil contingent thereon. High prices, artificially maintained; increasingly larger carry-overs of unsold tobacco, necessary to main - tain that high price; larger delays in final settlements for this carry - over; increasing production engendered by high price. The price maintained for tobacco during this period was almost as high as during war times, and the prices of other farm commodi - ties was much lower. The growers and some of the officials of the association thought these high prices could be maintained indefinitely. To maintain these high prices, part of the crop had to be withheld from the market, and the amount necessary to withhold increased yearly. The 1921 crop, the first crop the association handled, was sold that year. The 1922 crop, much larger due to higher prices in 1921, was not all sold until 1925; all of the crops, 1923, 1924, and 1925, were not sold when the first contract expired. Large parts of these crops had to be stored to maintain high prices. Stock of tobacco increased 26 million pounds in 1920 to 466 million in 1926. The production of tobacco increased from 220 million pounds in 1921 to 312 million in 1926. At last the association warned the growers against the increased production but continued to increase prices. You know I learned a long time ago that a man who asks another man to make a personal sacrifice for the good of the industry could use his time just as effectively by baying at the moon. Warn - ings are of 'no avail when prices are high. This Increase In production was largely outside the association, the percentage of the crop in the association | decreased and upon the producers of this shrinking por - tion of the crop fell the entire burden of maintaining the price for steadily Increasing amounts sold outside the association. The delayed payment discouraged production among association members, while full payment on delivery to those marketing independently encouraged their production. So acreage increased on the outside and decreased on the inside. The most difficult problem of the re-signing arose from members comparing 'the relative benefits of the association members with those to non-members, to the "outsider" as he was called. The members claimed that they were being "ridden" by the outsider, that the mem - bers were maintaining a good worker, and that the non-member who contributed nothing to its maintenance; was profiting thereby. They </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION claimed, and I believe with justification, that the outsider was receiv - ing more benefit from the association than the member. The Effect of Deterred Payments The most frequently voiced objection to the association was In regard to Its deferred payments. The members wanted their money when they delivered their product. These men who howled the loudest about holding their product until they got their price, discovered it was not so convenient to do without the money from that crop while it was being held. They declared the association was organized as a selling organiza - tion and was used as a holding organization, and that they wanted their money all at once. In the latter years of the association the members became recon - ciled to the fact that they could not control prices without regard to supply, that to stabilize the market, a part of large crops must be temporarily withheld from the market, that payment for the tobacco so withheld must be deferred until the product was sold. They did not like the idea but they would have placed it in the same category with drouths, snow-storms, and other unpleasant things that had to be endured if this unpleasantness had fallen on all producers, members and outsiders alike. But they absolutely refused to take a philosoph - ical view of the outsider. Feelings and discussions between members and non-members were heated and personal, and each member per - sonified the outsider. To one member the non-members were Pete Smith, who had been favored by the buyer on the auction with a good price, and taunted the member with his good fortune; and Bill Brown who sold his tobacco on the outside market, got his pay all at once and jingled the money in his pocket and paid cash for his sup - plies, while the member had to content himself with a warehouse receipt and credit; and John Doe who had told him "Your association can make the good market, I'll sell on it." When this member was approached to sign a new contract, he said, "I'll not sign till Pete Smith, Bill Brown, and Doe sign." The feelings of Smith, Brown, and Doe had also intensified in these five years of acrimony so they didn't sign. No one signed and there wasn't any association. The adoption of a sound price policy by the association would have avoided many of these troubles. If the tobacco had been priced so as to sell — except In exceptional years — the same year as pro - duced, the member would have received almost as much money at the time of his delivery as the non-member, and the final settlement could have been made in a few months rather than in a few years. The economics made possible by the association — efficiency, grading, cheaper re-drying, storage, and sales would be an added benefit to the members In which the outsider did not share. Prices would not </seg>
            <seg id="p158">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE be maintained at as high a level and part of the increases in produc - tion would have been avoided; since the advantage would have been with the member, the percentage of tobacco marketed .through the association would have increased. It didn't adopt this sound sales policy. It attempted to fix the price, and like the coffee people and all these others, it failed. Now in my mind those associations which try to fix prices without regard to supply can be grouped in two general classifications: Those that have failed already, and the other, those that are going to fall in the immediate future. Some time ago I heard a speaker say that no farmer would believe he had a money benefit from an Increased price unless he saw some other farmer suffering under a disadvantage. I do not subscribe with that belief. However, I doubt if it will ever be possible to keep a membership satisfied when non-members receive more benefit from the association than members, even though the market is im - proved for both. One of the lingering ill effects of the discontinuation of the Burley association has been the lessening of confidence of many in the entire Burley belt in any cooperative marketing. "I've approached men in regard to cooperative milk marketing who said, "No, sir, I was a member of the Burley pool. Cooperative marketing Wont work, and I have had experience." He had had some experience. Because the Burley pool ceased to function, even though it paid its way several times over, they think no cooperative marketing association can succeed. Experience is said to be a great teacher, but it has several striking weaknesses, one of which is that experience teaches so many things that aren't so. For example, a cat that has sat on a hot stove lid, never will sit on a hot stove lid again — but he wont even sit on a cold stove lid. Now the reasoning of these ex-members of the Burley tobacco association is very much like that of the cat. The Burley failed, therefore all cooperatives fail, and it is only very slowly that these men are being made to realize that memberships in cooperative mar - keting associations total one-half the number of farms in the United States; that the local volume of farm products sold through coopera - tive marketing associations equals one-fourth of all the world's pro - ducts within the world trade. That failures of cooperative associa - tions are less frequent than failures in private business organizations, and that the statement that farmers wont stick together have long been obsolete for in every important agricultural country in the world there is a cooperative marketing association that is a dominating factor in the marketing of each of their important farm products. </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION However, I am happy to state that there are now four strong co - operative marketing associations operating in the territory where it failed in 1920 and so far as I know none of them are trying to fix prices. THE OUTLOOK FOK LAND UTILIZATION O. E. BAKER Senior Agricultural Economist, U. S. Department of Agriculture I'nrt I. — The Prospect for Consumption of Farm Products In studying the land problem the first step is to consider the probable future need for farm land. This is dependent upon the future consumption of farm products, on the one hand, and upon pro - duction per acre, on the other hand. Let us consider first the pros - pect for consumption of farm products. This depends upon three factors — population growth in the United States, consumption per person, and net exports. The Prospect for Population Growth The most important of the factors affecting the future of Ameri - can agriculture is the number of people in the Nation. At present about 90 per cent of the farm land is used to produce for the domes - tic market. The prospect is for an increase in population during the next ten years, according to the estimates of Professors Thompson and Whelpton of the Scripps Foundation for Population Research, Dr. Dublin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and other statisticians, only a little more than half that shown by the census for the decade 1920-1930, unless the immigration restrictions are relaxed, for an increase in the decade 1940-1950 only about a third as large as in the past decade, and for a stationary population about 1960 as much larger than the present population as the present population is larger than that at the close of the World War. This stationary condition will persist for a decade or more and may be followed by a decline. In other words, the maximum population of the Nation in the future, unless change occurs in number of births or immigra - tion, will be only 15 to 20 per cent greater than at present. This increase, though spread through three decades, is about the same in percentage as that during the past decade (16 per cent). Let us consider the basis for this startling conclusion. Ten years ago, indeed as late as 1923, the population of the Nation was increasing nearly 2,000,000 a year. Now the increase is less than 1,000,000. (Fig. 2). Between 1921 and 1931 the number of children born in the United States dropped from about 2,940,000 </seg>

In much the same way as the urban birth rate. The fall in the birth rate has been so rapid recently that, despite the increasing population, the number of children born each year is less usually than in the year preceding.

The increase in deaths was not be - cause people were dying younger, but because there is an increasing number of old people. The number of people over 65 years of age Increased 34 per cent between 1920 and 1930, according to the Census, whereas the number of children under 5 years of age de - creased one per cent. Enrollment in the first grade of the public schools has been declining irregularly since 1918, in the second grade since 1922, and in the third grade since 1924. The rapid decline in the birth rate since 1924 has not had time to be reflected in the school enrollment statistics. (Fig. 3). The figures just given for 1931 are preliminary and are based on reports of births and deaths during the first nine months of 1931. These returns indicate that there will be about 150,000 less births in 1931 than in 1930. The decline of births in this year of economic depression, apparently, will be two to three times as large as the average annual decline during the decade of urban prosperity preced - ing. Should the decline in births in the future become more rapid, as these 1931 data suggest, the increase in the Nation's population will be less and the approach of a stationary population more prompt than the estimate just given indicates. Will the Trend in Births and Deaths Persist? But it is fitting to ask, may there not develop a decline in the death rate or a rise in the birth rate? With reference to the death rate, physicians and statisticians of the insurance companies assure us that there can be little further extension In the United States of the average span of life. At present a new born child, it is expected, will live to be nearly 60 years old on the average, whereas in New Zealand, a pastoral country- whose record an industrial nation like the United States can scarcely hope to equal, the new born child will live to be 64 on the average. This is the highest in the world. Although the expectation of life in the United States may Increase slightly, a rise in the death rate is Inevitable, as the young and middle - aged people, the heritage of a higher birth rate and a heavier Immi - gration in the past, grow older. Only one person in eighty to ninety of the nation's population is dying each year at present, and It is obvious that every new born child does not live to be 80 or 90 years old. In a few years the death rate will rise, unless a great Increase In immigration occurs, simply because there will be more old people to die. There is no hope, therefore, for an increase in population through a decline in the death rate. Let us consider, therefore, the prospect for the birth rate. The major immediate causes of the rapid decline In the birth rate since the World War are the reduction In European immigration </seg>
            <seg id="p162">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and the increase In migration from farm to city. The immigrants from Kurope were mostly young people, recently married or of marriage - able age. Moreover, many of these immigrants, perhaps most of them, came from peasant farms where the tradition or large families persisted. The recent rapid decline in the ratio of children to women of child-bearing age in the cities has been confined to the population of foreign birth or parentage. The foreign-born mothers are growing older and, therefore, having fewer children, w!iile the native-born mothers of foreign parentage are adopting urban American ways. For many years native-born mothers in the large cities have not been having enough children to maintain even a stationary population. When foreign immigration was restricted during and after the World War, a greatly Increased movement set in from the farms to the cities, which has persisted until recently. For the first time in the Nation's history (except, possibly, between 1910 and 1920) the farm population diminished during the past decade. This migration also has been mostly of young people, — middle-aged and old people cannot well learn a new occupation and make the many other adjust - ments necessary. Since farm people have a much higher birth rate than city people — almost twice as high as in cities of 100,000 population and over — this migration of the young to the cities where they will have fewer children than on the farm, is reducing the Nation's birth rate. Moreover, the flow has been so great that it. has depleted the farm population, and diminished the number of people who can migrate from the farms to the cities in the future. There were, in 1930, over S80.000 fewer children under 5 years of age on farms than in 1920, a decrease of one-sixth; and 335,000 fewer children 5 to 9 years old, a. decrease of nearly one-tenth. On the other hand, there were 300,000 more people over 55 years old on farms in 1930 than 1920, an increase of nearly 9 per cent. The human population on farms, like the horse population, is growing older. But the scarcity of children in the cities is much more serious than on the farms. In 1920 there were just about enough children in cities of over 100,000 population to maintain population stationary. In 1930 there was a 20 per cent deficit. In the smaller cities (2,500 to 100,000 population) the deficit averaged only 7 per cent. On the other hand, in the farm population there was still a surplus of chil - dren in 1930 of 50 per cent above the number necessary to maintain a stationary population, and in the rural non-farm (mostly village) population a surplus of nearly 30 per cent. So long as immigration from abroad remains rigidly restricted, not only will the cities be dependent on the rural and principally the farming people for any increase of population, but they will be dependent on movement of people from rural districts to prevent a gradual decline. </seg>
            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION A large factor, therefore, in the population prospect is the pro - portion of the people who live under rural conditions. What is the outlook for change in the farm population particularly? Apparently, there are two major forces working in opposite directions. The me - chanization of agriculture, which must continue for a few years at least, since there are not half enough colts on farms to replace those that die or become incapacitated yearly, tends to reduce the number of workers needed on farms. Between 1910 and 1930, in both of which years the Census was taken in April, the number of males engaged in agriculture declined over 1,000,000; but practically all this decline occurred in laborers working on "home' farms," mostly children over 15 years of age. Number of farmers and of hired laborers remained almost stationary. Agricultural production increased nearly a third (Unit this increase was not owing to mechanization alone). On the other hand, there is a notable movement of urban factory workers, professional and business men to small farms or suburban places, where they can have a garden and keep a cow and a few chickens, producing vegetables, milk and eggs for home use, but sometimes also for sale. Between 1920 and 1925 the Census recorded an increase of 36 per cent in farms of 3 to 10 acres in size, and of 16 per cent in farms of 10 to 20 acres, whereas the number of farms in all the larger size groups decreased. Between 1925 and 1930 the farms in the middle size groups decreased, while the number of large farms increased. The prospect at present is for an increase of this movement of city workers to suburban places and small part-time farms. Although this is likely to raise the birth rate among these people and is a most salutary trend, it will doubtless diminish rather than increase the quantity of farm products purchased. Since it is likely that urban industries in the next decade will not expand their need for labor as rapidly as in the past decade, it is probable that the safest assumption with reference to farm population is that it will remain about stationary, perhaps decline slightly. Let us consider, therefore, the fundamental forces affecting the birth rate, both urban and rural. Why should the birth rate of the farming people be nearly twice as high as among the people living in large cities? And why should the trend everywhere in the Occident, not only in the United States but in Europe also, be downward? Clearly the decline is associated with industrial development and city life, and probably the major cause is the cost of raising children, particularly in the cities, and the competition of other desires. A recent investigation made by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Com - pany indicates that it costs in the cities about $9,000 to raise a child to the age of 18 for a family having an income of $2,500 a year. Since it requires about three children per family to maintain even a stationary population, it appears that for a typical urban American </seg>
            <seg id="p164">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE family to raise three children will cost $25,000 to $30,000. This necessarily . reduces the standard of living, and fewer parents, evi - dently, are willing to make the sacrifice. Quite often, too, urban conditions of living are not favorable to family life. In the modern urban industrial system there is little place for the child and almost no place for" the aged, while the wife tends to become either a factory worker or an office worker, and the home is more and more in an apartment house or a hotel. In many, perhaps most, cases the individual, not the family, is the eco - nomic unit. On the farm, not only can the child be raised more cheaply than in the city, but also in most cases he is an economic asset from 10 years of age onward, while the wife is an economic necessity and a co-worker, and even the aged find plenty that they can do. Moreover, the farm is the home and the factory, and the family is both the economic and social unit. However, the cost of raising children is felt on the farms as well as in the cities, and there is increasing rural imitation of the fashions and standards of urban life. Whether the suburban movement will decentralize the city pop - ulation, and partially restore the former family ideals, only the future can reveal, but as yet the influence Is inappreciable. The farmers of the United States can count on only a slow increase in population, and as will be shown later, in the domestic demand for farm products, with a more or less stationary consumption only a few decades in the future. All this assumes, of course, that the restrictions on immigration will not be relaxed. If such an immigration as occurred in 1923, for example, should be maintained while the birth rate declined, the entire picture would be altered. One hundred thousand more immi - grants next year, 200,000 more the year after, followed by accretions of 100,000 a year until the 700,000 of 1923 is reached, would result in a rate of population increase during the next decade probably as large as that at present or, roughly, 1,000,000 a year. For the popula - tion of the nation to increase nearly 2,000,000 a year, however, as it was increasing a decade ago, would require a larger immigration than has ever occurred in our national history. Whether such an increase in immigration will develop is a matter also which only the future can reveal. At present it appears no more likely than that the trend of the birth rate "will be reversed. This prospect for population growth has been considered at such length because It deserves a weight of at least 80 per cent in esti - mating the future consumption of farm products. Let us now con - sider the minor factor of change in per capita consumption or farm products. </seg>

In the United States, for example, where animal products constitute over two-thirds of the diet, measured in average farm price of the raw material, it requires about two acres of crop' land and three acres of humid pasture, or equivalent of arid grazing land, to feed the average person; whereas in Germany only one acre of crop land is required, partly because of higher yields per acre, and in China where acre-yields of the crops are similar to those in the United States, but where little meat and no milk is consumed, there is only a half acre per person. In Japan the smallest area per person in the world is reached, one-fourth acre, but owing to high acre-yields the standard of living is higher than in China.

But, lacking protein and fat, a person could not live on sutiar alone. The cereal diet would maintain health much longer. To maintain health permanently meat, milk, or other foods hlsh in protein and fat should be added. These require three to four acres of crops and pasture to yield the same eneruy value in pork or milk, or about 14 acres devoted to beef production. A shift in diet in the United States from cereals, vegetables and fruits toward more milk and meat, particularly beef, would markedly affect the area of land needed to produce the Nation's food. It re - quires 11 acres of crops fed to . beef cattle and 2% acres of pasture to produce as much feed, measured in calories, as 3 acres of crops fed to hogs, or 2% acres of crops. and 1% acres of pasture used to feed dairy cows, but only 1% acres of wheat or of tomatoes.

            <seg id="p166">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE However, a glance over the figures of meat consumption during the last thirty- years reveals no permanent upward trend in per capita consumption. For beef, there is the well-known fifteen - year cycle of production and consumption, with sharp troughs in consumption in 1900, 1915 and 1930, probably and flat crests covering several years nearly midway. But the trend is down - ward. Per capita consumption of beef and veal has been esti- ■ mated for the three trough years at 71.3, 58.8, and 66.9 pounds, respectfully; while in the earlier crest period, 1903 to 1910, inclusive, it averaged 79.8 pounds and in the later crest period, 1918 to 1926, it averaged 69.3 pounds. The number of cattle in the country has remained about constant for 30 years, except for the cycle, while human population has increased 60 per cent. The discrepancy has been divided between an increase in production of beef and veal per head of cattle on farms and ranches January 1 and a decline in per capita consumption of beef.

Perhaps of equal importance was the Prohibition Amendment to the Constitu - tion, the prosperity of the urban people during and after the War, and the food education articles and advertisements in the popular magazines. The result has been a decline since the War years of about 100 pounds per person in consumption of cereal foods, and an increase of about 27 pounds per person in the consumption of suuar, also a notable increase in the consumption of milk and pork, and probably a smaller increase in use of fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, the per capita consumption of pork and of milk has been much higher since the War than during the War or before. (Fig. 5). The best available estimates, which are subject to change when the returns from the 1930 Census of Agriculture and Distribution are tabulated, Indicate a per capita consumption of pork </seg>
            <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION and lard since 1921 varying from 10 to 20 per cent higher than during the pre-war period, 1909-1913, and of milk about 20 per cent higher since 1924. The total consumption of meat per person, ex - cluding poultry but including lards, was about 154 pounds during the pre-war period 1909-1913, and from 1925 to 1929 it was about the same. For 1930, however, a material decline is indicated in the consumption of all animal products. The changes In consumption of the cereals for human food have been very different. The per capita consumption of wheat dropped about 15 per cent between 1915 and 1919 and has since remained around 85 per cent of pre-war, except tor a slight drop in 1930. l J er capita" consumption of corn and rye fell 50 per cent between 1915 and 1919, (if War Trade Doard estimates may be compared with the returns from the Census of Manufactures) and. has since remained about steady at the lower level. The total consumption per person of wheat, corn, oats rye, buckwheat, and barley for human food averaged about 340 pounds a year during the pre-war period, 1909 - 19.13, whereas during the last five years it has been only about 240 pounds. This is a decrease of a hundred pounds, or nearly 30 per cent. On the other hand, the average American is now eating about 30 pounds more sugar or over a third more than before the War. Most of this sugar comes from Cuba and the Insular Possessions, and the increased consumption has involved little increase, therefore, in land requirements in the continental. United States. Omitting the abnormal year 1930, it appears that the decrease in the United States since the pre-war years in consumption per person of cereal foods, principally wheat, flour and cornmeal, has reduced the area of these crops needed to feed a person from about 0.34 acre to 0.26 acre, or by about l/12th of an acre; while the increase in the consumption of milk, pork and vegetables has increased the area per person needed to produce these products by an eighth of an acre. The net result of the change in diet has been an increase in crop land needed to feed each person of about l/24th of an acre, which is about 2 per cent. This is a very small amount of .change; and the safest assumption, perhaps, with reference to the future is that the present acreage requirement per person will be subject only to such reduction as results from progress in agricultural technique. Un - doubtedly, however, notable shifts will continue to occur from one food to another. The production of food involves the use of about six-sevenths of the total crop land in the Nation and nearly all the pasturage. There are four important non-food products, however, which also need to be considered; cotton, wool, flaxseed, and tobacco. The per capita consumption of cotton has been remarkably uniform, varying between 25 and 30 pounds during most of the years since 1900. Although mill consumption of cotton has declined notably during the past two </seg>
            <seg id="p168">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE years, this decline is almost certainly transitory. Wool consumption per person, on the other hand, has remained since the World War at about 10 per cent below the average at the beginning 01 the century. The per capita consumption of linseed oil, the principal flaxseed pro - duct, has been increasing until recently, but the increase is supplied by imports, which are now about as large as the domestic production or flaxseed. The consumption per person of tobacco has increased about a fourth during the past 30 years. Combining all the major agricultural products (cotton, tobacco, flax and wool, as well as foodstuffs) consumed by the American people on the basis of crop land required to produce them, it appears that the net land requirements per person, assuming a stationary produc - tion per acre, are about the same now as 30 years ago. Aggregate consumption of farm products in the United States continues to in - crease more or less directly with the population. Exports In recent years from onertenth to one-fifth of the Nation's farm products, measured in areas of land required to produce them, has been exported, mostly to Europe; and In Northwestern Europe, where most of the agricultural exports go, as in the United States, the birth rate has been declining for 50 years. But. the decline during the War years was much greater in the belligerent countries than in the (nited States, and the rebound in 1919 and 1920, after the soldiers Birth Rates: Five countries of northwestern Europe 1870-1929 BIRTHS PER i.ooo I : I 1 1 1 1 1 POPULATION | /~ ~ «.~— England on** Wain 5 O . i- ' ' » ' ' ' i ' i i i i I i i i i i i i i I i t i i i i t i I i i i i i t t i I i i i i i i i i I i i i i 1870 IS80 1890 1900 1910 1920 1930 us.K~annitor»aac»nac «i»o&gt;«»i»&lt; Il aai FlC. 6. — Birth rates are declining also in Nortnwestcrn Europe, which has hitherto provided the principal export market for American farm products.

However, the decline since 1920 has brought the birth rate to lower points in nearly every country of Northwestern Europe than It is in the United States. Prom Sweden to Scotland and Switzerland the birth rate has fallen to that point where it is scarcely able to maintain population perma - nently, and in England, Germany, and Sweden there are not enough daughters being born to replace the mothers of the present day. It is clear that American farmers cannot depend on continuous expan - sion of the Northern European market. On the contrary, agricultural technique is advancing in Northern Europe as it is in North America. In Northwestern Europe acre-yields of some of the crops are twice as high as in the United States, and after a decline during the War years they are now advancing In several countries beyond their pre - war levels; also, as in the United States, there has been a shift from cattle primarily for beef to dairy cattle and swine, which shift, there as here, results in a notable economy in the amount of land needed to provide the people with food.

            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Moreover, the intensification or the nationalistic spirit which ac - companied the World War, and the consequent desire for national security with respect to the food supply, brought in, like an undertow, a notable wave of tariff enactments. Italy, which imported until recently sixty to ninety million bushels of wheat annually, including Hour, mostly from the United States, has now practically prohibited imports with a tariff approximately 87 cents per bushel. In Germany and France, likewise, tariff duties have become almost prohibitive. (Kig. 7). Of the great wheat-importing countries of Europe, only Creat Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands retain free trade in wheat, and in Great Britain agitation for a tariff is strong, in part, in protect the gold supply. Should a general protective tariff on agricultural products in Great Britain be adopted by the new govern - ment, it seems not unlikely the effect on certain aspects of American agriculture would be material. In Southern Europe also the birth rate is declining, but less rapidly. Even in Italy, where a vigorous nationalisih has retarded the decline at least temporarily, the number of births in 1929 was fewer • than in 1928.

            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION the birth rate is still high, and the stationary state of population is more remote than in Northern Europe. On the other hand, in Russia population is increasing at the tremendous rat* of 2 to 3 per cent a year, apparently — twenty-five to thirty millions gain during the decade — and there is no evidence of a declining birth rate except in the cities, which include only twenty per cent of the population. In this respect Russia resembles the Orient rather than the Occident. The acreage required to produce tlie agricultural exports from the United States was less in the fiscal year 1929-30 than in any year since the beginning of the century, and only about half as great as in the year 1921-22. (Fig. 8); The exports in 1930-31 have been still less. The crop area required to produce the exports of animal foodstuffs (mostly lard and pork) now only slightly exceed that which would be required to produce the imports (beef, lamb, milk and some dairy products), whereas of the cash crops, notably cotton and wheat, this is far from the case.

            <seg id="p172">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The significance of the rapid decline in agricultural exports since 1926 is not yet clear. Undoubtedly the reductfon in the purchasing power of European peoples, owing To diminution of American credit and other factors, the increase in European tariffs on agricultural products and American tariffs on manufactured goods, the decline in the value of silver, which has affected the purchasing power of Oriental peoples, and many other factors have exerted an influence. Some of these adverse influences doubtless will Improve with recovery from the business depression, but that exports of farm products will again exceed or even equal the post-war peak, or the earlier peak at the beginning of the century, 1s not certain in view of the declining birth rate In Europe and the low purchasing power of the peoples of Asia. . Summary — The Outlook For Consumption of Farm Products The outlook, therefore, is for an increase in demand for farm products varying more or less directly with the population of the United States. During the thirty-three years since 1897, included in our index of agricultural production and consumption, domestic con - sumption of farm products per capita, taking the average for the five years, 1897 to 1901 as 100 per cent, has varied from only 96 per cent in 1917 and 1921 to 106 per cent in 1926 and in 1928. The crop area required to produce the exports of farm products has varied from about 10 per cent of the total crop land in 1930 to about 20 per cent in 1921. The curve for total agricultural production has not •diverged from the curve of the Nation's population by more than 10 per cent in any year, except in the very adverse seasons of 19.17, 1921 and 1930. (Fig. 9). There are no forces in sight which seem likely to disturb this parallelism between production, domestic con - sumption, and population. In other words, agricultural production in the future, as In the past, undoubtedly will not and should not increase much faster than the Nation's population, unless exports increase greatly. This brings us to the question, how much .farm land is likely to be needed to provide food and fibers for the 1!&gt; to 20 per cent greater population that may be expected a third of a century hence. Let me leave one thought with you: The permanent prosperity of American agriculture, I believe, depends principally upon the num - ber of people In the Nation to be fed and clothed. </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION THE OUTLOOK FOR LAND UTILIZATION Part II. The Prospect for Production Let us now consider the prospect for consumption of farm pro - ducts which we found depends primarily upon the future population of the Nation. The prospect for population, we noted, was an increase about half as large in the next ten years as in the ten years just past, with the stationary population about thirty years hence, followed by a declining population, unless the immigration restrictions are relaxed or the downward trend of the birth rate is reversed. Other factors, but of minor importance, are changes in diet and in per capita con - sumption of other farm products, and changes in exports. It appears probable that changes in diet will not greatly affect the total con - sumption of farm products during the next few decades at least, and the prospect for any great increase in exports is none too encouraging. The outlook, therefore, is for an increased need for farm products 5 to 10 per cent greater ten years hence than at present; and, possibly 15 to 20 per cent greater 30 years hence, when the Nation's maximum population appears likely to be attained. In other words, the farmers of the Nation should look forward to about as large increase in pro- Changes in composite Yield per acre for corn. wheat. oats, and potatoes PER' (WCICMTCOBV*C«EACC) CENT I | I 1 1 1 — ; 1690-169". -100 j^"^ 170 : 1 — 1 , 1 T5^— ~- •— ■ United States — ■— — Middle Atlantic 160 Northern Soutti Atfannc J, — — — Cast North Central -^"^ West North Central -0*^ IgQ , to *"" Mi All other States 120 1- -jT-~^^ **~^Z /^T^~ &gt; ~ "- _ — 7 100- 4— . .

In the older parts of the Cotton Belt (includ - ing mostly in All other States") improvements in technique have been offset in recent years by depredations of the boll wevil and by soil erosion. </seg>

Today let us consider the question, how much more farm land will be needed to provide this 15 to 20 per cent increase in production. Obviously this depends upon production per acre. Agricultural Production Per Acre Prior to the World War the principal means of increasing agri - cultural production per acre was by obtaining higher crop yields. In fact, it was scarcely realized that there were other ways. But acre-yields of the crops considering the United. States as a whole, have remained practically stationary for 20 yeara, and total crop acreage has remained practically stationary since the World War (Figs. 9 and 10). The great increase in agricultural production during the decade after the War was owing almost wholly to four factors of minor con - sequence before the War which suddenly became of major importance, jfcS*-^^^ HORSES AND MULES 2 YEARS OLD AND OVER &lt;=A L^S .«jO|T7"~~ ~_^_^Decrea5einNumber.Jan.l.l920-Apr.l.l930 „«.

This decline released a larire amount of feed, and mnde it cheap. Many farmers in the South found it cheaper to buy feed than to raise it. and crop acrease, mostly corn (See Fiir. 12) declined notably. Fewer horses, therefore, were needed, especially in Georgia and South Carolina where cotton acreage also declined. 1. First in importance is the substitution of gasoline for horse and mule feed as a source of power. The decline of about 8,400,000 horses and mules on farms, and of probably over a millic n more in cities, between 1918 and 1931 has released nearly 30,000,000 acres of crop land, which has been used mostly to feed meat and milk </seg>
            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION animals and to produce cotton. This is equivalent to an increase of fully ten per cent in the effective crop acreage of the nation. The decrease in horses, moreover, has been greatest in the most fertile section of the United States. (Fig. 11). As there are less than half enough colts on farms to replace the horses and mules that die or become disabled yearly, substitution of tractors and automobiles for horses and mules probably will continue for several years at least. The mechanization of agriculture also has had indirect effects. It permitted the production of wheat at a low price on many million acres of semi-arid land in the Great Plains region, causing correspond - ing reduction of wheat acreage east of the Mississippi.

            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 2. Almost as important as the mechanization of crop production has been the increasing production of meat and milk per unit of feed consumed. The increase in animal products (other than power) since the World War has been about 23 per cent, whereas crop feed available has increased not more than 10 per cent, while the feed from pasturage probably has declined slightly. (Fig. 15). This increased production of milk and meat per unit of feed consumed, assignable to culling of cows, slaughter of cattle, sheep and swine at an earlier age (young animals make greater gains on the same amount of feed than older animals), reduction in death losses by better sanitation, particularly among hogs, a vast shift in pork production — already noted — from the South to the Northwest, where the stock is better, and more efficient in transforming feed into pork and lard, the use of minerals in feeding, and many other causes have added the equivalent of 25,000,000 acres, probably, to the crop area.

Less important, yet a significant factor, particularly from the standpoint of crop land requirements of the nation, has been the shift from the less productive crops per acre to the more productive: notably, from corn toward cotton in the South, a crop which is worth much more per acre, from wheat toward corn in the North, and from grain and hay toward fruit and vegetables in several areas, notably in Cali - fornia. Looking to the future, there is no assurance that these shifts from less productive to more productive crops will continue.

Since 1921 the increase in acreage of the more valuable crops has been notable. Likewise the increase in number of -dairy cowb, hogs, and chickens has been much greater than that of beef cattle and sheep, which produce less human food per unit of feed consumed. As a consequence, production per acre has increased. 4. Likewise, there has been a shift from beef cattle toward dairy cattle, hogs, and chickens, which proauce much more food than' beef cattle per unit of feed consumed. (Fig. 16)). During the next decade this factor may sink into insignificance or disappear, owing to the probable upward trend of the beef cattle cycle; but later, when the number of beef cattle decline, this factor is again likely to become of some importance. Nearly all the increase in agricultural production per acre since the War, therefore, can be assigned to the decline in horses and mules and improvements in animal husbandry. These two factors alone have </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION added the equivalent of, roughly, 55,000,000 acres to the effective prop area since the World War, which is an increase of about 18 per cent. It is these two new factors, principally, which have enabled the total crop acreage to remain almost stationary while agricul - tural production increased about 20 per cent. Soil Erosion mid Land Resources One other factor deserves consideration, and that is the loss by soil erosion, notably In the South and Southwest. It is estimated by Mr. H. H. Bennett, of the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, that between a fourth and a third rif the cultivated land in the United States is eroding seriously, that is, the surface soil will be gone, unless, farm practices are changed, in US to 100 years, varying with the character of the soil and other condi - tions. In other words, within 100 years, gullying seems likely to be well advanced on 100,000,000 acres. • Mr. Bennett states further that "something like 17,500,000 acres of land that were formerly cultivated in this country have been destroyed by gullying, or so severely washed that farmers can not afford to attempt their cultivation or reclamation." He adds — "the estimate is considered a minimum, because all the eroded lands have not yet been surveyed." f^&gt; """" — T&gt;^^__^ REGIONAL SOIL EROSION AREAS /--\ Fir,. 17. -Soil losses by erosion are becoming increasingly serious in many portions «f the United States., particularly in the South and Southwest. As the surface soil in these areas is removed by sheet erosion and the sub-soil is exposed, gullying develops, because of the less porous and usually heavier character of the subsoil : and In a few years the gullies frequently become so large as to render cultivation of the land impracticable. It is estimated by the United States Bureau of Chemistry and Soils that fully 17 million acres of formerly cultivated land have been rendered incapable of cultivation by erosion, and that on about 100 million acres, erosion is becoming serious and will result in rendering the land non-tillable unless prompt measures are taken to ret aril the process. </seg>
            <seg id="p180">REPORT OF NEURASKA STATE BOARD OV AGRICULTURE Erosion appears likely, therefore, to reduce materially the acre - age in crops locally during the next decade or two in many parts of the United States. (Fig. 17). Looking farther into the future, it appears inevitable that, unless eroding lands can be restored to pas - ture or forests, or other means of restoring soil loss as adopted, exten - sive land abandonment will occur in these areas of severe erosion, involving an increase in tax delinquency, slow impoverishment of the community, with serious social consequences, and eventual extinction of agriculture in the locality. But the area of potentially arable land in the United States is so great that even the loss of many million acres of land by erosion, although of extreme importance locally, probably will not seriously effect the trend of agricultural production for the Nation as a whole. There are at present about 260,000,000 acres of land in harvested crops in the United States, but there remain, probably, 600,000,000 acres more that could be used for crops. Of this 600,000.000 acres, about a half, or 300,000,000 acres require only plowing to be put into crops. These 300,000,000 acres consist of 41,000,000 acres of idle or fallow crop land in farms, according to the 1930 Census, 109,000,000 acres of plowable pasture in farms, probably 100,000,000 acres of semi-arid dry-farming land not in farms, used mostly for grazing at present, and possibly 50,000,000 acres of arable sub-humid land not In farms. (Fig. 18). The 300,000,000 acres which will require reclamation or clearing include 30,000,000 acres of poten - tially irrigable land, about 75,000,000 acres of land requiring drainage to be suitable for crop production, and, roughly, 195,000,000 of forest and cut-over land not requiring drainage. Even after excluding the 100,000,000 acres that may be lost by erosion, it appears, therefore, that agricultural production could be doubled merely by the extension of the cropped areas. But production probably will be increased more cheaply by using fertilizers, by keeping better cows, and by the many other ways of increasing yield per acre previously noted. Regional Shifts in Land Utilization These regional shifts in land utilization, which the progress of erosion will render inevitable in the future, are, indeed, already occurring. Other factors than erosion have also exerted an influence, the principal influence since the World War being the mechanization of agriculture. Between 1919 and 1925 a net decrease in the total crop acreage of the nation of about 13,000,000 acres took place, according to the Census, — the first decrease ever recorded by the Census. The decrease was very great In the Piedmont portion of Georgia and South Carolina owing doubtless to the devastations of the boll weevil as well as to erosion, while the progress of mechanization in Texas and Oklahoma also doubtless exerted an influence.

Most of this plowable land is in farms, and provides a much lancer reserve than is ever likely to be needed for crops— unless exports of farm products increase many fold. 1919 reducing the acreage harvested nearly one-half. This increase of crop acreage in the Western Plains was owing largely to the great advance in application of power to grain production, enabling one man to seed and harvest perhaps twice as large an acreage as a decade earlier, thereby making crop production profitable on much drier land. Between 1924 and 1929 these regional trends in crop acreage continued, except that the area of greatest decline moved northward.

In the Southeastern States, where the decrease hail been so notable between 1910 and 1024. the decrease durins the second half or the decade was small and scattered and was exceeded by increnses in several states. Southeast of this belt less notable decreases in crop acreage occurred in most counties of Tennessee and South Carolina, also in about half the counties of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia. West Virginia and Kentucky, and in more than half the counties of Maryland and Delaware. A recovery in some of the counties of this region from the drastic . declines between 1919 and 1924 was to be expected. However, in more than Tialf the counties in the South - eastern States and in most of Indiana, Ohio, and Southern Michigan, the declines between 1919 and 1924 have continued into the period 1924-1929.

Three areas of increase in crop acreage in the East also deserve notice, — (1) the Mississippi River bottom lands from Missouri southward to the sugar-growing counties of Louisiana, and also in the Coastal Prairie rice district. Reaction from the decline in crop acreage after the World War appears to have spread from these Mississippi River bottoms eastward almost to Georgia and westward Into Texas. (2) The Southern tip of Texas, notably around Corpus Christi. (3) The Coastal Plain of Eastern North Carolina and Southeastern Virginia. This increase is attributable, in part, to the fairly favorable prices for cotton prior to 1929. </seg>
            <seg id="p184">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Between 1919 and 1924 crop areas in the United StateB decreased 13,000,000 acres, but this was counterbalanced between 1924 and 1929 by an increase of 15,000,000 acres, according to the Census. In 1930 there was a further gain of 2,000,000 acres of crop land, according to estimates of United States Department of Agriculture, but in 1931 came. a drop of 9,000,000 acres. Total crop acreage is less now than at the close of the World War. In 1930 there were 41,000,000 acres of crop land lying idle or fallow, while pasture in farms has increased also by 41,000,000 acres. Most of the increase of pasture, however, like that of the crops, occurred in the western half of the United States, where former range land has been included within farm boundaries without any marked change in character of use or productivity. On the other hand, most of the increase in idle crop land has occurred in the eastern half of the United States. It is evident that progress in the use of the tractor., combine, and other large-scale machinery in the West has continued tt&gt; promote expansion of crop acreage, and this has continued to exert a depressing effect upon eastern agriculture. Since the Census was taken this depression has extended in very severe form into parts of the West also, and it seems not unlikely that the expansion of crop acreage in the Great Plains and other Western areas will slow up, possible cease entirely, for a while. In Conclusion The farmers of the United States and all who are interested In the welfare of agriculture should realize that a great change has occurred in the ideals of the American people, which is altering the nge composition of the population and, unless a reconsideration soon occurs, will reverse the trend of national development. The rapidly declining birth rate and the rigid restriction of immigration, coupled with the impoverishment of the European nations to which we formerly exported large quantities of farm products, and. the prospect of a de - clining population in these nations also, has made former land, policies as obsolete as the hoe and the flail. Only yesterday the spirit of youth pervaded the American Nation. The free land in the West beckoned the young man with the promise of a home and accumulation of a competence. The rapidly-growing cities also offered opportunities to acquire wealth as the population of the cities increased. Immigrants from Europe were welcome to share in the political equality, in the economic opportunity afforded by the cities, and in the joy of exploiting the greatest contiguous area of arable land in the world, with the possible exception of the Russian steppes and woodlands. Yet now, when the conquest of the Continent is no more than half complete, and while the trend of per capita income and wealth is upward, the aspirations of the people alter </seg>
            <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION until today both the true natural increase of population and immigra - tion are reduced practically to nothing. It is clear that unless there is an increase in the Nation's popula - tion, or in exports of farm products, more rapid than the advance in agricultural technique, the trend will be to concentrate production upon the more level, more fertile, or more favorably located land. Despite an increase of nearly 16,000,000 in the Nation's population during the past decade, over 32,000,000 acres of land which were in crops in 1919 lay idle, reverted to brush, or were used for pasture in 1929, mostly in the States east of the Mississippi River and in the Pacific Coast States. During the next decade the increase of popula - tion probably will be only about half as great as during the last decade, while progress in agricultural technique doubtless will con - tinue. Agricultural occupation of new lands may be left to individual initiative in a period of rapidly increasing population and demand for farm products; but agricultural recession in nearly half of the farming area of the Nation raises new problems, many of which are evidently beyond the power of the individual to solve. Privations can be borne joyfully in a pioneer environment when land is appreciating in value and the condition of poverty is recognized as transitory, but the situation is very difficult when land is depreciating in value and the condition of poverty is recognized as not only permanent but also pro - gressive. We must realize that the situation with reference to sub - marginal land is not transitory but in all likelihood will persist for many years to come. Question: You left the impression that using dairy products is a good thing — that it is better than using cereals. Mr. Baker: That depends. It is a good thing for the -dairy farmer. Question: Is there any possibility of Russia becoming a com - petitor in the world market? Mr. Baker: Even the best informed know so little of Russia. I have had a great many Russian visitors to the United States. They stopped coming this year. Professor Filley knows how I send them around among my friends over the United States and impose on them to take care of them. I do not believe that we need to worry much about Russia. Some 80 per cent of the people of Russia are still living on farms. They know nothing about birth control and the population is increasing rapidly. They are putting enormous amounts of money into health campaigns. I heard only two or three weeks ago that they have established a lot of clinics all over Russia to promulgate knowledge, of birth control. They realize that this is a problem. </seg>

Of course they need to industrialize. They are doing what they ought to do — getting olT the farm to the city. Question: What about the consumption per capita in our ma - chine age? Mr. linker: There wasn't much decrease until the war. Since then we have had an increase in use of dairy products, a tremendous increase in sugar consumption, an increase in the use of pork and lard, a decline in beef use, and a notable decline in breadstuffs. Mr. Rogers: Hasn't the increase of milk consumption been due to the decrease in the consumption of beer? Mr. Baker: It used to be the beer wagon and now it's the milk wagon. In the cities dairy lunches have opened up and people drink milk. I might add that I wish the American dairymen were fully aware of the danger that confronts them should a change be made in the prohibition amendment. I- would expect if we had free beer again, that it would cripple the dairy industry. It is something we ought to think about. REPORT OF THE 19S1 NEBRASKA CORN YIELD CONTEST P. H. STEWART and D. L. GROSS* The largest enrollment of contestants in the history of the Ne - braska ten-acre yield contest started the 1931 season. Of the 275 men who entered the contest, 63 finished in the eastern section, 74 in the central, 13 in the west and 12 in the irrigated region, making a total finish up of 162 men. In view of the very adverse corn year, particularly in the Important corn area in northeastern Nebraska, the number who finished was very gratifying. Yields of contestants in the eastern and central section were smaller than in any previous contest. The 64 men in the east averaged 4 4 bushels and the 74 central Nebraska contestants averaged 32 bushels per acre. No one produced 100 bushels per acre for member - ship in the 100-Bushel Club. George Eiker of Brule grew. the highest yield of the season, 95.8 bushels per acre, under irrigation. This is the third consecutive year that Mr. Eiker has had the highest yield in the irrigated section and the entire state as he grew 99.5 bushels in 1930 and 108.7 in 1929. • Acknowledsment is made to L. R. Snipes anil W. E. Huff of the Rural Economics Dei&gt;aitmi i nt and to County Extension Audits of the state fnr assistance in securing entries, yields and data for the Corn Yield Contest. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The state was divided as usual into eastern, central, western and irrigated regions. All irrigated land, regardless of location, was placed in the irrigated region. The eastern Nebraska region is composed of that part of the state lying east of the west line of Knox county south to Merrick, thence along the 1'latte to the west side of Butler then south to the state line. The west lines of Keya Patia, Brown, Blaine, Custer, Gosper and Red Willow counties make up the western boun - dary of the central region. All counties west of the central region compose the western region. -fillies of the Contest Except for changing Furnas and lied Willow counties into the central section and an adjustment of labor and market prices to current iigures, the contest has been carried on under the same rules that have been used for several years. Briefly, the rules are as follows: ' "Any person more than 18 years of age may enter a field of corn of ten or more acres on which he must submit a report giving rotation, cultural practices and labor data. Contestants are scored on the basis of 65 per cent for yield, 25 per cent for profit per acre, and 10 per cent for the quality of the product. "Kent was charged on the share basis, this being arbitrarily set at two-fifths in the eastern and irrigated sections, and one-third in the central and western sections. Corn was valued at 35 cents for No. 1 corn with 14 per cent moisture. Man labor was valued at 25 cents per hour, and horse labor at 13 cents per hour, this to cover machinery depreciation. Husking was charged at 6 cents per bushel to cover labor, wagon, team and board. Tractors were figured on a scale ranging as follows: Two bottom plow tractors tl.OO per hour, o bottom plow tractors $1.25 per hour, and 4 bottom sizes $1.50 per hour. This also covers depreciation on the machinery which they pull. Except for a few fields which were obviously low in yield, 20 pound samples of ear corn were taken at husking time for shrinkage, shell - ing and moisture determinations. Yields were figured on shelled corn with 14 per cent moisture." </seg>

The 1931 season except for a few local areas was very adverse for corn from the standpoint of deficient soil moisture and extremely high temperatures. In view of these conditions, which in many instances produced the best corn on the poorest land, it is rather surprising to note the rotation and fertility practices of the eight high men in the eastern section of the contest. </seg>

The 63 men in the eastern section of the 1931 con - test averaged eight years since their conHest fields were seeded down. It seems logical to summarize the importance of soil fertility in corn production under eastern Nebraska conditions in this way: Dur - ing dry adverse seasons fields high in fertility may not yield as much as poor fields and they, may actually yield somewhat less. This is due to the fact that a large amount of available nitrogen in the soil overstimulates the cprn plants early in the season thereby increasing their need of water, causing burning and tiring later in the season. However, during fair to good seasons, such well maintained fields yield considerably more than poor fields. Fields low in fertility will not make a high yield regardless of the favorableness of the season. The highest average yields in eastern Nebraska and on irrigated and subirrigated soils may be expected from well maintained soils. On upland tields in central Nebraska, especially in the south central part and in western Nebraska, corn on soils which are too rich may burn very badly. Farmers have recognized this fact and make a practice of grain-farming fields longer than would be profit - able in eastern Nebraska. This is well shown in the following table: Years Since Highest Yeilding Vplnnd Contest Fields Were In legumes or Sod Crops. Eight-year Average Eastern region Central region Western region 1.4 years 29 years 15 years Further evidence that farmers recognize the necessity of not getting central and western Nebraska soils too high in fertility, espe - cially in nitrogen, is shown by the number of years since all contest fields were in legume or sod crops in eastern, central and western Nebraska. </seg>

Clean fields may not yield high but the yield is at least higher than would be the case If weeds were numerous. Killing weeds early in the year by methods which are timely and economical such as by disking and harrowing is important. The men who reported good yields did not do an excessive amount of work on their fields. They kept them clean. Cultivation in excess of the amount needed to eradicate the weeds is not likely to pay divi - dends. There is no magic in merely cultivating the soil, in fact, any - thing but very shallow cultivation if the corn is tall and well devel - oped may actually do harm, because of the injury to the root system of the crop. Corn Varieties and Types Variety tests and farm experience have shown that there is a wide difference in the yield and quality of corn produced by different lots of seed corn. Varieties and selections differ also in strength of stalk and shanks, suckering. tendency to smut, freedom from ear rots, and In other ways. Many illustrations of differences in corn varieties are found when the contest fields are checked for yield in the fall. No one growing a late, rough, deep kerneled, starchy type of corn has stood among the top contestants in the eight years of the contest. The Use of Machinery In the seven-year period of 1924-1930, records on the amount of man labor spent per acre shows a uniform decrease in the eastern and western sections and a general decrease in the central and irri - gated sections. This has been due to ah Increase in the use of larger machinery such as multiple row cultivators, tractors and the general use of more power per man. An increase in the per cent of men who listed their contest fields has also had a tendency to reduce the man. hours per acre. The following tables show the trend toward larger machinery, and listing: </seg>

Observations during the year indicated that fewer tractors were being used than in 1930. The contest figures show about a 10 per cent decrease in the number of men using tractors in eastern, western and irrigated sections although central Nebraska contestants used more tractors than in 1930. The per cent of men using 2-3-4-row cultivators showed some decline in all but the central section. Eastern, central and western Nebraska showed a small increase in the per cent of men list - nig their corn. The machinery trend for the year had its effect apparently on the amount of man hours required per acre of corn up to husking time. </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS- ASSOCIATION Central Nebraska showed a decrease from 4.1 to 3.7 man hours per acre. Contestants under irrigation likewise decreased from 6.4 to 5.5 man hours per acre. However, contestants in eastern and western Nebraska sections increased their man hours per acre from 5.6 to 5.9 and 2.9 to 3.3, respectively. On the whole, however, the trend toward more power used per man hour is still under way. It may be checked temporarily by economic conditions. With the recovery of prices and the further development of machinery, the trend is likely to be resumed. The 1930 report gave the remarkable record of Floyd Brown of Stamford, who in 1930 grew his corn with an expenditure of 1.2 man hours per acre. Mr. Brown lowered his record to 1.13 man hours per acre in 1932. His records, which cover the actual work done on 110 acres of upland and bench land, show that the land was disked with a tractor in intermediate gear pulling two 20-blade disks. A total of 16 hours were required for disking. The 110 acres were listed in 58.5 hours with a two-row lister. A four-row weeder was pulled with the tractor, taking 21 hours for the first time over and 17% hours for the second with an additional 11 man hours and 44 horse hours for cultivating with horses. No other work was done on the fields which were reasonably weed-free, making a yield of 37 bushels on the 10-acre contest field. However, the record of E. W. Ott on upland in Harland county in central Nebraska shows an expenditure of 1.02 man hours per acre which is even less than Mr. Brown's record. Mr. Otfs labor record on 101 acres of corn following wheat shows 42 hours of listing with a two-row lister pulled with a tractor. In cultivating.. 36 man hours were spent with a 4-row weeder pulled with a tractor and 24 man hours with a 2-row weeder also tractor pulled. The corn was culti - vated twice. A total of 102 man hours were spent on 100 acres or 1.02 man hours per acre. The corn was free of weeds and it is very doubtful if additional cultivation would have been of value. It is not suggested that all contestants can and should equal these records but the point is that some men are producing corn in an efficient way and at a very low cost. Relation of Yield to Profit Why emphasize high yields? Are not our crop surpluses the resirit of high yields? Do not big crops often bring less than small crops? These questions are often asked . What is the truth of the matter so far as the individual farmer is concerned? As a matter of fact, the man who has a small crop and no surplus grain to sell is not benefited by a high price for corn or other crops. If low yields per acre mean a profit then a crop failure should be a bonanza. </seg>

            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION So far as the individual farmer is concerned, he must have high yields produced at a low cost if he is to have any prospect for a profit from his grain. Figure 21 shows the labor income, that is, the amount which a farmer -receives to pay for his time on corn yields of 25. 35 and ■15 bushels per acre after two-fifths of the crop is paid for share rent, after power and machinery costs are paid Tor at the rates specified in the contest and after husking costs at 6c per bushel are paid. The average power and machinery costs for the 63 men in the eastern section, of the contest are used as a basis for these figures. Corn is valued at 35c per bushel. On this basis, a man in eastern Nebraska with a 25-bushel yield of corn would receive. 42c to pay him for his six hours put in on an acre of corn or 7 cents per hour as a wage. A yield of 35 bushels would bring in a labor income of ?1.92 or a wage of 32 cents per hour after all costs were paid. A 43-oushel yield would bring in ?3.42 cents per acre or 52 cents per hour for his time. The man- who, on the average, makes the most profit from his corn or other crops, is the one who produces high acre yields and at the same time uses labor and machinery efficiently. The contest figures bring this out in a striking way. The use' of good seed, the maintenance of high soil fertility in relation to local rainfall, the timeliness of doing field work and the efficient operation of machinery with the end in view of having the soil in good condition and free of weeds, are the main items in determining the profit from corn.

KIESSELBACH Corn may not be a highly profitable crop at this time but we will continue growing a large acreage in this state. I believe there is no other state in the Union that can grow corn as cheaply as Ne - braska. Relatively speaking, we are going to be well off among the corn growers of the country. We annually produce about 230 million bushels on about nine million acres. Whether we should continue growing such a large acreage, let our economists decide. The ques - tions to be considered this afternoon especially concern the economy of production. Any industry that is well managed is very much concerned with practices which result In low cost of operation.' Meth - ods of corn growing which increase acre yields without a proportional increase in cost bring about more profitable production. Practices which lessen the cost of operation without a material reduction in yield also contribute to increased profits. Although the outcome of our corn crop, as measured in terms of crop yields, is very much dependent upon the rainfall and other climatic factors, the success of corn growing is by no means entirely a matter of the weather. Great importance attaches to the kind of management given the soil from the standpoint of crop rotation, manuring, seed-bed preparation and weed control. The yield and quality of grain are also greatly influenced by the use of sound seed of productive adapted varieties and by well planned planting practices. The Individual farmer is interested in low cost of production, and this can be facilitated through efficient seed and field manage - ment which leads to larger acre yields. It is not only what we do this year that counts. The manner in which the soil has been cared for during past years helps decide present yields. Many of the better managed farms yield half again as much in the average year as some neighboring farms simply because proper attention has been given to keeping up the soil productivity. This means keeping some live - stock and a fair acreage of alfalfa and sweet clover or red clover used in the rotation system wherever these crops can be grown. Plan - ning ahead for future corn crops by a constructive program of main - taining soil productivity is an essential of any rational farming system. Then too, early and thorough seed-bed preparation is usually profitable procedure. Where the land is plowed for corn an approxi - mate depth of seven inches at an early date is desirable, this alone has caused corn to yield 12 per cent more during six years at the Agricultural College than where the plowing was done just prior. to planting. In the case of listing a previous disking or else double listing have proved preferable to mere single listing. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Our time U rather short aud we will have opportunity to discuss only a few of the many factors involved in the growing of this greatest of all crops. Since this part of our program is to be handled in the lorni of a corn question box, it is hoped that you will feel free to ask any questions in which you may be interested, and also to relate any experiences you have had. QUESTION: Do you think that Nebraska farmers are growing the right type of corn? Would it not be better for us to occasionally send away for new seed? Mil. KIESSEL.BACH: As a whole, Nebraska farmers are to be commended for the seed they plant. In earlier years, there was far greater tendency to send away to considerable distances, east or south, for seed of some highly advertised sort, without first having given it a trial under local conditions to establish its suitability. The result frequently was immature and soft corn with lowered yield and quality, due to the plant types being too large and late ripening. On the other hand, sending long distances north or west may result in too extremely small vegetative development and eariiness of maturity for maximum yield. As a general practice, therefore, it is desirable to use locally grown seed of recognized high productivity. All of the chances of adaptation, high yield ,and good quality are in its favor. QUESTION: While what you say seems fully borne out by farm experience, and we have less soft corn in the country than used to be the case, is it not true that corn runs out after we have grown it a few years, and It should then be replaced? MR. KIESSELBACH: Little importance is to be attached to the idea of corn running out due to being grown on the same farm for a long term of years. Changes that take place in corn after some years of local production are more likely to be advantageous than harmful. The corn is .becoming adapted to local conditions due to the operation of the principle of survival of the most suitable plant types. Why should corn run out or deteriorate any more locally than anywhere else? QUESTION: Is there any way that we men on the farm can im - prove our own corn by selection or breeding? MR. KIESSELBACH: Yes, if a type of corn is being grown that is regarded just a little too late ripening, and much of our corn is affected that way, it may be made a few days earlier ripening by selecting for seed during a few years a somewhat more slender, smoother, fewer rowed ear, with somewhat shorter and more horny kernels. These ear and kernel characters are normally correlated with inherited eariiness of maturity and smaller vegetative development. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The smaller plant types with less leaf area per plant require less water in growing to maturity and therefore are better able to withstand conditions of moisture shortage. The amount of water required by a corn plant is fairly proportional to its leaf area. The picking of sound, well developed ears is suggestive of well adapted, productive plants. Progress in changing the prevailing type of plants in a variety may also be made directly by observing the growing plants in the Weld and selecting the seed ears from the type desired. In this way plants may be selected for such characters as earliness, size, ear height, freedom from suckers, lodge resistance, and strong ear shanks. It normally takes several years to bring about any appreciable change. In any event the shelled seed should always be made up from a large number of ears rather than to increase the seed supply from just a single ear. Such restricted selection is apt to result in a degree of inbreeding which lowers yields. QUESTION: Isn't it considered advisable when we want seed to get it from the north? MR. KIESSElJ,BACH: There is no advantage in getting it from the north provided you can find suitable seed in your own locality. If you wish to send away for seed, it is safer to send north rather than south. Statements in regard to seed brought in from a distance should be qualified because we can under some conditions send long distances for seed corn. Distance' is not the difficulty. It is the chanc you run in getting corn that is unadapted. The Experiment Station has repeatedly sent for seed corn as far away as Illinois to a locality that is practically due east of here. We get this seed from certain growers with whose corn we have had some experience and know that it fits our climate and soil conditions, as a general thing. I would prefer to send 50 or 100 miles north for seed rather than the same distance south. It is not so important where your seed corn was grown if you have assurance through past experience that it is the type of corn you should be growing; that is. If you have found that it matures well, and is really productive under your local conditions. Never send a great distance for corn for your general planting unless you or some neighbor have had some 'experience with it. It appears from variety tests at the Experiment Station that some corn growers could well afford to substitute some other good variety for their own seed. This can best be done after trying out corn on a small scale from a number of successful corn growers during a period ot years. MR. COOPER: You believe then that the corn grower should convince himself over a period of years as to a variety before making a complete change of seed? </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS" ASSOCIATION MR. KIESSELBACH: I believe that is true. Some years a certain variety may produce 10 bushels more and another year 10 bushels less than your local corn. In determining what constitutes a highly productive corn for your use the performance over a period of years should be considered. One should not make a hasty change. MR. WELDON; of Wood River: One year I sent down into Kansas and got some corn that is excellent in that state and planted it in Central Nebraska. The crop from it grew 12 to 14 feet tall and did not mature. MR. KIE.SSELBACH: You probably sent a little too far southeast in Kansas. I believe you could have sent to northwestern Kansas, not too far west, and obtained corn pretty well adapted to your con - ditions. I would like to ask you folks" whether you consider that there is some one variety that is outstandingly superior for the state, or for any rather large region within the state. MR. COOPER: Why restrict it to one variety? I should think that there may be several very productive varieties of about equal merit. MR. BIERMAN: It is my opinion that the importance of variety name is overstressed. Reid Yellow Dent, as grown by different growers and in different parts of the state, may differ decidedly in adaptation and yield. More importance should be attached to the type of corn than to the variety. MR. KIESSELBACH: That would seem to summarize the ques - tion of variety very well. It might be added that the strains of corn prown by some farmers have probably been lowered in yield somewhat by a process of seed selection which resulted in a sufficient degree of close or inbreeding to lower its yielding ability. In the earlier days, twenty years or more ago, when the importance of corn show prize winnings was greatly over-rated, it was not. uncommon for the cham - pionship single ears to sell at auction for almost fabulous prices. Such ears were sometimes planted by themselves for increase in isolated seed plats. Such treatment has been found to lower yielding ability in some cases. In open pollinated varieties of corn it is desir - able to always shell together a rather large number of ears for the seed supply as this will avoid close breeding. MR. COOPER: I would like to ask Mr. Biermann about his ex - perience with winning show corn. Has he ever planted prize winning samples separately to see if there was any difference in production? MR. BIERMANN: I think the folks at the Experiment Station are in a better position than I to answer that. My results are prac - tically the same as those at the Experiment Station but no farmer </seg>
            <seg id="p204">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE T7GARD OF AGRICULTURE can give any very definite or reliable yield information. We are not. equipped to make reliable tests. MR. KIESSELBACH: Mr. Biermann is "passing the buck." The type of corn which Mr. Biermann has been selecting toward is what we think of as the Nebraska "utility" type of corn, which is some - what more slender and shallow than was popular in the state a few years ago. We are now picking the more slender, smoother ears from the same variety we have been growing and consequently have a better adapted type through ear type selection. One can bring about the same change by going into the field and selecting plant types. Mr. Biermann used to have. . I think, the older score-card idea in mind but he has changed his type. MR. BIERMANN: I thing your observations are in accordance with mine. MR. KIESSELBACH: At our Agronomy Farm this year we grew corn from more than twenty farmers. Some lots yielded better than our standard Hogue Yellow Dent variety; some yielded less. ■ Some yielded only about half as much as others. We do believe that there is a wide variability in the producing ability of corn which farmers are growing. Comparative yield tests serve to bring out differences. MR. MOTT: Has the college carried oh any experiments with hybrid corn this past season? MR. KIESSELBACH: We had very extensive field tests with commercial and experimental hybrids. We tested eight commercial hybrids, and by commercial hybrids we think of hybrid seed corn that can be purchased on the market. Of these eight hybrids two yielded as well, or a little better than our standard Hogue Yellow Dent corn; the rest yielded less. You are taking quite a chance In investing in commercial hybrids as some commercial hybrids are less satisfactory than ordinary standard varieties. In some cases the com - mercial producer changes the particular hybrid combination from year to year and the corn you were growing this year is not the corn you prew last year or the year before. Where that is the case you are not able to build up experience with one particular hybrid. We ar«» hoping as time goes on that these producers will settle on one or several hybrids. They are working with the best of spirit and aro trying to improve the hybrid seed corn. We had some experimental hybrids which yielded twenty bushels better than standard varieties. We believe at this time that farmers probably ' should not buy com - mercial hybrid seed except for some special reason as for instance, to secure strong stiff stalks adapted to the use of a corn picking machine. The principal of corn Improvement by hybridization is sound, and after a few years we will, I believe, be ablfe to depend definitely on hybrids for certain regions where they have been tried out. Last year twenty farmers' varieties averaged 25.6 bushels compared with </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION 25. 0 bushels as an average for eight commercial hybrids, and 41.8 bushels average for the thirty best experimental hybrids. MR. McAHDLK: I grew some of Pflster's Krug corn from El Paso, Illinois, this year. It yielded well and was the earliest maturing corn 1 ever raised. MR. KIESSELBACH: Was the type satisfactory to you? MR. McAHDLK: Very. MR. KIESSELBACH: Mr. Pflster has selected rather an ex - tremely smooth type but It is a high yielding corn. As a four-year average Pflster's Krug yielded 1V6 bushels less than Hogue Yellow Dent, but that is really a good performance as Hogue's is very high yielding. We do not recommend Hogue corn for farm use on account of Its tendency to lodge and sucker. Pflster's Krug corn has a strong stalk and suckers very little. It seems to have been selected along productive lines. The Experiment Station has decided to adopt this Krug variety as its standard variety, and recommends it for eastern Nebraska. MR. MOTT, Hastings: A year ago I had a very good field of hybrid corn. It had very strong stalks, and one feature I noticed was that every stalk had a good ear. My Minnesota 13 had some barren stalks, but in the hybrid I couldn't find a stalk in the whole field without an ear. MR. McARDLE: Isn't it generally considered now that corn dried quickly and thoroughly by artificial heat has stronger germina - tion than corn dried slowly by usual methods. MR. KIESSELBACH: I believe not, if the corn which has dried slowly under normal field conditions Is sufficiently dry before heavy freezing sets in so it is not injured by low temperatures. There is a close correlation between moisture content and freezing injury of corn. I believe it is pretty hard to beat nature in the drying of seed corn if you are growing a corn that matures in a satisfactory manner in the fall. There are some exceptions to that. There would be little justification for paying a high price for artificially dried seed corn, provided you can get satisfactory germination from field selected seed or from corn dried in your seed room. I think • artificially dried corn Is a matter of insurance and safety. QUESTION: Are the small nubbins produced last year in many sections as a result of drouth unsuitable for seed? Will they yield less than if the seed had been produced under favorable conditions? Also how important Is It to have a perfect germination? ■MR. KIESSELBACH: Due to excessive drouth last year, corn ears were relatively small in many sections of (he state, and do not look much like seed ears as we usually think of them. Many corn growers express fear that such ears are not fit for seed. This is |i </seg>
            <seg id="p206">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE needless worry? The best ears produced under such conditions, even though small, are very desirable for seed. The unfavorable conditions have provided an opportunity for survival of the fittest. In case very early ripening corn were needed for early hog feed, or for late replanting in eastern Nebraska, seed obtained from long distances, say two to three hundred miles, north or west, should meet such requirements. To produce a maximum yield such corn should be planted thicker than normal because of its small vegetative size. Even then it could normally be expected to yield only about three - fourths as much grain as the standard local types. When it comes to the question of germination, corn as a whole matured fairly well last fall and there should be little trouble this spring in picking sound seed ears. Farmers naturally reject for seed those ears which are visibly moldy or rotted or light in weight, and thereby pick seed that is sufficiently free from seed-borne seedling dis - eases for all practical purposes under Nebraska conditions. It is always desirable before planting a field to corn to make a thoroughly reliable germination test of a representative sample of the seed in order to know just how much of it may be expected to grow. The chief cause of low germination in this state is freezing Injury during the fall or winter while the corn still contains a high proportion of water. Well dried seed is not injured by cold. The importance" of a reliable germination test cannot be over - stressed, because it should serve as a guide in adjusting the planter. Every corn grower has an ideal as to how close he wishes the plants spaced in the field. If the seed does not germinate perfectly the planting rate may be proportionately increased. One may get a good bit of satisfaction from results at the Experiment Station, during a fifteen-year period which indicate that slight irregularities in stand are not serious from the standpoint of yield, provided a reasonably normal number of plants per acre are secured. In the case of occa - sional missing plants, the neighboring plants grow and yield so much better that they practically make up for the missing plants. In the case of checked corn at the Agricultural Experiment Station, a stand of three plants per hill in hills spaced 3% feet apart has given the highest yield. Two plants per hill has yielded only three bushels less, while four plants per hill' has yielded 2% bushels less during a fifteen-year period. These data would seem to justify all reasonable effort to secure a stand of approximately three plants per hill in eastern Nebraska or a corresponding rate per acre, if the corn is drilled or listed. Corn is commonly spaced farther apart with an approach toward central and Western Nebraska, due to lower rainfall. Carelessness in picking seed may result in too thin a stand and serious loss of yield. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The manner of seed distribution in the row, whether in hills or in drills, has been found to have no effect upon the yield. Checked corn can usually be kept free from weeds more easily than surface planted drilled corn. Farm experience in most of central and western Nebraska is decidedly in favor of listing. In eastern Nebraska there is relatively little difference in yield if thorough-going practices are employed by either method. The individual farmer may choose either method, acording to the lay of his land, the equipment available, and the relative cost of operation. There is a prevailing opinion that listed corn can be more cheaply produced. Slipshod listing practices are undesirable from the standpoint of both corn yields and the yield of succeeding small grain crops. QUESTION: What has been your experience as to time of planting? MR. KIESSELBACH: Reasonably early corn planting has proved advantageous over late planting. While there are exceptions,. it brings the plants into the silking and tasseling stage somewhat earlier and during more favorable climatic conditions. Early planted corn also ripens earlier and results in lessened danger of early frost damage Planting at the Agricultural College at Lincoln between May 5 and May 2 0 has given best results during a period of years. QUESTION: Some of my neighbors tell me that they grow their best corn in fieltla that are. somewhat weedy, and I am wondering just what effort should be made to keep down weeds. MR. KIESSELBACH: Whatever the planting practice, it com - monly pays to disk or harrow the ground just prior to planting as a weed control measure. Rather free use of the harrow or weeder on plowed ground just before planting, and again just before or after the corn comes up proves a great help in killing weeds. In other words, swat the weeds early before rainy weather or other cause may result in their making so much headway that they will be a serious annoyance afterwards. Ordinarily it is necessary to cultivate corn only enough to control the weeds. In weedy corn fields the weeds use moisture and nutrients which might otherwise be used by the corn. Weeds sometimes reflect favorable soil moisture conditions tor corn,, but in themselves are no aid to the corn, as suggested by your neighbors. There is no advantage in continued late cultivation after corn is normally laid by. QUESTION: What have you found to be the need for seed corn treatments, such as are recommended to prevent corn diseases, worms and squirrels? MR. KIESSELBACH: As an average for the last five years In Experiment Station tests, farm selected or planter-box seed was un - affected in Held stand by representative mercuric seed treatments, and </seg>
            <seg id="p208">UEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE it yielded one-half bushel less grain per acre when treated. At the North l'latte Experimental Farm, Zook and JoJon obtained one bushel reduction in grain yield per acre as" an average for seven different organic mercury treatments applied to ordinary farm selected seed. These are evidences that farm selected seed is commonly not suf - licientiy infected with seedling disease organisms to respond materially to treatment when planted at the prevailing standard rate under Ne - braska conditions. Outlying tests in cooperation with farmers have brought the same results. Likewise, the Experiment Station knows of no seed treatment that Is helpful in preventing damages from worms, rodents, or birds under Held conditions. Nebraska farmers In general, who have tried seed corn treat - ments of various kinds, have been disappointed with them and have discontinued their use. MR.KIESSELBAOH: What do you Nebraska corn growers think sweet clover does in the way of increasing corn yields when plowed under in the Spring of its second year? MK. COOPER, of Douglas County: I have never had very good results with plowing green sweet clover under in the spring .of Its second season. My experience has been that it burns more than where corn follows two years of sweet clover. I have tripled the yield of corn on the same field by two years of sweet clover. Instead of raising 25 bushels, I have raised 75 bushels to the acre. MR. KIESSELBACH: There are soils in eastern Nebraska rather tiadly run down due to soil erosion or continuous cropping where' we believe you can easily double the yield of corn during favorable years by growing sweet clover. QUESTION: What is the relative value of plowing the sweet clover under in the spring of its- second year as compared to leaving it for the full two years, and just how does this practice work out in different parts of the state? MR. KIESSELBACH: I am going to ask Mr. Stewart to discuss that question. MR. STEWART: Judging by the amount of sweet clover which is now being grown in the state, it must be giving good results. We know of some localities, particularly In the eastern part of the state, where more than 75 per cent of the small grain has sweet clover seeded with it. As one goes westward in the state, there is more difficulty in cropping land following sweet clover. I was interested recently In discussing the use of sweet clover in south-central Ne - braska with the manager of a large estate in that part of the state. Formerly they had in their lease a requirement that their tenants sow 20 acres of sweet clover every year. They have found that this </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA CHOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION is building up more fertility than their average rainfall will handle without danger from burning. It has been shown ' that when sweet clover Is plowed under in the spring of the second year it does very materially increase the. fertility, particularly nitrogen. It has been estimated that six to eight Inches of growth plowed under during late April or early May adds from 70 to 75 per cent of the nitrogen that would be secured if the sweet clover is allowed to grow for its full second season. Many farmers, however,, judge the amount of fertility that second year sweet clover will add by the amount of growth. They are rather inclined to allow the sweet clover to get too tall before they plow it under for corn. Rank growth uses mucft soil moisture and it Is difljcult to prepare a good seed-bed and get a good stand of corn when a tall growth of second year sweet clover is plowed under. Whether or not the sweet clover should be allowed to stand for the full two years, or plowed under In the spring of its second year, depends, I believe, pretty much on the individual farm and farmer. If the second year sweet clover is needed for pasture, then It might well be left stand the full two seasons. Then too, if the soil is par - ticularly poor it would be well to allow the sweet clover to stand for the full second year as thiB not only adds the maximum of nitrogen but much organic matter is added and the soil is improved greatly in tilth. On the other hand, where the soil has been well maintained In fertility. It probaby Is more profitable in eastern Nebraska to plow the sweet clover under in the spring of its second year, doing this promptly before the growth is more than six to eight inches high. MR. KIESSELBACH: I would like to ask Mr. Dletz how they are using sweet clover in Custer County. MR. DIETZ: Sweet clover in Custer County has not been tried long enough for definite conclusions as to the best way to handle it in rotations. The common practice we have been following there is to sow the clover with oats or barley and pasture it In the fall and during its second year. Sometimes, Instead of using it for pas - ture, we. use it for hay or seed. Ordinarily we let it stand on the Jleld for the full two years. MR. KIESSELBACH: It would seem that the discussions this afternoon have emphasized many of the important considerations in connection with the growing of corn. Attention has been directed to the importance of crop rotation and maintenance of soil fertility; early and thorough seed-bed preparation; clean and timely cultiva - tion; careful seed selection, and use of a productive and adapted variety. </seg>
            <seg id="p210">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE DEBATE ON Kesolved, That the Substitution of Other Crops for Twenty-five Per Cent of the Winter Wheat Acreage in Eastern Nebraska Would Increase the Net Farm Income Under Present Economic Condi - tions. AMOS. K. GRAMLICH, First Speaker on Affirmative My belief that the substitution of other crops for wheat would Increase the net farm income is sincere. The crop rotation on our own farm had wheat stricken from it three years ago and alfalfa and barley substituted with satisfactory results. Two forces have been vital during the last quarter century, in bringing about the present crisis in the wheat growing industry. These two forces are: tirst, the enormous increase in wheat acreage and production; second, the decline of demand due to substitution for wheat and a slower increase in the rate of population. In 1901, Sir Wm. Crooks, a British scientist, predicted a wheat shortage here in thirty years or by 1931. His belief, which seemed logical at that time and was held by many authorities, was that there remained but little uncultivated land suitable and profitable for wheat production in the United States and soon the rapidly increasing pop - ulation would consume all that was produced at home and more. He believed that we would be scrambling in the world market with Eng - land for import wheat. He, like others, did not see the part science was to play in wheat production. Thirty years ago the average wheat yield of the world was 12.7 bushels per acre. During the past seven years it has averaged 14.1 bushels per acre or an increase of 1.4 bushels over thirty years ago. With the present world wheat acreage, not including Russia which has no data at present, this means an annual increase in production of 450,000,000 bushels. Varieties have been developed which do well in regions of scant rainfall and short growing seasons. Modern tilling and seeding machinery have improved around the tractor. These, with the combine, have made possible wheat growing in areas of low yield because of the decreased cost of production. In 1929 the world wheat area outside of China and Russia was 245,000,000 acres as compared to 204,000,000 in the period 1909-1913. This increase of 40,000,000 acres was contributed to by the United States with 14,000,000, Canada 15.000.000, Australia 7,000,000 and Argentine with 3,000,000. The acreage in the United States has increased nearly thirty per cant since 1909. There seems to be no immediate prospect of abandoning any considerable portion of the world wheat .acreage. Each ' year farmers </seg>
            <seg id="p211">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION grow more than is consumed and contribute to the enormous surplus which has been piling up during the last half decade. We can thank the Hoover administration for a Farm Board to shoulder the respon - sibility for a surplus but the real trouble is a supply greater than the demand. Germany with a $1.62 tariff on wheat will eat a lot of sauer kraut when her own wheat is gone., France, Italy, and others have a high tariff to encourage home production and to prevent dump - ing by Russia .which is so characteristic of the Soviet regime. It also keeps American wheat outside their borders. The United States is also built up on a protective tariff basis but that is no aid to wheat so long as we have such an enormous domestic surplus. The second factor contributing to the crisis in wheat, and which directly affects the surplus, is the decreasing rate of population in " practically all of Western and Northern Europe and in the United ■ States. Here we found our people, from 1790 to the Civil War, obeying that Biblical injunction, "Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth." At the close of the Civil War came the development of manu - facturing with the concentration of people in the cities and a resultant tailing off In the birth rate. Unless birth rate increase or immigration is again opened the United States will reach its maximum population in a few years. Europe will be static in population increase at about the same time. When farm population increase becomes stationary the city in - crease will be so low that certainly a problem will develop to dispose of farm products, especially wheat. City people are not heavy con - sumers of bread. The World War wrote an indelible chapter into the food habits of American people and to a lesser degree the rest of the civilized world. During the war period the consumption dropped from an average of 211 pounds per capita for 1909-1913 to 176 pounds for 1917-1918 and since then has remained practically stationary. If per capita consumption could be brought back to the 1910 level it would remove two-thirds of the wheat we must now throw Into export channels. People are consuming more sugar, milk, pork, and fresh vegeta - bles and will probably not use less of these and return to wheat. If our farmers care to reduce themselves to the squalid standard of living found in the great semi-virgin wheat producing country of Russia the solution is easy. Just grow more wheat. If they desire to raise the present standard of living or even maintain it the problem becomes complex in many regions. Eastern Nebraska is fortunate for its soil is good; its rainfall sufficient; and </seg>
            <seg id="p212">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE its people resourceful. We are in a position to partially abolish wheat and thereby increase our farm income, pay off the mortgage, buy a new car, and retire In California. IRA KINDIG, FIRST SPEAKER ON NEGATIVE Air. Chairman: We all realize that we are confronted with a problem in wheat. We all know that our own granaries have been tilled and that the store houses of the world contain a great quantity of this commodity. We admit that there is truth in the figures pre - sented by our opponent. We agree that the storage holdings are unusually large; that large holdings tend to lower price and that these conditions have brought about a problem in the growing of wheat here in eastern Nebraska. In answer to the argument of the present surplus we, of the negative contend that we have just what, for the most part, is very desirable. We have a plenty. And we challenge anyone to prove to the satisfaction of himself or to any of us that a plenty is not a good thing. Are we hungry? Plenty to eat will suffice. Are we going to school? Got in lust as the last bell rang. Plenty of time. Have we fed cattle? Had about a bushel of corn and a forkful of hay left. Plenty of feed. How Is the gas? The gauge reads one-fourth full. Plenty of gasoline to get home and back to town. Yes! Plenty is a good thing. It is really a necessary thing for the individual. And whatever is necessary for the individual we generally concede is necessary for the community, the state, the nation, and the world at large. For these very simple reasons we contend that a surolus is neces - sary. It is needed for national and world welfare. - And we believe that both sacred and profane history will bear us out. in this con - tention. I quote from sacred history. Genesis 41:53-54: "And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end. And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: And there was famine in all lands: but in all the land of Egypt there was bread." And the reason that there was bread in all the land of Egypt was because there was a great surplus. This surplus had not been </seg>
            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION built up from the carry-over of one or two years crops as has our present surplus, but was due to seven years of continuous well directed effort. And this effort continued through another seven years during which time the surplus was depleted to the welfare of the people of Egypt and those round about. Really we believe that what we are experiencing now is not so much a result of over-production as it is of under-consumption. The bread lines of our cities and the great effort that our country is now putting forth to care for the needy and the unemployed argues this. Men without jobs do not eat bread as do men with jobs. And bread uneaten holds back the movement of wheat. And the holding back of wheat in this case means under-consumption. This conten - tion is strengthened in a paragraph by Howard Foorance in the Re - view of Reviews for August, 1931. He writes: "Those who argue that what this country suffers from at the moment is not over - production, but under-consumption, are fortified in part by current wheat statistics: for last year's harvest of 850 million bushels was only 20 million more than the ten-year average; and this year's total a large winter wheat gain, partly counterbalanced by a small spring wheat prospect will be but 6 million bushels more than in 1930. A single bad season might even things." The tariff has been advanced as an argument in favor of the reduction of our wheat acreage. We agree that it is favorable to industry and expensive to agriculture. We believe that our country could have gotten on very well without it. And we believe that it would be good national policy to do away with it. For in so doing the industries of our country and agriculture would, we believe, be put on sound basis. Our farmers are efficient. We will compete with the world If we are given a chance to buy our needs at a world price rather than at a high tariff protected price. Put industry and agri - culture on a parity and we will hold our own against the producer of •any country. Let us now give attention to the region under consideration. Over all of it is shown by "Hedges and Elliott" in Bulletin 244 of our Experiment Station, livestock is a major farm enterprise. Also over all . this region, corn, wheat, oats, barley, alfalfa and wild hay are grown. Livestock farming, we maintain, is more profitable on the whole than is grain farming. The two types blend well. For where there is livestock there must be feed, and feed is pasturage, roughage, and grain. Winter wheat will provide afi these. And in blending livestock and grain there is no crop, we argue, that can take the place of winter wheat . It is our surest crop. And when threshed and placed In storage it will keep indefinitely without material Iobs. Hence the adage: "As good as old wheat in the bin." Until recently we have thought of it mostly in this way. We have considered it a </seg>
            <seg id="p214">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OP AGRICULTURE cash crop. One that we could hold or sell to advantage as money was needed. And even now I would not say but that wheat in the bin is as good as money in the bank or in stocks and bonds. When the price of wheat broke our Experiment Station and fed - eal agencies were quick to point out the advantages of wheat for feed. I have in hand Miscellaneous Publication No. 96 issued by the United State Department of Agriculture under date of September, 1930. From it I quote: "In a general way, and for all-purpose feeding, a pound of cracked wheat or a pound of cracked barley, or a pound of both in any proportion, is equal in feeding value to a pound of corn." Professor Loeffel of our own Experiment Station in Bulletin 2 61 under date of October, 1931, has this in part as a summary: "Wheat is more palatable than corn. "Pigs fed wheat gain more rapidly than similar pigs fed corn. "Wheat when coarsely ground is slightly more efficient than corn. "A bushel of coarsely ground wheat properly supplemented will produce 15 pounds of pork. "Less protein supplement need be fed with wheat than with corn. "The pork from wheat-fed pigs is equal in quality and palatability to, and is firmer than, corn-fed pork." We could go on indefinitely with these reports which prove our argument that in blending livestock and grain there is no crop that can take the place of wheat. Along with the reports that I have given I want to add the weight of the testimony of my practical experience. I have found that not only is wheat good as grain but that it is good for pasture, roughage, grain and protection in the care of livestock. Farmers whose corn crops are short can now save money by substituting wheat and barley, pound for pound, for corn, and in feeding those grains in the same way and in the same combinations as they have heretofore fed corn. First in the matter of protection about the only satisfaction that I have had in the past eight or ten weeks in caring for the cattle has been in seeing them enjoy the wheat straw stack. The yards have been so muddy and there has been no good place for them to be in the open except around the straw stack. There they can rest in the sunshine and in comfort when they are filled. There they like to rest at all times of the year. My neighbor whose cows had frozen udders two years ago did not have a straw stack around which his cows could lie. A straw shed is the cheapest and equal to the best protection that can be provided. And wheat straw, in my judg - ment, has no equal for litter in the poultry house and for bedding in the barn and sheds. </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION Winter wheat affords growing pasturage at a time of the year when ordinary pastures are dormant. Growing pasture seems to give tone to- the animal system as does no other feed. Not long ago I was in a veterinarian's office. It was about this time of the year and there had been some loss of horses due to compaction. I asked about the cause. "Too much dry feed such as cornstalks and straw," I was told. "The way to do is to mix the cornstalks and straw with green feed by turning on wheat a part of the time." This I have found to be good practice with all classes of livestock. There is no known cure for cornstalk disease in cattle but green wheat along with the corn - stalks is, in my opinion, a material preventive. Neighbor A told neighbor B to pen up his hogs. "Ah no!" neighbor B replied, "they do so much better when they are out." "Yes, they are on my wheat all of the time." In the matter of roughage it is surprising the good that can be gotten from wheat straw. There are those who winter their horses and mules largely on this roughage. I remember of a public sale that was held a few years ago. The horses at this sale were in unusually good condition and they sold remarkably well. The owner is said to have explained that all he had fed was wheat straw and a little grain. Some days ago a neighbor and I were talking about our present shortage of hay. "I guess we can do as we did the year before we moved over here," he said. "We didn't have straw enough and so we begged of the neighbors. We couldn't buy hay for we didn't have the money. We worked over all the old straw stacks of the neighborhood. One day as we were passing with a load of straw a man who had alfalfa hay for sale said to another: 'There goes another load of nice green alfalfa hay.' It was hardly that," my neighbor added, "but we got the stock through the winter." Wheat may be used for hay. When used in this way it should be cut while the stalk is yet green and when the grain is passing into the soft dough stage. Horses relish it and they seem to work better on it than on alfalfa hay. If any of you become short of hay I recom - mend that you give it a trial. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION Wednesday Forenoon, January 0, 1032 MR. MOTT Presiding D. S. DALBEY, Second Speaker on the Affirmative I understood that I was to talk for twelve minutes. I didn't hold the watch on Kindlg. We are neighbors and I just politely didn't call him down for running Over time. When this question was submitted to me I was very thankful that I was asked to represent the affirmative side. t, A good debater should look at both sides of the question but try as hard as I could I haven't, been able to think of one good sound argument on the negative side. Professor Gross said that our oppo - nents would do a good deal of wise cracking about this question of substituting 20 per cent of our wheat acreage for other crops. You will note that Mr. Kindig flashed a silk handkerchief. You will also notice I haven't got one — I can't afford silk handkerchiefs. There is no question but what every farmer who lives in eastern Nebraska — and we are considering eastern Nebraska In the question under discussion — finds that wheat is the most unprofitable crop on the farm this year. We are considering present conditions, not seven years of famine. We mantain that under present economic conditions it is now profitable to substitute other crops for wheat. All of you know you would have been lots better off now If you had grown no wheat in 1931. You have continued to grow wheat for 30 cents when it costs you 60 to 75 -cents per bushel, according to the Nebraska College of Agriculture. There isn't any question but that every man whose money is in wheat is going to lose. Wheat is the least profitable crop we have raised on our farms this year and we are considering right now — not when it was $1.20 or last year when it was 60 cents. Wheat was 30 cents at threshing time this year. I sold corn to a feeder two weeks ago for 40 cents a bushel. Corn can be produced for so much' less than wheat that there is more profit In raising it. In raising wheat you have to pay out more cash and do less labor yourself than with corn. A man and his family can do practically all of the labor involved in growing corn, such as planting, cultivation and harvest - ing. There is some expense for shelling. Wheat growing calls for a great deal of expense. There is the cost of cutting with a binder </seg>
            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION — the cost of -twine and extra help. The money outlay in wheat is more than any other crop. We can't compete with Australia and Canada, and Russia and South America in raising wheat. The Farm Board has urged us to reduce the wheat acreage and produce in the United States just enough wheat to use. If we raise just what we consume we would get some advantage of the 42 cent tariff. A surplus of 200 million bushels of wheat in America is altogether too much for our own good. We can't produce wheat in eastern Nebraska as cheaply as in western Nebraska. Even western Nebraska farmers produce wheat at a loss at present prices. They can produce it cheaper in Russia; they have cheaper land and cheaper labor. I think the only reason we grow wheat here Is that we want to diversify. We want something to bed our cows with and to rotate on our land. Let us take an average quarter section of land in Gage county. It has on it the average 32 acres of winter wheat. Supposing we decide to reduce that 20 per cent, we would cut out 6.4 acres. We would still have 25 acres of wheat and that was just 2 5 acres too much this year. If you cut out all or part of this 32 acres of wheat I would sow that land to alfalfa. Alfalfa In Gage county is selling at $12.00 a ton. If you had this 6 acres in alfalfa you would get far more profit than from any other crop that we grew in 1931 in Gage County. Or we could put that 6 acres of land into sweet clover. During these low price years I would fertilize and build up my land so that if and when wheat gets higher we can grow larger crops. I have had a good deal of experience in growing sweet clover. For ten yearB we have been growing less acres of grain crops and more sweet clover in order to get our land into condition to grow larger and more profit - able grain crops. We have on our farm already reduced the acreage of winter wheat but by growlng_ Bweet clover and alfalfa we are producing about as much wheat as when we were sowing more acres. That is an argument, in favor of using sweet clover in rotation. If you want to get a money crop sow alfalfa or sweet clover or plant any - thing rather than wheat. Mr. Hyde spoke of the railroads using what cars they need. That is exactly what we are thinking about doing with wheat. We ought to raise just what wheat we use. Mr. Hyde said they only operated the cars they need. We shouldn't grow any more wheat than we need. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE P. H. STEWART, Second Speaker on Negative Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have been very much interested in the entertaining argument presented by our opponents but I am frank to say that I am not much impressed with their display of oratory. I am, In fact, reminded of the time when Rastus asked Mose the meaning of oratory. Mose replied, "Rastus, don't you all know what that means? I'll 'lustrate for you all. If I says black is white and white is black, dat am foolishness — but if I say black am white and white am black and at the same time I pound de table and beller like a bull, den dat am oratory." The affirmative side, it seems to me, has given you a demonstra - tion of both foolishness and oratory. To begin with, our opponents have told you that in eastern Nebraska, in the area which we have designated for this discussion, that the present acreage of wheat should be decreased. They tell us that we are now growing too many acres of wheat and that a change to other crops in this area would increase the income. They seem to be under the impression that in the area under consideration we are now growing an abnormal wheat acreage. As a matter of fact, this is not the case. I have here in Table 1 figures from the State Department of Agriculture for 1914 and 1930 on the acreage of wheat in certain representative counties in this area. What are the facts in this case: Table 1. Comparative Wheat Acreage in Kii.stern Nebraska Counties in 1014 anil 1930.

            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS'- ASSOCIATION Would they have the farmers of this region reduce their wheat acreage another 20% which in Otoe County, for instance, would make a reduction of 76% below the 1914 acreage, which we commonly as - sume to have been a period of normalcy and balance in eastern Ne - braska agriculture? There are, we believe, good reasons for not reducing the acreage much further. The farmers living in the area we are discussing are well estab - lished in their farming operations. They have at hand the machinery for handling small grain crops. Drills, binders, and threshing ma - chines are on the farms and ready for use. The investment in these machines has been made. If we further reduce the wheat acreage what does this mean? Simply, that a still greater overhead for small grain machinery will have to be charged against oats which is already a crop that is very low in acre returns and which is often, if not usually, grown at a loss. If we are to charge against oats a still greater portion of the investment in binders, drills and threshing machines then our losses on the oat crop will be still greater. How much is this going to help our present economic situation? What about the suggestion that a still greater corn acreage be ■grown? We believe that there are several objections to an appreciable Increase in our corn acreage. First there is the matter of labor dis - tribution. Would our opponents have the farmers in eastern Nebraska go without Bleep and work day and night during April, May and June, which is the rush season for corn land preparation, corn planting, corn cultivation, and alfalfa hay making. Suppose we greatly Increase the corn acreage and then we have a cold, wet, backward spring which greatly delays corn planting and cultivation. Can you imagine how these grassy, weedy corn fields will look by the time one can get into them and get over the last field? Winter wheat and corn do not compete for attention at the same time. We can prepare wheat land and seed the crop following harvest when other crops need no attention. After wheat is sown in late September or early October the crop call for not a minute of attention until the corn is laid by in early July. This dovetailing together of corn and winter wheat so far as labor requirements is concerned is a matter of great importance to the farmer who is attempting to handle his farm crops during these strenuous times with a minimum of labor. An increase in the acreage of corn and alfalfa complicate the farm labor situation. There is a limit to what can be done in any certain month. Farm profits and good farm management depend to a considerable extent on the profitable distribution and use of time throughout the entire year. Our opponents tell us that livestock farming Is, on the whole, the most profitable type of farming. We are glad to find, at least, one thing on which we can agree. But as Mr. Kindig has already </seg>
            <seg id="p220">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pointed out there is no reason why there should be a conflict betweeu wheat growing and livestock production. Wheat as a grain is an excellent feed. Moreover one of the most important factors in profit - able livestock farming is the matter of a sure, and uniform production of feed each year. .Livestock production is not an "in and out" busi - ness. A sure feed supply year after year is a necessity. Let us com - pare wheat and corn from the standpoint of their being sure crops. Statistics from the Nebraska College of Agriculture show that there is less variation in the yield of wheat from year to year than of corn. This is particularly true in the region in eastern Nebraska where we are now growing wheat and where we are told to cut the acreage 20 per cent. Hedges and Elliott in Bulletin 244 of the Nebraska Experiment Station in discussing this point for southeastern Nebraska, say: "Winter wheat is a rather uncertain crop in northeastern Ne - braska but in southeastern Nebraska it is more dependable than either corn or oats. Wheat yields have an average variability of only 21%, which is 4% lower than for oats or corn. Due in part to this low variability in yields from year to year wheat becomes a profitable crop in southeastern Nebraska, in fact a much more profitable crop that oats." Wheat matures early in the season and often makes a crop while corn may be greatly impaired if indeed it is not a failure, due to adverse late July and August weather conditions. It is a rare season when both wheat and corn fail. A balanced combination is therefore an insurance against a complete crop failure. And yet we are told to still further reduce our wheat acreage in the south half of eastern Nebraska and grow more corn — a less certain crop and one which will complicate the labor distribution tor the season. This hardly seems logical. Grow more corn, keep more livestock, and maintain soil fertility, we are told. We agree to the suggestion as to livestock but what about the relative effects of corn and wheat from the soil fertility angle. Wheat is not necessarily a harder crop on land than corn, indeed we will show that it is less detrimental than corn to soil fertility and soil maintenance in general. The Missouri Experiment Station in Research Bulletin 63 on Soil Erosion brings out the fact that fifty-six years of continuous corn growing on a field will entirely remove the upper seven inches of soil while it is necessary to grow wheat nearly three times as long, or 150 years. In order to remove the same amount of soil. Moreover, they show in this, work that there is a greater per cent of run-off from land planted to corn as com - pared to land in wheat. Table 2 summarizes these data which were taken from a soil similar to that of southeastern Nebraska which had a slope of only 4 per cent, a relatively slight gradient. </seg>

We believe that the legume acreage in eastern Nebraska can be profitably increased and we furthermore believe that the maintenance of our present wheat acreage will facilitate the estab - lishment of more legumes rather than retard it. In the counties bordering the Missouri river, seeding red clover, sweet clover and even alfalfa on Winter wheat is a common and on the whole a suc - cessful practice. In the region under discussion, where it is not prac - tical to seed legumes with wheat, oats or barley, can be used with success or the legumes may be seeded alone. There is, we maintain, no conflict between our present wheat acreage and the establishment of a. practical acreage of legumes and the proper maintenance of soil fertility. We come now to consider wheat production costs. Our opponents have emphasized the fact that the cost of production studies show that a bushel of wheat can be raised much cheaper in western Nebraska than in the eastern Nebraska area under discussion. The figures which they have presented are valuable and interesting and worth while — yet we believe that care must be used in interpreting them. There is some question as to just how to evaluate figures based on one single farm enterprise. Farming is an all year round business. It is difficult, to say the least, to pick out a certain farm enterprise and isolate and analyze it without taking other enterprises into con - sideration. We are likely to be as badly misled as the farmer was in that old sheep story where he found that each year he made $2.00 apiece on two ewes that he had and figured from this that if he had 5,000 ewes he would make a fortune of $10,000 a year. These figures which have been given as representing the cost of wheat in the different sections of the state are based on the actual time put in on the wheat crop. On farms where wheat is the main crop and is given most of the farmer's attention, what about the time for the entire year. Unless a man is a suitcase or town farmer he must consider the income from wheat in terms of a living for the entire year and not just for the three months or so put in on the wheat crop. Hence actually the income from wheat on wheat farms should be divided by a year's time and not just by the time put In </seg>
            <seg id="p222">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ill the wheat field for much additional time is spent in overhauling machinery and in sitting idly by waiting for harvest to come. Grow other crops, feed livestock, and keep busy for the entire year as does the eastern Nebraska farmer, will be the reply — yet what is the actual situation? In Cheyenne county, lor instance, there were, according to the Census, 1,116 farms in 1930. There was 385,606 cultivated acres for the same year or an average of 345 cultivated acres per farm. Statistics show 213 acres of wheat per farm, leaving 132 acres not actually in wheat. Of these 132 acres, 58 were in fallow, leaving only 74 acres for corn, oats, barley, alfalfa, sweet clover, sudan, potatoes, beans, or cane. With large machinery at hand, how much time will be required to tend the 74 acres in crops other than wheat? Like - wise in Perkins county there were in 1930 333 acres of cultivated land per farm, of which 195 were in wheat and- 28 in fallow, leaving 110 acres for all other crops. This acreage is hardly sufficient to utilize the labor not required by wheat when the large machinery available is considered. But the wheat acreage should be reduced and more of the other crops grown to help distribute labor throughout the year, may be suggested. This will reduce the wheat acreage to a point which will increase the machinery cost until the overhead may perhaps be so great that the cost per bushel of wheat will equal that of eastern Nebraska. Western Nebraska farmers have a limited amount of land available. Many of them are ambitious young men from the east who moved westward in order to satisfy their land hunger. Others are local men. Regardless of where they come from, these .western farmers are not millionaire farmers with large acreages on which to use large machinery. Large machinery calls for large acreages. Large acreages require large amounts of capital. Bo we want to encourage corporation farming in order that we may have conditions most satisfactory for the use of large, extensive wheat growing. We believe, therefore, that the figures given for raising wheat in eastern and western Nebraska do not indicate what the labor income may be for the entire year and that is the real test. The cost figures, therefore, have little, if any, significance in relation to the question under debate. Weeds are causing the farmers of Nebraska more and more concern. They are an increasing menace. Is there a better crop for weed control than wheat, which permits early fall plowing? Wild roses, artichokes, sand burrs, cockle burrs, sunflowers, and many others are controlled so much better by the early fall plowing co - incident to wheat production that for this reason alone we feel favor - able to a reasonable wheat acreage. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION May I present one more argument in closing. Graduates from the "School of Experience" rank high in my estimation. The fact that successful experienced, practical, level headed farmers are growing a reasonable acreage of wheat in eastern Nebraska in itself is to me good argument that the. practice has merit and is desirable. Because of the factors which we haVe presented and because of my great respect for the judgment of the man actually on the land, I would hesitate to advise him to change his wheat acreage. D. L. GROSS — Third Speaker for Affirmative Ladies and Gentlemen: I am very sorry indeed to note that our opponents have drifted far from the question involved in this debate. After my colleague, Mr. Gramlich, so clearly outlined the main points at issue in this discussion there is really little excuse for the many side tracks which our opponents have taken. As a matter of fact, I am not at all sur - prised that they have thus strayed from the points at issue. They remind me of the politician who, realizing his position is weak, at - tempts to cover his confusion with oratory. Let us analyze their arguments in the light of the question involved. Re-stating the ques - tion, we find that the main point at issue is "would this proposed reduction in wheat acreage increase the net farm income?" For the life of me, I cannot find a single argument that my opponents have advanced that has a bearing on their side of the argument. They say the acreage is already reduced in some counties by 15 per cent to as high as 56 per cent. Lord help us! I thought there was going to be two sides to this debate, and here they are arguing for the affirmative. Of course, there has been a big decrease. in wheat acreage In this area, and there is only one reason for it, — wheat has become unprofitable and the farmers are changing to other crops which at least have a chance of giving them a profit. Remember, too, that this debate is being presented from the standpoint of present market con - ditions. Wheat prices are lower now than they have been for the last thirty-five years. If farmers have decreased their acreage of wheat during that time, the reasons for decreasing it now are un - questionably greater. The farmers have been wise in shifting to other crops, and this same wisdom will bring about a still greater shift from wheat to more profitable crops. They realize that the competition of cheaper land to the west, where wheat is produced on large acre - ages at a much lower overhead cost, and a much lower cost per bushel, is an economic factor which is forcing them to fewer and fewer acres of this crop. Another argument which our opponents advance is that a 20 per cent reduction in the winter wheat acreage would disrupt the present alleged even distribution of labor on the farm. They paint a </seg>
            <seg id="p224">■ REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE dismal picture of farmers having to work day and night without sleep for three whole months. I am sure that many of you were moved to tears by this eloquent solicitude for the poor down trodden farmer. And why this great burst of sympathy? All because these poor farm - ers would have six more acres of corn to tend, and six acres less of wheat. My colleague, Mr. Dalby, pointed out to you that in Gage County, the county with the greatest wheat acreage of any In eastern Nebraska, each 160 acre farm had on the average but 30 acres of wheat. A twenty per cent reduction on this acreage would be six acres, over which our opponents would have the farmer spending ninety sleepless nights. Next they say that wheat is a more dependable crop than corn and we should therefore continue to grow a large acreage of it so as to insure feed for our livestock. I believe you already realize that our opponents have here fallen into a very grievous error, either consciously to try to befuddle the issue or unconsciously because of not having thoroughly analyzed their statements. They seem to assume that if the farmer reduces his wheat land by six acres he must of necessity put this six acres into corn. You will note, of course, that in one case they would put this six acres to oats, which we all agree is an unprofitable crop ordinarily, and in this case they would put it in corn and have the corn burn up. They have been very careful to shy away from the proposition that Mr. Dalby pro - posed, that of URing this six acres for alfalfa or for much needed addi - tional pasture, both of which are more profitable at the present time than any of our grain crops. One other crop, that they have carefully refrained from mentioning is barley. The fact of the matter is I can well imagine that they had hoped most of all that this crop would not be mentioned,- because it blows their argument sky high. Figures on barley show that in point of dependability one year after another it is even more dependable than wheat. Not only that, there is an - other important point, the introduction of barley brings up that punc - tures one of our opponents' 'balloons which they have been so carefully f.Hing with gas. They have made the mistake, of course, of filling all their balloons with a highly inflammable and very explosive material. The balloon that should be exploded next is the one which says that a decrease in the wheat acreage would unbalance the overhead with particular reference to machinery which the farmer now has and which is used in wheat production. The match that sets this off Is the fact, of course, that the same machinery is used for barley as Is used for wheat. Just by way of pricking another of their bubbles, we might take a look at this chart which we have here, .which gives the average yield of barley and wheat for a five-year period in the seven leading wheat producing counties in the eastern section. You will note that the average wheat yield is eighteen bushels, while that of barley is </seg>
            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION thirty bushels. Mr. Loeffel, who has charge of the experimental feed- Ing work here at the College has carried on very thorough experiments using wheat and barley as a feed. He has found that 100 pounds of wheat are. equal in feeding value to 117 pounds of barley. The yield of wheat is 1,080 pounds per acre, while that of barley is 1,440 pounds. If 100 pounds of wheat are equal to 117 pounds of barley, then 1,080 pounds of wheat are equal to 1,264 pounds of barley. Now since barley yields 1,440 pounds per acre, we And by subtracting 1,264 from 1,440 that barley produces 176 pounds more feed value per acre than does wheat. In other words, these figures alone prove the contention of the affirmative that six acres of land would be more profitable if sown to barley rather than wheat. Chart No. 1 — Comparison of Yield and Feed Value of Barley and Wheat in Seven Lending Wheat Producing Counties of Eastern Nebraska. Five year average yield of wheat — 18 bushels or 1,080 pounds Five year average yield of barley — 30 bushels or 1,440 pounds Pounds of each grain of equal feed value — Wheat 1,080 pounds- Barley 1,264 pounds 1,440 — 1,264 = 176 pounds greater feed value per acre from barley. The next chart which we have here really comes down to the essence of this debate. If as our opponents contend, our present wheat acreage should be maintained, then we must assume that In some way or other ther.e must be a profit in growing wheat in eastern Nebraska. Remember that our opponents are saying, according to the wording of this question, that a reduction in acreage would not increase the net farm income.; Let us look at the facts in the case. This chart based on figures carefully recorded for the Rural Economics Department by over 100 farmers in eastern Nebraska, brings out the fact that instead of a profit the farmers are actually taking a big loss for every acre of whea^wmch they sow.

            <seg id="p226">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE With these figures in mind, how can our opponents have the fortitude to argue that a reduction in wheat acreage would not increase the net farm income? If a certain farm enterprise is being carried on at a loss, the elimination of this loss gives the whole farm enter - prise a chance to show a profit. There is just one more bubble that I would like to prick and then I am through. No doubt our worthy opponent, Mr. Kindig, had the idea when he began to quote from sacred Scripture, that by thus doing he would suggest to your mind the idea that he himself was a fine Christian gentleman, and for that reason you would conclude that whatever he said was gospel truth, and that you would take his remarks as the people of old accepted divine revelations. He went on at length to quote the parable concerning seven years of famine and seven years of plenty, inferring, of course, that we here in America are on the verge of a great holocaust of starvation, and I might add, where there will be great weeping and gnashing of teeth. Prom this premise he went on to argue that farmers should continue to grow wheat even at a loss of $3.52 an acre, so that the people would not starve in the future. I would like to ask you gentlemen if you can see a single point, in this altruistic tantrum of his, which has a bearing on the question at hand. We like to think of laying up a part of a surplus to take care of a time of scarcity. Well and good, but what has that to do with increasing the net farm income of eastern Nebraska farmers under present conditions. I think you will agree with me that such an argument, if indeed we can dignify it with that term, is nothing but another one of the opponents' smoke screens, thrown out to hide the confusion they must feel in attempt - ing to argue a point which has no foundation in fact, and which down in their hearts they know to be untenable. REBUTTAL FOR THE NEGATIVE — IRA KINDIG From the school of experience and from all of the facts and theories that we can find, we believe that in a large measure our opponents are wrong. We believe that a system of farming that has been established out of the school of experience as our system has been established here in eastern Nebraska cannot be far wrong. Now I have tried to substitute on my own farm in Gage County such acreages of oats and barley for winter wheat. You will all admit that there is no merit in growing an increased acreage of oats. Our opponents have suggested barley for southeastern Nebraska with never a thought apparently that chinch bugs in that section of the state often injure barley severely, if indeed they do not ruin it completely. Mr. Dalby has said that not long ago he sold corn to a feeder for 40 cents per bushel. That is his good luck. Because had that feeder done as I have done, he' would have used wheat instead of </seg>
            <seg id="p227">. NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION corn, either feeding wheat as the entire grain ration or to supplement his own corn. By doing this he would not have had to pay exorbitant prices for corn for which he is now suffering when he markets his hogs at the present low price. ' Our opponents have quoted figures, the source of which they did not state, in an attempt to lead you to believe that barley will produce more hull-free grain per acre than winter wheat. I wish to quote you figures taken from Bulletin 253 of the Nebraska College of Agri - culture in which the comparative grain yields of various crops are given for the 1 1-year-period of 1920 to 1930 inclusive. This table, which has been very carefully compiled by Dr. T. A. Kiesselbach based on results at the Agronomy Farm, show that as an average for this entire period Nebraska 60 winter wheat has yielded 2,189 pounds of grain as compared to 1,337 pounds of hull-free barley. In other words, using. Nebraska 21 oats as a basis, barley has yielded 12 per cent more while Nebraska 60 winter wheat grown, as it might well be grown on: the average southeastern Nebraska farm, has yielded 183 per cent more than Nebraska 21 oats. Here is an advantage of 71 per cent in favor of winter wheat over barley, basing the figures on hull-free grain. Winter wheat leads the entire list of small grains in yield per acre, considered from the standpoint of hull-free grain, and we maintain that it is a worth while crop to grow as it is a dual threat crop, either. for market or for feed. I would like to invite our opponents down to the farm to help me do chores. I would also like to take them, by contrast, to one or our neighbors to assist in doing chores. This neighbor has no straw available and I would suggest that if our opponents accept my invita - tion that they provide themselves with hip boots for the trip to the neighbor's farm. Wheat straw is valuable as a bedding and while, of course, we do not maintain that you can grow a crop for this sole purpose, yet its value on the farm which has livestock has a bedding is just one more reason why we should maintain our winter wheat production at the present level </seg>
            <seg id="p228">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE ROOT SYSTEM OP FARM CROPS IN RELATION TO PRACTICAL. CROP PRODUCTION * By 3. E. WEAVER Professor of Plant Ecology University of ' Nebraska Introduction Soil moisture is the greatest limiting factor to crop production - in Nebraska. The root systems of plants are the organs of absorption of both water and soil nutrients. A knowledge of root development of cultivated plants, of their position in the soil, extent and activities at various stages of growth is of great importance to all who are engaged in crop production. Frequently half — and often much more — of every crop plant is invisible. It consists of roots which extend far into the soil. - Natural Vegetation Indicates Conditions of Soil and Climate The natural vegetation is an excellent indicator of conditions of soil and climate for crop production in any area. The native species in the eastern half of Nebraska are deeply rooted. The roots of little bluestein (Andropogon scoparius) and Indian grass (A. nutans) vary from 3 to 5.5 feet in depth (Fig. 22). Those' of big bluestem (A. furcatus) are 6 to 9 feet deep. Many other prairie grasses have similar root habits. The legumes, composites, and other plants grow - ing among the grasses nearly always penetrate to even greater depths. The cut-leaved rosin weed (Silphium laciniatum) penetrates down - ward 9 to 14 feet. The blazing star (Liiatris punctata) has a very widely and strongly branched taproot which ordinarily reaches a depth of 16 feet and has a lateral spread on all sides of the plant of 3 to 4 feet. The wild rose (Rosa arkansana) often penetrates even deeper (Fig. 23). ; The presence of a continuous cover of tall, deeply rooted grasses indicates conditions favorable to the production of cultivated plants of similar habit, a fact fully substantiated by the excellent yields of wheat, oats and corn. The continued growth of these grasses throughout the season, with the late period of flowering and seed production among most of them, indicates a long favorable growing season uninterrupted by a deficiency of soil moisture. The abundance of water in soil and subsoil is further attested by the presence- of numerous other herb's, many of which extend much deeper than the grasses and absorb the water that percolates downward through the surface soil. There is enough water for both grasses and legumes, as well as composites, etc. ' The materials for thin paper have been taken in a larfie part from the writer'* lM&gt;ok, "Root Development of Field Crops," by permission -of the publishers, McGraw- Hill Book Company.

Upon germ - ination,, a strong taproot develops rapidly anfl penetrates almost ver - tically downward. The roots of plants only 6 days old are often 15-18 inches deep.' It frequently reaches a depth of 5 to 6 feet the first season, 10 to 12 feet by the end of the second year, and may ultimately extend to depths of 20 feet or more. It is notably a deep Jeeder. In common alfalfa, practically no branches occur in the sur - face few inches of soil, and those that originate deeper do not spread widely but turn downward after running obliquely a little distance and usually pursue a- course more or less parallel with the taproot. Often, both large and small branches are quite scarce, and the taproot is always the most prominent part of the root system. Under favor - able soil conditions, nodules occur at all depths. The root habit shows considerable variation among the different varieties, and that of a given variety, varies markedly under different environmental condi - tions. When depth of penetration is limited, the degree of branching and wide lateral spreading of branches may become very pronounced The crop makes its best growth in deep, moist soils where the full extent of its deeply penetrating root system may be utilized. The development of the root system at different ages and its modification due to dry subsoil was illustrated by a series of draw- Ings. (Fig. 24). WINTER WHEAT (Triticum aestlvum) A series of lantern slides illustrating the development of the root system of a strain of Turkey Red winter wheat were shown These studies were made in a field at Lincoln, Nebraska, at 10- to 15-day intervals during two successive autumns. The primary root system, consisting usually of a whorl of three roots with their branches, originates from the embryo and is the first to appear. But soon a secondary root system develops from the joints or nodes above, the number and branching of roots increasing in correlation with the number of tillers. Root elongation, under favor - able conditions, is very rapid; sometimes, a growth rate of over half an inch a day is maintained for 60 to 70 days in the primary root system of winter wheat. Crops planted early during favorable seasons for growth form a secondary root system which rather thoroughly fills the surface 12 to 2 0 inches of soil, while the primary roots extend well into the third and fourth foot. The extent of the root systems of wheat drilled on September 20 is shown in Fig. 25. The mature root system has a working level of 3 5 to 4 feet and a maximum depth of 5 to 7 feet.

            <seg id="p238">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (adventitious roots) were confined almost entirely to the surface foot of soil. Many of these widely spreading roots later turn downward and often penetrate deeply. When the plants were 4 feet tall and the stalks had about 12 leaves each, a second examination was made. This was on July 5, H weeks after planting. During the 3 weeks since the first examina - tion, a remarkable extension of the root system had taken place. The main lateral roots had extended even more widely, some of them to 4 feet from the base of the stalk. Many of them had turned down - ward rather abruptly, penetrating into the second and third and even into the fourth foot of soil. (Fig. 30). In addition to these, an entirely new group of roots had arisen. These penetrated more or less vertically downward 3 to 4 feet and filled the soil beneath the plant. This region had not been penetrated by the main lateral root system. Thus, the main vertical roots supplemented the main lateral ones. The longest of the vertically penetrating roots had grown at the rate of over 2 inches per day. That growth was not yet complete was shown by the abundance of new roots, some of which were only a few inches long and had' succulent, turgid ends 3 to 4 millimeters thick. The longest branches were confined to the first foot of soil. Many extended to within half an inch of the surface. These, with their many ramifications, formed an intricately dense and efficient absorbing system. At this time, the roots of neighboring stalks, which were only 16 inches apart, had greatly overlapped. Indeed, roots of plants in adjoining rows, 3 feet apart, were drawing upon the same soil area for water and nutrients. Since many roots grew so near the surface, the field was cultivated shallowly with a hoe in order not to disturb them. The large quantities of water transpired by corn in eastern Ne - braska have been measured, by Kiesselbach, 2 75 pounds or 34 gallons (over a barrel of water) usually being needed to mature a single stalk of corn. The root system of maturing plants was excavated and examined on September 2. The stalks were 8 to 9 feet high, and though a few leaves had dried, most of them were still green. The husks on the ears were beginning to dry, and the kernels were dented. The crop had completed its root growth. The main lateral root system (Fig. 31) had scarcely increased over that found early in July. Most of the roots of this type were found in the first foot or two of soil. Some retained a nearly horizontal position throughout their entire course. Others ran at various angles from a few inches to 3 feet or more and then turned downward either abruptly or with a gentle curve. The longest extended into the third and fourth foot of soil, or even deeper. Branching throughout was even more profuse than before. Unlike the shallower portion of the root system, the more deeply penetrating part had made a marked development. All of the </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION roots were profusely branched with laterals ranging from less than an Inch to 15 inches in length. Usually 10 to 12 of these branches with their sub-laterals occurred on an inch of the main root. Thus, over 200 cubic feet of soil and subsoil were quite thoroughly drawn upon for water and nutrients by the roots of a single plant. I | .

A study of the root habit shows clearly why corn does best on a deep, well-drained soil which has an abundant and uniform supply of water throughout the growing season. If the soil is well prepared before planting, the main benefits of cultivation are derived from keeping down weeds, preventing the crusting of the surface, and keep - ing the soil receptive to rainfall. The superficial position of the roots shows clearly why deep cultivation is harmful. Fortunately, weeds are most easily destroyed when coming through the surface of the soil by shallow cultivation such as harrowing surface-planted corn. This also breaks the soil crust, giving a drier and warmer soil and more vigorous crop growth. The harmful effect of letting weeds grow for a time is not entirely due to their rapid removal of water and plant </seg>

An examination of the half-grown root system explains why late tillage, except for weed eradication, is of little value. The roots are po well distributed through the soil that little moisture can escape even from uncultivated land. Hilling at the last cultivation not only acts as a mechanical support to the stem but also encourages the development of brace roots which are an additional aid in hold - ing up the plant against strong winds. But if hilled early, later cultivation partly removes the hill and exposes a portion of the root system. . Even shallow cultivation cuts off many of the roots, and deep cultivation is very harmful and greatly . decreases the yield. Cultivation to a depth of 4 inches during a period of 9 years in Ohio gave a decreased yield every season but one, as compared with similar cultivation to a depth of 1.5 inches. The average decrease per acre was 4 bushels of grain and 183 pounds of fodder. In Indiana, very similar results have been obtained. In Missouri, deep cultivation com - pared with shallow reduced the yield 6.5 to 13 bushels per acre. The harmful effects of deep cultivation are always more pronounced during years of drought. In Illinois where the roots were pruned to a depth of 4 inches at a distance of 6 inches from the hill, the yield was de - creased 17 bushels per acre. For the highest yields, cultivation should never be deep enough to injure the roots seriously. They should bfi allowed to occupy fully the richest portion of the soil, which is usually the furrow slice. The proper type of cultivation is one which is deep enough to kill the weeds but shallow enough to reduce root Injury to a minimum. COOPERATIVE LIVESTOCK MAKKETINU P. O. WILSON Sec.-Mgr. National Live Stock Marketing Association January 6, 1932 It was a keen disappointment to Mr. Ewing when ne found it would not be possible for him to appear on your program this after - noon. He was prevented from doing so by an urgent call from national farm organizations and cooperative marketing associations to meet with the President at Washington to consider a solution of some national problems that confront us at this time. It is my intention during the limited time I have on your program to attempt to outline the program of work which has been undertaken by the National Live Stock Marketing Association. First, however, I would like for you to consider the Importance of the livestock Industry of this country as well as its importance to </seg>
            <seg id="p241">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS- ASSOCIATION the State of Nebraska. More than one-half of all the agricultural income of our nation is derived from livestock and livestock products. During the past year the livestock Industry produced over 16,500,000 pounds of meat, and over 2,225,000 pounds of lard. This supply of meat and lard required livestock producers of the country to furnish 12,000,000 head of cattle, 8,750,000 calves, 71,000,000 head of hogs, 22,750.000 head of sheep and lambs. Figures from your state indicate that more than one-half the cash income from farms is derived from livestock and when we consider the extent: of the other agricultural activities within this state it would seem that Nebraska is truly an agricultural state and that whether an individual is producing livestock or grain or his interest lies in the field of merchandising or banking it would be safe to conclude that he is interested in the better program for agriculture for his state because of the fact that either directly or indirectly his business depends on the success of agriculture. I have just called to your attention the fact that more than one - half the income from farms in your state are derived from livestock: to be more nearly exact, the report we received from your state indi - cates that around 69 per cent of the cash income from the farms of this state can be credited to livestock. The report further shows that the state marketed an average for the last three years of approxi - mately 1,500,000 cattle, 5.500,000 hogs, and 8,500,000 sheep. Nat - urally, interested as we are in the marketing end of the livestock work, we were interested to know just what happened to this livestock after it left the Nebraska farms. Upon investigation we found that approximately 68 per cent of your cattle were marketed through the Omaha market; 44 per cent of the hogs and 74 per cent of the sheep found their way to this same market. These figures would indicate that the Omaha livestock market furnishes the principal outlet for the livestock of your state. Next we are interested in knowing just how important a part your livestock played in the success of the Omaha market. In check - ing this we find that you furnished over 60 per cent of all the cattle that went through that market; better than 75 per cent of the hogs, .and a little more than one-third of the sheep, were also supplied by the State of Nebraska to the Omaha market. I hope that through these figures you have grasped the impor - tance of the relationship that exists between the livestock industry of this state and the Omaha livestock market. For years you have gone steadily about your work of producing cattle, hogs, and sheep, and although you were supplying a large percentage of the volume of business which goes through the Omaha market you have given very little time or effort to a program that would strengthen your sales power on that market and this lack of interest on your part has per - mitted the development of a system of marketing for the Omaha as </seg>
            <seg id="p242">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE i . I well as other markets which has taken from you the control of the sale of your product. Few industries in this country of ours spend all of their time with the problems of production and turn their finished products into the hands of other individuals and organizations to be merchandised and it is our opinion that the livestock producer, in order to attain his greatest success, must control the marketing machinery which is handling the actual sales of livestock. It should not be difficult for livestock producers to visualize the importance of volume of the success of a sales organization and the lack of power and control which is sure to exist where the volume is divided between many independent selling agencies. Take for in- Ktance the Chicago market, where there are approximately 100 regis - tered selling agencies, each of them spending thousands of dollars to convince livestock producers that it can render as good or better service than any of the others and merits the support of the livestock producers of the territory. Much time and money are expended by these agencies in an effort to secure business for their organizations but the greatest loss to the livestock producer comes because of the division of volume, and the lack of sales power on the part of any or all of these commission agencies. Fanners Need Larger Share of Consumers Dollar When you consider that the buying power of a market is vested in the hands of a few individuals you can readily recognize the handi - cap of some 100 or more salesmen on the Chicago market in their attempt to establish a sales value on your product. On the contrary, ir this volume of livestock were put into the hands of your own organization, with each salesman working under the control of your organization, we contend that your bargaining power would be in - creased and you would be more on an equality with the buyer when it comes to determining the price of your product. The National Live Stock Marketing Association is working on just such a program. This is a long time program and progress may seem slow but with the proper organization in your state working in harmony with the other states of the Union, much can be accomplished. Some of the livestock producers of Nebraska have already spent a great deal of time and effort in developing a local cooperative asso - ciation. This agency, operated from the Omaha market, has, from all reports, rendered a very valuable service and has been able to show substantial savings in commissions and refunds to its patrons. We have no wish to reflect in any way on the value of this organization but in the case of the old line system of sales agents on our terminal markets, we have pointed out to you the importance of a unified pro - gram and the loss in sales power of thesp agencies on a terminal mar - ket because of the division of volume. The 'same thing can be said in reference to a system that will permit the setting up of independent -i </seg>
            <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS" ASSOCIATION cooperative livestock marketing organizations in different sections of the country with no program of correlation or cooperation existing between these individual cooperative associations. It is true that individual operating units of this kind, located on favorable markets, can and have shown a substantial saving in com - missions. This is commendable in any organization, but we must not lose sight of the greater benefits to be derived through cooperative efforts. Were we to save all the commissions and return this amount to the livestock producers it would have very little effect in changing the. financial status of the individual livestock producer. But by close cooperation and correlation of our cooperative marketing units, the various states and regionals, into a national program, we can look forward to the accomplishment of sufficient benefits to the livestock producers to far outweigh any possible savings in commissions. Foremost among these possibilities is that phase of the National Live Stock .Marketing program which would give to the producer of livestock a larger share of the consumer's dollar. No one could call himself a friend of agriculture who would deny the claim which the livestock producer has to a greater share of this consumer's dollar. . We have been asked by numerous men from your state why the National Livestock Marketing Association does not have a member agency on the Omaha market. This is a question that can be better answered by you livestock producers of the State of Nebraska. You have a cooperative livestock marketing association on the Omaha market. If it is truly cooperative and under the control of the live - stock producers of this trade territory then I maintain that you can answer, better than anyone from the National office, the question of why the National Live Stock Marketing Association does not have a member agency operating at Omaha. The doors of the National Live Stock Marketing Association are open. We welcome to membership any strictly cooperative agency meeting the provisions of the Capper- Volstead law and maintaining an open door in its membership to every livestock producer in its territory. The Cooperative Marketing Program lierore discussing the program of the National Live Stock Mar - keting Association I would like to spend a few moments on what we feel Is the most Important of the recent developments in the advance - ment of cooperative marketing in this country. I refer to the passage of the Agricultural Marketing Act by the 71st Congress of the United States. We could easily spend the rest of the day in discussing the merits and demerits of this Act. It is regrettable, nevertheless true, that we still have a wide difference of opinion on the part of our farmers as well as our agricultural leaders as to the solution and the </seg>
            <seg id="p244">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE exact type of legislation needed to assist in lifting our industry out of the deplorable condition in which it now iinds itself. While farmers and agricultural leaders are debating among them - selves on this subject, interests opposed to cooperative marketing, many of whom have bitterly fought every attempt on the part of the farmer to enter the marketing field, have organized themselves so that they may more effectively fight further attempts of the farmer to place himself on a basis of equality with other industries. These op - posing organizations are now attempting to do away with the Agri - cultural Marketing Act and the Federal Farm Board, or at least strip the Act of all its effectiveness. When you realize that the Agricul - tural Marketing Act was about the first attempt of Congress to assist the farmers in the organization of cooperative organizations for the purposes of solving their problems, and when you further consider that it required years of efforts on the part of the organized farmers of this country to secure the passage of this Act, it does seem that farmers and farm organizations would realize at this time that it is highly important that they forget their differences, pool their interests, and make every effort to save the ground we have gained the past several years. But it is still more important that they agree on a program for the future, and present a united front for the task ahead of them. With the present condition of agriculture this is no time for a back - ward step. Any changes in the Agricultural Marketing Act should be for the better and should, we believe, be made on the recommenda - tion of men actually engaged in the agricultural field and not by those who are opposed to our interests. The National Live Stock Marketing Association is an organization of producer owned and controlled sales agencies, banded together for the purpose of more effectively serving the livestock producers of the United States. Twenty-one cooperative livestock marketing associa - tions are stockholders and members of the National association, mak - ing it the target livestock marketing organization ever to operate in this country. ' In the formation of this organization the fundamental principles of cooperative marketing were preserved. The foundation of the entire organization was based on the individual livestock pro - ducer, farmer, or rancher.. Through his membership, either in the local shipping association, district marketing association, regional sales agency or terminal sales agency, the livestock producer is given not only the privilege but the responsibility of the voting control of the entire organization. Through this control he names the officers and directors of the terminal and regional marketing associations. He also outlines the policies to be followed by his regional or terminal association, and through his vote elects the delegates to the annual meeting of the National Association and through this delegate he is represented in the </seg>
            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION selection of the directors of the National Association and the National officers. Producers Should Control Marketing The National officers, so elected, are charged with the respon - sibility of carrying out the functions of the National association; they are responsible to their terminal and regional associations and those organizations, in turn, back to the individual livestock producers of the country. It is our contention that either through direct vote or through their representative, the livestock producers of this country control not only the policies of the' National Live Stock Marketing Association but they have control of the personnel and of the entire operations of the organization. In addition to the twenty-one member agencies of the National Association there are two subsidiary organizations, namely, the Na - tional Feeder and Finance Corporation, and the National Live Stock Publishing Association. The purposes of the National Feeder and Finance Corporation are two-fold: first, to set up regional livestock credit corporations which will make loans to stock men for the feed - ing and finishing of livestock; second, to move livestock as efficiently as possible with minimum costs from the areas of production to the corn belt and eastern feeders. The total authorized capital stock of the National Feeder and Finance Corporation is five million dollars, consisting of 50,000 shares of stock of par value $100 per share. All of the stock of the National Feeder and Finance Corporation is owned by the National Live Stock Marketing Association. Funds for the purchase of the capital stock of this corporation have been borrowed from the Federal Farm Board by the National Live Stock Marketing, Association. The National Feeder and Finance Corporation assists in the organization of regional credit corporations and provides additional capital for these corpora - tions by purchasing a majority of their capital stock. These credit corporations then discount their livestock paper with the various Federal Intermediate Credit banks. Credit Conditions At the present time there are five regional credit corporations in active operation. Due to the fact that livestock alone represents about a three billion dollar Industry and In addition to this com - modity there are numerous others such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, fruit, and others, representing in round numbers a total value of twelve billion dollars annually, it can be readily understood that the five hundred million dollar revolving fund authorized by Congress in the Agricultural Marketing Act would not efficiently finance agri - culture. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE . For that reason the following plan was developed to assist in financing the livestock industry. The Farm Board loans the National association funds to provide a portion of the capital for the develop - ment of regional credit corporations. The National association pur - chases the stock of the National Feeder and Finance Corporation, with these funds. This makes available the funds with which the National Feeder and Finance Corporation can in turn purchase the stock of the regional credit corporations. The National Feeder and Finance Corporation after this stock purchase, owns the majority of voting stock of the regional credit corporation; thus it operates, so far as imancing is concerned, as a holding company. The regional credit corporation with the funds received from the sale of stock to the National Feeder. and Finance Corporation, pur - chases Federal Land Bank bonds. Federal Intermediate Credit bank de - bentures or other government securities, which in turn are deposited with the Federal Intermediate Credit bank in order to secure a line of credit which will be approximately ten times the amount of the capital stock of the credit corporation. In this way the regional credit cor - poration can, with a comparatively small amount of capital, carry a large volume of livestock loans. A stockman desiring a feeding or pasture loan first makes an appication for same to a member sales agency of the National Live Stock Marketing Association. The applicant furnishes a financial statement with this application. These are checked by the marketing association and then sent to the regional credit corporation where it is passed upon. If the loan is approved, the feed and livestock are inspected and appraised by competent inspectors who have been ap - proved by the Federal Intermediate Credit bank. The applicant gives a chattel mortgage on both* the livestock and feed, and executes a note to the credit corporation. The credit corporation discounts the note with the Federal Intermediate Credit bank and the proceeds are placed to the credit of the regional corporation and in turn made available to the stockman for the purpose of livestock, or If he owns his livestock, the funds, can be used to purchase feed. The National Feeder and Finance Corporation, in addition .to rendering linancing Bervice, receives orders from member agencies or the National Marketing association to purchase stocker and feeder cattle and these orders are filled mainly- by our member agencies operating in the range states. The stock is shipped directly from the range to the feed lot. Supply and Demand Information The main purpose of the National Live Stock Publishing Asso - ciation, the other subsidiary organization of National Live Stock Mar - keting Association, is to keep farmers and ranchmen advised as to the </seg>
            <seg id="p247">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION operations of the National association and Its member agencies; also to keep the individual members In close touch with all phases of the livestock industry and to inform them as to the supply and demand conditions, with respect to livestock and livestock products. The total authorized capital stock of National Live Stock Pub - lishing Association is 2,000 shares of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, and 1,000 shares of preferred ■ stock, par value $100 per share, making a total of $110,000.00.° The National Live Stock Mar - keting Association owns all of the common stock of this subsidiary. The preferred stock is owned by the member agencies of the National association. This subsidiary owns and publishes the "National Live Stock Producer," a paper which is devoted almost entirely to the marketing end of the livestock industry. The actual sales service in our organization is practically all rendered by pur member sales agencies, which are located at strategic points throughout the country. This is quite different from the form of organization used by other commodity marketing groups. Our commodity being very perishable In nature, must be handled quickly and will not permit assembling in large numbers anTT holding for any considerable length of time. Each of these member sales agencies is a separate entity, controlled by a local board of directors and man - aged locally. Each renders a complete sales service. In most cases this sales service has included, in' addition to the regular sales service generally rendered by a commission firm, market - ing information, radio reports, transportation services, extra field serv - ice, the handling of livestock loan work and many others, with far less cost than the same or lesser service than was formerly rendered by privately owned agencies. In other words, they have been able to render more service than is generally expected of a commission firm, and in charging the same rate of commission as other agencies they have been able to show substantial savings. . The National Live Stock Marketing Association works with each of its member agencies, trying always to strengthen these units and harmonize the operation of one with another. It is our plan, as the organization develops, to furnish each and every member operating agency of the National association with market information which will place our salesmen In position to bargain with the best of buyers and in a position where they will have information which can bo passed on to the live stock producers, enabling them to systematically plan their breeding and feeding programs. Included in the National Live Stock Marketing Association's set-up is provision for a Sales Board, or as we call it, "Sales Advisory Hoard." The duty of this board will be to secure the most authorita - tive information possible relative to supply and demand in respect to livestock and livestock products and with this information as a basis. </seg>
            <seg id="p248">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to prepare and transmit reports to the member sales agencies early each business day and as many times as necessary during the trading hours of each day for their information and direction. The Sales Advisory Board is composed of the president and gen - eral manager of the National Live Stock Marketing Association and the manager of the National Feeder and Finance Corporation. While' this board has not functioned up to the present time, preparations are being made to start the work as soon as possible. • Charts, graphs, maps, and other Information are being compiled and placed in such form that it will be possible for an individual in the National office to furnish this information to the member agencies and advise with - them in their sales work. The Farm Board has been very helpful to the National association in preparing this information. The research department of the National association has been in active operation for some time, and is furnishing bi-weekly reports to our member agencies and others regarding markets and market trends. 1 feel safe in saying that no more reliable market Information is available today to livestock marketing agencies or to livestock pro - ducers than that which is released by the research department of the National Live Stock Marketing Association. As our funds permit we certainly Intend to enlarge the work of this department and make Its services cover an even larger field. Our plans provide for a transportation department. We feel that this service is highly Important and should be rendered the agencies by the National association. At present we are handling our trans - portation problems through the Illinois Agricultural Association. This will be transferred to the National ollice under a separate department just as soon as our growth and income will permit. Other departments and services of the National include publicity, advertising, legal, public relations, and livestock and meats. In the short time we have been operating it has been impossible for us to completely develop each of the departments that are planned for the National association but a start has been made on practically all of them. These and many other services will be developed just as rapidly as funds permit and as the development of the organization shows a need for them. The problems of livestock marketing are many and some of them exceedingly complex. We can not expect them to be solved overnight and for this reason a long time program has been outlined for the National Live Stock Marketing Association which, if properly sup - ported by the livestock producers of this country, should bring some very definite results. </seg>
            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION What Itesults May We Expect? Some of the results which we may reasonably expect are as follows: First. The marketing of livestock in an orderly manner, taking into consideration consumption and demand. This would tend to relieve congestion at markets and gradually do away with or minimize the wide fluctuations in day-to-day markets. Secondly, we can reasonably expect, through this organization, to bring about general use of a standardized livestock grading system. Some very important results along this line have already been ob - tained. Third, the elimination of wasteful systems of distribution of livestock. Fourth, the elimination of unnecessary speculation. Fifth, centralizing the control of the selling of livestock should, and we believe will, enable us to do a better job of merchandising than has been done in the past under the old syBtem. Sixth, through our research department, sales advisory board, and member agencies we should be in a position to keep the indi - \ldual members of our association more closely informed on supply and demand than they have been in the past. Seventh, we can aid members in avoiding or controlling surpluses and keep them, informed on any change in the market demand. Eighth, we can stimulate the consumption of meat through adver - tising and by cooperating with packers and retailers and in other advertising campaigns. Ninth, we should be able to lower the actual marketing cost required to- move our produce from the farm to the ultimate con - sumer, and by so doing obtain for the producer a. larger share of the consumer's dollar. These as well as many other benefits should come with the de - velopment of the cooperative livestock marketing program on a national plan. The success of this organization as well as that of any coopera - tive organization, rests in the hands of the producers of the com - modity. They must have a real vision of cooperative marketing and be willing to deliver their livestock to their sales organization. They must accept the responsibility of ownership and exercise their voting privilege and see that the directors and officers are elected who believe in the principles or cooperative marketing and who are qualified to direct the destinies of the organization. The members should see to it that their organization is directed by men who believe in coopera- </seg>

If our membership in the local and state cooperative associations will accept these responsibilities and exercise the powers granted them, there should be no reason for disappointment in the results obtained from carrying out this National program. THE CONTRACT FEEDING OF LIVESTOCK DAN HILDEBRAND, Seward I dare say that there has been more interest in the contract feeding of cattle and sheep in cooperation with the range man this year, than in any year in the history of our country. This, of course, has been brought about largely on account of the very low price the feeder cattle and sheep have been bringing the grower. Probably another reason is on account of finances. As we review conditions over a period extending for at least li f teen years back, we find as a general rule the grower has been receiving a very satisfactory price for his livestock, barring only the period around 1920 and 1921 and of course, so long as the price of feeder stock was holding up where there was a profit to the grower, he was not especially interested in taking a chance on receiving more money when the livestock was finished for market. The last two years have probably been the most disastrous two years for the farmer in the last twenty years and I dare say will be long remembered by many feeders of cattle and lambs. Grower and Feeder Should Cooperate It clearly demonstrates that there must be closer cooperation be - tween the grower and the feeder in order that we may at least elim - inate, so far as possible, the speculative element for the grower and the feeder by trying to work out a program whereby both the grower .-ind the feeder market their livestock on a finished market basis. In other words, there is no secret as to the approximate amount of grain and roughage it requires to finish a certain age steer or lamb. In a given length of time. From this information one can estimate the approximate cost per pound that the gain should cost .under normal conditions. . . &gt; I think it is conceded by all concerned that there is a lot of room for thought in working out this problem along an eauitable basis. I think it is also conceded one of the problems is to line up the grower, who has for these many years disposed of his surplus livestock either </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION direct to the feeder or on the open market. Now that we have so many problems entering into the marketing of our livestock, it be - hooves each and everyone interested to eliminate so far as possible any unnecessary overhead in order that we may successfully compete with the meat substitutes that are being urged on the public from day to day, and thereby promote a greater consumption of meat products. I think we -are all quite agreed that if it were possible to deliver the feeder livestock direct to the feeder in the corn belt where same can be handled on a feed and transit billing, then the grower and the feeder would not be so much interested in the initial cost or price that feeder livestock is bringing on the market in the fall, but they would be interested In what the ultimate consumer is willing to pay for the finished product. You can readily see that if a larger portion of our feeder livestock could be handled on this basis, both parties, over a period of ten years, would Hkelv fare far better than where a long price is paid for feeder livestock this year only to have the finished product sell on a basis that not only fails to bring a profit, hut means that the feeder has to absorb a very substantial loss. As a result the next year, feeder livestock are reduced to a point where the grower does not profit, making an economic condition that is bad for both the grower and the feeder. Probably some of you heard the Honorable Duncan Marshall a year ago, outline a plan that was being used in western Canada where the growers had combined their efforts and were delivering calves to the grain belt where they were to be fed out on contract. This apparently proved very satisfactory to both the grower and the feeder. With all the contracts that I have had anything to do with, rarely have 1 found a case where the feeder and the grower did not profit in a small way and I believe this is true even under the adverse conditions that we are having just now, where the livestock have been fed out on an equitable, fair basis. I appreciate that a custom which has been in use as long as the present one, is not easy to change, as my understanding is that the Universities of Wyoming, Colorado, and our own University has been giving serious considera - tion to this very problem. With world conditions so changed, that almost every country is striving at this time to get on a domestic basis, each and every live - stock interest must give more serious thought to the growing and marketing of livestock in order that we may meet the situation in a way that will put the business on a more profitable basis than it has been within the past few years. I am sure that every fair-minded grower will further realize that the ultimate consumer gives the final answer as to what will be paid for the finished product. This being true, I feel that the sooner we </seg>
            <seg id="p252">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE arrive at a basis in which both the grower and the feeder sell on the same market, the sooner we will eliminate, in a measure, the severe losses that have taken place within the past two years. 1 appreciate that this contract would have to be changed from year to year in order to meet conditions, yet, after a workable con - tract has been prepared It would be a very easy matter to either add to or take from, according to the conditions that had to be met. I know of no subject today that should be of more vital interest to the livestock interests than the subject of growing and feeding of livestock on a cooperative basis in which both the grower and feeder would only be interested in the price that the finished product brought when sold. I thank you. MR. THOMPSON: Are there any questions that you would like to ask Mr. Hildebrand? ELMER YOUNG: I don't think the contract price or agreement is generally understood. MR. HILDEBRAND: In my contract there is no price set. The reason for this is that both the grower and the feeder are selling on the same market on' the basis of the finished product. These year - lings weighed 560 pounds. I agreed to feed them out on the basis or market price for the gain and $1 per 100 on the original weight 1 felt that with corn prices as they are right now I could put the gain on them and take a chance on what they would bring. They gained 248 pounds per head and sold for $6.20 per hundred, which made our gain amount to around $17. Then I got $5.60 bonus on original weight. This amounted to a little better than $22 a head for my share. With corn at present low prices, it is natural I put the gain on the yearling cattle at a low cost. The grower got $5.10 per 100 pounds for his 560-pound yearling. If the cattle had brought 8 cents per pound, he would have received 7 cents for his weight. In other words, both sell on a finished market basis and not a feeder basis. QUESTION: Who pays the freight? MR. HILDEBRAND: The grower pays the freight on the original weight of the cattle. The feeder pays the freight' on the gain he puts on. QUESTION: Who pays the reloading charge' ANSWER: The grower pays 8% cents on the original weight of the cattle. QUESTION: Where are the cattle weighed? MR. HILDEBRAND: Either at loading or unloading point. This year I am weighing them at home. They are weighed here and 3 per cent is added in lieu of the stockyards fill. When weighed at loading point 3 per cent is shrunk from weights. </seg>
            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA CROr GROWERS' ASSOCIATION SIOAKL DAVIS, Cass County: What is your arrangement on death loss? MR. HILDEBRAND: Where you get them on the plan I have these, the feeder stands the death loss; when you are feeding them on just the per cent of cattle basis, the grower stands the loss of the animal. You stand the feed consumed. QUESTION: You have a contract. Would you hesitate to have anyone go into it? MR. HILDEBRAND: No, they would be very welcome to anyone. I have a drove of 162 cattle for one of the Omaha banks. I offered three contracts. I figured them very closely. If you can figure closely you won't lose. You are welcome to either one of these contracts. We have some distressed cattle from Montana on contract basis. I feel that in the long run those folks will get more than they would have gotten for these feeder cattle and we will be well paid for the corn and time put in. QUESTION: What price do you figure the grower is going to get for his cattle up at home? MR. HILDEBRAND: On those already sold, he will receive ?5.10. Out of this he has to pay his expenses. That will leave him $4.25 net. Market conditions will determine what he realizes from the remainder. QUESTION: What about the hog feed? MR. HILDEBRAND: I get all pork produced by hogs following the cattle. REMARK: It seems to me that there is one advantage to the grower. He is assured within 1 cent of the fat cattle market. MR. HILDEBRAND: If the grower is selling theBe cattle on a basis of a finished market, certainly he is getting all there is in it. QUESTION: Supposing your corn is worth 80 cents per bushel. You would have to have more. MR. HILDEBRAND: Yes, the point is this: The experiment station has given us from year to year figures as to the approximate cost of 100 pounds of gain — how many, bushels of corn are required to put on a given amount of gain, the amount of roughage necessary to put on this amount of gain. By using these figures and our own teed prices, we can easily calculate the cost, in dollars and cents, of 100 pounds of gain. In making the figures I think we should be lair to the grower. After a certain amount has been added for feed charge, certainly he Is entitled to share in any profit over and above that figure. QUESTION: Couldn't you say that when cattle prices are going up you are helping him just as much as he helps you? </seg>
            <seg id="p254">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. HILDEBRAND: It should extend over a period of time to arrive at a definite conclusion. The facts are that the sooner we begin to realize that the grower's problem is the feeder's problem, and the profits of both parties are based on what the finished product brings, the better off we will be. If they are both selling on the same market they should be satisfied that they have got out of the business all they put into it without the feeder assuming the hazards and taking the chances he has. We are on a domestic basis and the sooner we realize we have no foreign markets, that our markets are here at home, the better off we'll be. The only export markets we have are in lards and fats, and they are worth very little. 1WSTUKE QUESTION IU&gt;X PROF. H. J. GRAMLICH, Leader Let us first consider permanent pastures. They have some ad - vantages. First of all, they require a minimum of labor to care for them from year to year. They can be used in wet weather due to the fact that they form a good sod. Being composed of perennial grasses, they do not have the tendency to become as woody as tem - porary pastures and therefore offer grazing for relatively long periods. Water and shade are available from the same sources year after year in permanent pastures. Where one has temporary pastures it is more of a problem to secure water and shade. There is not the problem with fences where one uses permanent pastures that is experienced with temporary pastures. Now let ub consider for' a moment the advantages of temporary pastures. They may be either annual or biennial as we may wish. Crops may be selected, such as sudan grass, that supply feed during July and August when most permanent pastures are more or less dormant and of little value. By using temporary pastures we can put practically all of the land under the plow if it is fit for cultivation and thus increase the total farm returns. In these times of so-called "over production" of some grain crops, it might be desirable to have more of our land in pastures. What are some of the best combinations for temporary pastures? I can give you in just one moment the set-up we use .in carrying our animal husbandry livestock through the season. This set-up applies particularly here in southeastern Nebraska but it would apply equally as well in other parts of the state. For early spring pasture, we use fall rye which may usually be pastured by the first of April. Fall rye is at its best from April first to June first. We also use second </seg>
            <seg id="p255">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION year Bweet clover which is available relatively early in the spring. Generally speaking, we are able to pasture this here at Lincoln about the middle of May and use it for about two months or until about July 15th. We also use sudan grass considerably. It is ordinarily available Tor pasture about June fifteenth, being seeded about corn planting time and makes a world of feed until frost or about October first. This year it lasted well up into November. Another crop which we use Is first year sweet clover put in early in the spring without a nurse crop. We are able ordinarily to start pasturing first year sweet clover by June fifteenth to twentieth, depending upon spring moisture, the condition of the ground, and the season. Corn ground double disked in the spring, put Into sweet clover In March, and clipped high when the weeds begin to come on is ordinarily ready to be pastured by about June fifteenth. This remains good until about the first of November. We use little or no permanent pasture. I doubt whether this is a practical set-up on many farms as most of you probably have some permanent pasture on rough land or along creeks which can be used in conjunction with these crops I have just mentioned. MR. ROBERTS, Lancaster County: What crop do you follow with after the rye? PROP. GRAMLICH: If moisture conditions are reasonably favor - able, we plow the land and then put it into a silage crop or drill a crop for pasture purposes. Whether or not we are successful depends largely on the summer moisture. This year our corn on rye land actually made more silage than that handled In the ordinary way. MR. WAHLGREN, Douglas -County: I have several acres of blue grass pasture in which the grass is about dead. I am thinking of plowing it up this spring and putting it into brome grass for perma - nent pasture. What do you think of this? PROF. GRAMLICH: I am going to ask Mr. Stewart to answer that question. MR. STEWART: The first question that comes to my mind is whether or not the land which you describe is farm land. If it is farm land, It might be well to crop It for a few years and seed down some other field- not so high in fertility. On the other hand, if it must be kept in pasture, it might be plowed, disked down well in order to pack It and then seeded to brome grass. Brome grass being u light fluffy type of seed is rather difficult to seed through a drill hut it can be done. A good many times It can better be broadcast by hand. Brome grass starts rather slowly but eventually It forms a very tough sod and Is one of our best cultivated pasture grasses. It could be seeded on this land early in the spring or one could wait and fall seed' it during August. &gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p256">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE FKOK. GKAMLJCH: Brome grass comes In very early in the .spring and grows again well in the fall but ordinarily is not very satisfactory during July and August. It might well be supplemented with some of the temporary pastures that we have been talking about. QUESTION: What can be used In Thurstdn County to take the place of rye where one did not get it seeded last fall? ' PKOF. GRAMLICH: One can use oats or barley or a mixture of oats and barley. These come on and make pasture about as early as anything which can be spring seeded. MARSHALL. ROSS, Buffalo County: We sowed fall rye in ttte spring and found that it made lots of pasture. When seeded in this way it tends to stool out and make a good deal of vegetative growth which makes excellent seed. ■ ■ ." ; . . ■■&lt;■ '■■ ■ • •.. ■ • ■■ .

ANDERSON, Lancaster County: We also spring seeded fall rye some time in March, about as early as we could get into the Held. Under our conditions it produced more pasture than oats or barley seeded in the spring. MR. UOOK, Lancaster County: In seeding brome grass for perma - nent pasture, would it be better to include some other grasses? MR. STEWART: There are a number of mixtures which the crops department have suggested for various conditions. Brome grass would be used as the basis of all of these here in eastern Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS" ASSOCIATION One might also use .some Meadow fesque and possibly some Orchard grass along with some sweet clover and , possibly just a little white or Dutch clover and blue grass, although these latter two tend to .come in without seeding. These mixtures are excellent to use on land that is too hilly to farm or which are located along a creek and are inclined to flood too much for farming. WAYNE DINSMORE: I wonder if anyone here has had exper - ience in pasturing winter wheat in comparison to winter rye. Which does the stock eat first, if they are sown side by side? REPLY : In my experience, stock will eat wheat first. I had a piece or rye but did not have quite enough seed to finish out the field. 1 used wheat on the rest of it and found that my stock ate the wheat down to the ground before they touched the rye. QUESTION: Could winter wheat be used in the spring for pas - ture as has been suggested for winter rye? MR. ANDERSON, Lancaster County: Ordinarily I do not believe that winter wheat would be as satisfactory when spring seeded as winter rye. It would probably not make quite as much growth and would have more tendency to rust than rye. QUESTION: How can alfalfa be pastured? PROF. GRAMLICH: Here is a good question. How about pas - turing alfalfa? I see Mr. Baker here from No;th Platte where they have been carrying on some experiments in pasturing alfalfa. I am going to ask him to give us his ideas. PROF. BAKER, North Platte Experiment Station: All of the work which we have done in pasturing alfalfa has been in connection with cattle on full feed and running on alfalfa pasture. We have had very good results with this practice. Cattle on alfalfa and a full feed of corn have gained just as fast as, and possibly a little faster than, those in a dry lot on corn and alfalfa hay and they have made gains a trifle more economically. WTien we marketed these steers, the shrink of both lots was practically ttie same and the dress - ing percentage practically the same. They sold at the same price. The principal advantage of feeding on pasture is, of course, to save the labor of putting up hay and the labor of feeding the hay. There may be some disadvantage from the standpoint of damage to the stand or alfalfa. We have not carried on the work long enough to know just how serious this is. JAKE PEDRETT, Kimball County: How about the danger of bloating on alfalfa pasture? PROF. GRAMLICH: On a full feed of grain, there seems to be little or no danger or bloat. Unless grain is fed to cattle on alfalfa pasture, there is always a probability of bloat occurring. </seg>
            <seg id="p258">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF" AGRICULTURE QUKSTION: Should sudan grass be mowed where it is not clipped closely and the plants reach considerable height? PROP. GRAMLICH: Here at the Agricultural College we have fed steers when running on sudan grass pasture which was clipped frequently and kept short and tender. This worked out reasonably satisfactory. QUESTION: When sweet clover is wanted particularly for pas - ture, should a nurse crop be used when seeding? PROF. GRAMLICH: From our experience here at the Nebraska Agricultural College, we would say that where you want sweet clover particularly ror pasture it is better to seed it without a nurse crop, as there is less risk of losing the stand. In northeastern Nebraska, and farther east along the Missouri River, I know that many men feel that it is foolish to not use a nurse crop, but at Lincoln and ' from here west in the South Platte country, we have a somewhat different situation. The small grain takes considerable moisture which can be used to advantage by the sweet clover crop. Where the land Is very weedy, a nurse crop cut down somewhat in amount may well be used. MR. DALBY, Gage County: Suppose you wanted to get some - what earlier pasture. • Would the use of a nurse crop help? PROF. GRAMLICH: You might get somewhat earlier pasture but probably the growth of sweet clover would not be satisfactory. We have also tried seeding sweet clover with winter rye and winter wheat but without much success. MR. GADDEKEN, Kimball County: I might say, while we are talking about sweet clover, that we have had some experience in pas - turing horses on second year woody sweet clover fields. We have had some loss of horses under these conditions and we believe that, it is due to pasturing the woody, coarse, and more or less dry sweet clover stems. I would like to ask if anyone has studied the relation of the soil to bloat on sweet clover pasture. I have the opinion that bloating Is influenced by certain chemicals in the soil. We have found that cattle on some fields will bloat much more than on others. PROF. GRAMLICH: Dr. Van Es of our veterinary department is of the opinion that whenever sweet clover is pastured during damp weather there is danger of bloat. There is much more trouble from bloat in northeastern Nebraska than in the South Platte section, par - ticularly when second year sweet clover is pastured during May and June, which is the wet time of the year and the growth of sweet clover is likely to be lush and succulent at that time. Later on In the year when the plants are somewhat less succulent and the weather somewhat drier, there seems to be much less danger from bloat. Here at the Nebraska Agricultural College, we have used sweet clover pas- </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ture for seventeen years and have lost only one animal from bloat. We know of no way to avoid an occasional case of bloat when a succulent growth of sweet clover is pastured during wet, damp weather. PROF. GRAMLICH: I see that Deltnar Anderson of Dawson County Is in the audience. I wonder, Mr. Anderson, if you would say just a word in regard to your methods of feeding cattle. MR. ANDERSON: We have done a good deal of work In feed - ing cattle on grass. We do not use sweet clover but ordinary native pasture common to our part of the state. We began feeding heavy cattle and have tapered off until we now have calves. We believe that calves are more satisfactory as the market demand is for lighter weight cattle. We have considerable hill pasture and find that we can utilize It best by feeding on pasture. We buy our calves in the fall and of late years have been starting them on ground corn fodder. We then gradually increase the corn, adding a little to the corn fodder until at the present time we have our calves up to about three pounds of corn in addition to what they get from the fodder. We continue to increase the grain ration until about the first of May when we try to get them on about eight pounds of corn and continue on that ration of grain after they are turned on the pasture. We have used some molasses feed with the thought of shortening the feeding period somewhat and getting them onto the market a little earlier. \ PROF. GRAMLICH: How can we improve our thin weedy pas - ture? I am going to ask Mr. Stewart to say a word on that. MR. STEWART: I would say in the first place that probably the reason why our pastures become woody is that they have been over-grazed. The first thing to do, I believe. Is to let up some on the amount of pasturing, that is, let the grasses get more of a start and in this way build up their more or less exhausted root system. Where Some manure is available, this might be spread over the pasture. Clipping the weeds is a good practice. Where the pastures are very thin, it might be well to scatter some seed over them early in the spring. PROF. GRAMLICH: We have with us today Mr. Garlock from the College of Agriculture at Columbia, Missouri. In Missouri they do a lot of feeding on pasture and I am going to ask Mr. Garlock to say a word to us at this time. MR. GARLOCK: In Missouri we do' have a lot of blue grass pas - ture and we have learned to appreciate it a lot. One regretable thing about our pastures in Missouri is that too many of them are neglected and are not given an opportunity to go to seed and main - tain themselves. Our main grasses are timothy and red clover. There is a tendency to use more red clover and timothy than blue grass. </seg>

In June, although the horses were worked considerably more, due to the more general use of pasture, the feed costs were reduced to $28.20. In July, although the horses were used somewhat less, the feed costs continued to go down, reaching $18.90. These figures, I believe, show the importance of using pasture as one means of cutting the cost of feeding work horses. 4-h chops jiik;ix&lt;; team The Association paid $100 toward the expenses of the 4-H Crops Club Judging Team which represented Nebraska at the International Grain and Hay Show by virtue of winning first place in this state contest at the Nebraska State Fair.

THE UTILITY SMALL ■ GRAIN SHOW Samples in this show are restricted to those submitted by certi - fied seed growers as being representative of the certified seed which they are supplying to customers. It is believed that this type of a show has much more value than ordinary shows of small grain samples in which many of the samples are hand picked and do not represent actual lots of seed for sale. This show was judged by C. A. Suneson and Nelson Jodon of the Cereal Office of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. The samples were considered from the standpoint of seed stock. The following list gives the winners in this section of the show. </seg>

James Neis, Spalding THE MARKET CORN SHOW The market corn show was initiated in 1930 in an effort to start a practical grain show of field-run corn to be judged from the standpoint of market demands. When the corn yields are checked in the field, a 20-pound sample is taken for shelling per cent. and moisture determinations. This field-run sample is then put in the show without treatment except fanning to remove the chaff. In placing the market corn class, the judges, who were H. G. Clark, Chief Grain Inspector, Omaha Grain Exchange, E. A. Lucke ol Lucke-Gibbs Grain Co. of Omaha, and Prof. T. A. Kiesselbach of the Nebraska Experiment Station, considered the sample from a com - bined feeder, miller and corn products standpoint. All samples were satisfactory In moisture content so this was not a factor in placing them. Under federal grain standards, the test weight per bushel standards are: No. 1, 55 pounds; No. 2, 53 pounds; No. 3, 51 pounds; No. 4, 49 pounds, No. 5, 47 pounds; and No. 6, 44 pounds. All samples in the show were up to the minimum test weight for No. 1 corn, 55.5 being the lowest test weight of any sample on display. Some consideration was given to test weight, however, other things being equal. There was a considerable range in test weights, the heaviest exhibit being a Krug sample from the Earl Mead, Dawson County, irrigated field testing 62.7, making a range in test weights in the state from 5T5.5 to 62.7 or 7.2 pounds. It is interesting to note a variation of 4.3 pounds between the highest test weight 59.7 pounds and the lowest test weight 55.4 pounds among the 39 contestants </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION from Clay County — this county having the highest number of con- ,, testants. Samples varied widely In their content of damaged kernels which came from rotten or partially rotten ears. Some samples were ex - cessively deep and starchy, indicating that the corn was not well adapted to the locality where It was grown. Purity was also a factor in placing the samples. It was brought out that red or reddish kernels in a yellow corn are objectionable from a milling standpoint. The winning samples were taken to local shows in counties hold - ing Corn and Hog meetings where they were again displayed along with all samples from contest fields in that particular county.

SPECIAL MEETING OP THE BOARD OP DIRECTORS OF THE NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION, January 4, 1032 Meeting was called to order in Room 108 of Experiment Station Hall by President C. Y. Thompson. All members of the executive committee were present. The minutes of the last board meeting were read and approved. The matter of the inclusion of Nebraska Common alfalfa seed in tests in eastern states was. discussed. It was brought out that many eastern buyers do not know Nebraska seed and con - sequently there is a lessened demand for seed from these states. After a thorough discussion of this proposition, it was moved by Mr. Dietz and seconded by Mr. Mott that the secretary of the Association be authorized to purchase a suitable amount of Nebraska grown Com - mon alfalfa seed to be sent to selected experiment stations by the Agronomy Department of the College of Agriculture for comparative tests with alfalfa seed of other sources and varieties. Motion carried. Mr. Day suggested that the distribution of alfalfa seed lists in eastern Nebraska would result In considerable demand for this seed. It was moved by Mr. Dietz and seconded by Mr. Biermann that the annual </seg>

The matter of seed supplies for the drouth section of the state was discussed. President Thompson reported that a committee had been in touch with Secretary Hyde while he was attending these meet - ings in an effort to see that provisions were made for good seed mov - ing into the drouth section. President Thompson reported that the Secretary was wholly in sympathy with the thought that good seed should be shipped into the drouth section and was willing to do all he could to foster such a movement. He suggested that since most of the counties were without county agents that contact be made through local organizations for handling of seed. Mr. Thompson also reported that although the seed loan had not yet passed, Secretary Hyde indicated that it would in all probability, and funds would be available in due time. It was suggested that the Secretary of the Association- keep closely in touch with the seed needs and do all that seemed possible to foster the movement of good seed into the drouth section. There being no further business, the business session was ad - journed and the regular program for the day taken up. P. H. STEWART, Secretary. </seg>

Stewart, Secretary-Treasurer January 1, 1031, to January 1, 10:12 The members of the association are familiar with the fact that the Association has two funds on which to draw. One of these is under the control of the Association directly and consists of money received for membership and for inspection and sales tax of seed certification work. This fund is used largely for the seed certification work, since it is from members of the Association who co-operate In this project. The Association also received $1,750 as an annual appropriation from the legislature through the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. This fund is used for the promotion of educational work of the Asso - ciation. The full report covers expenditures from both funds.

It is unfortunate that we should have this kind of roads this week, although I guess the snow is a blessing to the farmers . It no doubt has cut our attendance a great deal. However, in behalf of this association I wish to extend a welcome to all that are here this afternoon, and hope you feel justified even if you did have to scoop your way here. We are fortunate this afternoon in having with us the talent we have advertised on our program, as they had quite a distance to come. The first speaker is a man who maybe most of you did not know previously, but no doubt you know him through his articles read in dairy magazines. He is the associate editor of "Successful Farming," a paper which I believe most of you receive in your home. He is a former professor of Dairy Hubandry In the University of Missouri. I take great pleasure this afternoon in presenting to you, Mr. E. M. Harmon. Mr. Harmon. MR. E. M. HARMON: Mr. Chairman and members of the Ne - braska State Dairymen's Association. Every time we raise our living standards, we increase our problems. When the automobile came into being, it meant that those who are to have automobiles must master their business sufficiently well that they might make enough more out of it to pay for a car and its upkeep. We pan say the same for the telephone, mail delivery, electricity, radio, airplanes, and all of the rest of our modern devices. </seg>
            <seg id="p312">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 304 uSaSSM m E. M. HARMON It is true that some of. these pay or help to pay for themselves if rightly used. However, that again presents problems to those who are to learn how to use them for increased profits. As dairymen, we are just as anxious as anyone to enjoy higher living stand - ards. But to' do this, we must constantly study methods of making each dollar and each hour' of labor invested return a high rate on the investment. Our grandfathers had none of these modern conveniences and could not have afforded them even had they been available. The only reason we can afford them is that we have learned how to accomplish more with less effort. We are all fortunate that science is constantly helping us in our efforts In the direction of efficiency. Dairymen have been particularly helped by science. The cream separator and the Babcock test have given us a chance to put .our operations on a business basis. We still have far to go. Fifteen years ago this month, when I completed by college course, I had been taught to balance a ration, using the old familiar proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. We know little about minerals and nothing at all about vitamins. We have lots to learn on these two subjects yet, but we have learned facts of tremendous importance to dairymen. We know now that some soils are deficient m phosphorus, and that feeds grown there will not properly support animal life. We know that even the lime content of soil may seriously affect the mineral and protein content of the feed grown. In Missouri tests a few years ago, alfalfa on well-limed soil analyzed 19.3 per cent protein. An exact duplicate of these con - ditions, except on soil that was not well limed gave about one-third as much alfalfa, with an analysis of 10.3 per cent of protein. These tests duplicated with soybeans produced a hay m the one case analyz - ing 14.6 per cent protein and m the other case 8.6 per cent protein. It does not require a large stretch of the imagination to see that we may possibly develop ways and means of treating our soil and of cut - ting and curing our roughage crops bo that we may materially reduce our grain feed bills. We know now that iodine can be fed to cows m small' quantities and increase the iodine content of milk. We know that this is a remedy and a preventive of goiter which is far more common In the </seg>
            <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION human race, and especially among girls and young women than is commonly known. We know that it is possible to feed eradicated yeast to cows and to thus produce a milk much higher in vitamin D, which in turn prevents rickets, especially in young children. We do not know yet just how practical these things may be, but they will bear watching. Someone may capitalize upon them in a big way. Going a little outside the dairy industry, we are learning that soybeans produce soft pork. We are learning that in poultry poor hatching results are often more likely to be due to improper feeding of the birds before the eggs are laid than to the care of the eggs during the incubation period. Here at your own experiment station, your Animal Husbandry Department upset the old idea that we had to feed our beef calves heavily on concentrated feeds during the winter in order to put choice animals on the market the next year. On the other hand, simply by feeding roughage for a considerable period and then finishing on green feed in the summer, they will be able to come on the market with choice and prime beeves at a time when such animals are scarce and high in price, instead of coming early in the spring when the runs are heavy. These are just a few of the many developments which are taking place and which the live - stock man must study if he is going to make the most profit out of his business. In the matter of farm management the proper use of power equip - ment is essential. I would not be one to Indiscriminately advocate selling the horses and substituting tractor power nor any other par - ticular type of power until conditions are known. That is something for each individual farmer to figure out for himself and to do what will pay him most. However, we do know that many farms are failing to make the maximum return because they are not utilizing enough power in the right way. For instance, when electricity is available, why will a man continue the tedious job of turning the cream separator by hand when electric power will do a better job at from one to three cents an hour? A man who succeeds in the highest degree must use the maximum amount of power that he can operate profitably. The marketing of our products presents another set of problems which demands our attention. Most Nebraska farmers are selling their butterfat through the devious and expensive route of the cream station. This not only involves an expense before the product reaches the creamery, but also requires time, which in turn deteriorates the product and makes it sell for less. The net result is that you get a year 'round price of several cents a pound under "that obtained in the good cooperative creamery stations. This statement is not a de - nunciation of centralized creameries. They have been and still are necessary. It is rather a challenge to both producers and creameries to correct this antique and expensive system just as rapidly as ways and means can be found to do it. Otherwise your standard of living </seg>
            <seg id="p314">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE must be just that much lower than that of those who do learn to bring their increased revenue to themselves. . For those of you who live in whole milk marketing districts, the problem is no less important. Here, the important job is that of bringing all groups — consumers, distributors, and producers to a com - mon understanding. Real cooperative milk' marketing consists of first, cleaning up the supply and the market thus insuring consumer and distributor a liberal supply of good quality milk at all times. Then when production is balanced to prevent seasonal gluts and a fair understanding is reached by each of these three groups, everyone profits. In communities where this problem has been sanely handled for several years on such a basis, we find all groups pleased with the arrangement. It is no small job. It is one that presents many prob - lems. But it is one which your Nebraska milk producers must solve for the good of all. Problems of disease control are just as perplexing yet just as important. We are pretty well along with our tuberculosis eradica - tion work. We have gone far enough that we know the present plan of eradication will work. The one thing we must watch most is that we do not become negligent. If we ever let tuberculosis get away from us, as it is in Europe, it will impose a burden on the farmers of this country that will be almost impossible to endure. We' can finish the job now under the present plan of eradication and at com - paratively small cost. We must do so. Next, we have Bang disease to control. We have little idea of what that disease costs us. We do know that in addition to causing abortions, it reduces milk flow, causes breeding trouble, and sterility. We know that it affects hogs and beef cattle and have some reason to think it causes poultry losses, as well as causing undulant fever in man. Your own experiment station has estimated the loss from Bang disease at about $100 each time a cow aborts. The Connecticut station found their losses to be $44 for each reacting cow per year (whether she aborted or not)-. Since cows probably abort about .40 per cent of the time, these figures probably check closely. In our own Mere - dith Jersey Farm herd production is at least 1,000 pounds of milk per cow higher, in addition to a full calf crop since we cleaned out the disease. If 20 per cent of the cows react and the loss is $40 a year, the losses to dairymen are at least $175,000,000 a year, besides the damage to other livestock. But, whatever the loss, it is too big a tax for the dairy industry to pay. It can and must be controlled. Control measures are not prohibitive and anyone who wishes to do so can eliminate such losses. But of all the perplexing things that confront us, we probably know less about breeding profitable producers than any other. For </seg>
            <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION years we have said to head your herd with a purebred bull, or with a purebred sire out of a tested dam. Hut for many men this is not good advice. A study of the records of the dairy herd improvement association of the country shows us that one-third of all purebred sires have lowered production. Only one-third have materially in - creased it. The other third has just about held its own. Many of these mistakes have been due to putting too much emphasis on some remote ancestor of the bull selected. Others "are due to an over - emphasis of an outstanding record on the dam. But regardless of the cause, the difliculty exists and must be corrected. It is a problem the dairy farmer must solve if he is to increase his profits. It is one the breeder must whip if he is to stay in the business and continue to sell bulls. It is one the breed associations must solve if they are going to continue to exist. It will be solved. In my opinion, the solution consists in the most rigid culling of purebreds and the use of proven bulls to breed families of proven animals which are uni - formly true for high production. Some breeders and dairymen have herds large enough to prove their own herd sires. Others will have to cooperate with their neighbors or with a big breeder, but no promising bull should be slaughtered until we know what kind of producers he is siring. At the present time 95 per cent or more of our bulls go to the slaughter pen before we know the production of their daughters. Everyone of us know of dairy bulls which have been slaughtered and which, it was afterwards learned would have been -worth thousands of dollars to that community. Such manage - ment is as foolish as building a house on a sand pile. To accomplish this, we must have records. By this I do not mean records on a few cows, or even all cows for their best years. I mean complete lifetime records on all cows and complete herd averages. When we all get this viewpoint, I believe the dairy herd Improvement association and the herd test will begin to be of the most value to us. Then I believe we will begin to make these agencies really, function to the greatest possible extent in lifting the plane of dairying to a level of prosperity that will make it really worth while. In conclusion, I have little confidence In the future for the man who doesn't thoroughly understand the dairy business, or who doesn't practice what he does know. We have some hard years ahead. Many will lose. But for the red-blooded man who studies his business, who follows his agricultural college, its extension service, his county agent, and the farm press, and who puts into practice the worth-while information in feeding, marketing, disease control, management and breeding, the future presents an interesting challenge and I believe a profitable occupation.

It has been found that the cows always gather around the side of the barn where they can get the most fresh air. Slide 9 This picture shows a cow that has been fed a liberal ration of high-quality feeds, corn silage and alfalfa hay without grain. This shows the effect of plenty of alfalfa upon a cow. It keeps her in good flesh and gives her a sleek appearance. Slide 10 This picture shows a specimen from a herd of dairy cows which were treated for "wolf in tlje tail" by having their tails split and a piece of salt pork tied in. This could not possibly cure the condition that had naturally resulted from the lack of a proper ration. This herd had been fed corn stover, timothy hay, oats straw, and a few corn nubbins during the winter. Cows in such weakened condition are very susceptible to disease and cannot be profitable producers.' Slide 11 3rd yr. on alfalfa hay 5 cows — Average aged Pallon, Nevada _. 977 lbs.

Slides 12 to 15 These four slides showed the feed produced by Bluegrass Pasture during 1910, 1911, 1912, and 1913. Taking the usual allowance in northern Illinois or I 1 /, acres of bluegrass to support a cow there was only one week during 1910 that 1% acres would adequately sup - port a cow. During most of the summer, nearly four acres would have been required. During 1911 there were two weeks that would have provided pasture for a cow. For twelve weeks the pasture was practically a total failure, so that 30 acres would have been required to support a cow. The year 1912 failed to show any time at all which bluegrass would support a cow. During 1913 it would have taken 30 acres to support a cow. There should be other crops of clover or timothy coming on to supplement bluegrass as it drys out more quickly and cannot be restored. The cows like bluegrass better as a feed, b.ut they produce better on clover. If a strip of bluegrass is around the clover field the cows will keep the bluegrass eaten closely. » Slide 10 The picture of this field of clover was taken the 17th of July. The clover is blossoming since the cows are not able to eat it closely enough. Clover. will solve the pasture problem economically. The cows can harvest their own summer feed and maintain a high level of milk production while the dairyman is busy harvesting the winter feed. Sudan grass should take its place when clover is gone. Slide 17 A cow pan consume four bushels of feed then she will lie down and chew her cud and digest the food. She should have feed that • will fill her up in a comparatively short time so that she can have time to digest the food. An illustration of this is that when this picture was taken I went with the owner of the farm to see his cattle. As we entered the pasture the. cows that were lying down all got up so we went on down to see the pasture. When we came back fifteen minutes later they were all lying down again but they got up as we came up to them. The owner said just to stay quietly behind the fence and they would lie down again. There must be a reason for their lying down or they wouldn't insist upon doing it. Sometimes cows bloat on clover, but if precautions are taken there should not be any danger. When cows are first turned onto sweet </seg>
            <seg id="p320">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE clover they should have had a full feed of their regular ration so that they are not hungry. Also the dew should be oft and when they are once on they should be left on continuously day and night. One point, to follow is that alfalfa should be used for hay and clover for pasture. Some farmers use these vice versa, which is wrong. The clover crop fails the first of August. Then a crop of sudan pasture should be used. Soy beans also make a good pasture. Slide 18 This slide showed eight plants. The first four were pastured the first fall and the roots were stunted in growth. The second four were not pastured the first fall and the roots had a chance to take hold well and the plants grew to a good height. .Slide 19 This Blide showed a hilly pasture that had for seven years re - seeded itself and produced three times as much feed as the same land before the sweet clover had been disked into the bluegrass. We are up against conditions now that are really quite serious, but I don't think it is as gloomy an outlook as we think. There are wonderful opportunities to make more profit by doing more thinking and studying. Is it a real man's job or is it a peasant's occupation? It is a job. In Germany it is a peasant's occupation where women carry feed^ for miles to feed to the cattle. The condition there is very bad. Just to show you that some people don/t think. We were up in the mountains for a vacation and I met a man who really didn't seem enthused about things in general. I asked him about the de - pression. He said, "What depression." I said, "This employment situation with so many people out of work." He said, "What can you expect with such a man as McKinley as president?" </seg>
            <seg id="p321">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION MAKING MONEY AND SAVING MONEY IN MILK PRODUCTION* Summary of address of WILBER J. FRASER, Profesor of Dairy Farming University of Illinois Dairy farming is really a business of two departments — the dairy herd and the farm crops. A dairyman must be as good a farmer as he is a dairyman, for it does him no good to have good cows and know the proper feeds to give them, unless he has an economical supply of these feeds in sufficient quantity to allow him to produce milk at a profit. Many good dairymen do not lay enough stress upon the matter of feed production and crop rotation, and as a result, spend for feed a large portion of their receipts which should be profit. A dairy rotation must be planned with certain definite things in mind, and the dairyman must realize that his problem In cropping is to properly feed his cows. Too many dairymen at present grow practically the same crops that their grain farmer neighbors do, and as a result their cows either suffer from lack of feed or must be fed purchased feed to make up the deficiency, whatever It may be. The good dairy rotation must do three things: (1) Supply the proper quantity and quality of feeds to keep the dairy cows produc - ing at their maximum production throughout the year, which means that the dairy herd is then making its maximum profit. (2) Provide for the most profitable utilization of the land by growing the most profitable crops and at the same time maintaining and increasing soil humus and nitrogen. (3) Provide for the distribution of labor so that the labor avail - able can be kept profitably employed throughout the year. The rotation should meet the requirements of the cows in the winter by- providing the proper amounts of rich roughage and grain, year after year, and in the summer by furnishing an abundance of good pasture. High quality alfalfa hay and corn silage form the basis for the most economical winter dairy ration. In fact, with the larger breeds giving up to 20 pounds of 3.5 per cent milk a day, and with the smaller breeds giving up to 12 pounds of 5 per cent milk a day, these two feeds are all that are necessary, if of good quality and fed to the cows' capacity to consume them. Beyond these rates of production, home home-grown grains should be added, according to the cow's production, because alfalfa provides such a large amount of high-class protein." This means that instead of paying out large </seg>

            <seg id="p324">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE. BOARD OK AGRICULTURE i ■ amounts of money for protein feed every year, the dairyman who feeds good alfalfa hay liberally will be supplying most of the necessary protein and will no longer be carrying the burden of an annual cash outlay for 1 purchased feed. Every dairyman can figure out for himself what a saving this would mean to him. A good pasture is six months' pasture, instead of only a two or three months" pasture. Sweet clover and other crops should keep the cows supplied with an abundance of pasture of the very best quality. • It is indeed fortunate for the dairyman who is trying to make the most money from milk production, that the need of his cows for hlgh-proteln hay, the necessity for the use of the most suitable crops on his land, and the requirement of the soil for nitrogen and humus all dove-tail together so well and profitably where an alfalfa hay - corn silage-sweet clover pasture program is followed each year. With such a system of rich roughage he can make more money with less labor and | thus get more real enjoyment out of farm life along with more profits from farm work. MR. R. C. JOHNSON: Before the next number I would like to take a few minutes to make some announcements. The Dairy Development Society will meet tomorrow at 10:00. The Fun Feed will be held at 5:30 tonight in the Student Activi - ties Building. Mr. Crowe I ..think has tickets for sale for the Dairy - men's Banquet which is tomorrow evening at the Hotel Cornhusker. We were notified that two members of the Caroleers would be unable to. be with us this afternoon, but we will call on the other two who will entertain us at this time. MR. VICTOR REDIGER: We are very sorry that the whole quartet is; not able to be here but we shall try to do our best for you. (The, Caroleers gave two numbers which were heartily applauded by the audience.) MR. R. C. JOHNSON: I am sure we appreciate a little of this type of program presented by these boys. The next and last number before we adjourn to the Dairy Barn is given by a man whom you all know well, Mr. M. L. Flack. His subject is our "Purebred Sire Program." He will explain how the different Herd Improvement Asso - ciations have progressed and how different ones have won these bulls we expect to give away at the barn. Mr. Flack. MR. il. L. FLACK: Mr. Chairman, ladies, and gentlemen: In 1930 a survey was made to find just what kind of bulls were used in our Dairy Herd Improvement Associations. Through the survey we found that there were' 120 grade or inferior bulls in use. This </seg>
            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN - S ASSOCIATION 315 survey was conducted by Mr. Lawritson in a series of letters to the cow testers. We felt after getting this information that something should be done to improve the herd sires in the state and especially in our Dairy Improvement Associations. The thing that seemed to fill the need the most was a purebred sire contest as is In use today. This contest was put into effect January 1, 1930, and closed Decem - ber 1, 1931. As far as the contest was concerned it was not so important. It merely gave us something to work for and to add interest to the association. In testing our sires we thought the best way would be to tabulate pedigrees for each and every bull in the associations. These pedigrees were to be placed in a large book and sent back to the cow test - ers. The tester in turn was to add infor - mation on the back of each sheet which ■PUB^yj MR. M. L. FLACK was made for daughter and dam comparisons and other information which would aid us m determining the value of the bull. We also had the testers take pictures of the sires and place them m the upper left hand corner. The grade bulls were given a place m the book also but of course no pedigree was run for them. The breeder who had a grade sire hated to see this condition adver - tised and consequently got a pure bred sire. One association m par - ticular replaced five of their grade bulls with purebred bulls. Running the pedigrees and getting the books back to the testers was the big job of this work, taking most- of the summer. Each county was well organized for helping in»thls work and at the time of our preliminary meeting purebred sire committees were appointed. The duties of the sire committee were to help the testers m getting the pedigree and also to aid m explaining the contest to mem - bers and those interested and to assist when possible m taking photo - graphs of the sires. Twenty-two associations were entered m this contest this year with 337 bulls. This is approximately 87 per cent of all associations and bulls m service. The pedigrees of the bulls were returned to Lincoln on December 1 and at that time judged by an out-of-state committee. It is interesting to know how we went about judging these bulls and making the awards. The bulls were judged on the following points: 1. Type. The type of the bull was taken from the picture sup - plied by the tester and attached to the pedigree. </seg>
            <seg id="p326">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE 2. Pedigree. This perhaps was the easiest point for the judges to make their decisions upon since the pedigrees were all present and tabulated for four generations. 3. Suitability. This point was judged by getting information relative to the type and production of the cows in comparison, to the bull himself. Each pedigree had a note attached giving Information relative to the suitability of the sire. Each association was given credit on the replacements made throughout the year. For each bull replaced 20 points were added to the total score. Also Borne credit Was given for bulls . that had proven themselves to be extra good in production. This was deter - mined by comparing their daughter and dams. Since nearly all of the bulls were young bulls very few daughter and dam comparisons were available. The following chart gives information with reference to the results of this contest: (See next page for chart) Twenty-nine per cent of the grade bulls were replaced in the associations. The above chart gives this information rather clearly and it should not be necessary to go. into detail about it. In order to make this contest well worth while and appreciated by the Dairy Herd Improvement Association the various Interests have helped in giving prizes. The State Guernsey Breeders' Associa - tion will award four Guernsey breed record books to the group of high Guernsey bulls. This award will go to the Platte Valley Asso - ciation. The Holstein Breeders' Association will award a true model Holstein bull to the association having the best group of Holstein sires. This award will go to the Saunders-Dodge Association. The State Jersey Breeders' Association will also present a prize to the group highest in Jerseys. This is a banner very nicely decorated and suit - able to be hung* in a county agent's office. This award will go to the Otoe-Cass-Johnson Association. It was thought best to offer a prize for the association that was high in bulls considering .all breeds. This prize is awarded by the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. It is a plaque carrying upon it the state of Nebraska with the counties outlined upon it so it could be engraved each year. This award will go to the Saunders-Dodge Association for the year 1931. However, it must be won three times to become the property of any association. There will be eight bulls awarded to the associations high in various groups of bulls. - These young sires are backed with good production records and also carrying more type than the average bull in the association'. These bulls were donated to the Dairymen's Association by the following: </seg>

We feel that this contest was very sucessful considering the obstacles which it was necessary to overcome. This project will be carried on as long as we have Dairy Herd Improvement Associations in Nebraska. We feel it is just as important to cull the sires as it is the cows and it will give the. breeders a better knowledge of pedi - grees and how to interpret them. It will also give the Extension Service and the college information on the bulls used in the state of Nebraska. We know of no other project used that will do more to raise the production in the average herds than the improvement of sires that are used within the state. </seg>

NIBLER, Assistant Secretary Each year the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association endeavors to encourage better dairying throughout the state by the distribution of exhibit material. This year there were prepared and sent out to county fairs; nine sets of exhibits. Although it was impossible to place exhibit material at all the county fairs, an endeavor was made to have a display at each of the counties in which there is located a Dairy Herd Improvement Association. In addition to exhibit mate - rial having been supplied county fairs, there were a few exhibits furnished some of the creameries in the state. This project has grown from year to year and this year there were twenty-five counties supplied with exhibit material and in ad - dition four creameries were also furnished with some material. Many far western counties were supplied, including Box Butte County, Sheridan County, Scottsbluff County, and also Torrington County of Wyoming. Many eastern, northern, and southern counties were also furnished with exhibits. Each exhibit set consists of four panels, each four feet square. Upon each panel there is expressed by Word or illustration some phase of better dairying. Some phases covered by these panels were market - ing, housing plans, value of Dairy Herd Improvement work, produc - tion of clean milk, and value of dairy products.

            <seg id="p336">ltETORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE There was again viewed by many thousands of people during the state fair the exhibit erected by the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association in the northeast corner of Agricultural Hall. The exhibit was erected this year in the form of a long chain, and each link carried a lesson In better dairying. The first link noticed was the one in which good foundation dairy cattle were emphasized. As one would progress along the chain he would see feeding, breeding, and quality emphasized in each link. After certain phases on production had been covered, certain phases regarding consumption were taken into consideration. The story told on the links of the chain was as follows: "From Production to Consumption There Should Be No Weak Links." In addition to the displaying of this exhibit at the Nebraska State Fair it was also displayed at the Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show when it was viewed by more people than at any previous Ak-Sar-Ben. Probably one individual exhibit which attracted as much atten - tion as any was the butter statue erected annually in .the ice box at the east end of Agricultural Hall. The erection of the statue was sponsored by the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. However, it was made possible through the contributions received from the Bea - trice Creamery Company, the Central Western Creameries Association, the Farmers' Equity Co-Operative Creamery Company, and the Ne-. braska Co-Operative Creamery Association. The butter statue was in the form of a large butter map of Nebraska with the individual counties outlined and their names inserted.- "Nebraska Ranks 4th in Butter Production" was placed upon a large placard over the map. </seg>

            <seg id="p373">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION ANNUAL. KEPOKT NEBRASKA DAIRY DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY 1031 The year 1931 offered the Society more opportunity for definite service than any previous year. We have had more requests for service and have received closer cooperation to insure more definite results. We have had larger attendance at meetings and demonstra - tions and a greater interest. The Society continued its general dairy development program emphasizing dairy calf club work, the use of more good purebred sires, eradication and control of contagious abortion, and building higher producing herds through testing and better feeding, and elim - inating the boarder cows. In all of these various projects we have cooperated with the Agricultural Extension Department, University Dairy Department, and all other agencies engaged in this work. During 1931 Manager O. H. Liebers and Assistant Manager M. N. Lawritson were called upon to address 338 meetings. 212 of these were devoted to encouraging calf club work, and assisting club mem - bers; 30 for the discussion and study of the value of purebred sires, and 97 for general dairy problems. There were 12,367 people in attendance at these meetings. One thousand two hundred eighty-nine farm visits were made; 772 were for the instruction of dairy calf club members and visitors; 188 of them were for the discussion of the value of good- purebred sires and methods of taking care of them; 329 were on general dairy problems. The Society received 4,570 requests for service through the office; 2707 were taken care of by correspondence, 1,092 by telephone, 771 by personal conference. The Society assisted 185 breeders and calf club members in pur - chasing 287 foundation dairy animals; 71 of these animals were pur - chased from 56 Nebraska breeders. All the Holsteins and Jerseys, with the exception of one Jersey bull and three Jersey Club calves, were purchased from Nebraska breeders. .There not being a surplus of foundation Guernsey, Brown Swiss, -and Ayrshire cattle in the state, it was necessary to import them from areas where they have good cattle of these breeds for sale. The cattle purchased included 100 calf club calves, 65 purebred sires and 122 heifers and cows. In </seg>
            <seg id="p374">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE addition to these direct purchases, the Society assisted many Nebraska breeders in selecting additional animals, also was of indirect assistance in disposing of surplus stock. BOYS AND GIRLS DAIRY CALF CLUB WORK The Society again valued the opportunity to cooperate with L. I. Frlsbie, State Club Leader of the Extension Department in furthering dairy club work during the past year. During 1931, 973 boys- and girls were enrolled in 111 dairy calf clubs in Nebraska. This is an increase of 13 clubs and 76 members over 1930. The Society purchased 100 calves for club work. Twenty of these were purchased from Nebraska breeders. Sixty-one of the calves were purebreds and 39 were grades. In selecting club calves, we require that they have good individuality, and are by sires with breeding and type, and out of dams who have proven good producers, having fin - ished, at least, one year's testing with 400 pounds of butterfat, or mature equivalent. 4-H CLUB EXHIBIT AT THE STATE FAIR There were 233 calves exhibited at the 1931 State Fair, an increase of 44 over 1930. This is not only the largest calf club show we have ever had, but decidedly the best, showing Improvement in the general quality and condition of the calves, and training and showmanship of the owners. As in previous years, the three highest winners in each class of the purebred calves were permitted to show in the open state classification on the following day. This qualified 35 club members for competition in the open show. Each year we have been impressed with the increase in both numbers shown and the success of the 4-H Club members when in competition with the breeders. This year the club members were especially successful, winning 1 Grand Championship; 2 Junior Championships; 6 Firsts; 4 Seconds; 7 Thirds; 8 Fourths; and 4 Fifth prizes. Only a few that did not get in the money. Perhaps still more important, was the ability and showmanship displayed by club members in the ring. This success in exhibiting is a splendid and definite demonstration of the good effects of club work on the future of agriculture. In the near future we may look to many ex-club members in each community to be as successful in community affairs and production and marketing problems. </seg>
            <seg id="p375">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION DAIRY CATTLE EXHIBIT AT THE STATE FAIR The Society has been active in encouraging a large and credit - able dairy cattle exhibit at the Nebraska State Fair. The 1931 State Fair was one of the most successful from a Dairy Development standpoint. About a year ago at the suggestion of Pro - fessor H. P. Davis, the State Fair Board put into effect a ruling requiring a production record of 400 pounds butterfat mature equiva - lent for all Dairy Cattle exhibited. Many doubted the wisdom of this drastic requirement, feeling it would result in a smaller exhibit. The Nebraska breeders, however, expressed their appreciation of com - bining type and production as a State Fair standard by bringing their best and making it the largest exhibit we have had in a number of years. The quality was considered up to standard. Number exhibited and average production of each breed: Breed Number Ave. Production Holsteln _ 124 625 lbs. Butterfat Guernsey ...: 104 545 lbs. Butterfat Jersey 82 499 lbs. Butterfat Ayrshire _ _ 43 460 lbs. Butterfat NEBRASKA AT THE NATIONAL/ DAIRY SHOW This was truly a Nebraska- year. The accomplishments will be hard to duplicate. Our fifteen club boys and their 17 dairy animals gained national recognition for Nebraska at the 1931 National Dairy Show. Every Nebraska club entry was placed in the money, only two below 5th place. The three club animals entered in the open classes of the National Dairy Show all placed in the money, and Cleo Hoy's Guern - sey, Ruth Mary Rose of Mills Center, won first. Junior Championship, and finally was declared the Grand Champion female of the 1931 National Dairy Show. The first time in the history of the National Dairy Show that a championship was awarded to a club member, and the first time that a Grand Championship was awarded to a Junior animal. It was also the first time Nebraska has ever won a first or championship at a National Dairy Show. It was the third year that Nebraska exhibited 4-H Club dairy cattle at the National Dairy Show. In both of the two previous years, we were successful in winning our share of premiums, and in each case the premiums were sufliclent to pay the expenses of the exhibit. The 4-H Club Show at the 1931 National Dairy Show was con - sidered the strongest ever assembled. There were 230 entries from 13 states, and it was generally conceded that not only were the cattle of higher quality, but they were better fitted, and more efficient show - manship was displayed by their owners. </seg>

            <seg id="p377"/>
            <seg id="p378">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Nebraska's 4-H Club entries consisted of 17 head: 7 Guernseys, 5 Ayrshires, and 5 Brown Swiss. Each state is allowed to exhibit in each breed a group of five animals, and in the classes — 2 in the calf class, 2 in the yearling class, and 2 in the two-year-old and over. Nebraska exhibited three state groups — Guernseys, Brown Swiss, and. Ayrshires. In the individual classes we won 1 first, 4 seconds, 4 thirds, 1 fourth, 1 fifth, 1 sixth, and 1 eighth. In the groups against very strong competition, Nebraska won first on Guernseys, second on Brown Swiss, and fourth on Ayrshires. The group show is the honor all states covet highest, and which brings out the best five animals in each breed. Selections are made on both individuality and uniformity of the group. The total cash premiums of the Nebraska club exhibit amounted to $599.00, being the highest by a wide margin of winnings per aniinal shown of any state competing. Nebraska is fortunate in having many of its leading business and professional men actively interested in her 4-H Club work. The expenses of transportation and travel of the club members to the National Show at St. Louis were again met by a group of Omaha and Lincoln business men and the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce, supplementing the money prize awards gained by the boys at the show. We hope that at the 1932 National Dairy Show, Nebraska will again be represented with a strong 4-H Club dairy cattle exhibit, and that it will include representatives of all five breeds of dairy cattle. In addition, Nebraska club members also made a splendid show - ing in the showmanship contest, cattle judging, and dairy demon - strations. In the showmanship contest with 230 entries, three Ne - braska boys — Harry Liebers, Lawrence Liebers, and Richard Johnson won third, fourth, and seventh places respectively. The Judging Team representing Nebraska's 4-H Club consisted of three boys from Saline County, Albert Hengen, Leonard Rahl, and George Nave. In competition with 24 teams from that many states, these boys won 4th place. They placed first in judging Guernseys, third In Holsteins, ninth in Ayrshires, and twelfth in Jerseys. The Club Demonstration team consisted of Arrol Wasson and Roy Equal, two boys from Wilcox, winning fifth place on their Safety Bull Pen Demonstration, in competition with 24 other teams. DAIRY HERD IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS During the year 1931 there were 29 Dairy Herd Improvement Associations operating in 63 counties of the state with 639 members testing 10,051 cows. Of this number 902 or 8.9 per cent were culled out as unprofitable producers. </seg>
            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION PUREBRED SIRE CONTEST The purebred Sire Contest Inaugurated this year by the Dairy Extension Department of the College of Agriculture and the Nebraska Dairy Development Society cooperating to eliminate the grade bulls from the herds of Dairy Herd Improvement Association members. Seven grade bulls were replaced by high class purebred dairy bulls. Thirty meetings with a total attendance of 686 and 188 farm visits were made in the interest of this project. During the coming year we hope to replace all grade bulls in Dairy Improvement Association herds with good purebred bulls. In connection with this contest, demonstration meetings on the construction of a "Safe-Keep" bull pen for the -safe keeping and handling of dairy bulls were held. The object of this project is to encourage and provide a means of keeping in service as long as pos - sible, dairy bulls that have proven their ability to transmit increased production and desirable type to their offspring rather than disposing of them because they have become too vicious and unruly to keep and handle with safety. SIRE PURCHASES During 1931, the Society rendered assistance in the selection and purchasing of 65 purebred bulls- for Nebraska breeders. In each case utmost care was exercised in securing bulls of good type with satisfactory breeding and production records back of them. The cost of these bulls ranged from ?50.00 to 11,000.00 with an average of J169.00. The production records of the dams of these bulls average mature equivalent 675 pounds of butterfat in a year. Fifty of the bulls, including 28 Holsteins, 16 Guernseys, and 6 Jerseys, were purchased from Nebraska breeders. The remainder 15, including 9 Guernseys, 4 Brown Swiss, 1 Jersey, and 1 Ayrshire all purchased in Wisconsin, except 6 of the Guernseys and 1 Ayrshire that were purchased in New York. CONTROLLING DISEASE The Society has always taken an active interest in the prevention and eradication of tuberculosis and contagious abortion, cooperating closely with Dr. VanEs of the Animal Pathology Department, and our State Bureau of Animal Industry. There has never been a time when Nebraska's Dairy Industry has been faced with as serious a disease menace as it is today -with contagious abortion. This disease results annually in a large loss to our dairymen, not only from the loss in production of milk and butter - fat, but also In the value of the calves lost and the breeding troubles that follow. </seg>
            <seg id="p380">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE More of our herds should be blood tested and all positive reactors either removed from the herd or isolated so that there will be no further spread of the disease,- and that they ultimately may become accredited as free from abortion. Greater care should be exercised in the introduction of additional cattle purchased, either privately or at public sales. A blood test should be required in every instance. Approximately 80 per cent of the dairy cattle-buying states have laws requiring all cattle imported into their states must pass a nega - tive blood test showing that they are free from contagious abortion. Nebraska is one of the few importing states that does not have such requirements, and as a result will become the dumping ground of positive or abortion infected cattle from the exporting dairy states, unless drastic measures are taken. The blood test requirements have resulted in finding many positive cattle in the exporting states which can only be sold to the stock yards for slaughter, or as breeding and dairy cattle to a few states like Nebraska that do not have adequate regulations. Anyone desiring to import, dairy cattle can buy them on a blood test. We have required a blood test on ajl cattle imported the past three years, and have experienced no difficulty. This involved the purchase of 591 head from several hundred breeders. Fifty-five of the 591 were found positive, and of course, were not brought to Nebraska. Approximately 10 per cent were positive, which Is rather high when considering that 60 per cent of the purchases were calves and heifers under breeding age, and the balance were practically all bred heifers under two years of age. In buying older cattle a much higher percentage of positive reactors may be expected. The Society embraces every opportunity to cooperate with fieldmen of the National Dairy Breeders Associations in furthering their breed activities and the splendid dairy programs they are promoting in this state, to work with, the dairy specialists in herd testing, and with the manufacturers and distributors of dairy products on their problems. </seg>

Rumbaugh, bass, who sang: Down to the Sea in Ships — Seabury. When the Bell in the Lighthouse Rings Ding Dong — Solman. The Mighty Deep — Jude. Captain Mac — Sanderson. This is the twenty-seventh time that this section of Organized Agriculture has been meeting. Twenty-seven years is a long time, and I wonder if we could think back twenty-seven years, what would come into our minds. I think it is a fine thing when we think of those women who first met here with their husbands for they felt that there should be something for them as well as for the husbands. Mrs. Whltmore was one of the first presidents and so thru the years we have had different presidents, such as Mrs. Gramlich, Mrs. Hudson, Mrs. Burr, Mrs. C. B. Noyes, and now we have Mrs. E. P. Noyes. Mrs. Noyes is the mother of five children, two children married, one daughter Clara, Is home extension agent in Douglas County, and Helen is in 4-H club work in the Extension Service, and one son is senior in the College of Agriculture. I am sure that a woman who has given so much, and has such fine children has a real message for us, so we are all glad to hear our president's greetings, this morning. Greetings — Mrs. Noyes: Twenty-seven years ago a small group of homemakers met to gether for the first session of the Home Economics section of Or - ganized Agriculture. Today we have come for the twenty-seventh annual program and I am very happy to extend greetings and a wel - come to so large a number. If I should ask, has this organization made progress, you would only need to look about this large well filled room for the answer, for from that small beginning it has grown to an enrollment of sev - eral hundred. Why this growth in a quarter of a century? Has time alone been the cause, or are there other factors which have haa a . part -in it, and If ho, what are they? Motor cars, good roads, and the radio have had a part most surely. We hear the programs of Or - ganized Agriculture announced over the radio and it gives us an urge to go and listen to the entertainment, the inspiring lectures and discussions, and to meet again the friends we make from year to year. Automobiles and good roads make traveling easier and in less time with less expenses. The development of the Agricultural Department through the Extension Service has been another successful means of Interesting </seg>
            <seg id="p388">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE people in the meetings of Organized Agriculture. And homemakers are desiring better living conditions for their families and showing increased interest in improved ways of performing household tasks. The Country Life Conference for 1930 reports large attendance figures at Farmers' Week lectures in colleges of agriculture the coun - try over, and that people who attend are concerned as much in topics that tell how to live as with topics concerned with making a living. This evidently means that people are interested in better living and improved human relationships. How much we would like to look in on that small group of home - makers at their first meeting and see what sort of program they had. Did it cover a period of three days as we have now, and what sub - jects were discussed? Did they have something for entertainment as well as something educational? I cannot say, but I am very sure that their program was worthwhile, and that it was on the broad subject of homemaklng for this organization could not have become what it is today if those earnest women had not started it out with worthwhile ideals. We have all noticed how good and worthwhile things live on and on and on, while things of a lighter vein are pop - ular only for a season and are then so often forgotten. Have the programs throughout these years progressed as much as we have pro - gressed in attendance? Yes, I think perhaps they have. For now each year we have speakers from distant states and how much we enjoy knowing them as well as hearing their helpful messages. Who of us was not glad to hear and to know Mary Swartz Rose of Columbia University who was on our program last year, and Dr. Caroline Hedger of Chicago who was with us a few years ago, and many others who have been brought to us in these annual meetings. On our program we shall find University and College of Agri - culture instructors. This gives us an opportunity to meet them and to visit some of their class rooms and laboratories to see exhibits and demonstrations. The music on our program also, is in charge of one of the University instructors. Surely we appreciate the time and ef - fort of these people who have a place on our program as we also appreciate the speakers who come from a distance. The year just past has been a very trying one. Drought, grass - hoppers, and low prices have given us all a hard struggle, but lei us not forget the hardships of the pioneers. This is a wonderful age in which we live, and let us keep in mind that we today are enjoying the Ideals the pioneers struggled for, and that -we owe much to them who endured the hardships and overcame the difficulties to establish their family hearthstones. Surely they had a harder time than we. "Where pioneers once led the way, now lives a people blest." In a recent magazine, a grandmother tells us times were harder sixty odd years ago than we know anything about today. She relates the following: "In the evening, Father would gather his family arouna </seg>
            <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION him and say, 'Let us pray.' And when we had had a short session of communion with God through which we gained new strength and courage, Mother would say, 'Let us play.' Then would follow an hour of such active games as blindman's'bur? and puss wants the corner, and later quieter games would follow. Sometimes other families joined us in the evening and played our games with us. So, praying and playing, we got a spiritual and mental refreshment that made the trials ot the morrow seem much easier to face." "Seems like to me," says grandmother out of her sound wisdom and rich experience, "that this generation of today might get something of value out of praying and playing, just as we did so many years ago." A story is told of a traveler in the southern mountains who lost his way. As he journeyed on, he came to a hut beside a creek and an old man sitting by the door, of whom he asked the way. The old man told him to "just go on" until he came to a road that was a bright road. The lost traveler did go on following the directions given and finally came out on the bright road. . We may feel that we have been traveling a dim road but we must "just go on" living and work - ing with faith and hope and courage until we come to the bright road of prosperity. "Never — once — since the world began Has the sun ever once stopped shining His face very often we could not see. And we grumbled at his inconstancy; But the clouds were really to blame, not he. For behind them, he was shining. And so — behind life's darkest clouds, God's love is ever shining, We veil it at times with our faithless fears, And darken our sight with our foolish tears, But in time the atmosphere always clears. For His love is always shining." As we return to our homes, let us take the finest and best of Organized Agriculture programs with us weaving i.t into the family life around our firesides. Let us start the new year with a spirit of gratitude, and how fine it would be if that spirit could abide with us throughout the year. May the year 1932 be a bright and pros - perous year for us all. In closing, I want to express appreciation for every kindness and courtesy shown to me during this time I have served as your pre - siding officer. I feel that you have been my friends, and I want to be your friend and it is my wish that this friendship may continue. </seg>
            <seg id="p390">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE NEWER HEALTH TESTS FOB CHILDREN By MINNA C. DENTON It would be quite superfluous for me to attempt to put over any health-selling drive before this audience. I need not remind you of government statistics to prove that the great wealth, even the great material wealth of this country is not, after all, in its wheat iields and its cattle ranches, its coal mines and Its factories and their products, but in its man power. I need not quote for you the huge total annual losses in man power which we suffer from the sick - nesses and premature deaths of our workers — figures that run up well into the billions, before which all the fees paid to all the doctors each year, present a relatively insignificant sum. All this loss from sickness is not merely personal hard luck for the one who is ill. It is also hard luck for the rest of us who must, directly or indirectly, help to support these invalid workers and their dependents, who cannot support themselves. The burden of these incapacitated workers Is a burden upon other workers, upon consumers, upon tax payers, upon capitalists, upon the medical profession itself; for the sick can pro - duce nothing useful and buy nothing that others produce, cannot even pay the doctors who minister to their sickness. There is indeed no question but what you and I and all the rest of "the masses" want health, and are willing to pay for it, just as much as we can possibly afford. Indeed, we do pay; but as' Mr. Ed - ward Filene remarks, usually we pay not for what we want, but for what we most decidedly do not want; that is, we pay not for health but for sickness. Instead of buying a year-round health service, we do not call the doctor until we must. We run our bodily machines as some people run their automobiles; we wait until they break down before we give them any special thought or care. Of course, we all know that this is very poor business, for in, our hearts we all believe In preventive medicine rather than in curative or emergency treatment. The trouble is, as. Mr. Filene so aptly points out, that the med - ical profession, or the health business, is not organized along the modern lines of mass production; it is not able to emulate the auto - mobile and other huge business organizations which give to the masses, the greatest possible service at the lowest possible price. The medical profession lingers in the individual handicraftsman stage in - stead of adopting modern factory methods, which would organize all the health producing forces of the community into a health conser - vation service. Low cost preventive medicine will doubtless always be group medicine. The group must include not only doctors and dent - ists and nurses and boards of health and sanitary inspectors, it must also include teachers of all varieties, especially those parents who have been properly fitted to do their part in preventing sickness before it is too late, that is In preventing most of the sickness in the youngest age groups of our population. </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION What organization we do have for preventive medicine, naturally made Its beginnings in the cities, where the dangers of group infec - tions seemed most obvious. The country should be a healthier place in which to live and bring up children than Is the city; but as the city progresses In preventive medicine measures, we begin to wonder how long this will be true. More than ten years ago. Dr. Wood ot Columbia University surprised us by quoting results of a survey or 500,000 children which showed, or so he thought, that the city child has 5 times the chance of the rural child, to reach maturity, for its diseased teeth, tonsils, adenoids, eyes, ear, mal-nutrition and other defects are. looked after by the city community, In school and else - where. This statement aroused a storm of opposition as being too extreme, yet most of the available statistics tend more or less to con - firm it.. Miss Abbott, Chief of the Children's Bureau, presented these figures before the 1931 Country Life Conference. • In 1915. the rural infant death rate for this country was 94 deaths per 1,000 live births while the urban was 103, that is about 10% higher. In 1928 the rural rate was 68, the urban 69; that is the country and the city now average about the same, so far as our 1 registration area is con - cerned. But there are already 14 of our states in which the rural •infant death rate' is higher than the urban; tho Nebraska is not one of these. In general, there can be little doubt that the effects of superior facilities for health education and for preventive medicine in general, are shown in the more rapid health Improvement of city as contrasted with country children. Apart from quarantine, sanitation and other measures for stop - ping the spread of infection, preventive medicine must concern itself with maintaining the health and resistance of the individual. It seeks to conserve those qualities which enable him to fight and overcome infection and ill health. As one doctor sagely remarks, "It is just as important to know what kind of a patient has the disease, as to know what kind of a disease the patient has." And still more im - portant, one would think, to know what kind of person may be relied upon not to get the disease at all, because his various resistance factors like Vitamin A, are so high that "germs can't get their claws into him" as the little girl said. In this country preventive medicine has concerned Itself chiefly with the health maintenance of these three groups: First, the infant under one year of age, or the group whose mortality rates have al - ways been excessively high. Secondly the school child — partly be - cause he is so easy to get at, And now more recently with a third group, the pre-school children, sometimes designated as the child at the neglected age or at the dangerous age — 1. e., the child between 1 and 6 years old. This is the age during which those physical de - fects and those character defects which may result In failure at school and throughout life, become fixed, unless recognized and cured in time. This pre-school child should be looked over and treated for </seg>
            <seg id="p392">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE these defects — the majority of children have, some defects — If he Is to have an equal chance of success with the best of his school mates and life competitors. The periodic health examination is Indeed the cornerstone of pre - ventive medicine, whatever age group may be concerned. How shall we know how much gas, oil, water, air, or battery strength we have if we never look at a gauge? Look before you run out of gas is as good a rule in health matters as automobile, mechanics. Parent teacher association suminer-rouhd-ups for pre-school children "Is your child ready to enter school?" began with the interest an eastern tender - foot took in the careful health examination which the cowboys gave the calves at branding time. Healthy babies must be worth even more to the community than healthy calves, she thought. But where should we look at the baby's body and* what should we look for? Health examinations for children are gradually shaping them - selves along five or six different lines. 1. The anthropomelric, that is to say height and weight meas - urements. Gradually, however, we are coming to realize that in the past, we may often have misinterpreted weight measurements. It is, of course, an ominous sign to have a young child stop growing or increasing in weight, particularly so if the weight arrest is continued for a number of weeks. But we have perhaps been too zealous at times in comparing the weight of each child with "the average for that child's age and height — like old Procrustes who trimmed or stretched all his luckless guests till they should fit his bed. In the first place, how do we know that the "average" weight found among all kinds of children, well or poorly nourished, is the best weight which the child could have? In the second place, should we expect the race horse type of child, with his slender bones and body, to fit into the same pattern with his more sturdy, large-boned comrade? In the third place, investigators claim that at least one-third of the mal-nourished are not below average weight. In . the fourth place, we have been too easily satisfied in recording the child's weight at, let us say 80 lbs. when we observed that the magic "average" for his age and height lies close to that same figure. Eighty pounds of what? How much of the 80 pounds is bone, how much is due to development of heart and lungs and important vital organs, how much is muscle, how much is fat — or how much is just water? Doubtless we shall before many years, discover better methods of taking body measurements. These will take account of size and shape of chest and its expansion; length of the body trunk which includes the vital organs, rather than of the whole body including the legs — why should the long-legged youngster be unduly penalized as under weight? Girth of arm or calf muscles may have to be considered, and thickness of fat as measured when a fold of skin Is pinched between the fingers. Meantime it is still of importance to measure the child's weight and height and determine whether he is growing or not; but his weight </seg>
            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION may more fairly be compared with his former weight, than with some one of the many conventional standards that have been pre - pared. Or if it must be compared with a standard, allowance should be made for results of other nutritional tests before deciding upon underweight or overweight diagnosis. 2. Closely associated, then with the anthropometric tests of the child's body comes what might be called the orthopedic examination or the posture clinic, i. e., the careful study of his shape and posture. Good health habits, like good manners, should be worn easily, should soon become automatic. It is surprising to what an extent posture reveals health conditions in two important respects. First, it may betray poor emotional adjustment in the child's life, as when the child who is nagged shrinks and slouches. Or on the other hand, easy graceful posture may picture self-control and poise, that healthy mindedness, that "glorious mean between the extremes of fear and fool hardiness, that equanimity which meets and solves the difficulties of life," — to quote Dr. Burdick. Secondly, posture often betrays the weakness of malnutrition, the lack of strength to hold up the pur - poses of even a gallant spirit. For these two reasons, round shoulders and angel-wing shoulder blades, caved in chests and pot bellies, sway backs and flat feet, become deeply significant signs. We who have tried it, know that nagging accomplishes little; "Sit up straight. Tommy!" doesn't last long and soon becomes a bore both to admon - ished and admonisher. Modern "corrective exercises" begin with the very young child and take the form of "playing circus" or other games which call for "walking tall' strengthening sagging abdominal muscles and stretching the tight posterior muscles responsible for sway back curves. Dr. Richardson's recent book "Pre-school child and his posture" tells us exactly how to manage these games. 3. The health examination always includes general observations as to appearance of good nutrition. What is the color of the child's cheeks; or if the blood vessels in the skin of the cheeks are too well covered to show the pink glow of health, what is the color of the lips, the lobes of the ear, the mucous membranes of the eyelid? If these seem too pale, the red blood corpuscles may be counted or their color tested. Are the eyes bright, }s the expression of the face alert or weary? Is the skin smooth, are the muscles firm or flabby to the touch? Perhaps your examiner may even use what he calls "per - formance tests" to see if the muscular strength is up to normal, as when he tests the strength of the hand grip against a strong spring, the chest expansion, or the pull of the arms. 4. The health examination always makes a search for physical defects, and perhaps the most prominent single item in this respect is the dental examination. We have all heard of Sir William Osier as one of our greatest classical authorities in medicine and one who has often set forth the deplorable defects of alcohol as a narcotir poison, yet he once said that if you should ask. him which has caused </seg>
            <seg id="p394">j REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE n.... . . _ . ■ , : :.. .i the greater amount of deterioration in the human race, use of alco - holic liquors or defective teeth, he would be forced to admit that bad teeth have distilled an even more potent poison. Industrial hygiene as well as school hygiene figures point out to us the relatively high percentages of neuralgia, neuritis, colds, boils, abscesses, albuminuria (an indication of serious kidney disease) in those workers who have decayed teeth or inflamed gums. Rheumatism, arthritis, heart trouble, high blood pressure are sometimes associated with unsound teeth, as doubtless each of us here present has often heard. Yet decay of the teeth is perhaps the most widespread disease of civilized nations, and sometimes it seems as though the higher the degree of civilization, the worse the teeth. Even our little children have it. Most examinations of school children if made by competent authorities, show that from 65 to dS r / r of the children at any age have decayed teeth and perhaps inflamed gums also. Which of us in this adult audience could stand up, in response to a call for perfect teeth and gums, no toothache, no cavities to fill, no teeth pulled? Possibly there may be one or two, but I doubt it. As for Nebraska school children, what records are available in the year 1030-1931, seem to show that about half of them have defective teeth. But these inspections were made mostly by the teachers, there being no den - tists available for the purpose in the majority of the schools; conse - quently we cannot compare these findings with those coming from trained examiners. Our diet is blamed for this deplorable condition. Primitive' peo - ple or those living on simpler fare often have perfect teeth, even though they do not use toothbrushes or employ dentists. The Amer - ican Indian and the far north Eskimos in their primitive state, are good illustrations of this fact. The Sioux Indians thought it was the lies issuing from the white man's lips that made his teeth so poor. Those Scandinavian and Italian peoples who live on relatively coarse fare, put us to shame with their almost perfect teeth until they come over here and begin to live on American diets, then their teeth speed - ily bcome as poor as ours. Is it their black bread and coarse vege - tables, their comparative lack of sweets and rich foods, the extra exercise that their jaws receive and the improved circulation, which makes their teeth superior? Perhaps so; at any rate we find that plenty of milk with its tooth building lime salts, plenty of vitamins to supervise the building process, and a reasonable amount of hard food to exercise the jaws, together with a minimum of candy and concentrated soft food such as rich desserts, does help get us out of this deplorable nutritional disease we have somehow brought upon our - selves. If only we practiced all we know about diet! As Dr. Brenne - man says, "The average mother of today knows about the essentials of an adequate diet as expressed in terms of food elements, foodstuffs, vitamins, iodine content and calories, than did the best informed physician of two decades ago." Of course we have all been taught </seg>
            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION that the child's milk teeth cannot be neglected, since decay of the milk set so often favors or initiates decay in the permanent teeth. The little child, like the school child, needs to have his teeth Inspected and kept in good shape. And his first permanent tooth, his school entrance molar or six-year molar, is of especial importance as the keystone of the whole dental arch, which determines largely the cor - rect spacing of the other permanent teeth. A lost tooth is a lost friend, particularly to the six year old child. 5. Decayed teeth, important as they are, are not the only defects common among school children and their elders. Diseased tonsils, adenoids, defective sight and hearing, indigestion, constipation, are prominent among the commonest of the physical defects which pre - vent a child's success in school and in after life. Yet three-fourths of our school children, like three-fourths of the men enlisting for the U, S. Army in times of peace, have one or more physical defects. Now the child who can't see the board or who ran't hear all the teacher says, often gets the undeserved reputation of being a slow child or a dull child. As for teaching a sick child anything, it can't be done. One supervisor of rural schools in a state not far from here, figures that 15 r / r of the elimination of pupils from the school, 16% of the non-promotion and retardation and 24% of the absences are caused by physical defects and ill health. More recent studies put some of the percentages much higher. As for happiness and ill health — when have they ever kept company? Don't send your child to school with a handicap. 6. Another form of examination sometimes quite important for the school child, is that for his mental powers. What is his true mental age; that is, does he at six years old know what may reason - ably be expected of a six year old? The connection between these tests and the health of the child is not clear, except as ill health may contribute to low mental age and low intelligence quotient. 7. Still another sort of test belonging to the field of mental hygiene has a much more intimate connection with physical health. These are the personality analyses, the studies of character traits, by trained psychiatrists who can really help us not only with the problem children, the bad boys and defiant daughters, but with the treatment of undesirable traits in our normal children at those times when we are most discouraged. The connection between a well balanced emo - tional or spiritual life, and maintenance of good physical health, is undoubtedly very close, but it is only a very wise and wisely trained outsider who can come into the circle with parent and child in these matters, in such a way as to confer lasting benefit upon either. Since the child's character traits and emotional responses are pretty well established by the time he starts in school, it is during his very tender years— the earlier the better — that expert counsel would be of most service to parents. </seg>
            <seg id="p396">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Preventive medicine for our children, then, begins with the "Well Child Clinic" which 1b little more than a name for the meeting of the child with the four or five persons most interested in his health; his parents, the doctor, dentist and nurse or other specialist, who look him over somewhat as described above, to ascertain what are his chances in life and how they may be improved. As has already been stated, most parents are not able to afford preventive medicine either for themselves or their children. To have low cost preventive medicine we must utilize mass production methods, i. e., we must have group medicine organized on the proper basis. In rural regions, these clinics or health examinations and their follow-up work call for the integra - tion of all the health producing forces in the county into a true health conservation service. This can hardly be done, except there be a non- • political county organization in the hands of a trained and competent personnel. Such personnel includes the doctor who acts as health director, the dentist or other specialists if he should be able to employ these, and the public health nurse who helps to execute the campaign the doctor has initiated. The Children's Bureau reports that 400 rural counties in these United States have initiated a prenatal and child health service, about 300 counties have child health without prenatal service. In fact there are over 1,500 such health centers for children, most of them in the crowded cities of the eastern and northern states. Leaders in the movement for rural county health units are the State of Delaware, which has all its counties organized; New York, Pennsylvania, certain of the south-eastern states such aa Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi. Notable examples are the health demonstrations organized by the commonwealth fund almost ten years ago, in Mansfield Co.. Ohio, in' Fargo, N. D., in Marion Co.. Oregon, and in Clarke Co., Georgia. Cattaraugus Co., New York, and Rutherford Co., Tennessee, are among present day leaders. Where does Nebraska stand in this health movement? Do you know who are the officers of your county health board? Do you know whether they are doctors or are they candidates elected for their pol - itical qualifications rather than for their medical knowledge?* Do you know; whether Nebraska is one of the 36 states having a state law enabling a non-political county health unit organization — if there should be one — to receive and control the spending of funds appro - priated for health purposes by the county commissioners? The ans - wers to these questions do not -encourage us to be proud- of the past record of bur state, but should incite us to consider what immediate action might be taken. Here is a bit of past history which may be of interest. Preventive medicine for the infant begins of course before he is born. A recent cartoon shows two rebellious adolescents with their heads together. "If we could only have got hold of our parents * By Nebraska law. the president of the county board of health is the sheriff and the secretary Is the county superintendent of schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p397">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION younger, we could have done a lot more with them." Most true, oh callow and sweet sixteen. And accordingly, we had the Sheppard- Towner federal grants for maternity and infancy care, which are avail - able to all states for seven years. Funds from this source were used in our state during that period. But when the Sheppard-Towner fed - eral funds were no longer available, 28 of our 48 states appropriated increased funds from the state treasury, to carry on the work begun with federal assistance: Nebraska, however, far from being one of the 28, actually decreased her appropriation. There are now 6 counties that employ full time public health nurses with the assistance of Red Cross funds — Antelope, Furnas, Holt, Pawnee, York, and Lancaster. How nearly they approach the desirable standard — one public health nurse -to each 2,000 of popula - tion, you can perhaps judge for yourselves. There are five other counties which employ a nurse for 2, 3 or 4 months of the year, often in connection with the opening of the schools; these are Burt, Frontier, Lincoln, Garden and Rock counties. Four or five Nebraska cities such as Lincoln, Hastings, Seward and Kearney have the services of a public health nurse or two. Professional and volunteer organiza - tions with civic minded programs have done something for preventive medicine in Nebraska. Among these are the State Dental Association, whose efforts have given Nebraska a most enviable reputation In the state follow-up reports made as a result of the White House Con - ference; the Parent-Teachers Association and some of the county Fair Boards, responsible tor iZ summer-round-ups of pre-school chil - dren in 1931, at which health examinations were made before school entrance.; the Junior League, supporting Well Baby Clinics, as in Lin - coln; Klwanis, Rotary, doubtless many others whose sporadic efforts may help prepare the way for permanent or long-time health programs. The State of Nebraska would seem to be a healthful place in which to live; its general death rate is something like 20% lower than for the whole United States, and its infant death rate compares very favorably with that of most states, tho Washington and Oregon have infant death rates about 15Cr lower than ours. But our maternal death rate is somewhat higher than the average for the whole coun - try, which itself is much higher than that in several European and other civilized countries. Rural Nebraska compares well with urban Nebraska so far as infant and general death rates are concerned. The national health champion for 1931 from among the girls 4-H clubs of the country, was a Nebraska girl. Two years ago, the winner of the $100 prize from the National Dairy Council in a nation-wide contest for the best and most successfully executed county health pro - gram was Douglas county of Nebraska, under the direction of Miss Clara Noyes. Thus it seems that we have much to be proud of, as a result of the efforts of individuals or of individual communities. How long before we can organize so as to extend to all rural Nebraska children these same benefits already attained by the few? </seg>
            <seg id="p398">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARDOF AGRICULTURE The entire group then divided into sections for the Round Table discussions. In the round table on House Furnishings, Miss Metzger 8aid,i"The two things we are trying to get are beauty and comfort. We should keep these in mind when working on our arrangements." First, you should look at each wall; check it and see what is wrong. Try to make it better. There are three things to do: (1) Eliminate those things which are not beautiful or good looking. (2) Make the objects appear at their best, that is. place them where they belong. (3) Conceal or cover up those things which are. poor. You may not like this arrangement at first but if you know it is correct, leave it there for a time and then change it to the old way. You'll find you like the new way much better. Klimination : If an object is used merely for decoration, you should be very critical about it. Those only for decoration should be much more beautiful. A chair may be ugly and be very com - fortable. It lends atmosphere to the room. lie-arrangement: Things should be placed squarely. There should be order and harmony and a feeling of balance.. Things should be toward the center of the room to give balance. Between the large pieces of furniture, there should be spaces and all the objects should be placed parallel. Openings should be on a structural axis but all houses are not built in this way so we must make them as nearly like this as pos - sible. Pull the big pieces of furniture out of the corners. Pictures should be hung low enough so that you can look into them. They should fit the space they are hung in and if more than one picture is hung together, they should be similar in subject. Concealment: Large windows can be concealed by heavy drapes arranged at each side. Tall narrow windows can be made to appear wider by hanging drapes on the outside and tying them quite low. A valance may be put over the top of the window which changes the height. Values should be somewhat the same; no outstanding lights or darks. There should not be white spots as covers on tables, etc. Very dark spots are not good. Slip-covers can be used to advantage. Clear colors with small designs as diamonds are much better than floral patterns unless you do not have floral patterns elsewhere. Ecru doilies are better than white ones and can be made so by dipping them in coffee. We should learn to appreciate the things around our. home and make them interesting. Look at room arrangement in good maga - zines and instead of wishing you had the things pictured, compare them with the things you do have and imagine the things you have arranged similar to those in the pictures. Living room, dining room, and bedroom panels were shown. Dif - ferent arrangements drawn by students were shown and a number of different articles very good in art but low in price. </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION A library table arrangement was given by Miss Metzger. She placed several different covers on the table and asked which looked better and why r - / They were placed so as to give the best spacing. A table Is used for placing a lamp or for use as a table. Questions asked: Would it be possible to arrange book ends any other way? Wouldn't it be hard to get book's out from behind the lamp? Are book ends ever set catty-corner? What would you do If you had four children to get their lessons on the table? . CHOOSING AND USING XJTENSIU5 AND TOOIiS Round Table, By MISS EDIT^H CARSE We get so we take our equipment for granted and as we work with it we make some very definite likes and dislikes. Things women like they choose first and so we are interested in knowing what you would like to work with. Several weeks ago Miss Smith gave me summaries of some testing circles. The Extension Service gets some local dealers to give certain pieces of equipment. The women form groups of about 12. They take home a different piece of equipment and use it for a week. At the end of the week they write a brief summary of the equipment. The next week they meet and each one takes a different piece of equipment. These summaries were inter - esting toine. Either the women liked the pieces very much or else they didSiot like them at all. This is the order in which the equip - ment was listed according to popularity. The first one and the one which had the least points against it was the long handled dust pan. Comments on this piece of equip - ment were as follows: Dust pan fits the floor, easy to use, can't tip, handle stands erect when not supported. Second in popularity was the waterless cooker. One objection to it was that it was slightly too small for the family. Some women use their waterless cooker every day. They appreciated the fact that they did not need to watch it. They appreciated the fact that they could cook several dishes at the same time over the same flame. Comment. . We had quite an experience in our county, two chil - dren died from eating chicken cooked in a waterless cooker. The chicken had been cooked and allowed to cool without taking oft the lid. Answer. The most recent research we have Indicates that no poisoning can be caused by cooking foods in aluminum pans. You could eat food which has been cooked in aluminum every day for twenty years and suffer no ill effects. </seg>
            <seg id="p400">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Third In popularity was the bread knife. The women were al - most unanimous in saying that they needed a knife for bread and cake. It was very desirable and almost essential. It saves time, is stainless, makes no crumbs, and is well made. S Fourth in rank of popularity was the soap shaker to be used at dish washing time. I was just a little surprised at this. I thought that soap flakes were being used. It, however, is an economical way to use left over soap. Comment. I have a soap shaker but switched back to Chipso. Comment. I have been married 20 years and in that time I do not think I have bought over $5.00 worth of soap, as I make my own soap. Next in order was the dish drainer. This piece was considered good enough to be included in a list of ideal equipment. Sometimes the use of a; dish drainer calls for a change in methods of dish washing. One woman did not like the dish drainer because the dishes were ; streaked when dry. Suggestions of overcoming this would be, if the dishes can be put thru a large pan ot hot water they would cpme out looking shiny and bright. Next one was the spatula. Comment. I think we are beginning to think more and more before we buy kitchen equipment and consider whether it will be useful and practical. Miss Smith. In my equipment studies I take a variety of sug - gestions because I find what one lady likes the other does not. Miss Carse. It is very possible that women have bought some - thing they wanted to use around the house and then have not used the equipment as successfully as they had hoped. It would have been better if an investment had been made in something they really needed. Some difficult experience such as this has probably made them stop and think. Comment. I would not know how to keep house without the dutch oven. Miss Carse. Do any of the rest of you have things which you especially like? Comment. Mine is a roaster. It is of a Father .large size, oblong, of cast aluminum and never scorches. I use it for meat and vege - tables. Miss Carse. There is now on the market kettles with black bottoms. The black surface absorbs heat quickly and a bright shiny surface tends to reflect the heat which means that it will take this kind of pan longer to get started. Miss Smith. Is there any suggestions as to where we can pur - chase something whereby one can blacken one's pans and not depend on soot? </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Answer. Yes, If you go to a paint store and tell them what you want they may be able to get you some material called gyptol made by the G. E. people. Question. Did you have a discussion of enamel versus the alum - inum ware before I came in? Answer. No. Most people, it seems to me, like to have one or two kettles which are enamel. Some people feel better about letting food stand in it. I believe the general tendency is to use as much aluminum as possible for cooking utensils, for it is more durable If you get a good quality. Enamel pans chip very quickly. Better quality pans are fairly satisfactory, it seems to me. Of the different aluminum pans here, that particular one has been used a lot. It has been used in the preparation of every meal. Question. Does it stay nice and shiny like that always? My aluminum gets so dark on the inside. Answer. It is just possible that your water is harder. Question, i As I live in Lincoln, that should make no difference. I just wondered, if it is because my pans are made out of a cheaper grade of aluminum. I got them at the Sears Roebuck store. Comment. I have a pan also like that, and it always turns dark. Comment. If vinegar is used it will take off that deposit. Question. Would it affect the flavor? Answer. I do not believe it does. It only affects the alkali deposit. We have seen cases of cooking oatmeal in aluminum pans and it leaves a dark deposit, because there is quite a bit of iron in it. The deposit on aluminum is an iron oxide. It has been said that if you cooked tomatoes in it next time, then you will get your iron. ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION ON "WHAT CONSTITUTES A WELL DEVELOPED CHILD?" DR. RUTH STAPLES What do we mean by a well developed child? What is child development? Development is growth. We often think of growth as physical growth. We want to keep in mind that that is only one aspect of growth. There are four or five different developments — physical, mental (mental tests as early as two months — pretty good ones at six months), motor development, emotional development, self - control and social development. A child might be extremely bright or average physically and yet has. no interest in any other person — socially an infant. In addition to being well developed physically, he should learn to eat and select food; By the time' he is three he should be able </seg>
            <seg id="p402">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to select all wholesome foods and to take care of his toilet needs (that Is to tell when he has to go to the toilet). By eighteen months he should be able to wear panties. He should be able to take care of matters of personal cleanliness by the time he is four or five. Motor development — instructural maturity. He can walk when' his legs get long enough to hold him up and calcification of the bones takes place, and if the nervous system has developed enough. A baby of nine months should be able to sit up and reach and pick up an object. When six months old he can reach but not pick up accurately. Age for walking — fourteen or fifteen months is the average. Ey the time he is eighteen months he is supposed to be able to feed himself and wash his own hands, and run around and about nicely and handle things very well. They have skill with large muscles now. They can scribble with a pencil. When they are two they should be able to draw a circle. They should be able to run quite skillfully. They are interested in dragging things about at that time because walking to them is an old story by now. By the time they are four and a half they can run and jump with poise — have acquired control of large muscles. They are able to cut with scissors, draw a cross from copy, button clothes, etc. What might retard a child besides his size? . Do "Taylor Tots,," etc., tend to retard? "Taylor Tots" do not seem to retard the child in walking, at least there is no evidence of that. Sometimes they get numerous bumps when they are walking alone because they are used to depending upon the "Taylor Tot." They must have a chance to play in order to learn how to do things. Kiddy Kars, etc., help them. It is important to give them an opportunity to do things. Let them tear around as much as they want to, also give them plenty of space. • . Intellectual development. There is a baby book for giving tests to the child from babyhood on. When four and a half or five he should be able to talk without using baby talk, lace shoes, put on hat and coat alone, draw triangle from copy and draw a recognizable man or tree. He should have no ■ mark of disturbing fears or other lack of self-control— finger sucking temper tantrums. He should be straight-forward, frank and inter - ested. Temper tantrums are normal in two-year-olds. It Is a matter of emotional development. They will keep these up if they find they can get what they want by doing sd. Emotional development is a matter of learning— to learn how to meet a situation cheerfully in - stead of by making a big fuss. How do you explain the difference in development of the various children of a large family, especially when the development of the oldest child is retarded? Different factors enter into a situation o: this kind. It may be caused by factors inside the family or out of </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION It. When an only child has a baby brother or sister he feels some - what neglected after the baby comes. What would you do when you learn a child Is being teased? If he was old enough he could not pay any attention to it. A little of it does not hurt him, but it is cruel to tease a little child who doesn't understand. It Is good for them to learn to make a come - back to a little teasing. However, sometimes a relative or someone else delights in stirring up a child emotionally. It is a bad thing. A child should learn to do things because it is the right thing to do Instead of through fear. At the age of five they should play with other children success - fully. They should meet children and adults without self-conscious - ness and embarrassment. We should see to it that everything ia being done to help the child to development which Is normal In all aspects. An eight-year-old boy who has a speech defect. How to cor - rect? It may be caused by an emotional disturbance. You must get it straightened out and remove the fear of stuttering. It usually re - quires the care of a specialist. Should not call attention to it to the child. Sex problems. We should teach the child to come to us with its questions by answering the questions that he asks. Do not give him a book to read himself until he is about ten years of age. Is there any way to teach a child to blow his nose? There is nothing definite to do, only give him a handerchlef and help him. Three pamphlets — on growth, personality, and habits — are avail - able from "Farmer's Wife," St. Paul, Minnesota. They are based on Reports of the White House Conference on Child Health and Protec - tion. The set of three booklets is forty-five cents — fifteen ceDts apiece. "WHEN COMPANY COMES". Round Table Led by MRS. CAROLINE B. KING People like hospitality better -than they do to be treated as com - pany. Hospitality Is such a temperamental quality that one just feels it when it is present. One does not need to have attractive linen, silver and crystal. The atmosphere in the home counts for more than that. Many years ago I lived on a ranch. In those homes you were a welcome guest whether your host lived in a tent or In a shack. Before living there, company meant hours of work and Slav ing to prepare the meals. Now I know that company doesn't want you to work yourself to death if they are really worthwhile company. All they ask Is that you give them a feeling of welcome hospitality. </seg>
            <seg id="p404">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I have a few good standard meals that are prepared for com - pany but none which are too good for myself when I am alone. Little notes of accent can be added to make the meals more attractive. A "hospitality shelf" is wonderful help in a home. On this should be kept relishes and olives, canned vegetables, bacon, nice canned corned beef. Corned beef can be hurriedly creamed or put in a cas - serole with crumbs and browned. Eggs should be kept on this shelf also. An omelet is quickly made and so appetizing. Cheese should be on hand. The time is past when the very, best linens should be used only for guests. At prices as they are every home can afford medium priced linens, dishes, silver, etc., all the time, any of which is good enough for any but formal dinners. I know one woman who buys ten cent store dishes and glassware and keeps them in nice condi - tion so that they can hardly be distinguished from the better wares. It makes people feel happy to be. invited when they feel they make no trouble. At a bridge party it is easier for the hostess if a luncheon is served before the bridge rather than serving refreshments afterward. At a bridge party which I recently attended the following was served: Creamed chicken on biscuits, a salad, chocolate wafer dessert and coffee. The dessert is made by using chocolate wafers made by the National Biscuit Co., and putting together with thick layers of stiffly beaten whipping cream between. Make two layers and lay on waxed paper. Put in refrigerator. When ready to use cut slices diagonally and put whipping cream over the top with cherries as decoration. It is well to keep on hand one-fourth pound of each candy ginger and candied cherries. They add much to many desserts. For a Washington bl-centennial high tea which would be inter - esting to give this year it would be nice to carry out the ideas that were used many years ago in high teas. At these teas the very best linen was used. Sliced tongue was always served with hot rolls, tea and coffee and a dessert called "trifle." This was made by lining a large dish with slices of stale cake moistened with orange juice or liquor from maraschino cherries. A thick custard was placed be - tween two layers, then two more layers placed on top of this and all covered with the meringue of egg whites. Personally, I like the meringue made by dropping the beaten egg whites on boiling water, then skim them off after they are brown. This dessert may be gar - nished with cherries, nuts, cocoanut or whipped cream. Sometimes escalloped potatoes were served. This was all served buffet style and they kept replenishing the tables. For a formal dinner I often serve tomato juice cocktail in the living room before the dinner. This is a good beginning and makes the dinner seem more gay. I often serve the coffee In the living room after dinner, also, instead of at the table. This gives the din - ner a more festive air. </seg>
            <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION When there are children In the home, they should be given the same consideration as the grown-ups. These things give them a cer - tain amount of culture and refinement. When serving tea I use some small cups for .the children designated as "fairy" .cups in which milk is served while the grown-ups are being served. Often-times the ihilk is poured from a tea pot. I call these "fairy" cups, because if they are played with too often they might disappear (be broken). They only come out when a tea is given then are put right away. The children love to drink from them. When I was young I was put upstairs when a dinner was being served. Then we all knelt over the hole in the floor where the stove pipe went through and hoped everything would not be eaten before we got a chance. A formal dinner is not so unlike others except that the host serves the meat dishes and the hostess serves the vegetable dishes. Everything is especially nice such as table linen, dishes and silver - ware. A menu for a nice dinner follows: Roast duck, mashed sweet potatoes with a little orange juice put in baking dish with marsh - mallows and baked; apple sauce with horseradish, hearts of lettuce salad with simple dressing and lemon pie-cake. Lemon pie-cake is made by putting lemon filling between layers of sponge cake and covering all with whipped cream. Sponge Cake 3 eggs beaten light 4 tbsp. water 1 cup fine granulated sugar • 1 level tsp. baking powder 1 tsp. vanilla . 14 tsp. salt 1 cup flour Beat eggs all together uutil light, then beat in the sugar, add water. Sift one cup flour, then measure and add baking powder and salt and sift again. Add extract and bake. For a fancy cake add to this recipe two tablespoons of hot melted butter while it is sizzling hot. Put this cake in a flat pan. When cool, cut with fancy cutters and ice. TUESDAY AFTERNOON MRS. NOYES, Presiding Let us come to order and we will begin the program for the afternoon. Again we have some music. The director, Mrs. Mary Hall Thomas, an instructor at the University of Nebraska, had charge of the music. The trio consisted of Viola Curry, Mary McAlister, and Roberta Wehrman, with Marian Miller at the piano. Their theme song was "Roses' of Memory." They sang three songs, "Beside the Still Waters," by Hamlln; "When Honey Sings an Old Time Song," by Carey; and a medley of "Good Night, Sweetheart," and "Sweet Ne - braska Sweetheart." </seg>
            <seg id="p406">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Before our next number we have two announcements. One is we have placed a question box on a chair at the back of the room. If any of you have questions you would like to have answered you may put them In this box and they will be answered later on. The other announcement is that the report of the Home Eco - nomics meeting of last year are in printed form now, and those who were present at the meetings last year are entitled to one. You will find them at. the desk outside at the close of the meeting. On our next number we are shown some pictures — Beauty Spots of Nebraska, and those of us who have traveled about Nebraska some, know that we do have some beautiful spots in Nebraska. I am sur« that we will be pleased to have them given us today. They are to be given us by Professor Dwight Kirsch. "Before I start to show these pictures I want to make just a few brief remarks. I appeared before an audience here about three years ago. I hope there will be one or two friends who will remember me. I spoke about pictures at that time, but these are a little dif - feren kind of pictures. They are pictures just the sam*. If you stop to analyze the matter of pictures and art in general, I think you will find that there has been quite a great change in the attitude of people toward art in the United States in the past ten or fifteen years. It has taken quite awhile for real art to get to all sections of the country. It is hard to believe but I think all of you know that it is true. In the past five years there has been an amaz - ing increase in art appreciation. We can see that in the university when the students come to class, by their attitude toward the ar« classes. Of course, there are many other evidences of the increased ap - preciation of art in Nebraska. The state capitol building is the pin - nacle of that. It is sort of a symbol of beauty in the state. The Joslin Museum in Omaha is another such place. I think building such as these are setting the pace of all beautiful things in archi - tecture. Many other firms have followed suit in putting up finer buildings. People are having finer homes that are really good ex - amples of architecture. We have many other examples of good taste of fine arts. You don't have to go to these fine buildings to find beautiful things in Nebraska. I hope that these pictures I am going to show you will suggest to you some of the beauty that can be found in the ordinary things that we see every day in our lives. That really is the purpose of showing these pictures as far as I am con - cerned. The pictures are taken in natural colors. They are not hand tinted in any way. The colors are all natural. The pictures are taken from different parts of fhe state. I hope they will give you a little of the pleasure they have given me. I have had a great deal of fun with them, and I hope that you can see in them some of th« </seg>
            <seg id="p407">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION possibilities right around you. I wish that all of us might have enough art training to be able to see such pictures." Professor Kirsch then showed some slides •of beautiful scenes in Nebraska and gave a short talk describing each one. "For several years the growth of art appreciation in the United States has been spreading rapidly In the Middle-West. This is show - ing in Nebraska by the finer homes, churches and schools that have been built, and particularly by such important shrines of beauty at* the Nebraska State Capitol and the Joslyn Memorial. The satisfac - tion of having or seeing beautiful things is possible for all of us in Nebraska. Many of these things are the commonplace objects that surround us, as seen under special conditions. It would be a source of great pleasure if all of us could have art training or could train ourselves to see pictures, that is, not only to see and appreciate pic - tures already painted by artists, but especially to see potential pic - tures all about us in everyday life. The lantern slides that are shown are examples of direct color photography — the colors registered directly by special plates. These are results of a hobby of mine, photbgraphing various things in Ne - braska that have appealed to me when I was prepared to set them down in the form of pictures. ' Among subjects shown are the following, comprising about seventy-five slides: Exterior views of the Nebraska State Capitol, under various con - ditions and showing the course of construction of the tower. Scenes of the University of Nebraska Campus and the Agricul - tural College Campus. Flowers in the Lincoln Garden Club shows and in Nebraska Gardens. Clouds, skies, and sunsets. Autumn scenes, and beautiful trees in Nebraska. Winter — snow and ice. Studies taken in the Sandhills. Unusual views of commonplace objects. After the pictures Miss Fedde divided the ladies in four groups and they all adjourned to the Home Economics Building where each division was entertained and served tea. </seg>

There is no topic I would rather discuss with a group of parents than that of children's incomes, I do not know if you have heard that expression used to any extent and my reason for using it will appear as I go on. The reason there is no subject I would rather discuss is that I felt the need of getting more informa - tion on the subject of handling children's money and it became a matter of personal concern to me and I started out to find for my personal help and satisfaction more about this and for the past three years I have been trying to study the problem as thoroly as I could and as I have been going on with this subject of children's money I have gathered some information and hence I am very interested in discussing it with you. Now, the whole problem of children's incomes is one which is receiving increased attention as the relationship of money and be - havior problems becomes more evident in the minds of children. The modern parent can not argue that because he did not have an al - lowance at his own disposal some twenty-five years ago that his child today should not have money, although we find parents arguing that point. I heard a man not very long ago arguing it with his wife. He said my parents could take care of my needs and I intend to take care of my boy's needs. If you will think back 25 or 30 years you will remember that people walked to rural schools while today they go in busses or automobiles. At that time they carried their own lunch to school whereas today, I do not know how it is in Nebraska, but in Arizona they have a school lunch. Even the entertainment 25 or 30 years ago consisted almost entirely of free entertainment and today, and I happen to speak of entertainment in our state, we have paid entertainment. Consequently, there is a need for money today that did not exist 25 years ago and, of course, one of our problems as parents today is to keep in touch with changes. I was impressed last year when studying with Dr. Rose to hear her say repeatedly that one of the problems of parents today is to keep abreast of the </seg>
            <seg id="p409">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION times. Whether we give this money to children on demand or whetheT we have some definite plan by which the child gets this Income, is a. question we would like to consider. It depends upon many things. I think parents are appreciating the importance of property rights and the need for money. How are children to know the difference between legitimate and illegitimate methods of getting money and using money if they do not have any contact with money itself? About a year ago just out of interest, I began to trace down a series of 18 cases of money difficulties. It was interesting to notice that in those IS cases which ranged from taking money from mother's purse to blowing up a safe, which landed J.he boy in the penitenitary, not a single one in those 18 cases had there been any income for the child. The mother of the boy who blew the safe and who landed in the penitenitary, said "I am confident in my mind that his trouble started from- the day that his father and I said 'No, we do not feel that we can give you this money that you ask for, but we will try to give you the things you need.' " Prom whence should that income come? We have both legal and illegal methods of getting money upon the part of children. Of the illegal methods is one of bribing, begging. Should I pay my child for grades? I heard a teacher not long ago say to a mother, "I can hot get your boy to study. Can't you do something, pay him some - thing so as to make better grades?" We find often times that uncon - sciously on the part of the small child, they insist on keeping the change, of taking money from mother's purse. That is falsifying. We also find that girls and boys are selling something to get money. And where it is not supplied in any way there are these illegal methods used. Then we have the legal methods. We have earnings for allowances. The girl is earning her income. The boy has an allowance. The boy is not getting as large an allowance as the girl is earning. The girl is very skillful in taking .care of little children. She is so pleased to earn this that she feels more capable becausu she is earning something that her brother can not. We have a certain amount of income on the part of children come as gifts. We have even inheritances, interest on homes. I came across a high school boy and I said, "How does it happen that you always have money in your pocket?" "Oh, you know I am pretty good about lending my money and getting interest on it." When we come to evaluate these incomes, an adult would not really want to rely on gifts for their income. Now, why do not parents want to give an allowance to theli children. • As I have worked with this problem, and I have been work - ing with both mothers and fathers, 1 have become interested in why parents do not want to give allowances. First, they feel that they can control the expenditures better. There is no doubt about it. When an income is not an elastic one there is a feeling that one must control every expenditure in the very best possible way and the onlj </seg>
            <seg id="p410">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE answer to that is that perhaps it is better to let a child really spen.J one cent today in order to save a dollar tomorrow, if they are goine to appreciate how to spend later on. One small boy of six was re - cently started on his allowance. Near the school w^s a small corner store where you could buy a prize package. This sort of package appeals to any child of six years. The boy came home and asked his mother, "Do you think that it would be a good way to spend the money? She said. "I do not know. I have not seen the package •■ The next day he came home very crest fallen. His mother asked him what was in the package. He said, "It was not worth anything It was not worth two cents.", I remember a mother and father who were very much concerned over two high school girls. These girls were in the junior and senior years. The father and mother had plenty of money and you know the problem of boys and girls getting in with other boys and girls These girls got very extravagant habits and the parents said "What can you do?" And after talking with them I realized what the real problem was. The mother said, "One of my girls went down and charged something the other day on a friend's account, of course with the consent of the friend." The girls had two dollars a week to pay for her football tickets and other school activities but there was something else she wanted very badly and having been told she could not have any more money, she had taken other means of se - curing what she wanted. That was a pretty hard situation for those parents. It was suggested that the allowance be increased for those girls, and no supervision made of their purchases. The woman said Oh it would just nearly kill me to see them buy the stuff that they would buy." ; She could not bear to let the expenditures go out of her hands 41 the end of a month I saw the woman again and she was almost driven to distraction by the way the girls were doing At the end of. three months I saw her again. I asked her how things were going. She said. "Well, it is really working beautifully." Now, there is a second reason why parents do not want to give children an allowance and that is because they do not wish to com - mit themselves to a regular outgo from the family income. Now as a matter of fact, we as adults use money for three purposes We use it to save, to spend and to give. We must teach the children that money is for three purposes. They go to Sunday School and they learn to give. They get the idea more quickly if we teach them how to give. Then we tell them that money is to save. Now you know it is pretty hard to get many children five or eight years of age interested in a college education. My children have an uncle who sends them each year some money. That $5.00 is to be put away the child edU ° atiOn - This ls not an acceptable Christmas gift to Maybe the six or the ten year old begins to say that it is not long before he is going to belong to the Scouts, or maybe he wants </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION to save his money for a bicycle. This type of saving rather than the very remote type of saving is more Interesting to the child. The remote type of saving just turns children away from saving rather than toward it. They have to see largely savings for a ourpose and then it is not hard for them to learn to save. Now, ifwe get chil - dren started on an income the problem is not over and I am strongly convinced in my own mind after working with a great many parents on this subject that one reason why I hear parents say that it would not work after they have arranged for the Income with the child, Is because they have taken their hands off entirely. The income does not have to be controlled by the parent but it has to be guided. One mother said she did not want her son to be unhappy. It takes time to give a child an allowance. I think that is the answer in a good many cases. It needs to be guided rather than controlled. If we are going to make the allowance work, start simply. Devices that have appeared for children to keep accounts are just practically worthless. The plan of having three boxes works very well. Have three boxes, . the saving box, the giving box, and the spending box. Plan a use for the money rather than .keep an account of how it was used, unless he is able to summarize those figures for a plan for future use. As adults we start with accounts by the aid of a budget so I say we must start simply by Interesting and discussing how to do it In order to start a child. What are some of the ways of helping them- to see the value of their money. If we are going to increase the allowance each year, then increase the responsibility. The children must assume more and more, responsibility. ■ The allowance is not to be tied up with discipline. There is a difference between an al - lowance and a saving account. There is a tendency to feel that a child has done a good job if he has saved. The allowance is a way of making children independent. They become independent in handling money, it gives release from emotional strain, does away with thft tendency to dishonesty. Children's income is a problem that many parents in this generation must study very carefully. Happiness de - pends in a large way upon financial health as well as physical and mental health. The following forms for helping keep children's In - comes were passed out and their use explained. </seg>

            <seg id="p420">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE CHILDREN'S INCOMES By MRS. MILDRED WEIGLEY WOOD What shall we do with the child who has money whenever he asks for it? Does this make him feel any responsibility in spending It? How would you like to try for a few months asking for money instead of having a definite income? From the time children are able to handle money they should have three small boxes marked with the words "spending," "giving," "saving." If they are too young to read these boxes should have pictures on jthem that will designate one from the other and mean those three different things to them. Each child should have a single account sheet which it is his responsibility to keep, but he should not keep an account for the account's sake. If he plans well how to use his money and dislikes to keep an account do not bother about keep - ing the account. The principle of the thing is what you want. What do you hold your boy responsible for paying for? One mother replied, "shoe repair, hair cuts, hosiery, school supplies." These were all commended as they are items that the child really has experience with and learns when he uses his money for them the real value of them from a money standpoint. Do not force him to buy neck - ties with his allowance at the period when he has no desire to wear neckties. Later on he will want all kinds of them, then let him spend his money for them and appreciate how expensive they are. I took my boy in to buy shoes and in going through the depart - ments he stopped to look in the millinery and ready to wear sections. He was surprised to see the various racks of' dresses, one rack all priced J15.95. He before had no Idea what dresses cost. Did I buy dresses that cost $15.95 or more. Some people insist we ought not to let children worry about money. Do not say "you must not ask for any money because then mother cant' buy a dress." A child should not be burdened with money affairs to that extent. Every child as he grows older should gradually learn how to buy for himself, and how to spend his money wisely so that when he goes to college and has to depend on himself he will not spend wildly simply for the joy of spending. How do you determine how much responsibility a child con assume? Simply by adding it gradually and observing how capable he is of handling it. If he is started early he can handle all of his expenses by the time he is a sophomore in high school. Then when he goes away to school he is not suddenly faced with the problem of handling all his own expenses just at the time when his mind is taken up with so many new experiences. How can parents wonder at the unwise expenditure of their children when away to college when they have given them no responsibility for spending at j home? Is there danger of children becoming "money - minded" because of having money of their own? Not nearly so much </seg>
            <seg id="p421">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION danger as though they had no money at all and the mind would have to dwell constantly on the need for it. In one school there were many cases of falsifying expenditures of boys and girls in homes with money. An investigation showed that there was no margin left for free spending aside from necessities and students were doing without these in order to provide the little things that seemed so necessary to them. The parents should not make a definite decision for the allowance of the child without first consulting him and talking over his various needs and deciding with him. A child likes to be consulted regard - ing his affairs and it will save much difficulty. One boy told his mother he wished he was like Bobby who gets one dollar for every grade of A he gets In school. Then his father puts this money in the savings bank and he has ten cents a week to spend. The mother explained that he had his savings in a more definite way and that she did not believe In paying children for good grades. She then told him his bank account was the same and asked him how much he thought he should have free to spend after hair cuts, school supplies, etc., were paid for. He decided ten cents a week was enough and she made it possible for him to have this and satisfied him. Many times when a child is allowed so much a month for candy, etc., he does not use that privilege, as it loses its charm then. If the parents and the child have a verbal contract regarding the expenditure of money there is not likely to be any advantage of it on the part of the child. The average child has a keen sense of honor if he has confidence in the sincerity of his parents. One mother had gone through the hardest experience of her life. She had spent hours thinking her child had taken money from her mother's purse to buy a pair of earrings. The girl had asked for ear - rings and the parents had decided that this should be her birthday gift. But the girl had a new beau and a date for a dance and three months hence the beau might not be on deck. She could get a pair for $1.25 that suited her. Her parents had planned to buy a $5.00 pair. She brought them home and showed them to her mother and gave her mother the impression that they had been loaned her by a friend. Later the friend phoned after the daughter had gone out and asked her mother how she liked her daughter's new earrings.. When the mother proceeded to thank the friend for the loan of them the friend exposed the fact that they were not hers but that the daughter had bought them. Th« mother lived in agony until the daughter returned at midnight in the fear that her daughter had taken money from the mother's purse to buy them. Her daughter finally confessed that she had bought them with her lunch money. The mother realized that her daughter had no money to spend beyond money for necessities and corrected this. </seg>
            <seg id="p422">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A son went out at night in the family car and did something he was told not to do and got the car into difficulty. It was nothing that was a disgrace but it was an unnecessary expense. As a result, the parents took his allowance of $2 a week away from him entirely as a punishment. After a day or so the mother complained that all of a sudden they could not get that boy to do anything. She did not realize that instead of taking away his allowance they should have made him pay from his allowance all the expense of repairing the car. The boy thought it unfair to deprive him of his allowance and grew antagonistic. He is going to be a lot of trouble to his parents. To tie up his allowance with the problem of discipline does not go very well with the child. The boy afterward told in confidence that he would not have minded if he had been asked to pay for the repairs and would have considered it only fair. But he did not tell his parents this. Why? Because they did not suggest it to him and made the other state - ment in haste before the boy had a chance to tell them of his desire. Do not be too persnickety when a child spends a few cents fool - ishly. Do not express amazement over what the child has done, but take It calmly and reason with him so that it will not be repeated. One wise father and mother arrived home from town to see that the three children had taken all the supplies and utensils from a cupboard and piled them in the front room. What did he do? He very calmly said, "Well, let's all get busy and put them back again." With those words all the excitement and glamour was taken out of it and the children were very much disappointed that the ex - pected storm had not broken upon them. You may be sure they never tried that same stunt again. Many little shocking things that children do need to be ignored rather than magnified. Small children do not spend money any more rashly than we do. We expect standards away beyond what we grownups have. There are many women who simply cannot trust themselves with a bank account. Some selfishly- spend too much on themselves and others are too free with their money for charitable purposes. Children should be paid in the home for anything that they do which you would otherwise hire outside help for. They should be paid commensurate with the labor performed. You could afford to pay 15 cents for a member of the family instead of 40 cents paid to an outsider. If you can better use the time it takes to wash the dishes for sewing, ask your daughter to wash the dishes and pay her for it. It is much easier for boys to earn money outside of the home than it is for girls. The only way many girls ever find out the value of labor is when they are paid in the home. </seg>
            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON January 6th MISS MATILDA PETERS, Presiding Since our music Is here, I think we shall begin our program. I am going to ask Mrs. Thomas to introduce the singers to you. Miss Viola Curry, soprano, will sing for you, and she will an - nounce her own numbers. She sang "Nocturne" by Pearl Curran, and "The Angel" by Lieurance. Howard Miller, baritone, sang "Where Heaven Is" by O'Hara, and "I Love Life" by Zucca. Miss Marian Miller accompanied at the piano. ' Miss Peters called attention to the question box located in the back of the room. She said, "We would like to have you make use of this question box. If any of you have any suggestions as to what you would like to have appear on next year's program, we would wel - come those suggestions because the program committee would like to know what type of programs that you want. It is only by making your suggestions known that the program committee can know what you would like to have. If you have any questions you would like information on, just drop them into the box too. These questions will be answered later. Make use of that question box; It has been put there for that purpose. "The next speaker on our program is known to a good many of you through her pages in the Country Gentleman. A number of you, I think, had the pleasure of visiting her round table yesterday morning and enjoyed her at that time. We are very glad to have her with us as one of our guest speakers this year. She is going to address you on "Hobbies for the Homemaker." Mrs. King:" "It certainly looks nice to see so many of you. It Is just a beau - tiful day. I want to tell you before I begin that I thoroughly en - joyed that storm that Old Man Weather gave you yesterday. We don't see so much snow in Philadelphia and I enjoyed it very much. It seems I always get such a delightful welcome here in Nebraska. Even the weather was lovely. "I am going to taik to you on 'Hobbles for the Homemaker.' Hobbies are a hobby of mine. I feel that everyone of us would be so much better if we had some real interest, if we had some hobby. I am not going to talk about fads. There is a difference between fads and hobbies. Pads are short lived, rather temperamental things, but hobbles are interests that stay with us for a long while. I wonder how many of us have made all sorts of things out of inner tubes, or the linings of a rubber tire? Things that we like for a while and then </seg>
            <seg id="p424">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE discard. Those are the things that I would call fads. I am not going to give much time to fads because I think it is a waste of time — as most fads are. They are not worthwhile. "Hobbies are things that last, grow, and develop and become more and more interesting all the while. I think of a hobby as some - thing that is a- help to attain the better thoughts of life, that adds to our education and helps to cultivate the tetter pursuits of life. The hobby we choose may not be a joy to every member of our family, it may not be a joy to anyone but you, but you should choose the hobby that is to be your hobby, and it should be something entirely different from your general line of work, and something that you thoroughly enjoy collecting and. working with. "Who needs a hobby? I say everyone! Most of all I think homemakers need hobbies. I think if we start the children out to take up something of interest to them, we sometimes start them on a splendid career. I have a friend In Philadelphia, who is quite an old lady. Every summer she goes to Maine. She picks all sorts of shapes of bleached wood from the edges of the beaches that are washed up. In her imagination she sees all sorts of birds, beasts, and all sorts of strange things in these pieces of bleached wood. From these pieces of wood she has made a collection of the strangest and most unique animals you ever saw. So famous has this collec - tion become that she has been asked to give talks on them, and has been offered great sums for her collection. That was a strange thing for her to take up. She was telling me about the children in Maine. They would pick up all sorts of sticks and branches and bring them to her. She helps them plan something from their pieces of wood. She teaches them to use their imagination and makes them see all sorts of gnomes and pixies, animals, birds, and beasts. This helps to develop their tendencies toward art and the unusual things of life. "Some people say to me, 'Don't you think homemakers have enough of a hobby? Do homemakers have time for a hobby?' I think when we get to the point where we spend every moment at work, that Is the time that we need a hobby most of all. We are going to get very dull and drab if we don't have something more in - teresting in life than keeping the house clean and everything polished. I used to give up everything because it was the day to clean the house. It was the day to bake bread, and I baked bread whether we needed it or not. Too many of us are that way, at least when we first start out housekeeping. Some of us see later on the uselessness of it, and find out that homemaking isn't Just housekeeping. Every houeswlfe is entitled to her hour or so of leisure every day. If she can put that hour to some use In developing something, I think she is gaining a great deal more. I don't think homemaking is enough. One grows dull and drab if one doesn't have something else. The homemaker herself becomes dull and uninteresting if she doesn't have something else to talk about except housekeeping. </seg>
            <seg id="p425">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION "I have an artist friend in Philadelphia. Cooking is her hobby. How she loves to get off her painting frock and put on a kitchen apron. And- the delicious things she can make out of common potatoes and meats is wonderful. So interested has she become in cookery that she studied the history and romance of it. She can tell you the most quaint and unusual tales of how parsely was discovered, or whai Charlemagne used to have on his table. You see her hobby is some - thing all together from her every day work. I think a hobby should be something as far removed from our daily work as possible. "When do we need a hobby? I think we always need one. 1 began mine when I was about seven. I planted some strawberry plants in a box, thinking I would raise strawberries out of season. I managed to have about three strawberries in the winter time. We are never too young to begin hobbies and never too old to collect them. When life begins to get a little dull, when we wake up in the morning and think of the same things for breakfast, and then the dishes to do after breakfast, and the same dafly tasks to do today as we have done them in all the days before, just the same, then we really need a hobby so that there will be something else to look for - ward to during the day besides the same breakfast and the same dishes to wash at exactly the same time day after day. When we are working too hard, then we must have a hobby. If it is only an hour or two a day, see that you get it. "The next question is — to get that hour or two a day. How are we going to manage it. Someone said to me the other day, 'How are you going to tell those people to get a little leisure time for hobbies?' One suggestion I have for you to get this leisure time is to manage your work differently so that you will have more time. Many of us take too long over the ordinary tasks. Speed up the ordinary tasks and that would help a lot. I love to do housework. To me it is relaxation. When I go home from work I love to spend an hour or two doing the dishes and cleaning up the kitchen, but I could hurry and speed it up if I were wanting my time for some - thing else. If this was my regular task and everyday work, I would speed up so that I could have time for other things. Careful planning of housework is always necessary if you want to have any leisure hours. Adequate utilities and equipment help a lot to speed up house - work. If you really want that hour a day for yourself, you are going to get it. That is one thing about we modern women. We do man - age almost always to get what we want. "There is one thing we want to do, and that is to get a clearer understanding , of what is housekeeping and. what is homemaking. Homemaklng, I find, does not fit in very well with' housekeeping, but housekeeping does fit in and round out homemaking. Housekeeping is doing the various tasks that have to be done to keep an orderly house, to keep the family clean, well fed and properly clothed. It is more like doing the essential things to keep a home going. Home- </seg>
            <seg id="p426">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE making is not only that, but it is bringing in more of the unusual things, more of the educational things of life. Hobbies probably would not be included in housekeeping, but. add a great deal to the enjoyment of homemaklng. "Selecting a hobby. It isn't necessary for us merely to confino ourselves to one hobby. We can have several hobbies. I think a hobby should be as far removed' from our everyday work as possible, so in selecting your hobby, choose not only one that you thoroughly enjoy, but try to choose one that is entirely different from your everyday work. "I have one hobby that is rather interesting to me. I have a collection of cats — however, not real cats. Someone years ago gave me a great big white cat. Yes this one was a real cat. - Everybody that comes to my house knows that I think a great deal of. my cat. So many have sent me cats from all sections of the country, all kinds of cats, small white china cats, gray cats, and they range in all sizes and colors. I have china cats from Egypt, Paris, and this summer I got one when I was in Dublin. You have no idea what a conversa - tional thing my collection is. People come in, and when conversation begins to lag, I say, 'Oh, I want to show you my cats,' and I take them in and show them my cats. Usually my big white cat comes stalking first of all, and then I show the other ones. In this way we begin talking about hobbles of all kinds, and make very interesting con - versation. "Collecting can be made a very good hobby. It is surprising the things you can collect, and how interesting it can be made. I can even see possibilities in collecting hand bills, if someone were inter - ested in that line. You can collect something without spending a lof of money on it. Even my little cats cost something although I don't think any one of them has been more costly than 50 or 60 cents. "One young lady wrote me and told me her hobby. She said, 'In the evening when all the work is done, I go out to a place on the farm where I can see the west. I take a note book with me and col - lect sunsets. I study each one and jot down the colors in the sky, the reflection in the water, the shapes and colors of the clouds.' Can't you just Imagine the beautiful thoughts and views she . must dtore up in her mind to think about all the next day while she is doing her work? | All day long she can think of the sunset she saw the night before, and wonder what kind of a sunset she will see that evening. "Another one of our girl readers wrote us and told of collecting stones and rocks along the creek that runs around their home. She told us before she begun collecting them, she had no idea how inter - esting and colorful stones and rocks could be. Her father fixed her a shelf in . her bedroom for all of her stones, and she accompanies each rock with a little description of where she found It, and dlf- </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION fereat things about it. She declared she was going to continue this hobby all the rest of her life. These girls don't mind writing about their hobbies. They enjoy telling someone, and Miss Hoagland is so enthusiastic and answers their letters so pleasantly that she gets al - most more than she can attend to. "A young girl I know in Illinois told me that her hobby was collecting historical facts about her state. Illinois Is my state and I had never known what an interesting state, it was. Sometimes it takes something like this to bring us to realize that there is some - thing interesting about the place in which you live. "Yesterday when I went up into Miss Steele's room, I thought it was very foolish of Miss Peters to ask me to come here and talk to you about hobbies, because you have someone right here in the college who could tell you much about beautiful things to collect. Miss Steele teaches craft work here, and craft work of the kind that I would really call worthwhile, the sort of work that one does for the future. Miss Steele is teaching her girls how to make heirlooms. They are not depending on the heirlooms that were left them. They are making heiriooms that can go down through the coming genera - tions. Worthwhile heirlooms, to my way of thinking, is a most beau - tiful hobby. "Once in a while. I think it is perfectly alright to make foolish little trifles. Years ago I stopped at a little town in Illinois. We had to stay there for several hours. I stopped at a house to get a drink, and the lady asked me into the living room to sit down while she brought me the water. I couldn't help but notice in the room that her sofa, every table and chair was covered with the most hideous crocheted covers. When she came in she told me of the days and days of loneliness she had spent In her home all alone, until she learned to make these masterpieces as far as crocheting is concerned. She had covers with inscriptions crocheted in, 'To Mr. and Mrs. So and So, in honor of their 50th Wedding Anniversary,' and all sorts, of such things. She had really found this way of expressing her - self. We have to find expression in some way. She found It through the making of these covers. If at that time there had been extension clubs and colleges to have told her what to do, she perhaps would have made some very beautiful things. We wrote to each other for awhile, and I sent her some patterns that I thought would be lovely in crochet, but she wrote back that she believed she liked her pat - terns better with the writing and wording in them. I made up my mind then and there that I would never say anything or find fault with anybody's hobby as long as it was interesting to them. This woman could have spent her time doing something very much better, but she enjoyed doing this. "Through the craft pages of the Country Gentleman we do try occasionally to give you rugs, quilts and patterns that we think would please the average homemaker. </seg>
            <seg id="p428">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "Music is a very beautiful hobby. We can all love music. I ■ think the way that we showed our appreciation for those two young people who sang for us this afternoon is a good indication that every - one here is a music lover. When you take up music as a hobby, try to make a real study of it. When you hear a composition that you like very much, try to select in it more motives by which you can recognize that composer in another composition. In music it is very interesting to take up a little study of the composer. "Reading is another very interesting and educational hobby. 1 wonder if we all read to the best advantage. There are so many good books now. Two years ago I made a study of the Bible. I read it, not so much as a religious rite, but I read the Bible as I would any. history or story. I read it not so much as one would just read the required chapter a day, but I found that there was a very beautiful story about each one of the different characters. All through the Bible there were chapters about Paul which gave a complete history of his life. "I am going to tell you just a little bit about my last hobby, that is my garden. You can always have a garden. Some of you may say, 'Oh that is too much like our ordinary work, all through the summer.' But gardens as a hobby can be made so different from the ordinary garden that you will love to work with it, and see how many different kinds of plans and scenes you can make. I plan my garden over each winter. I change it all around, but then in the summer I sometimes don't live up to my plans, for when the flowers come up and the color schemes begin to form, I think it is too beau - tiful the way it is, and sometimes don't change it. In making garden pictures with rocks, waterfalls, streams and all those things that go to make up a rock and flower garden, a most delightful garden can be built. My garden keeps me busy the year around. In the summer, of course, I am planting and tending the flowers as they grow and bloom. In the winter time I read books and magazines on gardens and reconstruct pictures of gardens. Every winter I make my garden all over on paper. After I finish that, the seed catalogs come along.. My neighbor calls them inflammable literature. We think we must have every j one of the flowers illustrated in our garden. About 12 years ago I began to try to have everything grow in my garden that they had in the books. I found that to do this I had to learn a good deal more than I already knew about land, soil, sun temperatures, and color schemes. "Gardening teaches you neighborliness and friendliness. It has taught my [neighbor how to cure loneliness. She was left alone and was always so lonesome before she got Interested in her garden, and she has found that it lias helped tremendously for her to forget her loneliness, j I tell her it has made her more beautiful. She says that is because 1 1 have grown to like her more and more since I have known her, and it just seems that way to me. But she works out - </seg>

Hobbies will make us all more interesting. "I promised the girl in our office who edits our club page, I would speak to you about clubs as a hobby. She said, 'Won't you please ask the ladies to make their club their hobby?' She has made a hobby of rural clubs. She says if the women would just take up one thing a year and make it their hobby, it would help us solve the problem of making this page more interesting to the women. She says, 'Why not start a club library, or go in for community improve - ment?' She urges to either join a club or start a club. "I want to say that I think resting is a good hobby. We don't have to be lazy or idle in resting. I like to lie back and close my eyes and think of some beautiful scene, or a book, or a flower, or just a little day dream, or something we would like to see accom - plished. I have a friend who says that she saves up some lovely thing to think about while she lies down. That is the only way she can be induced to lay down the tools she is working with and rest. "These are just a very few of the things that I would like to talk to you about if I had the time, or if you had the patience. Hobbies" will take you out of your work-a-day world and take you into- the realm of realization. You can't be angry very long if you have some - thing very interesting to think about. You can't be worried very long if you have a hobby to occupy part of your time and thoughts. Let's call a hobby a sort of fairy wand that turns dismal tasks into joy. I thank you." "I think we always feel a certain satisfaction in seeing in person someone we have learned to know through the printed pages. I am sure that we feel that way about Mrs. King. We are going to have just a few minutes for community sing - ing. Mrs. Gaines, whom most of you know, is going to lead us, and I am very glad to present Mrs. Gaines at this time. Mrs. Gaines led the group in four songs, "How Do You Do," "Nebraska," "Comin' Thru the Rye," and "Pack Up Your Troubles." MISS PETERS: "Since our speaker , has appeared before you before, I am not going to take much time to introduce her. I am glad to present again Mrs. Mildred Weigley Wood, who will speak to you on 'Steps to Good Management.' " </seg>
            <seg id="p430">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE STEPS TO GOOD MANAGEMENT First of all the basic step to the management of any home is To Consider the Needs of the Family. It isn't just the physical needs that have to be considered, just as Mrs. King pointed out. There are the desires and wants of individual members pf the family that £t VC IV consldered - N «eds differ greatly in different families They differ according to the ages of the children and the kind of children. That is, families that have both boys and girls have a dif - ferent problem from the one that has only one or the other. Or the family with older children has a problem different from the family with all small children. I think of a small boy of eight who expressed this rather clearly the other day. He said he didn't think his Mother knew the washing business very well. When I asked him why, he said 'Oh, she thinks my. face had ought to be just as clean as my hands, and you know I don't use my face." I think there is a good deal of pretty sound philosophy in that. This first step then means to consider the needs of the family not the needs of the mother alone, nor the needs of the father alone nor the children alone, but the needs of the family as a whole We are now working in a democratic era, and that means that we must recognize the needs of ail. What are the resources of the family? it is true that home - makers must consider the resources of many, in determining clothing needs, fuel needs, rentals and food. Frequently a well managed home results much more quickly if we consider these human resources more carefully than we have in the past. I am always interested in checking up on the abilities of different ones, because we sometimes find abilities that we never thought existed. American homemakers have one very definite idea in mind. As I work in different com - munities in my state I realize that sometimes people have more abil - ities than we give them credit for. It doesn't take a very large girl to dust the lower rounds of the chairs. That is an ability that a child will enjoy exercising, and they should be encouraged to do these small tasks at a very early age. Having considered the needs and determined what are our re - sources, we are then ready to make a plan. Making a plan is the third step. If we are going to have workable plans, there are four prin - ciples of planning that we must hold to. Sensible things must come first. Everyone of us in this room has failed to observe that some - time or other. Haven't you ever started to clean out dresser drawers when you knew that you had something else waiting that should be done first, when you knew that you would get yourself into trouble by doing that one thing when you knew there was something more important that should be done? The second principle of planning is that a study of records will show the best use of resources, and the needs of the family. We all fail at some time or other to keep </seg>
            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION records, which does help to make this plan. The third step In mak - ing a plan Is that we have to consider what are the interests of other members of the family in making a plan. Do not go ahead and make a plan without consulting the other members of the family. The plan may please you but it may not be what the rest of the household want at all. Try to strike a happy medium so that all will be satisfied. Fourth, if we are going to make good plans, we have to make allowance for the unforeseen and the unexpected. The plan for the use of the day that does not allow for interruptions is really not a satisfactory plan. The plan for the use of money that doesn't make some allowance for emergencies is not a very sound plan. Now we are ready for the fourth step of the ladder. After mak - ing the plan we have to live by the plan. It Is alright to make your plans for the use of money, but it is not so easy to live by the plan. You may say, how does living by the plan contribute to enthusiasm, energy, and a well balanced home? I might say that living by the plan is the only way in which we will find a means of getting to a well managed home. We will attain this goal only by doing the things that we actually learn how to do. We learn to schedule our time by scheduling. We learn to budget by budgeting. We learn to plan wisely for equipment by planning wisely. It Is actually living by the plan we have made that enables us to retain one of the later steps. Checking the results is the fifth step to a well managed home. In m"an y phases of housekeeping, checking is very common. It is easier however to check the results of certain housekeeping activities than it is sometimes to check the results of our families and community relationships. Having checked the results after living by the plan, we are then in position to -take the last step, which is to perfect the plan. We have a plan which we think is perfect, but sometimes after living by the plan for awhile, we see where we can revise the plan and in some way perfect It a little more and make it better. That is how we perfect the plan, by changing and revising and thus perfecting it. Taking all of these steps into consideration will help considerably in attaining a happy, well managed home, a home that everyone will enjoy living In and one that will be a suitable background for the rearing of children. The making of a well managed home is not only a Mother's job, or a father's job, .or one that belongs to the children alone, but It is a job that belongs to each and everyone of them. I thank you. MISS PETERS: We now come to a very Interesting and very beautiful feature of our program. I want to introduce a new comer to Nebraska, who will preside during the Nebraska Farm Home Maker presentation. Mrs. Ellis: </seg>
            <seg id="p432">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "When I was asked to preside at this meeting today, I thought that I was really being privileged. I have attended several of these programs in another stale. I have always felt so proud to be con - nected with them in any way. As you know, today we are setting aside this time to honor five of Nebraska's Master Farm Homemakers. We do not mean that we are honoring them because they have built exceptionally fine homes, or because they have gathered much in the way of wealth, some of them have attained more in this line than others. But we are honoring them today because they have made a happy home life for their families and children and have done much for the betterment of the communities in which they live. They have maintained homes in which their families have developed in a sur - rounding of health, physical, moral and spiritual, and their children's lives have been one of cooperation. In spite of the difficulties and little disagreements, they have managed to make their homes . real homes in which their children have lived, and in so doing they have reached out to other homes in their communities and have stood for all that pertains to the highest ideals. Ten other Master Farm Home - makers have been honored in the past. The five women here today are those to be selected for the 1932 honors. The honor is being conferred by the Farmers Wife, and I feel sure that back of the honor there must lie a feeling of great gratitude that they have been selected for this honor by their own Nebraska neighbors. Many more than these five women were nominated, and to each was sent a length work sheet from the office of the Farmers Wife. These work sheets were filled out and were sent to the Farmers Wife office and gone over there. Those which seemed to show the greatest degree of accomplish - ment were singled out and the homes involved were visited and from these visits our five Master Farm Homemakers were selected. It gives me a great deal of pleasure at this time to introduce to you Miss Bess Rowe of the Farmers Wife. "It is a great happiness to me to come back to Nebraska. Some - how there is always such a friendly feeling here with all whom I come in contact with here. The Master Farm Homemaker movement is five years old. This is the third group of Master Farm Home - makers in Nebraska. It seemed to us that certain things might be accomplished from such a movement, and we feel that great accom - plishments are being made along this line. We felt that this might help to throw the spotlight on those individuals who were pioneers in such a movement. We hear a great deal nowadays about the in - stability of the home. We read of the great number of divorces and all such things regarding the instability of the home. This movement will help you folks on the farm to realize that there are many won - derful things being done in homemaking, and it will offset some of the other things we read. The rural home is a home which is stable, and we want to call attention to the contribution to all farm homes by farm homemakers. I believe to a certain extent many of these </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION things have been accomplished. Much progress has been made by these ladies here today. In five years 381 women have been recognized. These women live in 21 states. It is a recognition of the accom - plishments of the entire family, because as Mrs. Wood said, no home is the accomplishment of an Individual. Every home is the accom - plishment, first of two people who establish that home and establish their ideals, and later train the children who come into that home to have the same ideals. We might say that we are recognizing five Nebraska homes through recognizing five Nebraska homemakers. Every woman so honored must be a real farm woman. By that we mean that farming must be the chief business and the chief source of income. She niust be nominated by her neighbors. These worn on have helped with the farm incomes in many ways, not only by raising chickens and taking care of the dairy products, but have kept records, saved, and watched their spending wisely. When told of the honor that was to be bestowed upon them, every one of these women felt that she should not be awarded the honor. I believe there are two reasons for this. Every master homemaker has her ideals. She sees her ideals set high above everything else, and feels that she has accomplished little. Her friends and neighbors see her accomplish - ments and think she has accomplished wonders. The Master Farm Homemakers In different states live on all types of farms, from twelve acre truck gardens, to the 1,400 and 1.600 acre farms of some. Some of the homes are so simple and some of them are quite elaborate ones. A homemaker's home may be modern in every respect or it may be a home which has none of the modern conveniences. The development of that home, to create a home such as is the ambition of .every farm family as rapidly as the resources will permit'. Does good housekeeping mean homemaking. Good housekeeping, yes, but not the kind of housekeeping that makes the family uncom - fortable. The master farm homemaker is a good manager. She plans her housekeeping and her duties around the house so that they do not conflict with other work of the farm and plans that the rest of the members of the family might have. She so plans her meals that all of the family might have good strong bodies to carry on their work. . She Is the sort, of woman of whom the young man says, "She Is the Sort of wife I would like to have," and of whom the younR mother says, "If I could be that sort of a mother and if I could have that sort of family, I would be satisfied." MRS. ELLIS: We now have the pleasure of listening to our own Dean. DEAN BURR said: "Friends, I was asked to speak for just a few moments this afternoon. I have jotted down a few notes that express some of the things that. I would like to. say on this partnership affair. I would like to say first that I am very happy indeed to have a part </seg>
            <seg id="p434">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In this program, a program In which an outstanding honor is coming to five Nebraska farm women, women who have through a consider - able span of life, demonstrated their ability and their integrity or business in that greatest of all human tasks, the making of the home. Those of you who heard Secretary Hyde last night heard him em - phasize the fact that there were three grent influences in American civilization, the church, the home and the school. Without in the least detracting from either of the other, it is my candid opinion that if we can properly evaluate the influences of those three tremendous factors of civilization, we would find that the home is the most im - portant of all from the standpoint of the future of civilization itself. Homemaking deals with those important life values that have to do with the molding of the character of future citizens. It is in the home that these characteristics such as honesty, industry, and the consideration of the rights of others is taught. In speaking of the present so-called crime wave, I recently heard a very prominent man say that the greatest contributing factor to the crime wave is the breaking down of good home influence. I was asked to talk for a few moments on this partnership busi - ness. I am glad to try to express it as I see it. The making of a successful home is ever a partnership affair. This is more particularly true of rural than of city homes, because agriculture is not only a business, but agriculture is a mode of life, and there is a greater correlation between needs of the farm home and the farm business than there is in any other home. The city man's business, or his work, is a thing aside from his home, and contributes little to the family living. The rural homemaker is generally an actual partner in all of the tasks, a part of the business of the farm. She plans with her husband the garden, the poultry raising, and the dairy activities be - cause they will contribute largely to the family food supply and in many cases to the cash income. Together they build a plan that will include work for the children according to their different ages and abilities, teaching them one of the greatest of life's lessons, that of honest labor. To those of you who are living in the city, and who have had farm experience, probably one of the greatest concerns is what definite tasks can we assign to a youngster in town that will teach him the most valuable lesson of life, and that is work and how to work. Into the scheme for the home is woven those things that will create in the children the desire to accomplish worthwhile things. They will soon learn how to work efficiently, and to properly balance between work and play. They will soon develop a love for the beau - tiful and the real. The fact that this cooperation in the building of the home can be obtained without either the husband of the wife separating them - selves from the home is the distinct advantage of rural life. Probably </seg>
            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION is this great advantage so widely recognized by all that most will admit that the country is a better place than the city to raise chil - dren. The contributions of the children to the family income or Interests, the contributions of the wife, to a large measure will take them away from the home when working and living in the city. That is not true in the rural districts, and I believe that when we speak of the advantages of living in the country, we will find many more than to be found when living in the city, as far as raising children are concerned and the making of a successful home. I have often told this that there are two big factors that tend to prove what I have said — that of the advantages of the rural person's life over that of the city person. First of these is emphasizing learning to work, how to work and the value of work; and the second of these is the self - realization that is generally instilled in a youngster on the farm or in the farm home. They realize self-confidence and know that they are independent. I believe probably those two factors above all others are the ones to which we may attribute the recognized general suc - cess of the country raised people. The fact that you have been chosen as master homemakers of Nebraska, that you are receiving this honor, is proof that you have been successful in this important matter of homemaking. It indicates that the home to you has meant more than a house in which to live, and that it has had built into it those things which stand for higher education. I want to congratulate you five women very much on this honor. I thank you." Our next speaker on the program is our own Director Brokaw, whom most of you know and know quite well. Probably all of these women who are being honored have had the privilege to work with him on many various occasions, and they have come to value his opinions and advice very much, and are willing to cooperate and help in all the things that he and his Extension Service undertake. Mr. Brokaw: "It is a distinct pleasure to take part in a program of this kind. In one sense I enjoy it. In another I do not because it follows so closely the things that we took up here this morning. In discussing standards I am inclined to just stop for a moment. This morning they said, 'Is it possible to set up a goal which is a certain standard that will judge these people?' It looks like a wholly intangible thing to do, but if it were not for standards which were set, it would be entirely impossible to judge them. I do not have anything to say In defense of the judges that judged these women. These standards were set up for the purpose of having something for homemakers to come up. to. The individuals may not measure up to all of them but they measure up to a high percentage of them. The competition has become so keen in our state that I almost begin to think that we are going to find some that measure up 100% perfect. Competition is keener and keener. That is true of so many things we undertake nowadays, and it keeps us all up on our toes all of the time. </seg>
            <seg id="p436">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE May I bring in just a little outside view into this picture now? It was my pleasure this fall to do something that I have looked for - ward to doing for a number of years, that was to drive through the southland during the picking of the cotton. We would drive for miles and miles and would see the darkies picking cotton with their black bodies and faces showing among the big patches of white . cotton, making a remarkable color contrast. We did not see the wonderful homes while driving along that we see on the Nebraska highways. No standard has been set for the cabins and their surroundings down there. But as we drove along I couldn't help but notice a big darky lady step up to the door, and she was so striking in the white dress that she had on. It was spotless from top to bottom. What is the difference between the exterior of these cabins and these surroundings and those we find in our own state? Setting of standards makes the difference. We have standards here in Nebraska that we like to live up to or at least like to try to live up to, and the results are evident in the beautiful- homes we see. No standards have been set for the surroundings and cabins in the south among the cotton fields, but the surprising thing came to me as we drove down the road a little ways. We stopped at a cabin and as we stepped into the door, I looked into that room and it was immaculately clean. The bed was spotless with its white covering, and the table was as clean as one could wish for. Somebody had been setting standards here in this little room. The other standards for the outside appear - ance of these little groups of cabins had not been set. I have another place in mind that shows a good example of the results of setting standards. I was driving through a number of small towns, and had a man with me that had never been to this particular place. I remembered it and have often thought that I had never seen such homely surroundings. Just before I came to one of them I said to the man, "I am. going to drive slowly through this town. There is something here that I want you to notice." We drove along and as we drove the scenes seemed to be more beautiful all the way, and the homes seemed to be more beautiful, some of them very simple In their design, but beautiful just the same. As we drove, the man said to drive a little slower, because he felt that he was missing some of the beauty by going so fast. Someone in this certain community had certainly been setting standards. I think one of the best illustrations that we have that shows the results of setting standards in the home is that of the State Pen - itentiary. It is reported that 90% of the men in the penitenitary say their troubles originated in a home where no standards had been set, and where religious rites had no part in their home. Is there anything- that would indicate to us more clearly the needs of setting standards? AH of these standards that I have mentioned are summed up under what we mighi. call home standards, and they are certainly fitting and proper in this thing of the Master Farm Homemakers Pro - gram. I thank you." </seg>
            <seg id="p437">NEBRASKA HQME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Mrs. Ellis then introduced Mrs. H. F. Capwell. one of the 1931 Master Farm Homemakers, who spoke on "Our Responsibility for Leadership." "Friends of Master Farm Homemakers: As we welcome into our state these new Master Farm Homemakers, we ask ourselves, 'Just what are our responsibilities as leaders as members of this work?" First, what is a leader? A leader is any individual who leads or initiates in the undertaking of something. She needs to be community spirited, to be able to cooperate, and she needs to be sympathetic with people. She needs to be willing to learn and to have the ability to overlook criticism. Some persons are never successful leaders. Lead - ership comes through study and the desire to serve others. Leader - ship develops slowly, and a leader always learns first to follow. It creates new interest, brings new friends and adds much to our lives. The Extension Service has been such a leader in the state of Ne - braska. Today we are recognizing not only these five women, but all farm women who are doing their best to raise the standards of homemaking and community making. It is a recognition of what a woman stands for in the home community. The object of this movement as has been Btarted, we believe, is to raise not only the standard of living in the home but in the com - munity as well. We believe that education on the farm is as neces - sary for a successful life and happiness as in any other vocation. Master Farm Homemakers are busy women. They are trying to combine homemaking with community making. With this honor we have certain responsibilities. There are community affairs to help be responsible for, affairs of the church to help with, rural meetings to contribute to, and annual meetings to plan for and attend. We wish to create, by our popular recognition service and by our ex - amples, a desire in the hearts of all farm women to become members of this organization. Master Farm Homemakers are good housekeepers, but good house - keeping is not necessarily good homemaking. This past year one lady introduced me as a Master Farm Housekeeper. The successful home - maker has high ideals. Her husband is her faithful assistant and she is his partner. No matter how tired she is or how busy there is one task that every homemaker should do and do well and that is her duty to her children. She has a responsibility of training future citizens. She needs to retain the confidence of her children,' her friends and of the judges who have selected her to this honor. Her community contacts have helped to develop her, so she in turn should feel more responsibility in taking a leadership part in com - munity affairs." ■Mrs. Tullis and Miss Ruth Haberly accompanied by Miss Bernlce Schellenberg, sang three songs, "The Fairy Children," "Canterbury Bells," and "Blue Bell, Dew Bell." </seg>
            <seg id="p438">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MRS. ELLIS: "I am sure that these beautiful songs and beau - tiful voices have added much to our program. We want to thank Mrs. Tullia and Mlus Haberly for them." MR. BROKAW: "Again I speak to you. this time because it becomes my duty to take the place which Miss Brown should have taken. We regret very much to have her absent at this time. This movement has meant so much to her. She has enjoyed her coopera - tion with the Farmers Wife in this one phase of her work. I am sure that I am expressing for her, her appreciation of this movement and the very fine things that the Farmers Wife has done for all people in the state. I rather hesitate also to introduce or to present these ladies, as Miss Brown has known them so much better and knows so much more of them and their activities than I. It has been my pleasure to sit in Farm Board meetings with most of this group. If we check up on their activities, we find that these ladies for a number of years have all been doing 4-H club work. They have built that wonderful foundation for leadership. I have faced many of them before in a business way. Besides taking part in so many community, church and business affairs, they have measured up as true home - makers. These women have an average of five children in the home. It was my pleasure to have a boy In a group of boys that I took away on a trip, from one of these homes. I knew that he was from a Master Farm Home by the time I returned. One of the best ways to judge a home and home surroundings is to get the children out on a trip. At this time I am going to ask them to stand. Mrs. John H. Cooper of Douglas County; Mrs. Thomas Graham of Dakota County; Mrs. Ervin E. Hartz of Lancaster County; Mrs. Henry A. Heyne of Cumlng County; and Mrs. John Strolz of Frontier County. Mis3 Rowe, it is my pleasure, to report to this group of Nebraska Farm Homemakers that you will present their pins of recognition." MISS ROWE said: "These pins are symbolic to the honor for which they are given. The foundation of the pin is a circle which symbolizes the home circle, the family circle. Then the other part of the pin Is a Roman lamp engraved in the circle. In honoring you today we are recognizing first that you, are doing well a difficult task that of making a successful home. In honoring you we are recognizing the greatness of this task. In honoring you we are recognizing the con - tributions of farm women to the country. In honoring you, we are honoring not you alone but through you we are' honoring every farm woman in this room, every farm woman in Nebraska. It has been said that the future of America depends on the future of American Agriculture. We will go further than that and say that the future of American Agriculture depends on the future of the American farm home. We are expressing our faith In the future of America and the future of American farm homes when we present these pins. </seg>
            <seg id="p439">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Miss Rowe introduced some of the 1931 Master Homemakers that were present, the county agents of the ladies honored this year, and those mmbers of the 1932 homemakers families that were present. The first lady is Mrs. Cooper of Dougles County. Mrs. Cooper says that she is expressly fond of poetry and find her own thoughts expressed many times in poetry. She wants her children to be pre - pared both mentally and physically to solve life's problems and be prepared for all they come in contact with. MRS. COOPER: "I am sure words would be inadequate for anyone of us to express our appreciation for this fine honor. I am not going to bother you with a lengthy . discussion or to tell you how I have achieved this honor. I am just going 'to pass on to you a little poem or a part of a poem by Henry Van Dyke, entitled "Success." It seemed as though it had been written for me to express my belief for my association with my family. It brough out just what I felt we needed to make a well rounded family. Four things a man must learn to do If he would make his record true; To think- without confusion clearly; To love his fellow man sincerely; To act from honest motives purely; To trust in God and Heaven securely. Mrs. Thomas Graham of Dakota County is the next one to be honored. She has six children, one is a doctor, one a civil engineer, one is a stenographer and three are students. She is president of the Dakota City Community Club, and I want to say that this club has done some fine things in library work. In business training for the children, they were given an allowance large enough to cover many of the things which they needed. If too much was spent for the things they wanted and not enough was kept for the things they needed. Mother and Dad did not buy them for them. MRS. GRAHAM: "Certainly I know that I am not the proper per - son for this honor for I have just done the little things that come to me each day. I think my love for the farm came from the training my father gave me. I was the only child, and as a youngster he put a little box on the cultivator and I rode and rode until I went to sleep. I was taught to love horses and the love of all farm animal.* by being continually with my father. My success in making a home has nothing to do with my own efforts alone, but with the efforts of my husband and myself; because Mr. Graham has been wonderful by doing and giving the things to fill the life of myself and family. We have all been great readers and my boys and girlB have been contented to take a book and spend an evening with a good author. That has done so much to make our home life a contented and happy one." </seg>

One thing that has impressed me while listening today is the fact that nearly all of the other, homemakers are closer to Lincoln. I think half of successful homemaking on the farm is to love the farm home. If I deserve any credit at all it would be through the cooperation of my family. After all. we must have cooperation on the farm the same as we do in any other busi - ness. To make plans and have husband and children plan with you is the only way you can succeed. I was raised in town and from my early childhood I had a great love for animals. And I still have As a very small child I had this love for stock and animals of all* every'year^Mt." 6611 * '"^^ ""* '" ™ ***** and haVe enjOyed The fourth member of the group is Mrs. Heyne. She has six - children, two married, one is a technician in the Lincoln Clinic and three are students. Two of them have been 4-H club members and have won honors. When she received notice of this honor being given her today, she said she hadn't had such a thrill since her daughter had been elected to Mortar Board. She says, "I always make my plans at least a day ahead and always allow some time in my Plans for interruptions." She loves to work with flowers, make quilts and read. Her personal ambition is to raise her family to be worth - while citizens. She says, "Home should be a restful place for all of us. It must be a place where we can express ourelves as we cannot do any other place. Every member of the family should feel that it equally belongs to them." MRS. HEYNE: "When we were told last night that we were to give a little talk, it didn't seem to me that I had anything to say that would be of interest to you. But I find I would like to tell you a few things of my experiences as a farmer's wife. I have never been sorry I lived on the farm. As a child I used to like to be on the farm and be around the stock and chickens When I got married and had my children, I found that God's broad acres was the best place to rear a family. </seg>
            <seg id="p443">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION I am very thankful for the things that have come to me. I love to read and hear stories. My mother was a great reader. She used to read things and then tell them to me In her own story form. On the farm there Is more to do than In the city home. As soon as my children were old enough and able to do something, they wanted to help Mother and were given little tasks to do. I think these little tasks they have to do make them stronger for the work they have to do later in life. They have always had a little income of their own, and I think this teaches them to be more economical. We have a boy in college and I think he is about as economical as a boy can be. Today I am more than glad that 1 live on a farm, and I want to thank all those who helped make this recognition possible." Mr. Hartz of Lancaster County, our next homemaker, has five children. She has been on a school board for six years, chairman of a community club, a project leader four years, and a 4-H leader for six years. Her children are 4-H members. They have been taught responsibility in the home. As soon as a child can pick up play - things they are taught to pick them up and put them away. She wants for her children,' clean and wholesome minds and bodies. MRS. HARTZ said: "When I received the recognition, I was just sure that someone had made a mistake in sending in my name. Most of these other women were born and raised on the farm. I was not. I was a teacher in town, and when I married, most of the people in the community felt sorry for my husband because he had to live with a city girl. I have tried to be the kind of a home - maker he would want me to be, and I want to thank those peoplfe today, who nominated me for this honor." </seg>

            <seg id="p446">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THURSDAY, JANUARY 7th MRS. NOYES, Presiding The morning program opened with a 4-H club demonstration "Good Grooming," by Virginia and Eunice Ellen Copenhaver of Syra - cuse, Nebraska. The points covered by the girls were: Importance of good grooming. Preparing for the shampoo. How to brush hair and massage scalp. ■How to apply the soap. Describe use of egg instead of soap. Shampooing. Soap, rinse and soap again. Describe the dry shampoo. Rinsing. Describe vinegar and lemon rinse Rinse three times. Finger wave. Gave recipe for home-made wave-set. Drying. • Concluding remarks. One often hears the expression "Looks don't matter." Looks do matter a great deal to every girl and woman. They always will matter, though other things such as. common sense, kindness, Intelli - gence and simplicity are' more important. The girls said in part, "When ready for a shampoo part hair over various parts of the head and brush well. Then massage the scalp. Apply a generous amount of shampoo jelly made by melting a mild soap. After rubbing this in thoroughly, rinse in warm water. Use a smaller amount of shampoo jelly again. Rinse in warm water, then a vinegar or lemon rinse. Vinegar solution: % pint tepid water, 1 tbsp. vinegar. Mix well. Use the last rinse of clear, cold water. This closes the pores and pre - vents danger of taking cold. Wrap the head in large bath towel as. it is very absorbent. Rub with towel and let dry in sun, if possible. Rub scalp vigorously with linger tips. Use stiff brush. "Hair set made at home is much cheaper. Go to a drug store and get 1 scant tablespoon of flaxseed. Boil about three minutes in one-half pint of water and strain. . Apply in generous quantities and comb through the hair. Set the wave with the fingers. When dry and ready to comb out, comb each wave individually and push back in place. Never comb clear through all the waves at one timp." Question: What advantages has an egg shampoo? Answer: It helps the scalp and helps the hair in that it cleans hair better. </seg>

            <seg id="p448">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE RUSSIA AS I SAW IT PROF. MARGARET FEDDE Many people ask, "Why did you go to Russia?" Everybody Is interested in Russia. My interest started in 1919 when I heard a Russian woman talk in this country. This woman after she was eighteen years of age gave her baby to her sister and gave up her husband in order to devote her life making life more bearable for the peasants of Russia. She had given years to the revolutionary cause but does not approve of the present regime. It has worked out dif - ferently than she had in mind. Since hearing this woman I have read everything about Russia that I could get hold of. I went to Russia with the International Institute from Columbia University in a small group. We went to learn all we could about the educational program of Russia. If their educational program does not bring them successfully through this five year plan, it is a failure. We visited a large tractor plant. At one time this plant was turning out just six tractors a day which was a very small output considering the number of people employed. A young man said he felt that the plant should put out 100 tractors a day. They made him director and within six weeks time he was putting out 100 tractors a day. Just after accomplishing his goal he contracted typhoid fever and died. His body was brought back to Moscow and placed beside the body of Lenin which was the greatest honor the people could pay him. They revere his memory almost as much as that of Lenin. He set a goal and accomplished it and that means everything in Russia. We visited a collective farm. Here all work together collectively and own everything collectively excepting that each family is allowed to have a cow and a few chickens and maybe a pig. Horses and machinery were owned collectively. The threshing was done by the women with perhaps two men supervising it. They fed the engines with straw for heating purposes. Here sex equality is thoroughly be - lieved in and the women work with the men and do men's labor. We visited a second state farm where everything is owned col - lectively. The people own nothing. Here they had tractors and com - bines and farmed thousands of acres. We also visited a tobacco fac - tory and an implement factory. We saw a beautiful palace of the czar which was then housing peasants and workers. The beautiful large rooms were full of great tables where 2,000 people eat and live. In the beautiful dining room which the czar used to have the wood work was spotted and the paper soiled. The people don't know how to take care of things. Russia has 160,000,000 people or one-third more than the. United States. When we talk about our education program here we mean </seg>
            <seg id="p449">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION schools. There it means more than schools. It means the radio. People hear only what the government wants them to hear. The big receiving sets are controlled by the communists. The communists decide what the people shall hear. Near the border line only small receiving sets are permitted so the people cannot get anything from a great distance. The homes, museums, movies, theatres, factories, parks and libraries are all controlled by the communists. Russia was a very backward country educationally. In 1917 eighty per cent of the women could not read nor write and sixty per cent of the men could not read nor write. There was a great need for education. At present they are putting great emphasis on reading and writing. One of their alms is that children shall be made literate and be able to understand the governmental program and be enthusiastic about it. They seem to be accomplishing it. They are urging an educational program for adults. Every adult must learn to read and write at the end of the five years which is in 1934. One avenue is through posters and through reading and writing. They call it a cultural program. In every possible way they make the children feel that they are a part of the government. They expect these children to bcome the rulers and govern from the ages of twenty to forty. After that, they are not much good to them. Who goes to school? They now have a seven-year compulsory school in most parts of Russia. Above that is a technical school and above that a university. The workers and peasants are given the first opportunity to get into the school, contrary to the time when the czar ruled and only the wealthy class had the opportunity to go to school". In university the students are given a salary while they are going to school which ranges from $25 to $65 a month, depending on the size of the family which they have. Many of them have fam - ilies. If there is any room left, the children of the professional classes get to go, then the children of the aristocrats. The children from 10 to 16 years of age are organized in con - nection with the schools. Outside of school hours they do things for the government. In the summer they are taken. to summer camps which correspond well with our 4-H club camps. Here they work out the problem of what they can do when they go back home to educate their family toward communism. America to them ranks high as a capitalism country. On a poster they have a red engine and a green engine running a race. The red engine stands for Russia and communism and the green engine for America and capitalism. Which will win? These young people are going to be a tremendous influence in Russia ten years from now. We cannot say that what they do in Russia will not affect us. There is at present a young Russian in our university whose father lives in Omaha. After he has completed his education here he plans to return to Russia and help with the program. He Bays that no matter how much wheat Russia produces in the next five years </seg>
            <seg id="p450">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE they need every bit of it at home. They need machines and building materials for their factories. The aristocrats beautiful homes are all confiscated and the chil - dren are taken to these in large groups. These are made into sani - tary hospitals and children's homes for former poor people. The children are kept there for months and taught, then are urged to go back home and spread this news. The children of Russia are just as bright and alert as our children are and know much more about their gpvernment. Here are some of the questions asked us by children ten to twelve years old: Why is there so much unemployment in America? What is your budget for education in America. Do you have any children who are not in school in America? What are you doing to eliminate unemployment? What do your teachers tell the children about communism? How was the financial crisis met in the United States? Do you ever have gatherings of the unemployed? How do you like our government? Every pioneer, as these children are called, must collect forty pounds of scrap iron. The children must build 5,000 radios next year. Seventy - five children go to collective farms and weed from ten to twelve. Every fifteen miutes they get up and stretch to keep, in good con - dition. The children are encouraged to help on collective farms. They are made to feel they are a part of the government. Does this destroy the home life? I saw no family life. I asked one man, "Why do you discourage family life?" He said, "Ninety - nine per cent of the mothers and fathers are not educated to com - munism, therefore the government cannot trust the children to learn communism from them. They do not take the children from the. parents. The women go to the factories and work and take their babies along. Older people look after them there. The work is done in groups always. The individual does not exist. The mother may take their children home at night or may leave them four days and take them home the fifth day which they have off. The women are not compelled to work, but they get more for themselves and fam - ilies to eat if they do. Everything is rationed and. the card system used and if a father and mother both work they get twice as much food for their families. Have they stamped out religion in regard to the children? I cannot answer this fully. This may partly answer your question. The children said to us, "You believe in God and we don't." To the people of Russia everything ends with the grave. Is the educational program complete? They are not told only what they -want them to know. The program is a very narrow one. What language is stressed? German. What do they do on Sunday? They do not know it is Sunday. One-flfth of the population is off at one time. They do not keep ac - count of the days and do not know one from the other." </seg>
            <seg id="p451">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION How are the people disposed of in the police work? They are sent to Siberia. Many are taken out at night and shot. The people are not allowed to leave Russia. A woman and her brother between the ages of 40 and 45 went to Russia to live though they were not natives of that country. They were interested in doing social work in Russia and became Russian citizens. A year ego the brother was arrested because he was too well educated and they did not trust him. For six months his sister did not know where he was. He and forty engineers were in prison and were put to work perfecting a certain machine. The sister is teaching in a higher institution. She told one of our group that she never goes to bed at night but she is afraid there will come a tap on her door and she will be invited out. She and a man were asked to make a course of study for the schools. She could not agree with the young communist. He agreed to let the course of study be printed if his name and picture would go on it together with a statement that he did not agree with all of it. The religion in the old days was very corrupt and superstitious. They are now substituting science for religion and tell the people that religion is poisonous. One poster they display represents a man beating his wife and the quotation from the Bible on it is "Women obey your husbands." They use this in prejudicing people, especially women, against religion and the Bible. They keep all religion from the children. The communists are not allowed to smoke or drink. As you think of it, how does the new regime compare with the old. The standards are very low under the new regime and there is much sickness because of lack of food. All the people ask is a com - fortable home and food and a simple life. • There are two million communists telling 158 million people what to do." I . ! ■ — MANAGING TIME INSTEAD OP LETTING IT MANAGE YOU MRS. MILDRED WEIGLEY WOOD There Is a certain philosophy about the management of time whether we be efficient or inefficient. Someone has said "The only thing that is equal In this democracy of ours is time." But do we all have the same amount of time? Some people have to get more done in 24 hours than others. Does the woman with three children have as much time as the woman without any children? "Busy" people are not- always the busiest. Sevenson has said. "I dislike peo - ple who are always surrounded with 'business.' " Effective manage - ment eliminates a lot of this. There is a vast difference between efficiency and effectiveness. A certain high strung woman thought she was tremendously efficient. It was three months before she rea&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p452">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ized her efficiency lasted but three hours of the day and the rest of the day she was worn out. Slow movements got her farther. Deliver me from an efficient woman, but not from an effective woman. We cannot discuss the question of time adequately if we do not recognize that every business has an overhead cost. In homemaking woman power is definite overhead cost. How recognized? If home - maker Is ill, replace power at definite cost. How do you decide how you arp going to use your time? Consider the needs of the family. The needs are so different at different times. It is almost impossible « to find two families whose needs are similar. There is a great varia - tion. I know one family who always interested me very much. I call them the "cobweb" family, because they had' an unusual number of cobwebs in evidence. There were five children and the father was recuperating from a long illness and studying law while doing so. Because of his illness their income was extremely limited. The mother had much to do to get everything into a day and keep her husband from feeling worried. She could not be blamed lor having a few cobwebs. I happened in and had occasion to go upstairs. She apol - ogized for the condition of the stairway, but she was making fruit cake. To her the joy of her family in the Christmas fruit cake meant more than dirty stairs and she hadn't time for both and had to choose. She had to let her work go and read to her husband from a book in which he was interested and which his eyes could not stand the strain of reading. She considered the needs of her family in the use of her time. She had to choose between cleaning the house at a time when something else was of more importance. Her decision was based on the needs of her family. There are two things to consider — planning for use of time and executing that time — scheduling and dispatching." Some people hesi - tate to schedule their time. They say it makes them feel pressed and they cannot make it work. It is true that a schedule shows up your inefficiency but the schedule is to the homemaker what a time table is to the railroad office. It is a means of preventing unwise delays on the way to a destination. A schedule is of no value unless it Is made for your particular family. You cannot make any other schedule work but one that is adapted to your own individual needs. You first have to remember what are the difficulties of getting the work done, then make a schedule to fit those. There are inter - ruptions both necessary and unnecessary. Borrowing neighbors can - not be controlled, but you can help your telephone calls by suggest - ing to friends and business people that you are more free to talk over the phone at a certain time in the day than at any other time. Plan your time for the neighbors to come in in the afternoon, so that you can make them feel comfortable and not that you are pressed for time. Oftentimes our schedules do not work because we do not plan for interruptions. We try to put too much into a day. We </seg>
            <seg id="p453">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION plan a day's work when we feel good In the morning and we do not keep up our speed. Another reason we cannot keep on schedule is because we spend our time on non-essentials. Dispatching of work. The effect of a real incentive is interest - ing.. Have you ever found yourself after a sudden invitation to dinner or some similar inspiration doing a day's work in a half day? We should be able to create our own incentives. One woman uses detec - tive stories. She promises herself a half hour of reading after her work is done and she can turn out an enormous amount of work by that inspiration.. Some people like to see how they can reduce the amount of time it takes to accomplish tasks. We should reduce the number of pro - cesses because it makes a great difference if you remove one process. One woman told of her experience with placing of dishes. She was able to lessen the time for getting a meal by placing the dishes where they were most conveniently used. She kept the serving dishes in the kitchen instead of in the dining room. We should plan to work at the time of least fatigue. You can take fifteen minutes off and rest and do the same task in half tho time. We are very careful that our children do not work when over fatigued, but we do not use half as much judgment about ourselves. Maintaining a reasonable standard. In so many instances we are maintaining a standard which is not based on what effect it has on the health and financial status of our families. A standard may be unreasonably low or unreasonably high. The time will come when young men and young women will sit down and determine what are reasonable standards with reference to many things besides money alone. Teaching children to be independent. Rural people do not have the problem that city people have with reference to children going into the street. It takes time to train them, but it saves time in the end. Whenever you have made a child independent so he washes his hands and hangs up his clothes, you have saved yourself time. We are a little too inclined to make martyrs o£ ourselves rather than letting other people help us save our time. Standardizing tasks. When we do a thing over and over we should be studying the processes we use to find out the least possible time in which it can be done. We can standardize bed making so as to use the least possible number of motions. We should plan to get more help from- other members of the family. Homemakers do too much themselves because they do not want to spend enough time teaching other people to help. But this would save much time in the end. The late Anna Hichardson used to say she wishes homemakers would realize the significance of their job as teachers. Whether a homemaker has been through university </seg>
            <seg id="p454">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE or not, she must make up her mind she is going to be a teacher when she becomes a- mother. An old English aunt said this of saving time, "The- use of my hodds and hends of time is certainly more Important than my reg - ulars." There are times when we could save much time when wait - ing for others. One woman does her. dusting in odds and ends of time. Another has a lot of needles threaded and her mending near which she picks up while waiting for a meal to cook or waiting for someone to come, etc. If you are going to save time, you must take time to save it. Analyze your time problem to cut time corners. Get away from the traditional and form reasonable standards to fit your family needs. MANAGING THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE HOME MRS. MILDRED WEIGLEY WOOD The ever present demand of the family is for food. What shall we eat today. This is the ever present question. Upon food depends the health and contentment of the family. One woman said she had done nothing but think about food and hadn't cooked a thing. The time spent in planning food and food combinations is not lost. Some - times women are so taken up with the actual cooking that they lose sight of the large number of planning problems that would save time in the end. One cannot solve a management problem If you do not recognize what it is. We have to know what the needs of the family are if we are going to solve them. We cannot lower the cost of food If we are not conscious of those problems. List a few of the planning jobs women are engaged in in planning food for the family. Planning for nutrition. See that we have fresh fruits and green vegetables daily. Planning for palatability. Decide whether you will serve spinach or grapefruit. Planning for variety. To plan for the children and also for the adults. The mother has to plan to some extent for the individual tastes of various members of the family. There is a great deal of difference in catering to people's taste and planning for individual tastes. If people do dislike something, don't serve it too many times. Planning for equipment. We get used to some piece of equip - ment and continue using it without stopping to analyze whether it is the most efficient piece for the definite work it has to do. Planning for serving. Sometimes we find it impossible to carry on conversation with our guests because of the many interruptions </seg>
            <seg id="p455">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION which the serving involves. We should analyze this situation and be able to simplify things so that we overcome this problem. Planning for quantities. Find out the cheapest way to buy your food for the size of your family. Determine which size can of vege - tables or fruits is the suitable size for your needs. Planning to save time and mental effort. Write on the recipes seldom used how many they will serve. One of the principles of good planning anywhere in the field of management is that the records which you have are useful. About how hany recipes do you have on file which you never use but which you must turn through to find what you do use? Discard all unused recipes. Make several well planned menus to keep on file when in a hurry or when planning for company. When you have worked out the right combinations of foods for a menu, make a record of it. It will save much time later. Planning for costs. Average your meals so that you do not have a famine one day and a feast another. Keep costs balanced. Planning for sociability. Perfect a plan for serving Sunday night supper In front of the fire in the living room instead of at the table. There is a strong connection between the social life of the family in connection with food. Notice how differently a family acts after they have had a satisfactory meal. In one home everybody is asked to keep the most Interesting thing that happens during the day until the dinner hour in the evening. Planning for emergencies. Have an emergency shelf and keep it stocked to prevent embarrassment when unexpected company comes. Work out the items to be kept on it and see that when they are used that they are always replaced. Planning for hospitality. What makes the dinner for a guest harder? You have more people and less time. You have more dishes when you serve guests. Work out a way to get rid of extra salad dishes. One woman serves a certain dinner for a certain family •every time they are her guests. She has this dinner perfected until it is no extra trouble for her to serve it and she has time for hos - pitality. I am not half so concerned about serving an imperfectly balanced dinner to guests four times a year as I am to have well balanced meals for my family. </seg>

            <seg id="p458">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE LIVABLE HOME MRS. MILDRED WEIGLEY WOOD Ladies and gentlemen, members of Organized Agriculture, and the University of Nebraska, it is a real pleasure to have the oppor - tunity to talking to men and women on the livable home, because it is a problem of interest to both. For several years I have been interested in asking people, both men and women what they felt made a livable home and invariably they list such characteristics as these: That it run smoothly, that there is an atmosphere of health, that it is neat and tidy, that there is leisure for recreation, that there are sufficient good looking clothes, It is easy to give such a picture of a livable home, but achieving it is no easy undertaking. Can we point out this afternoon a few definite conditions which help make a livable home? I would like to suggest five, not as the only ones, but ones which are being accepted as important. ' Effective methods of housekeeping is the first I would call to your attention. Poor Richard's Almanac said, "Beware of little ex - penditures." This is as true of time and energy as of money. Unless we have the type of housekeeping that Ija the end gives freedom, it will not be livable. I have been interested in a little experience that I had some two years ago when I returned from a summer vacation. In Arizona everybody takes a summer vacation. I happened to talk the same day to two different homemakers. One had gone over to the coast. Her husband' is a professional man, making a good income. She had good help but the help had taken advantage of the absence of her employer and had taken her departure and, incidentally, some of the home equipment. This was, of course, irritating. The woman said, "I have had absolutely no chance to do anything I wanted to do. I have had to clean all the kitchen woodwork myself. I have washed the curtains," and she went on and on enumerating all the things she had done. I was interested in her efforts at a clean house because I knew just such a cleaning had taken place some three weeks previous. She could not even go out with her husband for dinner because she was so fatigued from the cleaning. The other homemaker had been back one week. She said she had not had time to get any but the superficial cleaning done, the curtains were not up and the rugs not down. "The children were so glad to get home," she said in explanation. The first thing they wanted to do was to go to an especially liked spot for a picnic, so to a picnic they went. They wanted to get around to all their friends and that took time. Is there not shown here the difference between effective and efficient home keeping? After all, the only point in housekeeping is to make the home livable. Which of these homes were more livable for the family? </seg>
            <seg id="p459">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION I was listening the other night to the story told by a woman who was born In Tombstone, Arizona, of her mother's experience there. Tombstone was an outstanding town in those days though today it does not belie its name. Housekeeping was a great event there as in other places and in the town of Tombstone it had been customary to use such times when carpets were up and curtains down to stage cer - tain social activities as dances for example. This woman, relatively a new comer In the town planned her home cleaning for certain days, and when the neighbors saw the evidence of house cleaning they determined upon a surprise party. But the surprise was to be on them, for their host-to-be, in an effort at great efficiency, and at the expense of great fatigue, took the carpets up and put them down the same day and alas: there could be no dance. That woman never lived down her reputation in that community for being efficient rather than effective. Effective home keeping .then, Is one asset to a livable home. Relative values must be considered. There must be a constant weighing of values. For example, the task of cleaning a home where one has very small children has a very different relative value from that of the same task several years later, when the children are larger. This is illustrated by an incident which came to my attention. Two small girls came over to my house some six years ago and wanted to know if I had an aluminum pitcher. They were going to have some friends and they wanted the aluminum pitcher to pour some cider. They wanted one which would hold a great deal and the looks of the pitcher was secondary. Those same two girls came back this year and wanted to know if I had a sliver tea pot for tea they were serving. They were very particular about Its appearance and much less inter - eted in its convenience. Here is shown how time changes the needs in a home. Some of you have heard of the woman who said there were three kinds of dusting. There is the kind where you dust everything and every crack and crevice, and the kind where. you dust only those surfaces that show, such as the piano top, table top; and the third kind where you just, draw the shades. Homemakers with such an appreciation of the part dusting plays in housekeeping are likely to have a livable home. They have weighed relative values. A third important consideration for a livable home is the early formulation of goals. The man and woman who determine early in their married lives that they are going to save for a home, or for the purchase of purebred cattle, will reach their goal more quickly than those who merely hope they may arrive.. Agreement of homemakers helps in the formulation of goals, in fact is essential if goals are to be achieved harmoniously. For example, the father who wishes his sons to become farmers, the mother who </seg>
            <seg id="p460">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE does not, often find themselves in a difficult, situation for the children realize this gulf of disagreement and know not which way to turn. A fourth condition for a livable home is that interest and activ - ities need to be coordinated if the home is a livable one. There are often conflicting interests in a group as the systematic housewife who does not enjoy a Sunday with divergence from the routine; or the man who enjoys books more than people, or perhaps, the family divided against itself on the subject of picnics. There must be give and take if the home is to be livable. A fifth condition, and the last one I am going to mention, is the cultivation of personality traits. An appreciation of the importance of this must exist and there must be opportunity provided for developing them if the home is to be livable. Certain basic personality traits as genuine affection, respect for personality of others, courtesy, sym - pathy and expressed appreciation need to be in the process of culti - vating if members in a home can live comfortably with one another. For instance, take just the matter of expressed appreciation. Will you lose anything by more frequently saying to your wife, "That dress is becoming," or "You look younger tonight than usual," or "How do you serve such good meals with all you have to do?' 1 Or, to your husband, "Fixing that door was actually a great help." Thus we see that effective, rather than efficient, management of housekeeping, relative values realized that life may be properly bal - anced early formulation of goals that all may be satisfied, interests and activities coordinated that the home may be run for all, and op - portunity and interest in developing personality traits, for success and happiness depends upon them. Here are five fundamental needs that must be met if home is a livable home, by which we mean one in which can be found relaxation, comfort and satisfaction. </seg>
            <seg id="p461">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION PART II MOTHERS VACATION CAMPS There were four Mothers Vacation Camps during the summer of 1931.

Camp Brewster, August 11-14, Y. W. C. A. Camp, 4 miles south of Omaha — Enrollment 50. Miss Leona Davis of the Extension Service was camp director of the Chadron Camp. Miss Mary-Ellen Brown director the last three. The camps were advertised through newspaper . articles, letter from Miss Brown, County Agents and Home Agents and through pro - ject and- study club groups. Any woman over 18 years was welcome. Children and visitors were invited for the last day of camp which was visitors day. The fee charged each person attending the Chadron and Deweese camp was $4.25, Lexington J3.75 and each camper furnished her own dishes, towel and bedding. At Camp Brewster the cost was J4.75 but bedding, towels arid dishes were furnished. Most of the campers paid their own way. Some received the trip as a gift from children, a few came as winner of prize trips offered by some organization In their county. Some were sent by their club. The purpose of the camp is to provide at small expense a three .'ay vacation full of rest, inspiration and fun for being homemakers. A second purpose is that the homemaker may pass on to others in her community various things which she received in the camp. It Left to right — Mrs. J. Thomas .Graham, Mrs. John Stroll. Mrs. Ervin E.

We know of no other place where food, shelter and an interest - ing program can be had for such a nominal cost. There were nature study and recreational directors at each camp The "before breakfast" bird hikes were popular. Many learned inter - esting facts about native trees, birds and grasses of Nebraska Whal a thrill to catch sight of a blue bird or a ruby throated humming bird! The study of the stars and the heavens was popular also Miss Ethel Mae Taylor of Harlani, Iowa, was the director of nature study at the Chadron Camp. Mrs. C. O. Bruce of Lincoln had that part at the other camps. . Three of the csrtnps were fortunate in having Miss Ella Gardner of the Children's Bureau in the U. S. Dept. of Labor, Washington D. C., as recreational director. Miss Gardner is an artist in leading recreation and in getting people to play and sing. Handcraft for camps this summer was basketry. Each woman was proud to carry home a reed flower basket, which she had made. The cost of the basket was 35c. The educational features were: Round table true, doubtful false discussion under the leadership of Miss Mary-Ellen Brown. These dealt with present day problem of the home and community. Miss Ella Gardner gave talks on the value of good posture. Per - sonal demonstrations were given to each woman who wished to know how she might correct her posture. Such expressions as "I have a hollow back" or "mine is a forward head" were familiar sayings heard about camp. During the music appreciation hour the women listened to pieces of music played by the victrola and used their imagination in inter - preting "what the music said." Instructions on how to handle a community party or a picnic and sources of material for programs, plays and stunts were given to the group, by Miss Gardner. "Shadow pictures" and the making of paper costumes and necessary parafenalis were. of interest to all of the women. A book review by Mrs. C. O. Bruce, "Grandmother Brown's Hundred Years," was inspiration to all. The book was written by Harriet Conner Brown, a daughter-in-law about her mother-in-law. Grandmother Brown was not famous in any way but a whole town rejoiced and celebrated with her her 100th birthday. The book is a true story of her life. It is full of sweet wholesome philosophy which is as useful today as in Grandmother Brown's time. Mrs. R. o. Williams of Kearney, who is a member of the State Farm Bureau Board Federation, told of the value to the farmers of the organization she represented. A demonstration and talk by Miss Cleota Woodall was given at Chadron on cooking utensils that are a saving of time and labor. </seg>

            <seg id="p465">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The camp is divided into groups or families on the first night and each family has much fun in composing an original song and a yell for their family. Each morning after breakfast was over, an hour or so was spent in hearing about each other, "wedding dress," "most embarrassing moments," "pioneer experiences," etc. The tales told would make splendid material for a book. Except at Camp Brewster each camper washed her own dishes. There was 1 much merriment and visiting at these periods. Everybody coveted the first place at the dish water. Each time a different method was used in selecting the groups such as: number of children, color of eyes, color of dress, those coming the greatest distance, number of cabin and counties in turn. ; .__ Mrs. Bruce and her story telling period. . At the close of the program each night came the "story hour." This was a story or group of stories told by Mrs. Bruce, — some were stories to tell to the boys at home, some were for the girls, others were for the Sunday school class and a few were for the women themselves. The "Bed time stories" will live long in the minds and hearts of the attentive, listeners and will be told again and again in homes where "Mother, please tell us a story," is a nightly request. The last part of the program each night was the singing of "Taps." "Day is Done, Gone the Sun, From the Lake, From the Hill, From the Sky, Safety Rest, All is Well, God is Nigh." When women go home from camp telling us they are more rested, have higher ideals, a desire to pass on the "good things," are more contented with their lot and happier than when they came to camp we feel that Mothers Vacation Camps are surely worth while. </seg>

The day opened at the camp with a hike at 5:30 under the guid - ance of Mrs. Jennie Bruce, and after the hike the members returned to enjoy a fine breakfast and which was much enjoyed by the hikers. All the programs at the camp moved with clock like speed and the ladies of the camp found ample time for their study and recreation, all of the cooking and serving being taken care of by the camp staff, so that labor was banished from the camp as far as the guest? were concerned.

Mrs. Minnie Skinner, of Harrison, Nebraska, a gold star mother, who had just returned from France where she visited the grave of her son, gave a very interesting talk of the trip and the many points of interest that she had visited in France. </seg>

Mrs. Jennie Bruce had charge of the book review section of the camp study and gave several most interesting talks of the various books that were selected for review, as well as giving a large number of fascinating stories. Assisting Miss Brown in one of the days at the camp was Miss Leona Davis of Lincoln and who gave .a very pleasant touch to the camp program. The ladies also had round table discussions each day, but as all such interesting discussions many- will be renewed at the camp the coming year. The members of the camp found much pleasure in the making of reed baskets which was carried out under the supervision of Mrs. Bruce and which the ladies were allowed to take home with them as a remembrance of the camp and its fun and pleasure. The youngest mother at the camp was twenty-seven years of age, and oldest seventy-five and the campfire girls ranged from nine to fifteen, so all ages were represented at the camp. . There were a number of counties represented and many of the attendants had been at the four previous camps while for some it was the first year, but all agreed that it would not be the last by any means that they would enjoy."

These trips are awarded to the two high scoring individuals. of the State Champion judging teams of the judging contests held at the Nebraska State Fair. The winners enter the national judging contests held in Chicago. The Home Economics Section believes these judging contests to be a phase of 4-H club work which helps girls to establish and recognize stand - ards, to weigh values and to develop judging. The names of the winners of these trips are printed below with letters expressing the appreciation of the girls and stories of their trips which help one to realize the meaning and value of such experiences to a 4-H club girl.

My Trip to Chicago We met at the Burlington Station in Lincoln at 1:15 p. m. Satur - day, November 28, 1931. Mr. Frisbie gave us our tickets and we boarded the train at 1:50 p. m. At. last we were on our way. Lois Pierson, Irene Leymaster, Evelyn Frost and myself sat together on the train, in fact, we were great pals throughout the trip. Mr. Frisbie </seg>
            <seg id="p472">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE called our attention to the many historic settings along the way. We arrived in Omaha at 3:25 p. m. Our baggage was checked, notebooks were given to us in which we were to keep notes of our trip. Then we walked six blocks to the Rome Hotel, where we had a banquet and Mr. Diers, author of the song "My Nebraska", and the man in charge of the broadcasting station at the university, taught us some Nebraska songs. Mr. Frisbie gave us some instructions about our trip. We rode from the hotel to the Union Depot in a taxi. It is a beautiful build - ing, there is a lavender tint to everything. The man at the informa - tion desk told us a little about the depot. The building cost approxi - mately $4,000,000, taking one and a half years to build it. The chandeliers are 60 feet in length, containing 300 bulbs. Each chandelier cost $6,000. It was not quite time for the train so they took us through the dining room and kitchen of the depot. We. got on the train at 7:30 p.m. Our berths were assigned, mine was a lower, number 10. I shared it with Evelyn Frost. While the berths were being made we went in to visit the boys. Mr. Frisbie gave us further instruction about our trip. We filled out some blanks and registra - tion cards and bought our 4-H caps. We went to bed about 10 p. m. Evelyn and I did not sleep much as it was the first time we had ever been in a Pullman. . . The next morning, Sunday, we were called at 6:45 a. m. We had 45 minutes to dress and be all ready to get off the train. We arrived at the depot in Chicago at 7:30 a. m. There were newspaper reporters and photographers to take our pictures.

A group of us girls went to Thompson's, a restaurant a half block from the LaSalle Hotel, for our lunch. At 3:00 p.m. we again assembled in the lobby and walked to the Field Museum. It is a wonderful build - ing but we did not get time to see very much of it. At 5:00 p.m. we took taxis back to the hotel. In the evening a group went to church, but all those who were to be in judging contests the next morning did not have to go so I stayed in my room. Monday was International Live Stock Show Day. I ate breakfast at Child's restaurant which is right across the street from the hotel. Nebraska was in the first battalion which left the hotel at 8:10 a. m! for special elevated trains to the International Live Stock Exposition, led by H. M. Jones and Assistant Major H. R.

We got to Lincoln at 1:30 where Miss Runnalls, Mr. Frisbie and Miss Norris met us with fifteen more 4-H members. We got to Omaha at 3:25 and was met there by other members. At 4:00 we were taken to the Rome Hotel where we had dinner and Mr. Dlers, author of the song "My Nebraska" taught us some Nebraska songs. At 6:45 we took a taxi back to the Union Station and then we boarded our train for Chicago. They all went into one Pullman to visit as it was much too early to go to bed. There were sixty Nebraska 4-H members. We elected Miss Runnalls our official mamma and a man from the Agricultural College as our official father. The next morning we pulled into Chicago at 7:30. We had breakfast at the Union Depot there. Then we walked up to our hotel. It was the Hotel LaSalle. Miss Runnalls assigned us our rooms. I was with a girl from Lexington. At 10:00 a. m. we walked about a mile and attended church in the Central Church of Chicago. This building was so massive in structure and decoration that it is very hard to describe to anyone who has not seen it. We came back to the hotel at 1:00 o'clock and went to a small restaurant where we had luncheon. We unpacked and rested until about 3:00, then we walked out to the Field Museum which was about two miles from the hotel. We were so tired we could not stand very long. This building is so high that our voices just whirled and ros°. to the ceiling. At 5:00 o'clock the building was going to close so we decided to sing "My Nebraska" to get the group together. A police - man came and asked us not to sing any more. Everyone was too tired to walk back to the hotel so we decided we would take taxis. They put seven in a car and divided the fare. We had supper in groups as we had been going all day. Most of the groups were to go to church again in the evening but the girls having to judge the next day were to stay in the hotel and get a good night's rest and be ready In the morning. Monday morning we were called quite early and we went and had breakfast. Then we formed in a line four abreast — two girls and a boy on each side. That morning we walked down through main street as all of the Btates were there. We covered about six blocks. There were about a thousand of us as we marched. We walked to the elevated train where we were taken to the Live Stock Exposition Grounds. At ten the girls having to judge were taken to the Live Stock Inn where we were separated into groups. There were about forty who judged canning, our project. They served us dinners there as we were not through and could not leave the build - ing. At 3:30 we were to meet in groups to go to Wilson Company to be entertained for the rest of the afternoon. We were taken there </seg>

He said that the north pole was about 25 degrees warmer than the south pole The cause of this is on account of an ice age over the south pole Men have to dress very strangely to be able to live down there He said that at the north pole the snow would melt about four months of the year while at the south pole it did not. There are no people living at the south pole. As we left this place we were presented with autograph books and a large book containing the program and several interesting pictures. Upon leaving here we were put into large buses to go back to the Livestock Grounds. Everyone lined up to march in the arena of this building and they were going to announce judging winners. They announced Oklahoma as winning our class. Tuesday morning we girls took the elevated train out to the Light - ing Institute where a lady told us about the correct lighting of the home, store, theatre and town. She said frosted glass, colored lights shaded lights and indirect lighting were considered the best. We left here by taxis to go to the Art Institute where we saw many beautiful paintings. The one I liked the best was "The Song of the Lark". The building was so massive in size and has so many rooms and floors that we didn't get through all the rooms to see everything We left here to go to the Chicago Mail Order Company where we were to have luncheon. Before going into the lunch room we were shown through parts of the building. This is very interesting as they cer - tainly handle a lot of mail. We were served a very nice lunch and for souvenirs, received a pencil, books and a beautiful chrysanthemum. Then we went into another room where we were entertained by some radio artists and a style show. At 2:00 p.m. we were taken out to the Planetarium. This is a place where they study the stars, moon and sun. We were taken into a large room which was very dark but had a white dome with the skyline of Chicago around the edge. During the hour we were there the instructor took us through a year's time. Tonight we were to go to a party for all 4-H Club members. We walked over to the Sherman Hotel where we attended our own 4-H Banquet. The people in charge separated us and mixed us up according to states. There were five different states at the table where I sat. Two 4-H members did the announcing of events. Some of the things for entertainment were: a girl whistling many tunes, a boy from Oklahoma who played the harmonica. It was then an - nounced that the winner in the health contest had a score of 999/10% The winner was Nebraska's health girl. She had the honor of making the highest score ever made in a health contest. Our health boy </seg>
            <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION placed (ourth. It was also announced that the style show girl from Nebraska placed second in the informal banquet dresses. Nebraska is very proud of these girls. Wednesday morning we went out to the International Harvester Company. We were taken through the works which was about the nosiest place I have been in. Then we went through the twine works and watched them making binding twine. We ate dinner here and received a large book "Century of Wheat", a small note book and pencil; they are also sending us a picture of the group taken there. In these groups were two 4-H bands, Kansas and Iowa. They led the groups wherever we were going. During this luncheon a moving picture reel was given of the old reaper and of the combine of today. They also announced the prize winner of the International Harvester. We were told we had walked nearly twenty miles going over the two plants that morning. After this we were taken back to the Live Stock Show. There was some very fine stock and again we were entertained by our two bands and many others. About 4:00 o'clock we left to go to the hotel. About half of the Nebraska group went to the show. It was at the Chicago Theatre and we saw Will Rogers in "Ambassador Bill" which was very good. After it was over we had supper and then went back to the hotel where we dressed for a party that was given to the 4-H members in the LaSalle Hotel. We played games, were taught many new action songs and did many other things. This lasted quite late, after which we were dismissed to go to our rooms. Thursday morning we were guests of Montgomery Ward and Com - pany for breakfast. Upon arriving we were taken through the plant, then we had breakfast. This being only for girls, although Mr. Frisbie was along. Today was Gertrude's . birthday and Montgomery Ward and Company presented her with a beautiful cake. It was delicious. They also announced the Montgomery Ward Winners. Dorothy Davis was Nebraska's girl. She received a book "Art at Home" while we were presented with scissors with a four-leaf clover engraved together with M. W. &amp; Co., 1931. We left here in taxis to go to the National Broadcasting' Station located in the Merchandise Mart Building. This building covers more ground space than any building in the world although it is not the highest one. This was very interesting as a . guide explained it to us. The walls were of glass about an inch thick and there were three layers of glass, having air between each one. They broadcast over eighty-six stations through six different stations. At noon we went back to the hotel where we divided into groups of seven. I was with Miss Runnals. We ate lunch and then went shop - ping. We went through Marshall Field &amp; Company which is con - sidered the most expensive place in Chicago. Of course, we did not spend much money here. We also went to the Ten Cent Store where we could buy more. At 3:00 p. m. we taxied out to the Lincoln Park where we visited the conservatory which showed plants. We also -saw the small animals as well as the lions and tigers. Going back to </seg>
            <seg id="p478">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the hotel we decided we would take a double-deck bus We were given time to pack and take our bags and wraps down to the Leader's rooms before going to a buffet dinner to be served at 6:00 o'clock There we were entertained by radio stars, more of the winners were announced. At this time Nebraska was told they ranked second in receiving prizes in the United States with Indiana over us At 9 00 o'clock we came down from the. party to go to our train on which we were to go home. Our berths were all made up so we went back to the Club Car and waited. Mr. Frisbie got up and said that some - thing had happened that the railroad men were kicking about and that Nebraska had to correct it so they could go home with a clear title. He said that if anyone had anything to say he wished they would say it. Then he asked the health boy if he had anything to say. He said he had, so he came up and handed the health girl a birthday present from the Nebraska delegation. This surprised most of the people on the train as they didn't know what to expect. Friday morning we ate breakfast on the train and got into Omaha at 9:45. We had our pictures taken as we stepped off the train. We first planned to stay in Omaha until noon but we left in about an hour. There were five of us girls in Lincoln to come down in the evening so we stayed together during the afternoon and went shopping We ran onto many people we knew and were glad to see them since we had been gone a week. We arrived home quite late and tired but happy. I hope that I might get to come on one of those trips again as I feel it is well worth my time and money and I hope many more boys and girls may have the chance to go and really use it. I think more people could get more chances to win if they would put more of the 4-H spirit into their work. MARGARET MILLER, Geneva, Nebraska. • * * * Weeping Water, Nebraska, December 14, 1931. Miss Allegra E. Wilkins State Home Economics Division Agricultural College Dear Miss Wilkins: May I thank you for the trip you so graciously made possible for me so that I might attend the International Livestock Exposition as a 4-H Club winner. I understand that the Home Economics division is responsible and urges these annual trips and this department should be con - gratulated for the good it accomplishes for the 4-H members. The value of these trips cannot be expressed because I feel that I am now better equipped to carry the club work to other young people in the future. Respectfully yours, EDITH NORTON. </seg>
            <seg id="p479">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION &gt;ly Trip to the International Livestock Exposition at Chicago Along with my teammate, Helen Johnson, and the other county trip winners, I left Saturday, November 28 for Omaha to meet the Nebraska delegation. From the Union Depot we went 'to the Rome Hotel to dinner where Mr. Dlers, author o£ the song, "My Nebraska", reviewed with us some of the club songs. Here we were introduced to our leaders and became acquainted with other club members who were to be our associates for the coming week. As part of our trips were given by the Northwestern, and part by the Rock Island Railroad companies, our group had to split for their respective trains. Our group, whose trips were given by the Northwestern, boarded the train at 7:45 with Mr. L. I. Frisbie, and Miss Mary Runnalls, Mr. Ed Janike in charge. Both the boys and girls each had a Pullman and after getting nicely settled, the girls received an invitation from the boys to join them in their car for an evening of "get acquainted". The entire delegation ate breakfast in the Union Depot in Chicago. In the station we were given, our permanent marching positions for the rest of the week and one which was very effective and caused many comments from spectators. Two rows of girls marched with a single row of boys on each outer side. Nebraska's green and white caps made our group an outstanding one in the delegation. From the station we marched to the LaSalle Hotel where our group was registered- and our rooms assigned. The girls were given rooms on the fourth floor with three girls to a room. After giving us time to unpack and clean up we met in the lobby and went to Central Church where Frederick F. Shannon conducted the services. After lunch we rested until 3:00 o'clock, at which time the Nebraska boys and girls walked out to the Field Museum and spent the rest of the afternoon in going through the many rooms and seeing so much that our eyes were quite tired when we finally returned to the hotel. In the evening all of the 4-H Club members were privi - leged to go to church, but as Helen and I were to judge the next day we did not go but instead went to bed for a good night of rest. At 8:00 o'clock Monday morning we assembled in the lobby for instructions from Col. W. H. Palmer. Nebraska was put in Batallion I which left for the Congress Street Bubway, parading through the streets. I was particularly amused to hear, "Where yo all com from" asked by some of our marching neighbors from the south. This form of talk became quite popular with us before our return. The special trains arrived at the International Livestock Exposi - tion where everybody marched onto the grounds and assembled before the Boys and Girls Club Building where we were given an address of welcome by Mr. B. H. Heide, General Manager. At this point Helen and I left and went to the Saddle and Sirloin Club Building to enter into the judging contest which lasted until 1:00 o'clock. We spent </seg>
            <seg id="p480">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the afternoon In going over the grounds and finding the exhibits entered by Nebraska. Prom the exhibits we wandered over the grounds, gathering souvenirs and watching the broadcasting from the studios on the grounds. At 4:00 o'clock both of the battalions assembled In front of the club buildings and left immediately by special buses for the plant of Wilson &amp; Company. The Nebraska delegation then went to dinner and from there to the auditorium where we were privileged to spend one of the most enjoyable and entertaining evenings. Admiral Richard E. Byrd was a special guest who told of his experiences at the South Pole. His talk was especially interesting to me as he told of the establishing of "Little America". From the Wilson auditorium the 4-H'ers were taken by bus back to the Live Stock Grounds where the winners of the different divisions were announced and introduced to the crowds. All states paraded around the arena singing state songs or giving yells so that excite - ment ran high among the different groups. On Tuesday morning the girls left Immediately after breakfast for the Chicago Lighting Institute where we went through and saw the different model rooms. This was very interesting as It showed us the correct system of lighting and we enjoyed a very instructive talk on the effects of lighting. We were shown a very clever, yet inexpen - sive method of lighting a particular "beauty center" at night by taking a common 10 cent water pail and inserting a light through the bottom to make a spot light and reflector. The model modern house was very interesting to me and I would like to have spent more time in each of the rooms. To the Art Institute we hurried next, where room after room showed the reproductions of the actual masterpieces that we have learned to love from, miniature reproductions. "The Song of the Lark", along with "Mother", "Evening Hour" and "Madonna and Child" were the most impressive to me. Helen and I were almost late back to our group as we went to the extreme end of the building to see the Serving Table Service that Napoleon gave to his sister. This set was truly very beautiful and made us realize, yet wonder at its costliness. Prom the Art Institute we visited Chicago's "Little Theatre of the Sky", that is, the Adler Planetarium; which is the only one in the western hemisphere. Here we saw by the aid of complicated machinery the relation, of the stars to the earth on the different points of the globe. Many years passed, figuratively, before our very eyes, in the short time of Jive minutes and the talk given by Miss Maude Bennot ended too Boon. All expressed a wish to spend many more such hours with our "eyes and mind In the sky" breathlessly catching a glimpse of that which we cannot seem to comprehend in daily life. We came out into the crisp cold of the lake winds to view, I believe, the most gorgeous darkening sunsets, I have ever, seen, looking across the lake </seg>
            <seg id="p481">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION to see Chicago's black skyline with the lights beginning to blink on and off. On our way back to the hotel our taxi was stopped by a police - man and because we had heard so many stories of Chicago's gang - sters and policemen, we were quite relieved when he only wanted to know "from those farm girls from the west" where buttermilk came from! At 6:30 we gathered at the Sherman Hotel for the club members own banquet, or National Rally, one of the important features of the week. Wednesday was Manufacturer's Day. In the morning we visited the International Harvester Company and after tours through the plants we were the guests of Cyrus McCormick, Jr., at luncheon. Here we received some of our most prized souvenirs, not in actual value but because of their educational value. After luncheon we boarded the surface cars for the International Livestock Exposition to attend the horse show. By this time most of us were quite tired of the rushing crowd so after deciding to go to a theatre, we left the horse show and went to the "Chicago" to see Will Rogers in the picture called "Ambassador Bill". Evening brought the National 4-H Play and Recreation party in the ballroom of the Hotel LaSalle. Ruth' Ankerson, one of our old school mates, came down to our hotel to see us and talk about old times. Thursday was educational day, which " began with a breakfast party at the Montgomery Ward &amp; Company. Because it happened to be the national health champion's birthday we made it a real party by suggesting a birthday cake for our state 4-H club friend, Gertrude Heikes. After an entertainment and sightseeing tour of the plant we left for the National Broadcasting Company studios located in the Merchandise Mart which has the largest floor space of any building in the world. In this building we saw the many large "glass" rooms where many of our popular programs are broadcasted. I was quite pleased to see Paul Whiteman's orchestra. The many panels and control boards that send the programs over the air and other features were interesting to us. Our guide explained something of the work and detail of sinking all of the thousands of feet of wiring under the floor boards. The broadcasting company does not send their programs directly from these rooms onto the air, but instead the pro - grams are transmitted by telephone to another part of the city where they are picked up by the antennas. The girls split into two groups to visit the larger department stores, later scouting through Lincoln Park. Then followed a hurried packing and boarding our train for Nebraska and home. Everyone wanted to see the. Mississippi river but because we were so tired we fell asleep as soon as we were in our berths. The next morning we parted at the station after saying goodbye to our many new found friends. These trips, won by the 4-H Club boys and girls for out- </seg>

            <seg id="p489">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION THE HOMEMAKER'S PRESENT CHALLENGE For the past year and a half it has been my privilege to act as Mrs. True Homemaker over the University radio. Probably not so many of you out here in the western end of our state have been able to listen to my "Good morning everybody" three days a week, because they tell me that the reception for KFAB Is not good in western Nebraska. I have had 6000 women on my mailing list who have been more or less regular listeners and regular correspondents. So you see I have really been able to have contact with a considerable number of Nebraska Homemakers. Now I am glad to have this opportunity of meeting personally so many of you western Nebraska women. On your programs you will see that I am to talk about the "Homemaker's Present Challenge". Doubtless many of you are think - ing in terms of the financial crisis which faces our nation. It is true that the present lack of cash in rural families does offer a challenge to the homemakers. But I would have you look beyond the money problem and see that larger task of homemaking. I would like to place before you today two rather broad, but very important challenges; First to build a happy family life; and second, to breed citizens of sterling character with great moral courage and a highly developed sense of civic responsibility. Do you think it easy to accept those two challenges? I wish it were, but I'm afraid that the modern trend of family life is making it increasingly difficult to attain these goals. The home of the past has been largely a matter of sentiment. Great songs and pictures and poems have carried the home theme. Successful men have lauded their homes and their mothers. All these things have made us shake our heads over the good old days that are gone forever and the good old homes that will be no more. Not long ago a woman said to me, "The trouble with our country today is that the young married people are not satisfied to begin with what their parents had". I must confess that my estimate of that woman's intelligence sank considerably after that remark. Of course homes are not what they used to be, of course young married people today have more material possessions than did the young people a genera - tion past. There are more possessions to be had now than our fathers and mothers ever dreamed could exist. Automobiles and radios and theatres and electric refrigerators were not available a generation ago — but* they are available today and they do have a tremendous effect upon family life. There are two factors which, it seems to me, complicated this ' job of homemaking. The one I have Just mentioned — the modern inventions which effect standards of living. The other factor is that homemaking is becoming a more competitive profession. The home has always been the greatest domain of women. Women were thought to be born wives and mothers. No special training was considered necessary before a woman took up her homemaking responsibilities. And once married, in the good old days, it was a case of "till death </seg>
            <seg id="p490">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE do us part": What do we find now? Divorce statistics are given In larger and larger figures. In the good old days the whole family gathered around the fireside for the evening hours, after the day's work was^-done. What do we find now? Seldom do mother and dad, let alone the entire family, stay home and when they, do, it is the radio, not the fire, 'round which they gather. How about it, do we as homemakers have a real challenge? Dp we not have a real job if we are to build a happy family life? Some - one has said, wisely I think, that the homemaker is at the head of one of the greatest experimental laboratories of the world, where the principles of the science and art of right living are worked out daily. It's a tremendous responsibility to be at the head of a scientific lab - oratory as great as a home. About two years ago I read these words by Secretary of Agri - culture Hyde. They made such an impression that I copied them and I want to pass them on to you. "Effective action to raise living standards on our small farms is necessary not only in the interest of the farm people immediately concerned but in the interest of the nation. These farms are a source of population as well as food supply. They send their surplus population to towns and cities. Hence the entire nation suffers when living conditions on small farms make it difficult to rear and educate young people adequately there. Not agriculture alone but our entire national life stands to benefit from whatever may be accomplished toward the establishment of satisfac - tory standards of living on the small farm." Standards of living — you have heard that term often and prob - ably you have associated it with furnaces and running water and cars and such things. You are right, those things do enter into the stand - ard of living. But I believe that the social life of the family is also a part of its standard of living. So today I am going to stress those elements of social life in a family which would contribute to the establishment of the satisfactory . standard of living which Mr. Hyde mentions. Men cannot live by bread alone. It is not enough for a family to be so busy earning a living that It forgets to live. I think of a verse I read not long ago: If your nose is close to the grindstone rough And you hold it down there long enough. In time you'll say there's no such thing As brooks that babble and birds that sing. These three will all your world compose — Just you — the stone — and your darned old nose. Just so It is not good for the mother to keep her nose so close to the grindstone of housekeeping that she forgets her larger duties of homemaking. It is not the furnace nor the electric lights nor the </seg>
            <seg id="p491">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION bath tub that contributes the most to happy family life — it is the fine attitudes and relationships existing between members of the family that make the biggest contribution. Much has been written and much has been said about the im - portance of the homemaker's taking time out to plan her money and time expenditures. It seems to me no less important that she should take time to plan for the fun and social life of family. In these days there are many demands upon each member of the family. That is why we hear the modern home spoken of as a filling station and a dormitory. So unless definite plans are made for family good times, the chances are each member will seek his own amusement and there will be little family life. Times of financial stress, such as these, cause us to revert to simplicity. So I am going to suggest a few devices by which the family social life may be strengthened without a great outlay of cash. First, let me say that parlor games are coining back. Department stores report a decided increase in the sale of such games as parches!, backgammon, chess, checkers, etc. Card games, aside from bridge, are also gaining in favor; I think these and other old-fashioned parlor games can be the source of many a happy evening. They also offer opportunities for parents to instill principles of fair play, to strengthen character in their children. Second, conversation as a source of entertainment is almost a forgotten art in America. Mothers could do much to encourage general conversation, especially at the table. Instead of gossiping about the neighbors, why not encourage each member of the family to report on a current event? Stimulate interest in events of state and national Importance. Begin early to instill in children an appreciation of their responsibility as future citizens. Third, reading is one of the most profitable of entertaining measures. I believe that a mother should guide the reading of her children, and make subtle suggestions; but she should not out and out prohibit some literature and say read this or read that about other reading matter. I think we would do well to bring back the custom of reading a book aloud to the family. Many families have taken whole vacations right at home by just reading together travel books about the places they would have liked to visit. The whole family should be encouraged to make use of the public library, if one is available. If not, the State Library Commission stands ready to serve any community. Movies: Why not have the family go to the movies in a group once in a while? I think the moving picture should be used as more than entertainment — it may mean also education. A mother would do well to discuss with her children why a movie is good or why it is bad, to help children develop a sense of discrimination about plays. She can teach them to study not only the story or plot, but also to </seg>
            <seg id="p492">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE watch the filming of the picture. The costumes, the stage settings, whether or not an actor keeps in character, etc. Indeed, I can see where movies could be made the basis for a study of drama or for helping along any community' dramatic club. Radio: The radio has definitely entered the home life. I wonder whether we make the best use of it. A few years ago I paid $3.00 to listen to a concert by the U. S. Marine Band. Now when all I have to do is turn the dial to have the radio bring me a similar concert, probably. I don't bother to listen to it. Musical evenings or sings, for the talented family, might be a means of strengthening family or community ties. When we see the appeal the Seth Parker programs have made, we know that people love that type of home entertainment. Auto trips to nearby ponnts of interest could be taken by the entire family. Family picnics and weiner roasts can be made as much fun as class picnics for the youngsters, if mother and father can grow young again. I can see where birthday dinners and anniversary dinners can become a vital part of family life. A birthday cake with candles will do more to touch the heart, young or old, than any gift, be it ever so handsome. Sunday night buffet suppers and informal afternoon teas solve the entertaining problem for many homemakers. These two easy means of entertaining could be used for the children's friends just as much as for grown ups. Encourage children to bring, their friends into your home. Let them enjoy showing hospitality. However, it is only fair that children help assume the extra work which their company causes. A great educator has said that a father and mother of gentle culture and broad vision can . do more to endow a young man or woman than either Yale or Harvard. There is nothing which can supplant the home influence in the shaping of a young person's life. And so it Is with this challenge that I would leave you today — that you are professional women heading one of the most important laboratories in the world, that you have a real job in building happy family life which will breed citizens of sterling character, with great moral courage and a highly developed sense of civic responsibility. </seg>
            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION MilS. NEBRASKA HOMEMAKER THINKS ALOUD By MURIEL SMITH, State Specialist in Home Management There are great wishes. In the mind of the average Nebraska homemaker. How can she make those wisheB come true are her problems. There Is that water system so necessary which has been needed for years, she is wondering what her part may be to make it possible some time in the near future. Her neighbor has a water system and many conveniences which go with it. That convenience did not come without planning on the part of the homemaker. At the suggestion of the neighbor who has studied her home finance management problem by means of records and has started the average homemaker to thinking of how she could plan better her spending. The average homemaker then is started to thinking by reading a group of slogans as follows: It is smart to be thrifty. A plan' for spending is prophecy. . A record of spending Is history. The analysis of how ten families of five members spent their money for home purposes was next considered with reason and ques - tions as to the division and what -it would Include. The following figures were discussed as to their variance for different families. Time was devoted to the item of $300 which from the summary of records was the amount contributed to the living by products from the farm for families of five members. The average Nebraska home - maker thinks of what some of the ways might be in which she could improve her spending and management of money during the coming year in order perhaps to secure some of those things most wished for by her family. 1. Comfort In the home. 2. Satisfactory clothing. 3. The best available educational advantages. 4. Some of the Joys of living. 5. Necessary care of health. Every homemaker must think of her home finance problems as an individual case and use the information given merely as a guide and suggestion as shown by the illustration which follows: Home Expenditures Savings $ 60.00 Food purchased i 250.00 Food, home products % 300.00 </seg>

The success and safety of the voyage depended a good deal upon the captain's knowledge of the winds and waves and even more upon his possession of accurate charts upon which to plot his course from day to day. On the high seas of family finance it is only too often necessary to trim our sails to the head winds of circumstance. But here, too, there must be a destination always in mind, or the family ship will drift aimlessly about.

BURL HORNBECK We will agree, I am sure, if we have given the subject thought at all, that the many industries of the United States are so closely intertwined that one cannot suffer greatly without affecting all others. Certainly we are learning that the great basic industry, the industry upon which, every other depends for life itself, cannot suffer over a period of thirteen years without seriously affecting all economic groups. When 32 millions of farm people in the United States cease buy - ing anything except necessities, who besides the farmer must pay? The builder, the painter, our bankers and merchants, the railroads, factories, and our churches, all must pay and all are paying for the slump which carried the farmer down at the close of the great World War. The farm problem is not alone the problem of the farmer, but is the problem of every thinking man and woman in the nation, today. It is with a bit of reluctance that I even mention the word depression. Farmers, perhaps as no other group, appreciate the true </seg>
            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION significance of the word. Before the present general business depres - sion was known, farmers had passed through a ten-year period of serious price deflation. It has been a costly experience, thousands of farm owners have been compelled to sacrifice their land. Over-Production; 28% Under-nourished. I find as I go among rural people a feeling of bitterness and of rebellion. We are being reprimanded on every hand for overproduc - tion and yet statistics tell us that 28% of the nation's population are suffering through malnutrition; that in Chicago alone 85,000 families are facing a winter of hunger, and' yet we farm people know that fruit and vegetables are rotting on tree and vine for lack of a market, that bins are bursting with grain that will not pay for the harvesting, that thousands of acres of corn are shimmering in the sunlight across the great cornbelt today holding no promise of recompense for the preparation of the seed bed alone. With 40,000 milllonaries in the United States, with 6,000,000 of little under-nourished children, with 50 r /r of the money of the nation tied up in vaults, we are forced to believe that something is decidedly wrong with the distribution not alone of capital but with the distribution of life-sustaining products of the field so well. . The distribution of our own products will not be greatly Im - proved until its control rests with farmers themselves. At the present time there is being staged a last desperate effort by old line dis - tributors of our products to crush cooperative marketing. I do not disrespect them for it. it is only natural that they should destroy, if possible, the building of a marketing agency which threatens to turn the flow of profit on farm commodities from their pockets Into the pockets of the producers. The only thing about it all "that I cannot understand, is. the attitude of some farmers toward the cooperative movement. Cooperative marketing can be brought about through organiza - tion alone. I am quite willing to admit that organization may be wrong for. any Industry, but the fact remains that since every other group in the United States is organized, there is absolutely nothing for farmers to do except perfect their own organization. We Must Hold Together The great American Farm Bureau Federation is reaching across the entire nation, banding farmers into one tremendous force. Much has been accomplished, but much remains to be done. There are many stumbling blocks in the path of Its progress. Its own worst 'enemies are found in ..our own ranks. I have little respect for the ex-Farm Bureau member, who because of some petty selfish reason, has forsaken his own organization and uses his destructive influence in the little cross road country store or wherever he can secure an audience to tear down that which his broadminded fellow farmers have constructed. </seg>
            <seg id="p496">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Classed with him is the INFORMED non-member who stealthily slips into his pocket the savings brought about through the tax pro - gram of his local Farm Bureau and refuses to lift a finger to further the only means of preserving agriculture. I trust that some time in the near future public opinion will force that type to see themselves as others see them. In closing I believe in the promotion of farm organization because I see in it the hope of a unified voice reaching into the halls of legislation; I see in it the hope of striking from ourselves the shackles of an antiquated tax system (shameful to admit that in my own Illinois 10% of the wealth is bearing over 90% of the burden of taxation). I see in organization the hope of preserving our American farm homes, from which have come the greatest statesmen of our nation, our i greatest poets, artists, dreamers and inventors, because I see in it the hope of lifting agriculture to the dignified place that the basic industry of America deserves. Why do we women contribute our bit in the promotion of this great work? For a selfish reason I am willing to admit. Because we love the land on which we live. Because of the sweep of open sky and broad acres stretching away; of clean air and warm sunshine. Because we i see from our farm windows pictures more beautiful than were ever caught on canvas. Because we know down deep in our hearts that 'there IS no better place beneath God's sun to raise our children. j It IS worth fighting for and with the helping hands of Nebraska farmers clasping those of her sister states, and on across to the sea - coasts from Canada and to the Gulf of Mexico, we who feed and clothe this Nation's people will through ORGANIZATION secure an adequate standard of living and an Income from the farm to pay the bill. I I • : TIMELY FOOD PROBLEMS By MATILDA PETERS During; the World War we directed much of our attention toward the utilization of home grown and perishable foods in order that such staple foods as wheat, fats, sugar and meats might be conserved for the army and the allied nations. Food conservation was our watch - word at home. Gardening was encouraged and stimulated to a re - markable extent and much progress was made In perfecting methods of home canning. Since that time we have passed through an era of prosperity which has led many of us to disregard the valut of thrift. Many of our rural people seem to have forgotten how much the farm Itself may contribute to the living of the family, in other words how inde - pendent the farm family may be as regards the food supply. </seg>
            <seg id="p497">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION I had the privilege this year of reading the work sheets filled out by the Master Farm nominees, and I think I am safe in saying that in the majority of instances these women are seeing that most of the food used in their families is produced on the farm. None of the women who were visited complained of "hard times". During the summer of 1930 I attended a conference of extension workers in Colorado. At a meeting of nutrition specialists from dif - ferent states I was impressed with the way extension work In Arkansas and Nevada was being "tied up" with the economic situation. All extension projects were required to be on what they called a produc - tion basis. In both states a farmer who went to the bank to borrow money was questioned as to what extent he was making the living for his family on the farm. For example: How many cows was he milking? How many chickens did he raise? How much of a garden had he? How much butchering was done on the farm? Were the grocery bills paid by means of farm produce or was it necessary to depend on major crops for this? The banks were taking the stand that a farmer who was not making most of the living for his family on the farm was not sufficiently good security for a loan. Haven't we all known people who had difficulty in getting ahead because when the corn crop was marketed the proceeds were needed to pay outstanding bills, including groceries and meats? We have heard a great deal in recent years regarding the eman - cipation of the farm homemaker from her drudgery. Some of the things I have to say may sound like turning backward instead of progressing, but such is not my intention. At the present time we are facing a serious economic crisis and in order to meet it we need to revise some of our methods of home management. During the years of prosperity and good. prices for farm products it was logical that the homemaker should reap some of the benefits by making her work easier wherever it was possible. Accordingly, many women have stopped baking bread, home butchering has been discontinued and less emphasis has been placed on the importance of a good garden, since many farmers have felt that they could buy vegetables more cheaply than they could produce them. The question might be raised as to whether or not the time for leisure gained thereby has always been wisely employed. If bo, meeting the present crisis will mean using the time in a different manner so as to render it more profitable economically. What appeals to one woman as drudgery may be a pleasure to another because the latter Is spurred on by visions of the fruits or results of her labors. It all depends upon the point of view. One woman dreads the task- of canning because she thinks of only the hot kitchen and the routine work while another woman looks forward to the joy she will have in the shelves filled with neatly arranged jars and the freedom from worry when she plans her meals during the winter. </seg>
            <seg id="p498">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Inasmuch as Nebraska farms are able to produce practically everything needed tor a well balanced diet. It seems to me that atten - tion should be directed toward those ■ activities which contribute directly to the family living. This will include the garden, the orchard, the dairy, jthe poultry yard, the source of meat supply and possibly the apiary. Perhaps it will not be feasible to develop all of these on a given farm. Another viewpoint with regard to the above needs to be con - sidered more! especially on farms where there are children. The con - tribution which these activities make in the training in habits of industry and; thrift is too great to be overlooked. Frequently, some of these can be combined with 4-H Club work. It seems to me that gardens for 1932 need to be planned with much care. Careful estimates as regards amounts which can be used fresh and also for canning will prevent needless waste. The fruit and vegetable budget of the Extension Service will be of aid in this connection. iSome of the young vegetables which can be stored when mature make choice canned products. Carrots, beets, onions. It should be remembered that canned tomatoes are just as valuable a source of vitamin C as oranges. When Duncan Marshall was here a number of years ago he placed considerable stress on the use of local foods in meeting nutritive needs at low cost. He said he had round that his family could get its Iron just as well from oatmeal grown on their own farm as from California raisins. The orchard, of course, cannot be achieved in a single season as can the garden. With good care and trimming and spraying of trees at the proper time the yield may be increased and better quality products assured. The orchards in any community should be regarded as an asset. I have known farm women to boast that all of their canned fruit in that year was locally grown and not any of it shipped in. Some Nebraska orchards produce fruit in sufficient variety to make this possible. The drying of apples seems ito be done so rarely nowadays that many people do not know how good they can be. The dairy of course is indispensable when it comes to furnishing the quart of milk for each child and a pint for each adult. The cream and butter in addition to furnishing valuable sources of fat-soluble vitamins and energy add elements to luxury and palatability to the diet. Cottage cheese makes a good source of protein- for the evening meal occasionally and may be used in a number of recipes. The poultry yard of course furnishes the delectable fresh eggs which are the envy of all city dwellers as well as some of the most delicious meats we have. When it comes to the meat supply for the farm home everyone will agree that buying all of the meat is expen - sive, even now when meat prices have fallen, but when there Is com - paratively little ready money. Prof. Derrick's demonstration yester - day should be of material assistance In helping you with problems </seg>
            <seg id="p499">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION of home butchering and curing of meat. Butchering rings are work - ing out successfully in many communities and help to make fresh meat available over a longer period of time. Meat canning makes possible a variety which is most welcome when interspersed with cured meats, chicken and fresh meat from the market occasionally. By browning or pre-cooking a part of the meat before packing in jars and packing some raw, a variety of canned meats is also possible. At butchering time we are making the best possible use of sundry parts such as liver, heart, tongue, kidney, brain and sweet breads? These are expensive delicacies in exclusive city restaurants and are enjoyed by people who have learned to eat them. Furthermore a number of these are excellent sources of iron and vitamin B — better than meat itself, in fact. Home butchering also Includes rendering of lard and proper methods will result in a most satisfactory product. We find highly advertised vegetable fats being recommended for practically the same culinary purposes as butter and inference is even made that result - ing products are superior. Doesn't it seem reasonable that high quality lard might serve the same purpose and very frequently the flavor might be improved with the substitution of a small proportion of butter? In recipes which call for chocolate, brown sugar, honey, molasses, or spices any flavor which lard may Impart to mild flavored foods is well concealed. When we use lard we are not paying a big price for the advertising of a hydrogenated cottonseed oil. It comes back again to having greater respect for our own Nebraska products. Are we throwing away our waste fats or are we utilizing them in soap making? Both toilet and laundry soap are easily made with a small expenditure of labor and the cost of the finished product is but a small part of the commercial product. People who are hard pressed financially and feel that activities of this type do not pay need to ask themselves whether or not they are using their time for something that pays better. If so, they are of course justified in not doing them. In quite a few sections of Nebraska we are finding a surplus of honey. To many people it never seems to occur that honey can be used for anything other than a spread, but It may be used as the sweetening agent in numerous recipes and impart a delicious flavor. Cakes and cookies made with honey have superior keeping qualities. Fruit cakes, candies, upside down cakes, pie fillings are only a few recipes in which honey may be used. We are being urged to use some of our wheat surplus in the form of cereal ground either at home or in a local mill rather than the commercial cereals with the long roundabout journey through the hands of numerous middlemen. One commercial wheat cereal sells for 18 cents for a 22 ounce package, making $7.85 per bushel; a 12 ounce package selling for 12% cents would be $10 per bushe]. </seg>

            <seg id="p501"/>
            <seg id="p502">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Still another 4 ounce package selling for 15 cents would amount to $36 per bushel. Do not these figures suggest a real saving? These prices do not mean that your local grocer is profiteering. There seems to be a tendency toward shorter times for cooking cereals than have been advocated in the past. At least two of the large cereal concerns have done some research work along these lines and do not get evidence that people in general prefer the cereals cooked a very long time. At least as many seem to prefer cereals cooked 10 to 30 minutes as those cooked for a longer time. This procedure is not recommended for very young children. In meeting present day food problems the time used in meal preparation should receive consideration. In our zeal for recommend - ing vegetables we have sometimes been inclined to suggest two or three vegetables in addition, to potatoes and the result is a rather pretentious meal. Wouldn't it be just as well to have a larger serving of one vegetable, cooked or as a salad, in addition to potatoes instead of two smaller servings of different vegetables and thus save time and labor in meal preparation? When a fruit salad is served why not let it serve as a dessert? The one-dish meal is one solution to the problem of simplifying meals. The meat or other protein and potato or other starchy vege - table may be combined in a single dish often as a stew or casserole dish. This with bread and butter, a simple dessert and milk con - stitutes a nutritious meal with little effort. Some one has said, "The mixing of foods to form a meal perfect in harmony of color, in nicety of flavor and in palatability requires skill equal to that used by an artist at his easel." With our present day knowledge of foods we might add the proper balancing of food groups. Good judgment as to combinations and flavorings are essential to achieve success. When a casserole is used, the food is served in the same dish in which it Is cooked and is also kept hot easily. I have prepared some sugges - tions for one-dish meals to give out to you. For the most part these make use very largely of Nebraska goods. These menus are sugges - tive and may be varied to meet individual needs. When we stop to count our blessings even in this period of depression, we realize that when it comes to living the farmer is more fortunate than people who are situated so they have no means of producing foods. Given favorable weather conditions, the Nebraska farm can produce practically everything that is needed to promote good health which is after all the greatest of all blessings. </seg>

WIGGANS: I think we are unfortunate this morning m two or three respects, unfortunate because the president of the Horti - cultural Society sent word that he was ill and consequently couldn't be here; unfortunate also m that too much condensed moisture Is coming down right now. Consequently, the attendance this morning is not nearly as big as we had hoped it would be. If the people who are interested m gardens knew the difficulty we had m securing this room, more would have been here. We had to fight for it, because we felt we needed a room of this size to hold the large number of folks who are interested m the subjects to be discussed here today. Any class-room on the campus would have been ample for the meet - ings had we known that a' blizzard was scheduled by the weather man. </seg>
            <seg id="p510">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 4 uore people will probably be here later. I am sure that the speakers can feel that quality is here even if we do not have as much quantity as we would like to have. Garden people are always interested in something new. They like to hear about new things and new plants to grow. In the last two or three years interest has been evidenced along specialized lines. We have come to the point where we are not satisfied with the same old things. We have to have rock gardens and so forth and today we have a |inan who has made a specialty of the. water garden. A few months ago when I came through Beaver Crossing I saw some interesting things. We have here this morning a man who has planned and developed the water gardens at Beaver Crossing and Mr. Smiley is going to tell us something about plants for the water garden. i . • PLANTS FOH THE WATER GARDEN 1 By MR. ERLE SMILEY, Beaver Crossing Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: As you all know, water gardening is comparatively new to most of us. It is hard to get reliable information about new things. We have made a specialty of water gardening during the last few years in Beaver Crossing. We have had all the experience and hard luck that come with a new proposition. We have made mistakes in buying water lilies, in the kinds of plants put in, and so forth. In water gardening the trouble with most people is that they make the pool too small. It does not make any difference how large you make it, it will not be large enough Every year you will want more room. Make it just as large as you can. However, It is not necessary to have a big pool to have a water garden. You can saw a barrel in two parts, or take an old wash tub and by selecting the proper plants make 1 an interesting water garden. There are some plants that people are not familiar with which are used in water gardening. I will tell you how they grow, what they are good for and which ones to use. Water cress is quite a plant for a water garden. It grows rank during the summer. It is often used for salads. It is especially good if you can grow it in very shallow mud, trough or box in one corner of the pool. The roots grow on top of the water and a very small end of it will be in the mud. The creeping primrose has a yellow flower about the size of a quarter. It grows around the surface of the pool. Parrots-feather grows on top of the pool and almost covers it. It has to be pinched back. It trails out of the edges of the pool. It opens in the morning and closes in the evening. It is very beauti - ful in the pool and stays green practically all the time. Then there </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY is Myrlophyllum. This is one of the plants you want in your water pools all of the time. It is an oxydizing plant. It is good for flBh. The fish deposit eggs on it. If you are raising tropical fish, do not use it. It will turn the water dark. Cabomba will not. Lotus Cabomba is good for the aquarium. It is not used in the pool unless you are raising gold fish. I stumbled onto a new one by accident. It is one of the best. It is sometimes called water fern or Anacheris. It makes a beautiful background in the pool. It will grow rank. There are two varieties of Anacheris, the wild variety and the tame variety. The tame variety is larger. The wild does not grow quite so rank. It is a good oxidizing plant and should be in every pool. In building a pool, most all catalogs will tell you to slope the sides of the pool. I do hot like this type. It is hard to get into the pool to put plants in. It is also more difficult to clean. I like a pool with straight sides. In building a pool, build it so that you will have a four-inch clearance, have twelve inches of water over the lilies and twelve inches of dirt. Be sure that there are twelye inches of water over the lilies. Some lilies will grow in a shallow place in one pr two inches of water and some in four feet of water but practically all will thrive in twelve Inches of water. The soil must be very rich. The richer the soil the better the bloom. Give the plants a lot of room. A good plan is to have at least one cubic foot of soil for every lily plant. The more the better. The more room the more bloom. The bloom will come quicker and last longer. . For some reason people want the water in their pools to be per - fectly clear. As soon as the water becomes green, the owner gets excited and drains the pool. This ruins the leaves on the lilies. Whenever you drain the pool and expose the lily pad and stem to the air and sun, the leaves will ■ come off. Instead of taking thin water all out, leave it there. To be sure it will turn green, but by using 23 grains of blue vltroil to every thousand gallons of water the alyse will- be killed. This does not bother the lilies or the fish. To keep the sides of the pool clear, paint them with a solution or blue vitriol, then fill with water and algae will not come on quite so soon. Rinse the pool before putting the fish and lilies back in. There are two varieties of Water Hyacinth, one with a bulb that floats and the other you have to plant. The one with the floating bulb will give lots of bloom, but the other will give more. The one with the floating bulb will turn very light through the summer unless you crowd them. Crowded into a. corner, you will find that the bloom will come in sooner. You can keep the plants in place by a small wooden frame. They will become very thick. • The water hyacinth will bloom one day and then wilt, but the blossom for that day is worth while. They are beautiful things. In </seg>
            <seg id="p512">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the latter part of August the bloom is heaviest and will stay until frost. Another good plant is the Water Poppy. This is planted in soil. It has three petals and they are canary yellow in color. They are about the size of a dollar and even larger. Then there is Water Lettuce. We do not use this. It has a but' on it which makes the plant look ragged. It is necessary to take the plants out and dust them if the bugs are kept off. It also takes up too much room in the pool. Arrowheads are nice. They can be picked up in swamps. It is necessary to know how to dig them, however, for they root very deeply. If you want to buy big ones, nursery firms stock them. Cat-tails can also be found in swamps. These are also hard to dig. They are too large for most back yard pools. The lotus is another charming plant for the large pool. The blossoms are beautiful but only a few are produced during the season, and salamanders. If you have fish, salamanders should not be used. It will take all of the pool if you are not very careful. It grows rank and high. Scavangers are needed in all pools. There are tadpoles, snails They eat the tails and fins off of the fish. They do not care for the same kind of food as do the fish. There are several varieties of snails. Do not use the Four Horned Singapore. They will eat plants. A good snail is the Japanese Trapdoor snail. It is a live bearing snail and multiplies rapidly. They grow to the size of a black walnut. The African Earhorn is good. They are light yellow with brown spots. They- lay eggs. A pair will produce several thousands during a season. They are short-lived, however. There are three varieties of Ramhorns, the reds, browns and blacks. These are very nice for a pool. Everyone wants a few fancy fish. In fact they are almost a necessity. Mosquitos lay their eggs in the calm water of the pool and there the larvae develops in great numbers unless the pool con - tains fish. Provide the fish with Myriophyllum or Water Hyacinth to deposit their eggs on. After spawning remove the water hyacinths or the snails will eat the eggs. Take them out and transfer them to another pool where there are neither snails nor large fish. If you leave them In the pool, a few will hatch but the percentage is small and those that do hatch will fall an easy prey to the old fish. Water lilies are the most interesting part of the pool. We use hardies.practlcally altogether. Tropicals take more room. You have to have a greenhouse to carry over tropicals. The blossoms come early in April on hardies while tropicals will not be out until along in June. </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Some blossoms open at daylight, others open at eight, nine or ten in the morning. Usually they open about eight and stay until about four or four-thirty. They bloom for four days. The first day they come out late and close early. After the blossom is through it will sink and go down out of sight. Very few hardy varieties are seed bearers. To get the best blooms from your lilies keep the leaves well picked back. Do not let them bunch. When a leaf turns color, pull it off. Pull it off close to the plant. The Chromatella is the best lily but bunches the worst. There are two very good yellows. The Chromatella is the most popular. It gives lots of growth and is very reasonably priced. A big one is the Sunrise. The blossoms are eleven inches across. It Js beautiful and has lots of blossoms. In the whites the Gonnere is best. It is one of the very few double hardy water lilies. It is just like a big ball. The Gladstone is the next best. It has a very brilliant white blossom with a yellow center. There is also the Marliac white. The Tuberose Richard Son! 13 a beautiful plant but it produces very very few blossoms during the year. The ones it does have are worth while. It takes lots of room. The Odorotta Gigantia is the largest of the Odorotta section but does not bloom a great deal. You have to have a large pool and do not care how much room It takes. It is very short-lived. The Odorotta Minor is a little white one. It is useful in a tub garden. There Is not much blossom but it is very nice. Of the reds the James Braden is not quite so brilliant a red but Is excellent for blossom. The Conqueror Is the largest of the reds, but. unless your pool is semi-shaded do not use this particular variety. It burns in the sun. It is beautiful but it takes lots of room. The Attraction is the most beautiful of all. It will bloom more than any other variety. It blooms continuously. It has large beautiful red flowers. The Escarboucle is a beautiful red but must be planted In shallow water not more than eighteen inches. The Glorosia is the most popular of the reds. Everyone seems to have that particular one. It is not the best one by a long way. It Is not very red. It is more of a deep pink. The William Falconer is a very unusual lilly. It opens pink, turns darker the second day and still darker the third day. On the fourth day it is almost a blood red. The Arethusa Is practically the same as the William. Falconer but does not get quite so red. In the pinks the Sumptuosia is the most popular and one of the best. There is a star shaped lily known as the Ambilis. It is a very free bloomer and a very delicate shade of pink. The Splendida is a strawberry shade of pink. The Morning Glory is the best bloomer. It is. a very delicate shade of pink when open. On the last day It is almost white. The Rose Krey is the most beautiful of all pinks but does not stay long. The Eugenie de Land is a very delicate Bhade </seg>
            <seg id="p514">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of pink. The tips of the plant are white. The Pink Opal has lota of bloom. It is not very large. The Tuberose Rosa is a very nice pink It comeB about four or nve inches above the water to bloom. The most interesting of all the lilies are the copper colored ones The most popular is the Comanche. The blossoms are almost yellow the first day and the fourth day it is almost red. During the four days it is four different shades of color. The Sioux is a good deal like the Comanche although not quite so large. The Aurora Is similar in color but very small. It should be used in a tub garden. These are the ones we find best for our water garden. I do not know anything about handling the tropicals. i Discussion Question: Should the roots of the Water Hyacinth reach the soil to bloom? Answer: f It is not necessary. We never plant them in any soil. Question: Will the blooms be larger if planted in the soil? Answer: I have not tried it that way. Question: Do you put the Water Poppy in the same as the Water Lily? | Answer:; Yes. There is no limit to how deep you put it in. Do not put in the Floating Poppy. Insects eat it. It is not a good plant for a pool. , . ' Question: Will the sets grow from the common wild Water Lily? Answer:' Yes. Question: How do you plant them? Answer:, Do not let the set get dry. Keep it damp all the time. Plant it at a forty-five degree angle. Leave most of the plant out It will grow a lot better. Question: Are there any "blue water lilies? Answer: There are no blue hardy water lilies. Question: How do you paint the pool. Answer: Ten cents worth of Blue Vitriol will cover a large pool It takes quite a while to get it into solution. Question': Do you just dissolve it in water? Answer: , Yes. Question: What should one pay for a good lily root? Answer: If you have a pool and want lots of bloom do not buy Odorota whites. Odorota Minor and Tuberose Richard Soni are cheap lilies. You can guess the kind of blossoms from the price of the lilies. You pay most any place $1.50 and $2.00 for the Chromtllla This is the most reasonable for the number of blossoms. The Sunrise </seg>
            <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY will cost $5.00. It is worth the money. The Gonnere white is $5.00 That is the standard price throughout the country. There are lots of places where the lilies are misnamed. In laying in a supply one will often get lilies which are not named correctly. Unless you know where you are buying, you may not. get the right ones. A reliable house will give you what you ask for. The Gladstone White is good. It is 51.50 to $2.00, depending upon the size of the root. Do not buy the Marliac White in preference to the Gladstone. In reds the stand - ard price of the James Braden is $3.00. It Is worth the money The Conqueror is $4.00. The Attraction is $5.00; the Escarboucle is $5.00 - the William Falconer is $5.00; the Gloriosa is $3.00. This has lots of blossom but is not a deep red. It is more of a pink. The Sump - tuosa is $3.00 and the Amabilis is $5.00. Three to four to five dollars is what you should pay for a good lily if you want lots of bloom. Question: What care shall we give the lilies during the winter? Answer: Take up as much dirt as possible. Put just enough water over them to keep them moist. Do not put them where it Is too warm. Question: Can you keep them in a cold place? Answer: You can keep them any place where the crown does not freeze. Do not let the crown of the root freeze. Question: Shall I divide the plant in the spring? Answer: Yes. Question: How much should you leave of the original plant? Answer: Take the whole back crown. The size of the root does not make a lot of difference. It is the size of the crown that makes the difference. Question: What fertilizer should be used? Answer: Use cow manure well rotted. Do not take it from where there have been pigs. This will burn the roots. Question: Can you use blood meal during the summer? Answer: Yes, If you want more blossom. Question: Bonemeal would be better than Vigoro, wouldn't it? Answer: I don't know. I have not tried it. Question: What kind of soil do you use? Answer: Rich soil. Lilies like muck which is rich in decaying leaves and stems. An old pond gone -dry is good. Question: What is the best way to finish the Inside of the pool? Answer: Some people use black asphalt to keep algae off instead of Blue Vitriol. Let the water set in the pool a week before putting the fish in. Question: Does not Blue Vitrol bother fish? Answer: No. It helps gill trouble. </seg>
            <seg id="p516">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Question: How early should we start lilies? Answer: Hardies should be planted just as early as you can put them out. The sooner you can the better. We leave ours In the pool all the time. We have running water. Question: How many lilies should be put in a fourteen foot cir - cular tank? Answer: That depends upon the varieties. About four would give enough if they are good varieties. The more root room the better the blossom. It would be worth while for you to come to Beaver Crossing to see our pools. Come about ten o'clock in the morning. There will be someone there to give you any information you desire. We some - times have a thousand people on Sundays. If anyone is actually interested we are glad to tell them about the lilies. You are welcome at any time and welcome to come often. Question: If you have twelve inches of water and then twelve inches of soil, don't you have to have pretty deep pools? Answer: Thirty inches is the depth of all of our pools. This gives one foot of soil and one foot of water and four inches, of clearance. Question: If you take the water lilies in in the fall and they get dry, does that hurt them? Answer: If they get too dry they will rot. They should be kept moist. I forgot to mention fancy varieties of gold fish. The Japanese and Chinese are the originators of them. They come in all colors, calico colors, blues and light blues. We have one light blue and one /■with a yellow head. MR. WIGGANS: I am sure that the number of questions which have been asked show our Interest. I can personally vouch for some of the things that Mr. Smiley has been telling about the Interesting things to see around his place at Beaver Crossing. The next subject for discussion deals with annual plants. Some - times, we think of annual plants as being a poor man's ornamentalR. With just a few cents anyone can have a garden. I mean c-e-n-t-s. Of course, you have to have s-e-n-s-e along with it. With just a small - amount invested we can have quite a showing if we use only the annual plants. We have with us a man who can tell, us a great. deal about this type of garden. Mr. Balch of the Kansas State Agricul - tural College is going to tell us about arranging annual flowers In beds. </seg>
            <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ARRANGING ANNUAL. FLOWERS IN BEDS* WALTER B. BALCH Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station Annuals are classed as those plants which are grown from seed for summer flowering. In the past few years there has been a decided improvement in the varieties of the annuals available but there have been few if any novelties of merit. The annuals grown in the home garden give a pleasant relief from the carnations and roses of the florist during the winter and at the same time keep us ever mindful of flowers and their uses so that we will use more of them during the winter months. Few things make a home prettier or make a more acceptable gift than a basket of summer larkspur or a vase of eapi - glosls or scabiosa. Perhaps the growing of them will cut down the calls you will make on your florist but the flowers will be the more appreciated for ■ your having grown them yourself. Too, they will often cause you to appreciate more the art of the florist in growing the plants to flower, for there is more to the growing of the annuals than throwing down a handful of seed of various sorts and going out and cutting flowers a few weeks or months later. Also after one has spent time and work in producing a crop of flowers he finds that he cannot always get them just as the florist does. This talk is to be -on the growing of the flowers rather than the arrangement of them. It isn't that the annuals will ever replace the perennials or the green - house roses and orchids, if you can afford them, but they serve to give us flowers at a season when we want them most and at a cost less than we would have to pay if we were to buy them. There are only a few rules to follow in the planting for effect. We see along railroad stations and sometimes in other places beds of coleus, Joseph's Coat and similar plants. These may be in the form of a star or a crescent or some design that has a significance to the particular spot where it is being used. As a rule these forms look good If they are rather large, do not contain too many colors and are for a strictly formal effect. For the home planting I think that it is better if we do not have much of this kind of planting. A large circle of annuals, or any other kind of planting, in the middle of a lawn disfigures the lawn and leaves us with neither lawn or Bower bed. If you want a formal planting and a spot of color have it up against a building or in a corner of the' lawn rather than in the center. Avoid making the flowers conspicuous. The feeling one should have about the flowers is much as we generally think of the Violet. It Is shy and is hidden and yet it does not hide itself so thoroughly as to be unseen. In the one case the owner has something to sell and he may have to push his wares. In the other case we want umt •Contribution No. 100, Department of Horticulture. </seg>
            <seg id="p518">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE dignity and should perhaps consider it as though the plants had some feelings and that they should be considered. It should be borne In mind that the flower garden is a private and not a public thing and that the privacy is enjoyed by you and not the folks that pass by. That may seem a bit selfish and It is not easy to put into words, but I think that if you will look back on the flower gardens that have appealed to you most you will realize that they were those that were t ucked away in some appropriate corner rather than popping up til you every time you turned around. In our gardening we do not attempt to improve on nature but merely to imitate her perhaps as she does when man has not inters fered with her. I think that nowhere in nature does one find a big regular bed of flowers jumping up at him out of the prairie. The Mowers may be in groups spread all over the prairie but they never pick out one spot and avoid others. Usually they are found nestled in draws, under the canyon or amongst the trees of a little forest Now as to the arrangement of the flowers in the spot we have picked for our garden. One of the most common questions is what colors may one use together? The answer is, do as nature does. Then one finds that nature mixes her colors promiscuously and that she does not worry whether a blue and a red variety are together or whether a pink one is between them. I will admit that there oro certain arrangements of colors of paints and dyes that do not go well together and that often we spoil a good natural color effect by putting into it a brightly and often hideously painted bit of garden furniture, but so far as natural flower colors are concerned we need not worry about clashing and improper color arrangements. If we find we need a bit of furniture in the garden we are Bare if we paint it a dark brown or a white. I prefer the brown because it will not show weathering so soon and because it 1b less conspicuous than white. That, however, is a matter of personal taste and one may do as he pleases about it. The same is true about mixing the colors in the flower beds. In my classes in floral arrangement I tell the classes that in my mind we can, with one or two exceptions. Use any of the flower colors In the same bouquet without danger. To my mind we can, but every year I find someone that objects to one arrangement while others who approve of that- one do not like Bome other. That is a matter of personal taste and I would be among the last to try to change your personal tastes but I think that you, too, should be tolerant of other people's personal tastes. Allow them the same freedom of color selection that you desire. There are perhaps one or two general rules of the arrangement of the flowers in the bed that may need mention. One would not think it but often one finds the taller growing flowers in the bed on the outside. This arrangement gives the effect of a screen for the smaller ones and as a rule cuts out the sunlight that they need. Thus we </seg>
            <seg id="p519">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY not only lose the value of the other flowers farther back but they are afforded an inferior development, and again we see that the arrangement is closely tied up with the good cultural practices. The stiff er and more natural growing plants look better when not mixed together. It looks too much like a formal evening dress at a picnic to have a stiff growing salvia beside, let us say, a Violet. That, however, comes from experience and after a year or two one puts together those that do best together without much thought, while, until one has grown them and seen the better and the less desirable together, no amount of talking or thinking about It will help. So much for the actual arrangement of the flowers in the beds. Let your judgment be the deciding factor, for the flower garden Is yours to enjoy in your ouside room in the summer. If others do not agree with you in the way you have put them, do not feel that they are superior to you, and on the other hand do not feel that they are inferior to you. No two people are exactly the same in anything and in our flower gardens we get a chance to work with nature and express ourselves. This is a very desirable thing and we should encourage rather than discourage it. As I have said in the beginning of this talk the important thing is the growing of the plants and with these few remarks about the actual placing of them let us go where we can set down more or less certain rules. Here we can devote our time to something that Is the result of experience and that does not change with the person. To have good plants we must grow them correctly and cultural prac - tices have certain "don'ts" that we must observe if we are to have real pleasure from our garden. Some of us grow the plants because we want to cover up some unsightly spot. Others want a bit of color all summer long and still others want some cut flowers and do not care much about the other factors. Really, each has a separate problem that would require a long time, to study out and find an individual answer for. In some cases we find the city man who is able and willing to water the plants whenever in his judgment they need water. Then, too, there is the • city man who wants something that will grow without water and still is not a cactus. Even a cactus needs some water and needs It at the right time or it will die. Then there is the person in the country who has to find a time when the men folks are not too busy with the spring work so that the garden spot may be spaded; after the plants are started there is little if any chance to water them. For the city person there is a wealth of material to use. Any seed store has packets of seed in the spring including countless . annuals and if your Nebraska conditions are not very different from ours in Kansas almost any of them will grow well if given the proper care: However, there is one exception to make here. Cheap seed </seg>
            <seg id="p520">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are not always good seed and if you buy seed because- they are cheap you are rather apt to be disappointed. It is -the same with seed as with any other thing you buy. You get what you pay for and if you take the cheapest packet you are apt to get old seed, mixed seed and seed that has a poor germinating ability. The cost of the teed is so small per plant that I wonder why it is possible for seedsmen to sell some of the poor stuff that they put out and get rid of only because it is cheap. When you are worried about the price of a packet of seed think of the florist who buys pansy seed that cost $15 to $20 an ounce and petunias that cost more per ounce than gold does. Of course these seed are small and one gets a large number of plants from an ounce but cheaper seed are no larger and Would be used had the man who makes a living growing plants not found out that the cheap -seed is, in the long run, the most costly. So when ordering your cataloges this spring or when you go to your local seedsman for seed go with the idea of getting the best even if the best does cost ten cents a packet rather, than five. Having made up your mind to get good seed you may wonder what kind, of seed to get. All of the factors that I mentioned in the beginning are to be included and in addition there is your personal taste that will influence you a lot. I think that three annuals that everyone should have who wants a' bright spot in his yard, are the salvia (scarlet sage), the petunia and the vlnca or the periwinkle. These will stand the hottest of summers and will do with the least amount of water and care. Yet when they get care and water and are in a good soil they will do even better. Of the annuals for cut flowers we have calendula, scabiosa, sweet alyssum, candytuft, annual phlox, sweet peas, asters, calliopsis, balsam, nasturtium, marigold, zinnia, centuria, portulaca, morning glory, and stock. From these one will have bloom from early in the spring till frost takes the asters and stocks, which will not come into bloom until the fall days reduce the amount of sunlight which is available. One perennial that is handled as an annual is the pansy and it should be added to this list of desirable plants for the amateur to have in his garden. Another perennial that often is handled as an annual 1b the snapdragon and this, too, could be in any garden. The list given here is getting long. It is far better to have a few well grown plants than to try to plant the whole place into flowers and then neglect them all the rest of the year. Such gardening is discouraging and takes away the pleasure for years to come. Plant a lot less than you think you can handle and you are apt even then to have more work then you want in July and August. We cannot always have the plants where we would prefer them but it will do no harm to suggest an ideal . location for them. Then if you have a choice of several places you can take that which is most nearly the Ideal. First, I would say, is a southern slope. This </seg>
            <seg id="p521">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY la because It warms up earliest in the spring and so makes It possible to start the plants sooner. By an early start we get a good growth started before the less favorable weather of the summer comes along and also the plants have a longer blooming period. The next factor would be protection from the north, because it will be protected from the first fall frosts, and we will thus haVe flowers in the fall after the neighbors have lost theirs. The soil should be well drained so that there will never be water standing on It, for if there is any one thing that plants will not stand for, it Is the having of their feet in the water. Nearness to trees is another important factor. Tree roots get from the soil the water and plant foods that the flower plants should have and. it is claimed that one should not have the flower plants nearer than fifty feet to a large tree. I think that if one remembers that the root system of most trees spreads about as far from the trunk as the tops spread above the ground, one will be safe and will not have much trouble in that direction. If one has plants that are shade requiring, one should plant them near the house or a building, for then the shade is furnished but the water and plant food are not drawn from the soil as in the case where one plants them under trees. It is claimed, too, that certain trees, notably the walnut, give off toxic material that will injure any growth that is attempted under It. I have not made a study of this for I think that one should not try to have the flowering annuals under any trees. Having selected our seed and our site we must now prepare the site. ■ The first step in . the addition of manures or other forms of organic matter such as a cover crop. This really is not so important with the annuals as with the perennials, for one can add a little each year and have a satisfactory growth of the plants. However, one will have a better growth of the plants and will get more benefit from the use of commercial fertilizers if he has In the soil rather large amounts of organic matter. Like all good things the amount of organic matter can be overdone so that it will depress the plant growth. Where the soil is not subject to blowing fall plowing is the mont desirable. Fall plowing gets the soil into better physical condition and goes a long way toward the control of insects and diseases. It also leaves the soil ready to plant earlier in the spring for the top soil dries out faster when it is plowed than when it is covered With the stubble of last year's growth. Where one can fall plow he can add the manure in the fall before the plowing or spading and at that time he can use fresh manure. If the manuring is done in the spring well rotted manure can only be used with safety. Lime should be added In the spring if one adds manure in the fall and vice Versa. After the plowing the cultivating should begin. One cannot work the soil too much or too often providing he does not try to work It when it is too dry or too wet or when frozen. It is In the working of the soil that I find most failures In the annual flower garden occur. </seg>
            <seg id="p522">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The fault is usually that the soil is not worked down far enough There should be no coarse particles in the soil when the job is finished or when the plants or seed are put in the beds. Coarse soil dries out too quickly at the surface so that when seed are planted they dry out before they germinate. It is often in such chunks that it Will cover the seedlings and if the seed should germinate they cannot come through the ground. In our gardens at the college in Manhattan 1 tell the boys this and then after they have the soil in what they think is the finest possible condition I have them go over once more. As it is a class I get a different group each year I know that they are not expecting it and I find that if I do take a chance and let it go without this last extra hoeing or raking, the plants do not take hold as well nor grow so nicely as when, we give it the last going over. Working the soil down often and thoroughly then, is one step in the early season that is necessary. This work should be done as soon as one can get it done in the spring. After the preparation of soil one must wait for the weather to moderate so that he can sow the seed. We can dismiss here the starting of the seed in boxes in the kitchen or some other part of the house. The expenses and bother of that is, so far as I can see, not worth the effort. In sowing the seed one should delay rather than hasten the date. When the ground is cold and the days are short the seed will not start and if they should start the seedlings developed will not be sturdy. One usually has earlier plants by delay - ing a few days than he does by trying to make a start too early. As one is dependent on the weather we cannot set a date for the Bowing of the seed. In the vicinity of Lincoln I would think that the seed of the hardier annuals mentioned could ordinarily be sown by thfc middle of April and in the northern part of the state a week or ten days later. However, those are approximate dates based on experience in Kansas and on averages and thus would not apply to any one year. In sowing the seed we should remember that to germinate seed three things are required. They are air. moisture and heat. The air of course will take care of itself unless one sows the seed when the ground is too wet and then packs the soil so that there is a ball of earth around each seed excluding the air and thus preventing germination. It is my experience that many a seedsman has been condemned ; for putting out poor seed when the seed really were Ml right but the sowing was a fault in this one direction. Moisture la supplied to the seed from the ground. It comes Into the seed only when they are in direct contact with the wet soil and that is why we should press the earth around the seed if the soil is not wet at the seeding time. This all takes experience rather than book learning and one can only tell what pitfalls to avoid and then let the planter go out and learn as soon and as best he can. The fact that the seed need some heat to germinate is the reason that we suggest later plant- </seg>
            <seg id="p523">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ing than is ordinarily practiced. The three elements of heat, moisture and air work hand in glove setting up in the seed certain chemical reactions that start things to going and if any one of them is lacking the reactions are incomplete and the seed will not germinate. After the seed are sown the rows should be marked. This may well be done before the seed are covered up so that there will be no doubt as to the location of the row. On the marker should be the name of the plant, the variety, the date of planting and any other information that one might want to keep. When this information is on the label a"nd if it is put on at sowing time there is little danger of the confusion that often is found in the garden, especially if Jt is one's first attempt and he is not familiar with the plants and the seedlings. The care of the plants for the rest of the season is rather well established, Water should be given in dry spells. When one has decided that water is needed one should apply it whether or not one sees a few clouds off in the horizon. Usually those clouds do not furnish enough water even when they do materialize into a rain and as often as not the rain fails to hit that locality. When the plants show external signs of needing water they should get it at once and in large quantities for they are actually suffering when they Bhow signs of wilting. When watering the plants in the garden give large quantities. A few heavy waterings do more good and use less water than a' sprinkling every day or so. The occasional sprinkling does more harm than good. It does not furnish enough water at any time to do much good and brings up to the top of the ground the roots that should be below getting the natural supply. As soon as these roots are brought up to the surface and one forgets to water one day some of the roots dry or die and plants suffer. Also under this light sprinkling system of watering when one has done a good job or bringing the roots up to the top. two or three inches of the soil, one can do a perfect job of cutting all of these roots off when he hoes In the garden. And that brings us to hoeing. As a rule one thinks that the more he hoes the better it is for the garden. That used to be the idea and 1 taught it for some time. It may be true that frequent hoeing was a good thing for the gardening of ancient Egypt and it is from there that most of our general information about gardening comes. It is interesting to trace it all from the Nile through Europe, Into the eastern states and then out here. The same ideas are carried all through the story and many of them are totally unfitted to the conditions they are now put to. So it is with hoeing the garden. It may have been a good practice under the conditions of other climates but in this part of the country experiment after experiment shows that there is less need of hoeing than we are apt to think. We must keep the weeds down. There is no argument against thar </seg>
            <seg id="p524">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for the weeds rob the soil ot the moisture, of the plant food and are a source of insect and disease infection. In the field we may have to cultivate to get rid of the weeds and I have no crow to pick with the practice of cultivating the corn and other row crops. I couldn't well say much about that for I am supposed to know little or nothing about them. However, in the flower, and the vegetable garden, I do know that scraping the soil to keep the weeds down as they appear does more good and requires less effort than hoeing does and gives us as good, or better crops. The pests that attack the garden are many and varied. As a rule we have chewing and sucking insects and they must be controlled with the proper spray. So far as I know there is no combination spray on the market that will do a good ]o!&gt; of controlling both types of insects. Those insects that attack the plant by chewing out a part of it can be controlled with arsenate of lead, calcium arsenate or paris green as well as pyrethrum. Those insects that suck the plant juices out, and those are largely the many different kinds of plant lice, or aphids, must be controlled with a spray that covers the insect and smothers it. For this we have the various oil sprays and the tobacco as well as the pyrethrum products. One can get these from his local seed store or florist and if one will go to the florists for this kind of a product he can very often get just the right spray. The florist has these same pests to fight winter and summer and has tried most of them so he knows which will do well and can get it for you. How - ever, no insecticide can do the work alone. You will have to apply the spray thoroughly covering every part of the leaf and the stem and in the case of the plant lice you will have to cover each insect that you want killed. Fertilizers are always a popular subject with flower growers. That subject, too, is a hard one to discuss for it usually brings one into chemistry rather quickly and even the- chemists admit that they do not know all that there is to know about that Bubject. Fertilizers are divided into two classes. One of these is the manures and this includes not only that material that one gets from the barnyards and chicken runs but green matter in the form of cover crops. It includes also trash that is collected through the summer from the lawn, from under trees, and from the flower garden as we trim, prune or throw out those flowers that have gone' past usefulness on this earth. The other group includes those fertilizers which we buy in sacks and are known as commercial or chemical fertilizers. The commercial fertilizers have a use in the garden, either tli. - annual or perennial, and either flower or vegetable garden. Their use though is as an accessory to the manures rather than a substitute for them. They encourage a quick, vigorous growth and when a plant makes a growth it uses the commercial fertilizers that we have applied as well as the organic matter that is in the, ground. Therefore, the </seg>
            <seg id="p525">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY more organic matter we have In the ground the more value we get from the commercial fertilizers and the more we apply of the one the more we get of the other. Used together and used as the manufac - turer recommends, the commercial fertilizer does improve the size as well as the Quality of the flowers and plants. However, if we expect the commercial fertilizers to be a substitute for manure or if we think that because a little did well last year a lot will do more this year we run into difficulties. These materials are like drugs that are used by a human. If he uses the right amount he gets very beneficial results. If he does not use enough he gets no good from them and if he uses too much he gets fatal results. The amount to use varies with the crop, the soil, the amount of organic matter in the soil, whether or not one Irrigates, and the kind of fertilizer that is used. While all of this seems complicated you will find general directions on the package in which the fertilizer comes from the store. These directions apply to the particular brand and usually will not work for some other brand, for each of these kinds varies a little. , There is a little to say about Irrigation. It is a common thought that one may not Irrigate during the daylight hours. The falacy of this, idea Is best shown in the practice ot the greenhouse man who will not water his plants on cloudy days and thus only waters when the sun is shining and the brighter it is shining the better he likes it. My guess on the beginning of this theory is that many people do not water properly and they will do less damage when they water in a wrong way if they water after the sun is set. However, they also Increase the danger of disease injury. Water heavily when watering. Such a watering soaks down for some distance and the roots of tho plants are' drawn downwards for the water will stay there longer than it will on top of the ground. Then if we neglect to water one day the roots, and thus the plants,' will not suffer and when we do hoe the garden it will not result in cutting off the roots of the plants. Daytime watering, too, requires more water to accomplish this result for there is a greater loss of water from evaporation in the daytime but it also cools the air, washes the dust off of the leaves and does not cause nearly the loss from disease that evening watering does. The spraying of the annual plants for disease need not be taken very seriously. We have but little Invested and we have thus little to lose if disease does ruin the crop. Often the cost of a good spray is worth more than the plants. There Is, too, the everlasting fear that it will break out again or that we did not do a good job and that the control measures tried will not be successful. My recom - mendation, therefore, in the control of diseases of the annual flowering plants is to remove all diseased parts and burn them. If this ruins the plant, remove and burn it. This is the cheapest as well as the surest way to control disease of the plants of the garden. </seg>
            <seg id="p526">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The growing of annuals is the earliest form of plant culture. It requires, in brief, the proper preparation of the soil, selection of the right kind of plants, use of good seed, and the minimum amount of culture. However, we should add that plants are like people and respond to treatment just as people do. Neglect is harmful, too much care spoils them, and the proper care allows them to develop into strong, healthy, satisfactory individuals either of the animal or plant kingdoms. ■ Discussion Question: How soon can you begin using Bordeaux mixture? Answer: Just as soon as you set the plants out in the garden. Spray them when you put them in the garden and then spray every week. If you get a rain just after you have sprayed, that is just too bad because you will have to spray again. If you do not get one, just keep the new growth covered. Question: Will Bordeaux mixture kill black beetles? Answer: Arsenate of lead with Bordeaux mixture will get the beetles. I Question: There is one thing these people might like to know. When zinnias and marigolds are put in water, they develop disagree - able effluvia which is terrible. We have found that if you put a tea - spoonful of formaldehyde in the water it will prevent this. Answer: Formaldehyde would kill any organisms which are in the water and a. small quantity like that would not be harmful to the water. ■ Question: We have kept them that way for a week and at the end of that time, the stems were just like they were when cut. Answer: I see no reason why this could not be used with other cut flowers. Question: We use one teaspoonful to a container. Answer: How big are your containers? Question: They hold about three quarts of water. Another thing,, so many people stress irrigation instead of cultivation. Last year we did not water but cultivated. Answer: There is a question of what you mean by cultivation. You can do a little harm if you have the roots too near the top. If you keep a light dust mulch on top of the ground, then cultivation has lots in its favor. Experiments find that instead of cultivation If you will go through with a hoe and scrape, just keeping the weeds off, you will get better results. Question: Last year, in one place we watered and in the other place we cultivated and we had much better success where we culti - vated. </seg>
            <seg id="p527">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTUHAL SOCIETY Answer: The soil might have beeii different In the two places and the care might have been different. I would not say definitely that cultivation is. harmful, but 1 would caution against too much cultivation. MR. WIGGANS: I am sure that we have all gotten some points from Mr. Balch's talk that we can take home and use. The next and last talk we have this morning is dealing with another special phase of our garden activity, namely, the rock garden, and Mr. Longnecker from the University of Wisconsin is going to tell us something about how you pile up a bunch of rocks and make them look like nature put them there. MR. LONGNECKER: I sort of hesitated when I was asked to come out here to talk on rock gardens, but it was sort of a selfish motive that made me come. On my first visit to Nebraska I rode across the state on horseback. The thing I was Interested In on this visit is your new Capitol. You have something really worthwhile. That is really the reason I am here today. I don't agree with some people as to the best portion of the Capitol. The thing that was out - standing to me was the picture, the mural In the library, "The Spirit of the Prairie." That is the whole spirit of the Capitol. When you get to talking on gardens, it is a big proposition to tell you how to build a rock garden and what to do with rock In the short time I have this morning. I have tried to make my material as compact as I can and to save time, I will read it. Slides 1. This scene is one of the things we find authors trying to copy. I do not think it is the thing you will find here. You should interpret the spirit of your locality. Even though this is beautiful, you will not try to copy It for your locality. 2. I threw this slide in to give you something of the Idea of your original type of stone. It gives you the horizontal line through the rock-work. You will find that in all the layers there is the ten - dency to have a general rhythmic line. 3. Here you have a Wisconsin dell. You have the long hori - zontal line In this type of formation. 4. A glaciated stream with the boulder type of stone. • 5. This Is the large type of stone that you have some places In your state. Here we have the long horizontal line. 6. This shows man's adaptation of that type of rock. It repeats the same line. It has a feeling for the stone. When you come to build a rock garden, the stone mason Is the worst man to have to do the building, He is not accustomed to the use of rock as you want </seg>
            <seg id="p528">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE it in the rock garden Itself. He is accustomed to cement and straight formal lines. He knows stone well, however, and in some cases has a feeling for' stone as you use it in the rock garden. 7. This is another more or less ledge effect showing Junipers. This is a light sandy soil. 8. In many flat places you will get erosion. Here you can Use ■ a rock garden to take care of a bad situation. 9. This is somewhat similar to that ditch you just saw. Flowers are used here. Another thing to remember in designing a rock garden is that the plants are not to be planted just for the individual plant itself but you will want a fairly pleasing desTgn to run through the whole, fitting the whole into the home grounds picture. 10. Here is a diagram showing the placement of stone. You will notice that the stone is just slightly tilted. 11. Here is a thing you quite often see and it lacks a feeling for stone as it should be used. The building principles may be all right but the stone is all the same size. There is no feeling of design. This is a rock pile. 12. It is better to have stone where you have a slight tendency for slope into the bank. Have some large ones for character. Be sure to have some soil pockets. The soil pockets should reach up through so that your plants will be sure of getting soil moisture. 13. This slide is poor, but it brings a point that I want to bring to you, the pool and a rock garden going back from it. When bringing in. water, bring it in in a logical way. Quite often we Bee water coming out of the very top of the rock garden. 14. | Here again we have a fairly good setting at first glance. I want you to see this thing here. They look like mummies. We have a rock garden in Madison of which the owner boasts that he has one hundred and ten different kinds of stone. He has stones the shape of birds, the shape of nests, etc. This is not a rock garden. 15. Would you not rather have this sort of thing? Here you have the natural formation of the rock. Of course you could not copy this but you could interpret some of the things, the use of rock in general layers and the use of the boulders. 16. ' This rock garden resembles a statue. 17. In using a stream of water, a great deal of the pleasure comes in the music of the water, the trickle of the water. This Is not a picture out in nature but done in a Chicago greenhouse. 18. Here you have a feeling of being out in nature. This is a garden on the Florsheim estate. This shows .the use of a limestone and sedimentary rock. 19. This is another picture of the same garden. </seg>

This is a plan of a formal type. 22. This is a picture of a spring with ledge area. 23. When you design the rock garden, there should be a logical progression throughout the whole carrying you from one area to an - other. 24. You have a number of different kinds of rock gardens.

This had been covered over. The rock work is quite pleasing. . 34. Here is another area showing the use of some ledge Btone. This Is done on a flat piece of ground. It is quite a problem to build a rock garden on flat ground. 35. Here is a boulder garden with large and small stone to - gether. This method of arrangement gets away from the monotonous use of stone. 36. Here is a garden which was built on our campus. It is close to a formal line of architecture. This place was washing quite badly bo it was decided to put a rock garden there. 37. This shows the use of ledge rock. There are numerous eoll pockets between the rocks where suitable varieties of plants are placed. 38. This is another picture showing the step area. The larger stone Is from the quarry.

WIGGANS: I think it is a good thing that Mr. Longnecker came when snow covered our rock piles so he cannot see what we do have in Lincoln. Do any of you rock garden enthusiasts have any questions which you would like answered pertaining to rock gardens? Discussion Question: In making a rock. garden on the level, would you do the grading and make hills and mounds or can you make a good looking rock garden on the level? Answer: I think I would keep away from the hills and mounds and use flat field stone, or if you are In an area where there are boulders, use boulders and be sure that some of your stone is large enough to give you good accent in the garden and to give you the setting of the flowers against the stone. Get away as far as possible from the hill and mound type. Interpret the country in which you live. In Nebraska, the mountain and that type of thing is not in place. Of course there are some places where you have a grade or rock ledge type of thing and there perhaps that would be your solution. Question: Would it be practical in Nebraska to use the rocks we have? We do not have rocks like you showed. Answer: As far as possible I thing I would use the Nebraska stone. I know there are some places in the state where you have ledge rock and some. places where you have boulders. There is some red granite. But if you want to use the correct type of material and in the correct way, use your native stone. Question: What variety of native stone would be best? . Answer: That depends on the architecture of your house, the topography of your lot, and the type of things you want to portray. Question: Should porous stones be used? Answer: Porous stone gives better effects. It ages faster. Lichens grow on it faster. It gets to be part of your home grounds faster. The stone holds temperature and moisture. It makes a place for your material. According to the type of material you want to grow, use the kind of stone. Question: Should a rock garden be built on level ground? Answer: I question' the advisability of building a rock garden on level ground. Be careful if you do it at all. Do it with flat Held stone. Keep away from mounds. An annual and perennial border is more in keeping on a level lot than a rock garden. </seg>
            <seg id="p532">'REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Question: Do you think it is possible to make a nice looking garden from the niger heads? We have one in Lincoln. Answer: You have to be very careful in the matter of design. You have to have a feeling .for natural situations. There is a Very fitting garden in Wisconsin made of boulders. It is very fitting. It is raised a slight degree above level ground. The matter of design enters in. Stone must not all be the same size. Then there is the matter of color and the type of material grown in it. It is possible to have a very nice rock garden with the use of boulders. You will have a harder job than if using ledge rock. Question' Won't the boulders take up so much heat in summer that they will dry up the soil around them? Answer: I think if you will turn a boulder over, you will lind quite a bit of moisture under it. You can grow plants where you have stone in high temperatures. Answer: It has been my experience here that plants do better in a rock garden. I made a little one in a small yard and I find that the plants keep moist there much better than out in the open. Question: What would be the best plant to grow in this climate for a rock garden? Answer: I would use plants that will stand a great deal of drouth. Sedums are good. We have about twenty-five varieties of Moss Pink, Phlox Subulata. Use Yucca for accent. You cannot go into shady - materials unless you have a shady situation. Question: We find Gaillardia and Columbine good. Answer: Yes, we use that and I think that Gaillardia, if you get out into the plains where it is native, .would be a fitting flower. The Gaillardia with us is a very rank flower. It grows so tall that it about topples over. In dry soils, it will stay down and stay in place. Question: Can a plant like Purple Rock Cress be divided? Anwer: Yes. I divide that along in August before fall rains. A good share of rock plants should "oe divided along the latter part of the summer. In Rock Cress .and Moss Pink after it is through blooming cut off old seed pods and flowers and along in August if you want to divide it, there will be good shoots to divide. Question: My phlox Subulata do not increase. What is the trouble? Answer: I do not know. What type of soil do you have? Question: The soil is heavy. I use fertilizer and the Verbenas grow fine and the Sedums grow fine. Answer: Phlox Subulata likes a light soil. A white grub bothers Moss Pink and Perennial Phlox. It might be eating some of the shoots at the ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p533">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY TUESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION CHAIRMAN: This afternoon, as you heard this morning, our first talk will be "The Arranging of the Perennial Border for Con - tinuous Bloom" and as was stated this morning, Mrs. Helen Field Fisher was unable to come, but Mrs. Murdoek of Nehawka will help us out here. This is to be a general discussion and if any of you have new ideas which you think are better than Mrs. Murdock's, you are privileged to state them. ARRANGING THE PERENNIAL BORDER FOR CONTINUOUS I BLOOM MRS. MURDOCK, Nehawka Under the circumstances you can probably all imagine how I feel so I hope that any blunders will.be overlooked. In listening to Mrs. Fisher's talks, one of the things she stresses Is mixture of color and repetition in the border instead of patchwork ideas of small amounts of a great number of different varieties. I do not know how. the rest of you started out with perennials, but my idea was to have as many perennials as possible regardless of whether they fitted in my garden or whether my soil was fitted for them or lot. This did not work so well. In starting out to get all summer bloom we all know that there are some kinds which bloom from early spring until late fall. The question is how to have blossom all summer. This cannot be done except by repetition. The same thing should be repeated at different intervals in the border. If the same kind of flowers are all in one place, you will have bloom in just that one place. You can start in the early spring with the bulbs.' The Fern Leaf Bleeding Heart is one of the early blooms and blooms throughout the summer. The more Columbine we have, the better our border looks. Centaurea Montana was about the earliest blooming blue flower. It is a little too rank. For bloom it is very fine because it is early. As a cut flower it is not good. Blue Flax is good. Just a little wil take care of itself. Along with Pyrethrum it is good. Sweet Williams are good. There is an ever blooming variety In red and It is made more ever - blooming by removing the blossoms. Sweet William of the Woods everyone should have. It multiplies rapidly. One plant will soon supply all your needs. Oriental Poppies need something with them. </seg>
            <seg id="p534">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE They take up quite a bit of room but they make a brilliant splash of color. I think the Memorial Shasta Daisy is good with them. It never fails to bloom at Memorial Day. Tiny plants, have as many as twelve to twenty blossoms. Coreopsis blooms all summer. The bloom can be increased by removing seeds and old blossoms. Then there is the Hybrid Delphin - ium and the Chinese Delphinium. Coreopsis is good near It. There will be bloom constantly. The yellow and blue is very beautiful. Hollyhocks are to be found in almost every summer garden. They are not good in a flowering border. There is such a lack when they are gone. After they are removed there is such a vacancy. They should be planted by themselves. Gaillardia will bloom from June until frost. It is a coarse perennial. Then there is Phlox. Last sum - mer I noticed two combinations of Tiger Lilies with Phlox. In one garden the Tiger Lilies were surrounded by blue Magenta Phlox. The effect was terrible. Then I saw the same combination with white Phlox and that was lovely. False Dragon Heads are very satisfactory. They increase rapidly by root runners. They make a mat. The stems become crowded. They must be thinned every spring. Then there is Butterfly Weed. There is not much said about it in catalogues. They do not recom - mend it highly enough. It has the brilliancy of the Oriental Poppy. One must be careful of its location because of its extremely glaring orange color. Of the Balloon Flowers, the blue is much more satis - factory than the white. The white is not a clear white. They come very easily from seed without any trouble. Then there are the Asters that come on in later September and October, j There are a few fine native varieties in Nebraska. I bought my first ones from a seed house and after they had bloomed I found the same thing along the roadside. One is a very dark purple With a hairy leaf and the other is a light lavender with a smooth shiny leaf. I do not know the name for them. Then there are Chrysanthe - mums. I have been told by those who sell them that they become a little later each year. They have to be very heavily mulched or taken in during the winter. There are some varieties which are not very sure, but when they do come into bloom they are worth the wait. They are good for a background. The Hibiscus is another for a peren - nial background. It comes easily from seed and is very hardy. Arte - mesla or Old Man has been quite prominent in old fashioned gardens. It is ferny and lacy. The background is an essential part of the border because the border shows off better with a green background than with just space behind it. Another Nebraska native that I think of in connection with Peonies is the native Thimble Flower. It grows to be about three feet tall and has large lavender bells. It blooms at the time </seg>
            <seg id="p535">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY the Peonies do. The lavender Thimble Flower with the pink Poenies is good. So far as arrangement is concerned I just merely by experience and experiments try to adjust colors that go together. The tall ones should be in the back. These rock garden plants that we can't have on account of not having a rock garden, can be worked in in the front row of a border. They will work into the front border without the necessity of a rock garden. The plants can live without the rock. CHAIRMAN: For my part, I have never heard Mrs. Helen Field FlBher, but I don't know as I really have missed much. I am satisfied. Mr. Balch will now talk to us about the care of house plants. HOUSE PLANTS — THEIR CAKE* WALTER B. BALCH Kansas Agricutlural .Experiment Station In the growing of plants in the home the caretaker must keep in mind at least four important points. These are temperature, moisture, light and soil. I do not know which of the first two is the more important but I do know that they are the two that are most often overlooked by the home caretaker of plants during the winter months. One of the greatest troubles that the house plant has to surmount is that the. temperatures in the homes, so far as the plants are con - cerned, are neglected. In our homes we usually have a daytime tem - perature of about 70 degrees and this is often raised two or more degrees In the evening when one is sitting around reading or playing cards. As the family goes to bed the furnace is banked and by morn - ing the temperature has dropped to less than 60. Such a variation in temperature is too much for the plants to stand. In the first place the daytime temperature is too high for the best development of the plants. The greenhouse man has his houses at much lower tempera - tures. Roses, for example, are considered the greenhouse plants re - quiring the greatest amount of heat and the warmest they ever have it is 65 degrees. After they come into bloom they are often kept at less. Most of the ferns, begonias and similar plants that we have in our homes as house plants are raised at a temperature of about 55 degrees. The high temperature that the plant is kept In tends to develop a tender unhealthy growth that is very subject to the attacks of insects and diseases. Such growths will wither very quickly when * Contribution No. 108. Department of Horticulture. </seg>
            <seg id="p536">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the moisture supply is not steady and constant and the plant will die though there is no apparent disease attacking it. These temperatures too are those at which the diseases and insects thrive in and so we first put our plant in a temperature that is not the best for it and in one that is good for its enemies. So we see that the first thing that the home caretaker has to do is to find a relatively cool place in the house for the plants. Having located the plant in the cooler place in the house we must remember it at night and just as we have to put a few covers over the youngsters before we go to bed so we must put our plants in a place that will not be quite so cool through the night when the house is cooling Very rapidly. With all of this done we have attended to the temperature at which the plant will thrive. Then we come to the question of watering. This is much more difficult for the beginner to handle. It Is a saying among greenhouse men that if an apprentice can be taught to water properly one can make a grower of him but if he fails to grasp that he can never be a successful worker in greenhouses. Unfortunately one cannot give very definite rules for the watering of plants. So many facts have to be considered and they are seldom the same for any two plants of the same kind unless they happen to come from the same greenhouse. This is further complicated by the atmospheric conditions in the home. Someone who had nothing better to do with his time once made some studies of the humidities of the homes and offices of several of his friends. He found that in the ordinary steam heated house or office the humidity was as low as it is in the Sahara Desert. In the next water heated apartment it was no better and in a hot air heated room it was but very little better. That gives us an idea about the amount of moisture in our homes and explains to- some extent why we have so many troubles with our breathing systems in the winter months even though we are very careful not to expose ourselves to the cold or to draughts. This is why plants which are growing in our homes will wilt even though they have been watered, for the tender growth made in the heat of the home is very easily wilted in the dry atmosphere of the home. There are two things we must do to overcome this condition bo far as our plants are concerned. The first is the careful watering of the soil so that there will be all the water the roots need to pump up to the leaves and still there will. not be soggy conditions, so exclud - ing the air from the soil, and rotting of the roots starting. It Is hard to tell how much water should be added to the soil or how often it should be applied for much depends on the texture of the soil. Many plants that have been brought to me are suffering from lack of moisture but the caretaker honestly tells me that she has watered them every day. That often is just the trouble. She has </seg>
            <seg id="p537">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY poured a little bit of water on top of the soil in the pot every day As a result that soil at the top of the pot is always soaked but that part that is nearer the bottom and the roots is dry, as can be seen when we knock the plant out of the pot. The trouble has been lhat where the water should have been there has been none but where it is not wanted and where it interferes with the circulation of the air there has been too much of it. In our home we overcome ihis difficulty by setting the pot in a pan of water. The depth of ihe water depends on the size of the pot. We have the water about vwo - thirds of the way up the sides of the pot. The plant is sometimes ieft in this water for several hours, or until the water has soaked Its way up through the bottom and through the sides of the pot to the lop of the soil. The water will not do this until the soil in the bottom has been thoroughly saturated. Then the pot is taken out of the water and allowed to drain. When all the water that will drain out of the bottom of its own accord has been drained off the soil Is con - sidered watered. In our home we find that usually plants require two waterings a week when this method is used but frequently one watering a week will do. After the soil is watered the leaves are watered. This watering, or syringing as the florists call it, is done in the greenhouse overy day. In the home it is more important but even in our home it is not done so often. However, we find that if we syringe at least three times a week we have the nice looking plants I like to have. The watering of the leaves is a simple process and takes but a few minutes. We take the plant into the kitchen and hold it under the spigot. The water beats the leaves down somewhat but it washes off all of the dust and soot that accumulates on the leaves in the home in the winter. Sometimes I take the plants. into the basement and duck them in a bucket of water. These treatments not only wash off the dirt but wash off the insects such as red spider and mealy bugs before we can see them or the damage that they do and before they get on in such numbers that they are hard to control. The syringing also :ur - nishes some additional water to the surface of the leaves so that they do not need to call on the roots or the soil for so much water. Such practice requires care and some work but it is my experience that once one gets into the habit of caring for the house plants in this manner he is never satisfied with the plants produced in any other manner. The third of the four horsemen of home care of plants has to do with light. All green plants require some light. They need the light to carry on the process that is comparable to our digestion. It is in the leaves that the plants breathe and digest and the plants need for the last process the green coloring matter and the sunlight. Of course there are some plants that do not need so much light as others just as there are some folks who do not need so much food as others even </seg>
            <seg id="p538">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE when both are doing the same amount of the same kind of work. However, the growing plant needs plenty of food to grow properly and it takes sunlight to furnish this. In the winter we are short on good sunlight for the growing of plants. We do have most of our sunlight from the south so it is windows with a south exposure that should be chosen for winter gardening. Next to this one should select an east window and after that as a poor third, the west window. The north windows in the winter, are almost worthless as the place for the developing of flower - ing plants. However, plants that have matured and are in flower will last a bit longer, other things being equal, in a north Window. Ferns and other green foliage plants will be .the best to select for a north window or a location' in a room where there is no direct light. In the past few years the water bowls of ivy and of other similar plants have been found to do well in darkened places. In my home I have such an ivy plant which has had no direct sunlight for three winters. It is doing so well that nearly everyone who comes to, our house wants one. Those who have got one like it, and if they have given their plant any decent care but have also put it in a window or where it has got daylight have bigger' and better plants than mine is, and in less time. I mention this just as a hint to those who like a plant or two in the home but who must use a place that is not Well lighted or which gets no direct sunlight. Since most of the plants that we have in the home come already potted up I think that we will not spend much time on this phase of home plant culture. However, it is an important one and one that should be studied by the home plant caretaker who propagates her own plants or who repots them when they get too crowded In the original pots. Just a few words on the subject of soils. The soil is the place where the plant gets the materials of which it make Us food. The plant you see takes raw material out of the ground and the air trans - ports some of them into the leaves. Here in the leaves with the aid of the green coloring matter and the sun it is able to make the foods that it needs. The materials that it takes out of the soil are not the same that come out of the air. Unless there is plenty of the material in the soil the plant will starve regardless of the other care that it will have. In addition to food materials the plant roots must have air and water. We furnish the food materials by giving a rich soil yet if the soil is too rich the roots will be over-fed and die so we must be careful in this direction too. The air will circulate in and out if we do not pack the soil tightly and d.o not fill it too full of water too often. To prevent this we add to the soil a rather large amount of sand. The sand being rather coarse in texture will allow the excess water to drain off and air to take its place. </seg>
            <seg id="p539">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY As a rule a good soil mixture is oie containing about one-hair good garden loam. If the soil rn your garden contains a large amount of clay, cut down the amount of it you luse in your mixture. This loam will furnish the bulk for your soil mixture and will also furnish some of the materials that the plant needs from which it maks Us food. About one-quarter of the soil mixture should be well decayed manure or leaf mold. This furnishes a (large amount of plant lood and also holds water in parts of the potting soil so that it is less apt to dry out. The balance of the mixture 1 should be sand. The sand loosens things up so that excess water will drain out and because of its size and its shape makes it possible for the air to get in and out. To such a mixture a little bone meal will do no harm. It is in such a mixture the plant should be potted. When it has been growing in the soil for four or five months it is apt to have used up much of the plant food materials that come out easily. It is then that a small amount of good commercial fertilizer used according to direc - tions on the package will do the most good, very often It is just what is needed to keep the plant in a growing and healthy condition. No talk on the care of house plants would be complete without touching on the insects and diseases of the plants. It is my experience that plants that are well cared for and given the attention that they should have are like our youngsters in that they seldom if ever have any trouble of such a nature. However, just as I think it is well to have a knowledge of first aid and to be on friendly terms with a doctor so I think that one should know how to handle the pests that attack our house plants. Thus when a small infestation occurs one can get rid of it before it has come to a point where it will be apt to ruin our carefully tended plants. There are in the main just two kinds of insects that attack our plants either indoors or out.- One of these sucks juices out as a mos - quito takes our blood. The other chews parts of the leaves or stems. The sprays for the two pests are as different as the pests. For the chewing insects we use a stomach poison. One of the best of these and also the one that is least liable to go awry is arsenate of lead. This material is a deadly poison and so must be kept out of the reach of all animals and children. Another material that is less effec - tive but is harmless to children if they should get hold of it, is pyre - trum. Either of these materials can be had from drug stores in nearly any town. The sucking insects are the pests usually known as plant lice, or as aphids. These must be controlled by a spray that covers the body and smothers the insect. There are now on the market a large number of sprays sold for the work. Many of them that I have tried do it well. One of the most popular and most easily obtained Is a nicotine product and is known as nlcofume and also as Black Leaf 40. This, too, can be got from most drug stores and is very good. It is </seg>
            <seg id="p540">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE not dangerous to leave around for though it would make one very sick if one took any considerable amount of it, it is so disagreeable to the taste that even a regular smoker as I am would not take an overdose of. it. So much for the home care of plants. I would add one word before I go on to a slightly different phase. More folks each year are growing plants in their homes in the winter months. Too often they spend ' good money on plants and expect them to care for them - selves. That just can't be done. Few things add more to the hominess of a house than to have some nice looking plants in it. However, If these plants are unhealthy looking specimens they detract even more than nice looking plants add, so take good care of the plants. In the past two or three years a new type of house gardening has sprung, up. It is becoming so popular that one can no longer call it a fad. It is known as dish gardening. This gardening is on a small scale but adds variety to the house collection of plants and by its very nature overcomes the two big troubles that we have with our house plants. The home for the plants is no longer the whole room but a small area about the size of a fish bowl. In fact, a fish bowl is often used for it. The plants are kept in this covered flsh bowl and the temperature and moisture conditions are kept correct and constant by nature. When one uses plants that need but little sunlight and will stand a large amount of moisture one can very easily and successfully have a nice dish garden. The materials needed are a flsh bowl, a glass cover for the bowl, some gravel, some good plant soil and the proper plants. In the bottom of the bowl is put the gravel so that excess moisture in the soil will readily drain away from the roots. On top of this is put a small amount of soil. In this soil one places the plants. After watering very carefully the lid is put on. If this can be sealed it is so much the better. In this medium we have a little world. As it gets warm the air gets fuller and fuller of moisture. As it cools off this moisture, which has not been able to go off into the room, condenses and we have a miniature rain in the bowl returning to the soil the water that it had given up and at the some time washing off the leaves as has been recommended for the house plants. In this way we have an almost endless cycle and very little attention Is required. It is true that some of the water taken from the ground is used by the plants so after a time a little water has to be added but one soon can tell when the plants need water and then he can add a halt a cup. There is one bad feature about this almost ideal house garden. The moist atmosphere of the flsh bowl is Ideal also for the develop- </seg>
            <seg id="p541">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY merit of disease. Consequently one is apt to have unusually large amounts of mildew. This need not worry one if he watches his plants. As soon as. the. plants look a little off color or a little later when the disease itself begins to appear one can take the lid off the bowl, air it out and have it a little dry for a day or two. Then water again, cover up and forget about the disease for. usually it will have been destroyed. One could go on for a long time naming plants that will do Well in the home or in the dish garden. The careful house gardener will soon find that certain plants do better than others in his home. This I think is due to the temperament of the grower, for just as there are florists who can grow roses by the acre under glass but can't get carnations to make any profit for them, so there will be home garden - ers who can grow one thing better than another. All I can suggest is to try several of them at the beginning and weed out those ihat will not do well for you under the conditions that you have :or growing them. Discussion Question: Will you tell us something about the care of the Christmas Cactus? Answer: I think the reason that most of us do not have vhe success we should is that we take it for granted that the cactus does not want water. It can use almost as much water as any other house plant. While it will not show the signs of lack of water as quickly, it does suffer if we do not water it regularly. The plant goes Into a resting condition. The sap becomes gelatinous and it stops growing. Insects attack it rather easily then. It suffers quite often from red spiders. They like a dry condition. While cactus will not need water as regularly as the other plants, they are neglected because it is thought that they do not want water. In the soil we should use possibly twice as much sand as I suggested for other plants and only half as much as the richer garden loam so the excess water will drain off and we will get air circulating around the roots. Question: Lime is good for the Christmas cactus, is it not? Answer: That is probably true. There are earth worms In Boil. These earth worms leave holes in their travel. Out of doors this is good but indoors the water runs out through these holes. Lime is good for getting rid of these earth Worms. Take a tumbler one-half full of water, add one-fourth lime to it and stir it up good and pour it onto the soil. The next morning the earth worms will have come to the top and be shriveled up. Question:- Do you advise the Amaryllis to be rested at all or kept in cultivation all of the time? Answer: I have never tried it without resting. It Is possible that they would do well in cultivation. We used to maintain that all </seg>
            <seg id="p542">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE plants should have a rest period of from one to three months a year. We have a Poinsetta that for five years has never had any rest at all. It is sixteen feet high. It had over one hundred blossoms on it. A rest period is not necessary for all plants. Question: Will the Breeder Lily bloom well as a house plant? Answer: It is not a success as a forcer. It has to have a rest. Question: What was the variety you said was good in the house? Answer: I did not name it. The one we have is the Spectabllis. Question: Is the Flowering Maple a good house plant? Answer: It is a rather thin foliage plant and would be susceptible to the dry atmosphere in the house. If you will give it absolutely ideal care you will have success with it. Question: What about the effects of gas? Answer: There are two kinds of gas, the artificial and the natural. The artificial gas contains large quantities of ethylene and this is harmful to plants. If you have a leak in the house there Is no ques - tion but that you will do harm to the plants. Where you are using natural gas there is no ethylene present and you will have no harm from the gas. The carbon monoxide apparently does not do much harm to the plants. That is very, very contradictory to what we have said for a number of years but it is based on evidence from several law suits. Several florists in the eastern United States brought suits against the gas company because of leaks in the mains in the greenhouses. The suits ran up into several millions of dollars. The owners of the greenhouses and the utilities people got together on &amp; series of experiments .and demonstrated that where there is no ethylene in the gas, the gas will do no harm. There is no ethylene in natural gas. With artificial gas, if you have a leak, you will hurt the plants. Question: Will the Sultana bloom in the house? Answer: It is thin skinned. It needs a relatively high humidity. Keep the -humidity high and you can grow it. Question: How do you start Lantana cuttings? Answer: Do not wait until too late in the summer. We usually have frost about the last week in September or the first week In October. We used to take out cuttings just as near that date as we could but sometimes had hard luck. Now we take them in August, about six weeks before frost. CHAIRMAN: Mr. Longnecker will next discuss "Interesting and Worthwhile Garden Club Programs." The garden club movement has gone much farther in Wisconsin than here in Nebraska and I'm sure we can profit from the many experiences they have had there. I take pleasure in introducing Professor G. Wm. Longnecker of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. </seg>
            <seg id="p543">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY INTERESTING AND WORTHWHILE GARDEN CLUB PROGRAMS i By G. WM. LONGNECKER Instructor in Landscape Design, College of Agriculture University of Wisconsin The Garden Club movement is doing great things in making people plant and garden conscious. I was talking with a man the other day who said he never realized there were so many rock plants until he had built his rock garden. You see he was becoming rock plant conscious; he had never noticed them before. He said the same thing was true of the rocks. A rock was always just a rock to him and when he began to look for stone suitable for a rock garden he found that there were a large number of different kinds. I always remember an example of knowledge that was given by a man in a lecture when I was a freshman in college. He said that the knowledge of the person who really knew very little was like the circumference of a small wheel in that it touched on very little on the outside, . whereas the knowledge of the well educated person was like the cir - cumference of a large wheel and touched on a great number of things on the outside. The first man knew very little but he thought he knew a great deal because he did not have the contact with all these other things. The well educated man on the other hand thought he knew very little because he knew of so many things that he didn't know anything about. So you see the more we know the less we know-. • The garden club has perhaps done more toward, beautifying the home grounds the last few years than any other agency. Have you noticed the Increased number of garden magazines during the past few years? This increase is largely due to the interest created by garden clubs. The movement is also a great thing from the nursery man's standpoint. It wasn't so many years ago that most nurseries specialized in small fruits and fruit trees. Today ornamental plants predominate in most nurseries, and a number sell nothing but orna - mental plants. The life of the garden club and its interest to the members depends, to a large degree, on the selection of the program chairman and on the committee selected; but there is another factor which is even more important, and that is fne willingness of the members themselves to do their part. Most clubs haven't a great deal of money to spend on speakers and it is just as well that they haven't. The club, to a large extent, should be self supporting as to programs. If the sole aim of the club members is to be amused, the club will be short-lived and very little of real value can be accomplished. The members should be membera because they are interested in plants, in beautiful gardens, and in worthwhile homes — and not because the </seg>
            <seg id="p544">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE garden club is one of the things to belong to. The members should be there to study and to learn, not just about beautiful flowers, but also about some of the fundamental things. The garden movement should get away from the superficial and get down to the basis of things if it is really going to live and achieve much that is worthwhile. Something should be known of plant growth, plant propagation, and plant breeding. The relation of plant to environment is another worth - while subject that will give one a general background for plant study. It will tell you why certain plants are happy and thrive where other plants will not grow. It will be an aid in the general grouping of material. Plants are the keynote of the garden movement. Take them seriously. ' They are living things with personalities. Plants are also the pigments with which you paint your home grounds picture, but do not think of them from the color standpoint alone. There are a great variety of forms and textures. Plants are living things which change with the seasons. A cutleaf sumac will give a fine texture to your groupings in summer, and a coarse texture in winter. The color of the foliage in summer is a dark glossy green; in fall it turns a brilliant scarlet. Plants also change with age. The white pine In its earlier 'youth is a trim symmetrical tree. As It reaches maturity it becomes a broad spreading character tree. The same 1b true of the red pine, the bur oak and others. These changes of plants as to seasons and to age should be kept in mind when planting is done. The foliage and twigs of a plant are quite as important as its flowers. The flowers are present for a short 'time at best. A shrub with neat trim foliage gives a good effect all summer, but in most- temperate climates, the foliage is off the plants half the year, so it is Important that its branches, twigs, and general habits are also attractive. When 'you have taken all of these things into consideration don't forget that plants have certain soil, climate, sunlight, and water re - quirement^ that must be met if the plants are to be happy. Of course you people In garden clubs should know something of design. Your gardens and borders should not be just additions to the homegrounds picture but should be a part of it; but as I was saying, plants are the basis of the whole garden club movement and you should study and analyze them carefully. The garden club should give additional garden knowledge, a greater insight into nature and nature's processes, and it should acquaint you with plants and enable you to use them more effectively. The work of the program chairman is truly a big task. The interests and needs of the club members should be met. In order to do this the program for the various meetings should be outlined as far in advance as possible, for the whole year If it can be done. The plan should not be a haphazard one, but should follow some definite scheme. You might study perennials. The series of meetings </seg>
            <seg id="p545">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY could be started to advantage by having some authority in the peren - nial field give an illustrated talk on the general use of perennials In the home grounds planting, or the talk might be on the design of the flower garden, or it might be a talk on perennials which flower at different seasons of the year. Such a talk should give you a blrdseye view of the field which you are going to study. During the year the club members themselves can study and bring before the club their findings about various perennials. Care should be used in outlining such a group of meetings so that they do not become monotonous. Early spring is a good time to study nursery catalogues. It might be well to get a number of them and spend a meeting analyzing eome of the things you find. A great deal can be gained by such a meeting. You will probably find that a number of the members have had exper - iences that will be worth while to some of the rest of the members. It is usually advantageous to keep your programs in step with the seasons. You will find that there is so much material to study that you will have a hard time knowing just where to draw' the line. I think it -would be well to study outstanding groups the first year, letting some of the other material go until a future date. When taking up a flower or group of flowers much can be learned by bringing in living or pressed specimens or pictures, or it might be possible to go to some garden that has a number of flowers you are studying. Some clubs are keeping scrap books of outstanding garden pic - tures, flower, shrub and tree pictures. One meeting is set aside during the year to compile, classify and paste such material as has been collected throughout the year. It might also be advisable to collect material on control of insects and disease, on planting, pruning, and other subjects. TheBe scrap books should be club property and avail - able as references for themselves. You will find them quite valuable to you as time goes on and they become more complete. If you are arranging your programs according to the season you might start in the spring by studying some of the outstanding bulbs, various members reporting on different groups. Perhaps someone might take the crocus and someone the narcissi. The tulip group Is a large one and might be subdivided into early tulips, darwins, breed - ers, mendal, cottage, etc. In addition to the reports on various bulbs a trip might be planned to places where bulbs can be seen in flower: another report at that time of the year might have to do with the removal of winter protection and other general Work that should be done in the spring border. There might be a talk on raising peren - nials from seed. If possible each member might start specializing in some one type of flower, so as time goes on each one could have something of value to contribute to the rest of the members. I know of a couple of clubs that have done this with annuals. One member </seg>
            <seg id="p546">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE raised all the different types of pinks that she could get hold of; another one took petunias and another zinnias, etc. When they were in their height of bloom, the club was invited out and a report given. A meeting could be spent on iris, again dividing the reports up among the members, somebody taking dwarf iris, someone German iris, and someone else taking Siberian and Japanese. There might also be talks or propagation and on diseases and insects affecting iris. Columbine, peonies, delphlnum, phlox, fall asters and others can be taken up In a like manner in their respective seasons. At i the time of the year when gardens and yards are at their best it might be well to have a garden tour. Neighboring garden clubs will be invited in at this time. It might be well to have Bome landscape architect or garden expert give an evaluation of the gardens before the club. It Is best to have someone from the outside do this. He will be much more free in his opinions and suggestions, and as a consequence it would be more apt to be worthwhile. ' If the club as a whole is interested in some special flower like the iris, peony, rose, or phlox, it might feature a flower show at the time of the year when their respective flower is in bloom. There might also be some talks and demonstrations at this time. Toward fall when fall varieties of flowers are being studied, there might be something given about fall work in the border, and about winter protection. As winter comes on, the club could either continue with its perennial study or shift to a study of shrubs or trees. Both of these groups are extremely interesting at this time of the year when clothed in their fall or winter colors. Again an expert might be brought In to help start the group decided upon. If possible it would be well to go right; out into the open with the person and have him use living examples for his discussion. There are a number of Interesting ways of studying either trees or shrubs. You might divide them into groups as to the method of branching. For Instance, you might study the oppositely branched trees first. Those trees that are oppositely branched are the horse chestnut, the Ohio Buckeye, the ashes and the maples, j There are a number of trees which come in each of these groups, but all other trees in this section are alternately branched, so right away you see you have a beginning because when, you find a tree which is oppositely branched, you know it is either a chestnut, an ash or maple. All other trees are alternately branched. Then you might take up your other outstanding trees in groups, and find how to tell one from another and how they should be used. The oaks are another outstanding group which most people find hard to recognize, but they 1 are really quite easy to know if you but pick out some of the outstanding characteristics of each. . You will want to subdivide the oak group Into the white oak and black oak groups. You will </seg>
            <seg id="p547">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY find that the leaves of the oaks in the white oak group have round lobes, and that those of the black oak group have bristle-like points. The oaks in the white oak group develop acorns in one year while the acorns of the black oaks take two years to form. In the white oak group you have the white oak, swamp white oak, the bur oak and others. In the black oak group you have the black oak, pin oak, scarlet oak, the red oak, and others. When you get to studying the trees or shrubs, you will find that there is something outstanding about each one if you but single it out. If you are to know the trees or shrubs, you must look for these simple outstanding things. Another interesting method that you might use in studying either trees, shrubs,- or perennials is the use method. By that I mean groups of trees, shrubs, and perennials which have somewhat of the same use might he taken up at the same time — trees, shrubs, and perennials that might be used for waterside planting, for shade, for banks, for dry sandy situations, for smoky cities, etc. There might also be a report on trees or shrubs valuable from the standpoint of fall and winter color. In the spring there might also be a like report on trees valuable from the flower standpoint. You will find that winter is the best time to study trees. We quite often think of it as a dreary, colorless stretch of time between fall and spring, but there is really a great deal to interest you if you but look for it. Of course we don't have the riot of color that Is prevalent in summer. It wouldn't be fitting. Instead you will see numerous delicate colors and shades, lovely grays and browns, and greens, all blending into each other and into the winter sky and earth. There are many trees that are more interesting in winter than In summer. The deciduous trees are bare of leaves at least half of the year, yet the average home owner seldom thinks of the winter aspect of the trees he plants. Winter is the season in which we see the true makeup and character of the trees. We can only guess it through a camouflage of leaves before. With the leaves off we see the American Elm as a refined sinewy athlete. We only had a vague feeling what the structure was before the foliage is gone. The typical outline of the elm is an inverted triangle but it varies some with the location and individual tree. Some elms are a good Imitation of the etruscan vase, some have a single stem or a few almost parallel stems and form a "tall, graceful tree with a refined spreading top. Some that have been in an open situation since youth and which have been left to shift for themselves branch quite low to the ground and form a broad, round headed tree with character quite akin to the oak, that is, if just observed by a casual glance. Yet in all types there is something that says. elm. That sinewy strength and grace is present. The elm is one of the most beautiful trees at all seasons of the year, but its true beauty is at its height when the leaves are gone. </seg>

It la common knowledge that there are no two kernels of wheat exactly alike. The same is true of the trees. You will find no two white oaks alike or Scotch pines alike; yet there is that something running through a species that is outstanding. It is not necessary to get out the hand lens or dissecting knife to tell the trees apart if one is a keen observer. In many cases the. casual glance is sufficient. Do you know the American elm by its vase or umbrella shape or is there something deeper than that? Is the white ash told just by its coarse twigs against the sky. or is it the beaded appearance of the twigs due to the leaf scars left by last summer's leaves, or is there a deeper and fuller character or personality that makes one tree stand out as an elm or an ash, as the case may be? You have the same things true with trees that are true with people. One individual will stand out stronger in a group than an - other. Perhaps a prominent nose makes a man noticeable and yet there is something besides deformaties that makes him apparent Jn a crowd. A certain something, as with the tree, that is hard to define, a poise or grace that is easily seen no matter from what angle you are observing. It is something which makes Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith, and not Mr. Jones; and an elm an elm and not an ash. The horticulturist or gardener sometimes makes a Dr. Jeckyl Into a Mr. Hyde and in other cases a Mr. Hyde into a Dr. Jeckyl. Then it is hard to pick up that feeling. It is as if a person has been away for a time; you don't quite know him when he gets hack, yet there is something about him that is familiar. . An elm is an elm no matter how mutilated It is in the camperdown, and a catalpa bungl is a catalpa bungi no matter if it is budded on the top of a high stick. The true character of a tree is shown better in winter than at any other time. The rugged picturesqueness of the bur oak is never better than when it is battling against the snowy winter blasts, un - bending arid silent, holding up its arms and defying the wind as it rushes along. The white bark and brown refined twigs of the paper birch perhaps backed by the green drooping branches of the hemlock brings cheer and music to the winter landscape, a winter wedding as it were, a timid, refined maiden in a bower of green. The hawthorn or thorn apple is another tree that is especially interesting; in winter. It is a low, broad-topped tree, beautiful at all seasons, but In winter you see what makes It broad-topped. The intricate branching Is almost parallel with the ground, giving a very horizontal effect. The branches themselves are a beautiful gray and blend especially well with the gray bark of the gray dogwood and the reddieh arching stems of the prairie rose.

            <seg id="p550">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THINNING AS A NECESSARY OPERATION IN THE PRODUCTION OF QUALITY FRUIT By E. L. OVERHOLSEU Professor of Horticulture, Agricultural Experiment Station of the State College of Washington, Pullman, Washington Thinning fruit can be said to be the practice of the removal of a part of the fruit from the tree, early in its development, for "-he purpose of benefiting both the plant and the remaining product. The necessity or justification of thinning may be considered under two phases, (1) with reference to the tree; and (2) with reference to competition, or the quality of the fruit or its product. ( 1 ) With growing plants nature's effort seems to be the produc - tion of perfect seeds which are capable of germinating and of growing into vigorous plants. This would insure the natural perpetuation of the species. The most seeds will be produced when the maximum number of fruits is matured. Hence the prime purpose, so far :is nature herself Is concerned, is perhaps not the production of fancy fruit, but the production of viable seeds. So long as this is done, nature is content with fruit of small size. The fruit grower, however, attaches comparatively little importance to the seeds. He strives to obtain as nearly perfectly developed specimens of fruit as can be done economically. The tree, however, growing In the wild naturally, or if left to itself, would be forced to cope with many adverse conditions which would cut down on the size of the crop consecutively, as follows: (1) the number of buds developed, (2) the number of buds which would bloom, (3) the number of fruits which would set, and (4) ihe number of fruits which would mature. Hence, to be prepared i'or the worst, the tree is naturally inclined to blossom most profusely to insure that some fruits at least may survive all unfavorable condi - tions and develop seeds which can perpetuate the species. If con - ditions are favorable a great abundance of fruit may be borne. On ,the other hand, when trees are placed in the best orchards under the ' most favorable conditions, relieved from injurious com - petition,, well fed, protected from enemies, and stimulated to pro - ductiveness, it is to be 'expected that often the trees would set and attempt to carry through the season, much more fruit than could be brought ito such perfection as the fruit grower desires. Furthermore, </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY it is quite conceivable that sometimes the amount of fruit set would be an enormous burden and a severe tax upon the tree. Generally, in well-cared-for orchards, except under adverse con - ditions, the trees set and attempt to develop much more fruit than can properly mature, so far as size, quality, and color of the fruit are concerned. In fact, if five to ten per cent of a full bloom sets fruit, a fair crop may be insured. This would indicate that there must be a natural thinning. We know this is true and the normal partial failure or natural thinning process may be due to a number of causes among which may be suggested the following: (a) winter injury; (b) lack of pollination; (c) insufficient plant food; (d) blossoms injured or killed by cold winds or rains at the time of blossoming; (e) frost during blooming time; f) blossoms or small fruit destroyed by Insects and fungi. But, with all the preceding factors, working at different times and on different years to reduce the crop, there are times when the tree sets too much fruit and endeavors to develop it. i The problem of thinning immature fruit may be said to involve a similar principle of conservation of individual life and vigor as is observed in the thinning of plants like beets in the row, or cucumbers in the hill. The productive nature of the fruit tree may be asserted In the development of many more fruit buds than are necessary for a crop of fruit, and hence the fruit grower is justified some years in thinning in so far as the plant itself is concerned. (2) With reference to competition: The first question that per - haps would arise in the mind of the man who grows the fruit is this: "Will I be paid in cash returns when I dispose of my fruit, for the time, trouble, and expense, to which I have gone in thinning the crop?" "Will the price I receive for my crop, after thinning, be proportion - ately greater than that which my neighbor, who has not thinned, receives for his fruit?" It Is well recognized that competition has become more keen in selling the apple crop; first, because of increased production, second because of the better care being given the orchards, and the resultant higher quality of the product; and third, because of greater compe - tition with other types of fruits, such as oranges, grapefruit, and bananas. Furthermore, fruit standardization laws of many states have un - questionably served as a stimulus to put better fruit upon the market. Such laws as they are more rigidly enforced, and become more widely recognized, should serve as means of enabling those Individuals who have a high grade product to receive proportionately greater returns for their fruit. The benefits of thinning, however, are not confined solely to the Immediate cash returns. Because of its beneficial Influence upon </seg>
            <seg id="p552">.REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the trees, and the way In which It aiSs in other phases' of orchard management, such as picking and grading, it may be advisable to thin some years even though there is relatively little difference between the price' received for thinned and unthinned fruit. ■ Benefits of Thinning The 'benefits of thinning can be divided into, first, the effects upon the product or fruit, and second, the effects upon the trees. 1. Size of fruit is increased. The Agricultural Experiment Sta - tion 1 at Geneva some years ago found that when the trees were heavily laden, thinning increased the size of apples. This was particularly true with the Baldwin and Hubbardston varieties. In thinning, sometimes half the fruit set is removed; still nt harvest time there may be little difference between the total yield of the thinned trees as compared to the unthinned trees. The yield at least is not cut in half. This means that the thinned trees must have larger fruits, as they have less numbers of fruits, but about the same quantity. This increase in size can be largely accounted for by the fact that the same amount of food supply and water is available tor something over one-half the number of fruits. Heavy thinning does, however, have a definite tendency to reduce the yield. Fruit grown with twenty leaves per apple is considerably more than half as large as fruit grown with forty leaves per apple. This probably results from the fact that with the larger leaf area, the fruit produced is richer in carbohydrate materials. Likewise, with larger leaf areas there is more storage of food materials in the twigs, buds and branches. The Ottawa Experiment Station 1 , Canada, employing the Graven - stein, removed 12 per cent in thinning. As a result, the average number of apples per barrel, tree run from those unthinned, was 443; while from the thinned trees, the number was 388. There was about 9 per cent increase in size of the apples. There is a definite relation between leaf area and size increase of apples. Studies by Haller and Magness (1925) 1 indicated that ap - proximately 40, 50 and 75 leaves each should be available respectively for Grimes, Ben Davis, and Delicious apples. Apparently, each fruit requires more synthesized food than can be manufactured by the fol - iage of its own spur. Apples grown with no leaves remained green and made but little gain in size. Magness, Overley and Luce (1931) 1 under North Central Wash - ington conditions and Murneek in Missouri (1929) found that with 'Beach, S. A., N. Y. (Geneva) Art. Exp. Sta. Bui. 239 (1903).

            <seg id="p553">- NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY only ten leaves per apple the fruit did not attain good commercial size. With thirty leaves per fruit, Rome Beauty averaged approxi - mately ninety specimens per standard apple box, Winesap between 113 and 125, and Delicious 125 apples per box. The larger size of Rome Beauty apples with a given number of leaves may have resulted from the greater size of the individual leaves which averaged over four square inches, while the Winesap leaves averaged less than two and one-half square inches in area. Possibly from 40 to 50 leaves per fruit are required with such varieties as Delicious, Winesap and Rome Beauty to obtain large sized fruit and at the same time enable the trees to bear regularly. These workers (1931) found in the Wenatchee district that the average sized 20 to 25 year old trees making a fairly good vegetative growth have from 60,000 to 100,000 leaves per tree. The number of apples which may be permitted to remain on' such trees, would approxi - mate from 1,500 to 2,500. Such thinning should result in fruit of best commercial size and quality, and yet the trees should produce good annual crops. It should be pointed out, however, that it is possible to produce fruit that is too large for the best market demands. Large fruit does not keep well, cannot be conveniently consumed by a single individual, and in the case of varieties like the Jonathan, is more subject to internal breakdown." The most feasible way to increase the number of leaves per fruit, with heavily ladened trees, is to remove some of the fruit by thinning. Proper pruning also tends to Increase the foliage area per fruit, and thus to increase the size of the fruit, and to reduce the amount of hand thinning of fruit required. Heavy pruning, however, will gen - erally decrease the total foliage area and the total fruit produced. There are, of course, conditions under which even excessively heavy thinning will not result in large size fruit. Such conditions are inadequate soil moisture during periods of drought and low vigor and vitality of the trees from any cause. With these conditions notwith - standing thinning or the proportion of leaf area to individual Jruits, the apples will tend to be small, of poor dessert quality, and in many cases of poor color. Furthermore, the purpose is defeated if the crop is thinned to give a large proportion of leaves per fruit, and then the leaves are injured by diseases or Insects because of an improper spraying pro - 1 Holler.

            <seg id="p554">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE gram. Not only the number of leaves, but the health and food manu - facturing capacity of the leaves must be considered. Probably some of the most important factors in maintaining vigorous growth in the orchard and resulting efficiency of the leaves are (1) an available supply of nitrogen, (2) an abundance of organic matter in the soil, (3) adequate soil moisture, and (4) control of insects and diseases that may injure the leaves. It has been determnined 1 that while the smaller apples grow faster than the larger ones in terms of percentage increase, the larger ones actually grow more than the smaller ones and hence are the more salable. . The little apples to begin with are still small at harvest and should, therefore, be removed at thinning time. It is usually worse than useless to permit them to remain on the tree all summer. 2. t The color of the fruit is improved. — When the trees are heavily laden, proper thinning generally improves the color of certain fruits. 'Auchter (1917) 2 found that the apples not only took on a deeper red color but were also covered more evenly, and all apples were more uniform in color. If, however, the fruit was set rather sparsely before being trinned, there was not an appreciable heighten - ing of the color when thinning was practiced. Where grades are largely based upon color, as is the case with some of the grades estab - lished by many of the State Standard Apple Grading Laws, this In - fluence is of much value. It is a little difficult to satisfactorily account for the increase in color which results from thinning heavily laden trees. It is perhaps due, in a measure, at least, to the following causes: (1) the fruits do not shade one another, and more light and sunshine will strike each fruit throughout the summer. Sunlight is a very Important factor in the development of color on apples, and some of the other 'ruits. (2) The increased available sugar or food supply which each remaining fruit receives because of the proportionately greater leaf area per fruit possibly" aids in the production of more color. 3. Uniformity of size and maturity accomplished: Thinning tends to bring about uniformity of size, and to cause the fruits to ripen more uniformly. One would expect this to be true, since all small, inferior or defective specimens are removed by thinning. Fur - thermore, those fruits which do remain have more favorable conditions in which to attain a good size.. If the trees were heavily laden, as a result of thinning, the fruit would tend to ripen more uniformly, because the fruits are thinned at least one to a cluster, or to a space of four to eight inches. This gives each individual specimen a more 1 CumminRH. M. B-. E. W. Jcnkinn, nml R. G. Dunning, Vermont Afrr. Exp. Sta. Bui. 308. 1030. 'Auchter. E. C. West Va. Ajrr. Exp. Sta. Bui. 162. 1017. </seg>
            <seg id="p555">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY equal opportunity to profit by the ripening influence of free air cir - culation, sunshine and sufficient food supply. 4. Percentage of salable and market value of fruit is increased: Thinning increases the percentage of salable fruit and likewise tends to increase the market value of the crop. This is surely to be expected if the statements previously made are true. Thinned trees bear con - siderably fewer culls, and a higher percentage of fancy fruit with a total yield usually of only somewhat less than the unthinned trees. By the judicious practice of thinning, the grower should have more "extra fancy" and "fancy" fruits. The West Virginia Experiment Station found one year, with a plot of twelve trees of apples, that the thinned trees returned twice as much net per tree as did the unthinned trees. On one other year the thinned trees gave at least a 75 per cent greater net return per tree. 5. Reduces rotting of fruit: With some of the stone fruits and particularly the peach, thinning lessens the loss from brown rot. When rot starts in a heavily loaded peach tree, where the fruits are piled together on short spurs, it may spread rapidly where the fruits are In close contact. This rapid spread from specimen to specimen can be checked by thinning the fruits' so they do not rest against each other. 6. The quality of the fruit is improved: Not only is the quality of the fruit improved by better size, color, uniformity, maturity, and per cent of salable fruit, but the actual chemical composition may be benefited. Magness, Over ley and Luce (1931) found that with a large leaf area per individual fruit, the total sugar, total dry matter, and tltratable acidity of the apples were greater than those of other fruits on the same tree with a small leaf area. The effect of thinning upon the trees. The discussion thus far has been confined to the influences of thinning upon the fruit. The effect of thinning upon the trees can be iaken up as follows: 1. Thinning helps ..to prevent the breakage of branches. This effect on some years is an important benefit, since even mature trees may lose large branches through the inabiltiy to withstand the weight imposed by the burden of an over-crop. The lessening of breakage is largely due to the more even distribution of fruit over the entire bearing surface, of the tree. A great deal can also be accomplished by proper pruning and by bracing. Nevertheless, it is frequently ad - visable to thin by removing the fruit, in addition to the thinning given by taking out branches at the time of pruning. Plum trees of the Japanese species with their brittle wood, and heavy producing habits, frequently lose branches from breakage with a heavy set. The same is true of peaches. 2. Thinning preserves the energies and aids in maintaining the proper vigor of the tree. When a young or poor growing tree matures </seg>
            <seg id="p556">•REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE 'BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the largest number of fruits might set, it is possible that too much food may be diverted from the new wood and buds. Trees of this kind may be taxed to such an extent in years of heavy crops, that they might be seriously weakened. Fruit trees when weakened or impaired in any way are unable to so successfully resist or recover from insect attacks, fungus diseases, winter inpury or other unfavor - able and severe weather conditions. Thinning out part of the fruits on such trees lessens the tax upon the plant, and the weakening which attends an over-production is averted. 3. It has been claimed that thinning tends to lessen alternate bearing of crops. One can surmise that, as a result of such thinning, there would be additional plant food available, which could be used in making the fruit buds for the next season's bloom, but food supply thus effected is not necessarily the chief determining factor in fruit bud formation. Nevertheless, with peaches, thinning seems to con - siderably influence the fruit bud formation for the crop of fruit the following year. In one experiment where peach trees were severely thinned, Jordan 1 reported 46.6 per cent more fruit buds matured dur - ing the season when compared to trees moderately thinned. The Colorado Station (Bui. 170, pp. 8^9) has this to say about the influence of thinning so far as obtaining annual crops instead of alternate: "A tree will produce quantity at the expense of quality, and at the same time utilize plant food that should be used in making the fruit buds for next year's bloom. The law of nature' is to perpet - uate Its kind and it tends to do it even at the expense of the welfare of the tree. Annual thinning tends to throw a tree into annual bear - ing. When a tree has been in the habit of bearing alternate crops, It may take some time to induce it to bear every year by thinning. It has been demonstrated in the orchard where this experiment was carried on that by annual thinning the Jonathan can be made to bloom well every year, providing other good orchard practices are maintained. Time to Thin: When the fruit has set, the earlier after the "June drop" the work can be carefully done the better will be the results obtained. This will be shortly after peaches have shed their shucks, or when other fruits are about the size of small walnuts. Generally the last of May or early June is the season for the thinning and at this time the surplus fruit can be removed at a rapid rate by one who has had a little experience. With plums and peaches in many sections, the work should be done earlier than the first of June; with pears and apples during some years thinning may be done later. Distance to Thin: In a general way one can suggest as follows: Remove all ill-formed, diseased, wormy or Inferior fruit; pick all clus - ters to one specimen, and then thin until the fruits are four to eight inches apart, depending upon the size of the crop, the particular :'ruit 'Jordan, A T.

            <seg id="p557">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY and the ability of the tree to mature the fruit properly without break - age of the branches. When the thinning is done by. owner, the danger lies in leaving too many rather than in removing an excess number of fruits. The question has often arisen as to whether it is always advisable to thin to one fruit per spur. When the total crop on the tree :s light, but certain branches have a comparatively heavy set, should these branches be thinned as heavily ffs when the entire tree bears a heavy crop? Investigations by Haller and Magness (1931) indicate there is some free food movement along the main branches and that fruit may draw upon leaves at appreciable distances for its develop - ment. Hence, when the crop as a whole is light, It does not seem necessary to thin to single fruits on strong growing spurs. Likewise, heavily loaded branches closely adjacent to others carrying few fruits do not need to be thinned heavily and the fruit may still be expected to develop satisfactory size. How to Thin: The thinning of fruit is performed about as one would pick the fruit at time of harvest. In thinning a branch, the fruit lowest down may be left on, and then the hand is moved along the branch about four to eight inches, snapping orf the fruits In passing. A fruit is then allowed to remain and the following four to eight inches of branch are cleaned of fruit. In thinning apples and pears or any fruit where the crop may be to some extent borne upon short growth, care must be exercised not to break off the fruit spurs. The apple or pear may be snapped off with the stem breaking just at the point of attachment to the fruit. This permits the specimens to be removed without disturbing those which are to remain and avoids the breaking of the spur. Nearly all fruits may be thinned by hand and most growers pre - fer to thin without the use of thinning shears. Some varieties of apples and pears with short stems are not so readily thinned by hand and the use of small thinning shears made for this purpose may expedite the work. This prevents' the breaking of the fruit Bpura and where several specimens are removed from a cluster, the remain - ing fruit can be left undisturbed when shears are used. If the fruit is pulled off by hand there is some danger of removing the enTlre cluster. Usually, however, the work can be done quicker, cheaper, and as well by hand. It Is certainly not necessary to use shears in the removal of plums and peaches. Cost of Thinning: The cost of thinning varies considerably, de - pending upon the distance to which the fruit is thinned, the size of the tree, the load of fruit, and other factors. From experiment station work and from information supplied by practical growers, a fair estimate of the cost seems to be an average of about thirty to fifty cents a tree. </seg>
            <seg id="p558">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the West Virginia 1 experiments, they found for one man a range of from 25 minutes per tree at a cost of 8% cents on nine year old Baldwins bearing one barrel per tree, to two hours and thirteen minutes per tree at a cost of 43% cents on middle aged trees of differ - ent varieties bearing from 4 to 6 barrels per tree. Cost' of harvesting and grading reduced: Aside from the bene - ficial Influences upon the fruit and tree, there is another point which should be kept in mind when one considers the cost and attempts to determine the returns. Because of the greater uniformity of size and color, and because of the lessened number of culls, the two follow - ing indirect benefits are obtained, namely (1) the cost of harvesting the fruit , is considerably reduced, and (2) the time and labor required to sort and grade is quite appreciably decrease?. Conclusions: Most growers who" have practiced thinning are of the opinion that on the years of off bearing, the necessity of thinning is not great, and that on such years the money returns from thinning may be slight. They believe, however, that on years of heavy yields, thinning will show profit, either by increasing the market value be - cause of the higher quality of the fruit, or by protecting the trees from damage which might result from the tax of too heavy a burden of fruit. Thinning can be said to be more or less of an individual problem, and different varieties will need to be thinned somewhat differently upon different years, depending upon the amount of fruit. It is at least a practice with which' one should be familiar, and a practice which the grower should judiciously' use as the season, the amount of fruit set, and other factors, demand. MR. BAKER: Are there any questions you care to ask at this time? I might ask, "Have they tried any thinning at the time of the blossoming? MR. OVERHOLSER: Not in Washington. Of course. It Is recog - nized that the earlier the thinning, the greater the effect upon stim - ulating and bringing about conditions that will give an adequate net in the following year. If a man thins blossoms even though that was a heavy year and they would expect a light crop the following year, it would be expected that the next year's crop would be greater. I don't know that the growers have ever foiind it economically feasible. MR. BAKER: I had never seen or heard of it being practiced until this year In southern Illinois. With Wlnesaps, part of them were thinned at the time of bloom and the others were thinned right after the June drop. This man contended that he had thinned during bloom for the last three years on the same trees and they came back » Auchtcr. E. C W. Vir. Exp. Sta. Bui. 162 (1917.) </seg>
            <seg id="p559">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY with a good crop each year. The fruit did seem more uniform in size on the trees which had been thinned during bloom. I asked him how he did it and he said he had three boys to help him and they just go through with pruning shears and cut the spur right off. MR. OVERHOLSER: I don't believe the growers in Washington would like to do that. Their spurs out there are fairly long-lived so they would be removing their potential fruit bearing capacity. MR. BAKER: I noticed that the spurs left on the trees were good vigorous spurs. This man beTIeved In it . He only had forty acres to look after. MR. OVERHOLSER: Of course, there is this thing about it in the northwest. They like to thirfk of their areas as frost-free. They do sometimes get late frosts at the time of bloom or shortly after and sometimes those frosts thin more than they should. They like to put off thinning until after danger of frost. They find In their practice that they get fairly regular crops and I would judge It would be less expensive. MR. BAKER: I know we have trouble enough thinning with apples on the trees, let alone when they are in bloom. Question: After hearing that talk, I feel that I have been repaid for riding most of the night. You spoke in your talk about the proper amount of sugar. I don't know whether you mentioned nitro - gen or not but that has a great deal to do with the size as I under - stood it from you and also with the setting of the apples from the blossoms. How do the growers out there equalize that. How do they get to know when they have the proper amount of sugar and the proper amount of nitrogen? Answer: I do not know that I can answer that question. The growers really have not gone into it far enough to try to say there is a definite sugar percentage in their apples. Nor in regard to thin - ning have they tied that up with the nitrogen relationships but It certainly would be significant, and whether they have done It definitely with that in mind, that has perhaps unwittingly been Involved. The growers use quite a lot of fertilizer. Nearly all of the orchards at one time or another use nitrogen In some form. Some have gone to excess. They have put on too much, with the result that they get poor color and get a delay in maturity and the result that they are spending money unnecessarily. There is another feature Involved with the Jonathan. That pertains to internal breakdown. The grow - ers are always striving to get large size and good color and they are quick to adopt any practice that would bring this about. With the Jonathan they feel that they have gone too far and have tended to bring about a situation that is discrediting to their Jonathan because it is susceptible to internal breakdown. If you put on year after </seg>
            <seg id="p560">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE year large quantities of nitrogenous fertilizer and thin heavily, you predispose that variety to internal breakdown. Nitrogenous fertilizer stimulates a larger leaf area and that together with the nitrogenous relationship itself gives large size. The growers feel that the eating quality of their fruit is as good as that produced anywhere. I don't know whether you agree with them. But I am happy to say that the northwest grows an apple that is very high in quality. They" do have a long growing season. They do have an unusual lot of sunshine and very favorable temperature and climatic conditions. They spray their leaf area and keep it free from insects. Their apples have a high sugar content. I don't know whether I have replied to that question as you wanted me to, if not, I would be glad to try to do bo. Question: I think the question has been pretty well answered. Of course we have some idea along that line but the organic matter we get in the soil, along with the nitrogen, keeps them in pretty good balance. But it is a mystery to me how to keep just that balance. Answer: I think the growers employ as measuring sticks and keep in mind the growth the tree makes. Eight to ten inches annual terminal growth. They keep in mind the size of the crop produced. They vary their amount of actual nitrogen from one-half pound to two pounds per tree. The experiment station feels with annual appli - cations that one pound of actual nitrogen is enough. Some years they feel it will do to withhold nitrogen. This year they will not use it to speak of. They vary it from year to year. One thing they have in the northwest is a permanent alfalfa cover crop. It may be of interest to know that one of the soil problems they have out there Is the problem of little leaf or rosette. The apple trees will have a type of growth where the leaves are smaller and more narrow and the space between the leaves is shortened. It was discovered that if they planted those orchards to an alfalfa cover crop that within three years this was corrected. But with increased growth of trees and a more complete shading of the ground it is difficult to keep up the alfalfa cover crop. Under those circumstances the trees again are showing rosette. Another thing has entered in. With the older trees the need for water has increased. In some sections they do not have all the water they would like to have and the cover crop suffers. That led to a number of studies and various kinds of fertilizers were applied. Elements not considered normally necessary were added to the soil. It was found that potash had no influence. Iron sulphate applied in large quantities overcame the trouble at once but that had to be reapplied every three years. . The effect became minimized each successive year. Besides It was too expensive to use. Again they were up against it. They decided that it must be an impurity In the iron sulphate. They found it was zinc. When they left this out the iron sulphate was chemically pure. This was added with no </seg>
            <seg id="p561">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY benefit. They found that some five or six pounds of zinc sulphate helped it. So this soil problem was overcome. . Question: Under the growing conditions that they have in the northwest what is the average life of a tree? Answer: The northwest, of course, so far as an apple producing center goes, is still somewhat young and I think we don't know. There are orchards thirty-five and forty years old that are still profit - ably producing. That is longer than has been the case in the Missouri Valley. Whether it will be as long as in New York State where there are orchards one-hundred years old, 1 don't know. - Question: How early do the trees come into bearing? Answer: That varies, depending on the variety and the pruning. Within recent years with young trees, they do not prune so severely. When they reduce the pruning to a minimum and give it in form of thinning out, they can harvest a crop at five or six years. Question: Do they trim their leaders back? Answer: No, they do not. They don't cut them back. Of course, they do top them if the branches become unduly long, in order -to maintain symmetry. In California they cut them back excessively heavy every year some ten years ago. They do not do that in Wash - ington. Question: Their trees seemed so much more stocky there. Answer: Whether we are right or wrong, 1 would like to have your judgment. We feel that we get a stockier tree when we do not cut back so heavily. We can keep the branch thin in diameter and have it almost devoid of pruning. The branch which we leave entirely will thicken up much thicker in diameter. While the one cut back every year will produce three or four water sprout shoots, it will not thicken up. It is devoid of fruiting spurs. One reason that they have the appearance of stocky growth is because they have given up the cutting back so excessively. Question: Do they select main limbs when they set the trees out? Answer: If the tree is a well grown nursery tree and has the branches developed and properly developed they do. If it is one year old they do not cut back so low as they used too. They as a rule cut the branch not lower than twentyfour to thirty Inches high and that means they can get the buds pushing out pretty well throughout the length. They can then have more branches from which to select. If it is cut back severely they just have three or four branches to select from. MR. BAKER: I might say that before you leave you should eat a Nebraska grown apple. </seg>
            <seg id="p562">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. OVERHOLSER: I would be Interested to do that. Archer said one time in Kansas City that someone said the Missouri Valley apple was the best In the country. He said he had just completed a tour of twelve Horticultural Societies and there were twelve places in the United States where the finest apple in the country was grown. MR. BAKER: We will go on with the program. I might say to some of you who came in- late that Professor Overholser has given us some very good information on thinning. I know from our own experience this year that if we had told our men to thin the fruit and had stayed away we would not have had so many small Individuals. We would go to the orchard where they were thinning and look on the ground and then tell the man to go a little easier and of course the men did so. The result was that too many apples were left on the trees. Mr. Burt is not here so the next on the program is "A Cold Storage House for Apples at the Orchard," by Mr. Turner of Neosho, Missouri. A COLD STORAGE HOUSE FOR APPLES AT THE ORCHARD MR. TURNER, Neosho, Missouri Mr. Chairman and the Nebraska fruit growers, I am glad to be here today. I enjoyed the professor's talk. About thirty days ago 1 received a letter from your secretary, asking if I could attend Vhis meeting and tell you my experience with the cold storage plant at Neosho and give you come costs and the advantages I received from, the plant. I told him I would be glad to do that. Here I am. I believe that the most of us are in the fruit business for the money we make. Not very many stay with all the expense and through all the agony of raising the fruit just for their health and the pleasure they get out of it. This year that is about all some of us got out of it. To make money out of fruit there are two things to do. The flrst is to do proper pruning, fertilizing, spraying and thinning to raise good crops. There is no chance to make money -out of poor fruit. The second step is marketing it to the best advantage. If a man falls to sell his apples for the most money obtainable, just to that extent he loses part of the work and money put forth. I think most every section has Its different marketing problems. Our section may be different from yours. Our plans may not work here. They do work with us. Some thirty to thirty-five years ago we did not have , trouble marketing apples. At that time we could sell all the apples at harvest. We are close to the zinc mines and the oil fields and have a good market. Most of our apples are sold locally. Very lew go out of the district. At that time we had no trouble. We made </seg>
            <seg id="p563">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY good money and our acreage increased rapidly. We did not have to spray. We did not have to worry about trosis in spring. We did not have so many drouths. Those were the good old days. They are gone forever, X guess. As time went along our acreage increased. We came to the point where we could not sell all of our crop lit harvest. The apples had to be put in barns and cellars and kept In storage. We got by this way for several years. Still later this did not work. We could not ke^p all of them because we were raising more all the time. We could not keep them long enough to get rid of them. We had an extra good ice plant in the town and arranged to store the apples there for twenty cents a bushel. Under ihis arrangement the apples we could not sell at harvest were taken care of. In the spring we got rid of the rest of them. We sold those and paid the storage expenses and had a profit. We outgrew this too. Then we had to either sell our apples at less than they were worth at a forced market or ship them out to other towns and store them. We tried this for three years. It was not so good. The expense ol shipping them and the storage was high. There was not so much profit.' Then we lost contact with buyers who had come to the orchards. We either priced them too low and they went right out, or too high and they stayed on hand. Then we decided to build our own storage at the farm. Five years ago we built the first section. It was just a small section. We thought it was big at the time. It was insulated with cork. We put in the best refrigerating machinery we could buy at that time. We have a good plant. It is not big but is good. This plant cost us, for thirty-five thousand bushel capacity, about thirty thousand dollars at the time. We found that it was entirely too small. We found that a large plant could be run at the same expense. We increased it to ninety thousand bushels. It cost fifty-five thousand dollars. The same plant today could be duplicated for much less money. We could put in the same plant for not to exceed forty thousand dollars. You could build a plant that will do good work for less than that. I say a ninety thousand bushel capacity. We can take care of more than that. We raise early apples and harvest them the first week in September or the last week of August. We harvest the late ones in October and November. In the meantime we sell out sotne in storage and use the space again and can take care of more. But when the market is good, the best money we make is selling at harvest and then we store what we cannot sell. We always sell what we can at harvest time if there is a fair price. This year we did not sell at harvest. So many people this year did not .-now where they were. They were afraid to go to the expense of storing and would sell cheap. Now as to the cost of operation. We store nothing but apples. We only run the storage about eight months out of the year. We start it the last week in August and put the apples In the first week </seg>
            <seg id="p564">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in September. Our heaviest expense is in August and September in cooling the apples down. After we get them cooled down we can do with less refrigeration. During the packing season we run three machines day and night. After the apples are cooled down we cut off one machine. Later we do not have to run at night. This reduces our expense. We have a very cheap rate for current. Our total expense for eight months is $1,500. The biggest expense is in September and October when it runs better than $300 per month. This includes power for running motors and lighting system for storage and iwo residences and for pumping water. The expense for labor for packing the apples in the storage and for selling the apples and for taking them out of the storage Is about the same, $1,500. Our packing - sheds are on either side of the storage. They run full length of vhe building. At one end of the packing shed we have grading tables and washing machines. The apples are washed and packed and put in storage In five minutes. That is a big advantage. The quicker the apples are put under refrigeration, the better they -will keep. Another advantage is that this is usually our very busiest time and we do not have to have extra help. It saves a big expense. We just put them in storage. One of the biggest advantages we have is the personal contact with the buyers. Practically every one of the buyers comes to the storage. We meet them personally. It used to be that through that section where there is one town right after another, pretty nearly every town had a small wholesale house. They buy In small quantities. They send their trucks over and get the apples. Practically all of our apples go out in less than carload lots. We usually store about fifteen varieties and two or three grades of each variety. The trade takes our entire crop. We have not shipped a car - load out of the district this year. There are many other advantages 1 could tell you about. Come down to see us some time and we would be glad to take you through. I would just as soon try to raise a good crop of apples without a good spray equipment as to raise it without refrigeration. , . Discussion Question: Do you store in baskets? Answer: The majority we store in baskets. This year we utored Ben Davis in bulk. Sometimes we store them in crates. We can get more apples in the bins. It saves about one-fourth of the space. They have kept perfectly. We have not tried to store the other varieties in crates. Question: How did you organize that storage proposition? Did you have a cooperative outfit? Answer: No. It is mine individually. Fifty miles from there they have a fine cooperative plant. It is a large one. rt is really too large for that district. For our district you can get them too large. </seg>
            <seg id="p565">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY It is hard to pay the interest on the investment.. It is three times as large as my plant. It belongs to the growers. I was one of the charter members of the organization when it was organized. It Is very successful but I believe it is too big. The cooperative plant can be worked out mighty nice. MR. BAKER:. Are there any more questions that you would care to ask? I am sure we are all interested in your storage house and you gave us some ideas to take home. I don't know whether. If we had many crops like we had this year, we could build a ?50,000 plant or not. Question: Did you get sonle contracting firm that builds cold storage plants especially to do this work? Answer: No. We drew our own plans and specifications and built it ourselves. We did have a refrigeration company to plan out the refrigeration and how much we would need and all that and put that in' and this refrigeration company put the insulation on. We planned the building. Someone said there was a question of whether he could afford to build a cold storage plant. The question is whether he could afford not to. Question: What is the size of your building now? Answer: It is 100x110, two stories. In the last addition we made the ceiling higher. The first building we made so that we could ptack eight baskets high. The last building Is higher. I prefer not to stack them more than eight baskets high. Question: Do you have circulation through the bins? Answer: The bins hold about 1,000 bushels. They are just poured in loose. They keep perfectly. Answer: Do you cool these down before you bin them In bulk? Answer: We have the storage cooled down before we put the apples in. We bring the apples from the orchard and put them right In. MR. HOPPERT: I think Mr. Turner mentioned to me that they have fans to circulate tthe air. MR. TURNER: Yes, we use Just fans. We have gotten by all right. Question: What temperature do you have? Answer: Thirty-three degrees held as near as we can. Question: Is the temperature held that way automatically? Answer: No: If you have the storage full of apples and get them all down to that temperature it is just like a block of ice. It will not vary much. </seg>
            <seg id="p566">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Question: About what commission do you charge the other grow - ers for selling fruit? Answer:. They all buy spray material from me. They also buy the baskets and pads from me. I charge them 20c for storage Question: Have you ever thought of the possibility of having a cold air storage in combination, the idea being to cool the apples off in cold storage and put them into an air cooled area after the weather is cold enough to store. them satisfactorily? Answer: I have never thought of it. Question: I would think that in the case of some of the late varieties you would have a cool enough air temperature, especially if the apples- were cooled first. That would increase the capacity. Answer: So far we have had all the capacity we need when we sell so many locally. We ship very few apples out of the district. We get much better prices on the local market. They are far ahead of any received from apples shipped out. All of our sound apples, no difference how small, we save for cider. This cider is made out of strictly sound apples. The others that we can ship we send to the vinegar factories. Every bushel of small apples will make about three and one-half gallons of cider. We get 20c a gallon for cider. This cider business we have built up in the last four years. Question' Is that a pasteurized proposition? Answer: No. It is just fresh cider. We make about ten barrels at a time and it will keep for at least thirty days in storage. Question: Did you store any drop apples this year? Answer: Yes. We always do. With the Grimes some of our very best apples drop on account of the heat. Some years we get more out of the drops. We have lots of hot weather. Sometimes some of our very best apples drop. If we can get to them and get them in storage they bring just as good a price as the others. Question: ■ You would rather let them drop than top pick them? Answer: No. We would rather pick them but if they do drop we store them. Question: Don't you make a practise of picking your largest ones before they drop? Answer: We should but we do not. It pays to do that but we' have been busy and try to hold expenses down and don't dp it. Question: Do you get quite a few green Grimes? Answer: Yes. Question: Do they soon color up? Answer: It takes a long time. Sometimes the best ones drop on account of the heat. Sometimes we get 25c a bushel more for them. </seg>
            <seg id="p567">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY MR. BAKER: It has been our experience here in Nebraska that our number one apples fall to the ground. This year thirty per cent of our crop were drops. If we had not been able to wash them I do not know what we would have done. Fifty per cent of the thirty per cent we put on the market. There is not a very large representation of the Society here bo we might as well save our business meeting until tomorrow. Does anyone know of any reason why we could not postpone it until to - morrow? That Is all of the program for this morning. </seg>

Mr. Hoppert, the Sec - retary, will read his address that we omitted this morning. Members of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society, Ladles and Gentlemen: Another year has passed and the fruit-man, especially the apple grower, has found that there are other problems besides the Browing of trees, ! pollination, fertilization, and control of fruit pests. The growers have found that in a year of a large crop, the marketing of the fruit is one of the major problems. One factor of marketing that at first appeared to be a great blessing and convenience, but since the last season has been considered a curse by most growers, is the truck load buyer. I do not mean to say that all truckers are a menace to the stability of the apple market; but the driver of the old dilapi - dated truck and the ones who have no financial backing and who go from orchard to orchard telling of Bome other place where he can get better quality at cheaper prices. These men are a detriment and nuisance £o the fruit grower. We expect to have some discussion on tliis subject in the afternoon program. The orchard tour held on August 10th, sponsored by this society, was well attended and a great deal of Interest was shown by the Jarge number of persons in attendance. Over one hundred people ate the noon day' meal at Brownville and several stopped at Auburn. The Senator Banning orchard at Union was the starting point and from there we ' went to the State Orchard south of Union, and then on to orchards around Nebraska City, Auburn, Brownville, Nemaha and Shubert. The last stop was the new packing house of the Shubert Land Co. and Shubert Bros., where a newly installed apple washer was Inspected and discussed. Those who inspected and viewed the orchards ,on this tour saw a very fine crop of apples and were very enthusiastic in their praise of Nebraska orchards and fruit. </seg>
            <seg id="p569">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The Secretary of this Society made a trip into the fruit section of Colorado and will show a movie reel and give a lectutre on Colo - rado's fruit in tomorrow's program. A very credible showing was made by the fruit men with their fruit at the State Pair in Lincoln. Several of the growers had dis - plays entered in the new Commercial Fruit Growers Class, and gave the public a better idea of what Nebraska apples look like in packages. In spite of the drouth condition and the resultant smaller sizing of the apples, the horticulture exhibit was better than usual. Professor Hoppert, State Horticulture Extension agent, put on a show of Nebraska apples at the Ak-Sar-Ben Snow in Omaha and re - ports a great deal of interest on the part of the crowds attending the Show. The law passed during the last legislature regulating the eradi - cation of cedar trees in the counties having large commercial orchards has not been tested in court. However the orchard men feel that a long step has been made in the direction of cedar tree eradication. It seems to me that this society should recommend and sponsor some needed legislation regarding the peddling of fruit from trucks and the misrepresenting of the grade. This would help make it hard for the trucker to misrepresent the quality of fruit he is offering lor sale. Another matter which might be changed is the freight rate, on certain grades of bulk apples. Into the central and western part of the state. It seems that Kansas has a rate which permits their growers to bill bulk apples as "Cider Apples" and in that way have a cheaper freight charge than we have into the same territory. The year 1931 has passed, but for most of the larger growers accounts are not closed yet. Many carloads of apples are in storage and many accounts unpaid. We hope for another good crop and bet - ter prices In 1932. MR. BAKER: Mr. Bowers is not here. Mr. Bowers is the man - ager of the. Wathena Packing Plant and perhaps some of you have been through that plant. If not, if you ever go through Wathena on the way to St. Joe I would suggest that you stop and go over that building. I was there when they were packing Jonathan and Delicious and they certainly have a wonderful building and some nice equipment. MR. HOPPERT: I might say that we were at the Wathena Pack - ing House this fall when the meeting of the Missouri Valley Fruit Growers was held at St. Joseph. This particular packing plant was one of the points of interest. Mr. Reese of the Federal Farm Board was present. The banker who made the talk at the packing house said that the cooperative organization was formed as a result of Mr. </seg>
            <seg id="p570">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Reese's activities and that the Farm Board had financed the building of this packing house. It is 150, 1 would judge, by 250. They have four or five large grading outfits. They do the grading and packing and washing of the fruit for all of the members. They packed up and sold three hundred cars of apples. They estimated that 15c per bushel would cover the entire cost. Their rate of interest was a little remarkable. This banker from Wathena said they could not begin to do business on that kind of a basis. I think one-fourth of one per cent was, all that was charged on a loan of $15,000. I believe the total plant cost about $30,000. They got pledges and subscriptions for the other $15,000. I am sorry that Mr. Bowers is not here to dis - cuss this himself. We had the assurance up until yesterday that he was coming and I know he could have given us interesting figures and explanations of how they handled the crop. Question: Is that one-fourth of one per cent per annum? Answer: Yes. Question: Have you ever heard him say anything about packing costs? : Answer: At that time he had not figured it up but he seemed to think it would run between: twelve and fifteen cents per bushel. The total investment of $30,000 represented land, building, machines for washing, packing crates and trucks. They had no basement Under the building so could not store. At Blair they had the basement fixed for storing and did store. They Tiad in storage under the pack - ing house possibly ten or fifteen carloads. That plant was still in operation at that time. I was anxious to find what the first year'a operations resulted in. From the reports of the Kansas meeting, they seemed to be quite well satisfied with the results. MR.. BAKER: We will go on with the program. This morning. Professor Overholser gave us a very good talk on thinning, and we have him on the program this afternoon on the subject of "Marketing the Apple Crop of the State of Washington." I am glad to introduce him. PROFESSOR OVERHOLSER: A moment ago I was reminded of a story that Dr. Whitney used to tell. I was reminded of it because I thought that I might be in the same situation. I was a student of Dr. Whitney. This story Dr. Whitney told about the time when a number of years ago they had an extension train, where specialists would give information on various points of the agricultural industry. The last day out. the dairyman got a wire telling him of serious Illness in his family. He hesitated to leave on the last day. Dr. Whit - ney realized his position and said that he had listened to his talk so often and with so much interest that perhaps with the aid of lantern </seg>
            <seg id="p571">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY slides he could give It for him. So Dr. Whitney gave his own talk in the fine manner he always gave it. Then it was time to give the dairy talk. One slide was to give a good type of dairy cow and the other slide the bad type of cow. Dr. Whitney called for the slide and when it was thrown on the screen, he began to lambast that dairy cow, pointing out all of its defects and its bad points. After he had lam - basted it for a good long time, he called for the next slide. When the next slide was thrown on the screen, he found that the slides had become mixed and that he had lambasted the good type of dairy cow. He caught his breath and gasped and said, "And this, gentle - men, Is a doggone sight worse," and passed on to the next slide. MARKETING THE APPLE CUOP OP THE STATE OP WASHINGTON By E. L. OVERHOLSER Head of the Department of Horticulture, Agricultural Experiment Station, State College of Washington, Pullman, Washington. History A point of interest concerning the apple industry of Washington is Its very rapid growth. Although apple trees were planted in the principle- apple- districts as early as the late 70's, plantings were light until shortly before the beginning of the present century. Natural climatic advantages together with high prices received for shipments during the late 90's, and for some time thereafter, resulted in more extensive plantings. This planting attained large proportions by 1907 or 1908 and reached its peak sometime in the five-year period from 1910 to 1915. Plantings were light during the next five-year period, but since about 1920 there has been a moderate Increase. The recent plantings, however,. are but a little more than sufficient to maintain the present number of bearing trees. These recent plantings have been trending toward fewer and better varieties, about 80 per cent having been Delicious and Winesap. During the early years of the present century the crop was grad - ually Increasing. About 1910 the increase became more rapid, and even more rapid by 1916, this rapid growth continuing until 1923. Since the very large crop of 1923, however, the increase has been relatively small. At the beginning of the century, the State of Wash - ington ranked about twentieth in the production of apples with an average crop of approximately two million bushels. At present it is the principal apple producing state of the United States, having In - creased its production to approximately 30,000,000 bushels annually, which is nearly fifteen times the production of thirty years ago. </seg>
            <seg id="p572">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Now over one out of every four apples purchased by consumers in the United States is a Washington grown apple (28 per cent), (John - son, 1930). During the five years from 1926 to 1930, Washington shipped 32.8 per cent of the carlot apple shipments of the United States and about 65 per cent of the box shipments (Hampson and Dummeier, 1930). The State of Washington Is, therefore, now one of the most' influential factors In the apple production of the country. Orchards in the State of Washington are kept in high production and every known feasible means is employed to grow and develop trees that will produce the largest possible crop of well colored, high quality fruit. Commercial districts. — The apple producing areas of Washington are usually grouped Into five districts upon the basis of their location (Chart I) as follows: (1) Wenatchee-Okanogan, with about 52 per cent of the state's shipments; (2) Yakima, with about 41 per cent of the shipments; (3) Spokane, with about 3 per cent; (4) Walla Walla, and (5) White Salmon, with about 2 per cent each. The Yakima and Wenatchee-Okanogan districts ship nearly 93 per cent of all the apples from the State of 'Washington. Some of the advantages of the Wenatchee and Yakima districts, which produce the bulk of the crop, are: (1) Excellent high annual yields of fine marketable fruit. The average yield is about 536 boxes per acre, nearly 77 per cent of which will qualify for "extra fancy" and "fancy" grades. (2) Splendid climatic conditions with compara - tive freedom from late spring frosts. (3) Prevalence of good com - mercial and heavy bearing varieties. (4) Highly centralized plant - ings, and very adequate facilities for handling, storing and marketing fruit. (5) Good roads. (6) Relative freedom from fungous disease. The fact! that there is no rainfall from May until September means that there is no scab to control and comparatively little mildew. (7) A fine type of people in the industry, and very good social conditions. Nearly everyone in the apple districts is an apple specialist and is more or less a student of raising and marketing apples, even though he may not actually grow fruit. The districts are, of course, not without their problems, which Include high land values (from $1,200 to $1,500 per acre) , excessive distance i from markets, expense of irrigation and inadequate water some seasons in certain districts, heavy infestation of codling moths, some winter injury and root killing, some alkali and other soil prob - lems, and only very limited diversification. While the cost of irrigation was listed as a limitation, it results in certain advantages as follows: (1) the districts are compact; (2) the orchards are productive; (3) the tree growth is rapid and ade - quate, and (4) intensive cultural attention is required. Furthermore, trees in irrigated regions must receive detailed care every year. If </seg>
            <seg id="p573">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY irrigation is neglected for a single season, the orchard is ruined. Also great care is necessary to avoid over-Irrigation which may result in alkali accumulations, and the grower is forced to give attention to his orchard and to keep informed. The greater investment and higher production costs necessitate careful judicious management, grading, and packing. Marketing Methods The marketing services involved in spanning the gap between the producer and consumer are listed by Dummeier (1925) as follows: (1) assembling; (2) grading and standardizing; (3) packaging; (4) storing; (5) processing or utilizing culls in by-product form; (6) transporting; (7) financing; (8) distributing; and (9) selling. Growers in the Pacific Northwest have marketed their fruit through various agencies, the most important being cooperative and semi-cooperative selling organization, local dealers, traveling cash buyers, and commission merchants (Kitchen, Seifert, and Hall, 1921). In referring to the semi-cooperative selling organizations it should be pointed out that there are some so-called "co-ops" that are largely assembling and packing associations who sell through other agencies. According to Dummeier (1931) about one-third of the apple crop of the State of Washington is cooperatively marketed. Very early in the history of the industry much of the fruit Was handled through cash buyers. As the production expanded the ten - dency was to consign more to commission merchants in the Various cities. This practice, however, was not satisfactory and the coopera - tives and the strong marketing organizations, borne no doubt at least in the minds of . many growers, upon the basis of necessity, worked for years to develop the practice of f. o'. b. sales and were successful even with the export trade. And this method of sale is now most extensively employed. Certain workers (Hampson and Dummeier, un - published) believe that the next trend in the development of methods of sale will be on a delivered basis. In an f. o. b. sale, the price is- for the fruit loaded on the car at shipping point, and the responsibility of damage or deterioration that may occur in transit is with the buyer. Usually with the f. o. b. sale, however, only about a two hundred dollars down-payment Is made upon the car before shipping for immediate delivery. A draft is attached to the bill of. lading which is sent to the seller's banking connection. The buyer must accept the draft before receiving the bill of lading. If some of the fruit arrives in an unsatisfactory condition an adjustment is made by the shipper and a refund allowed. Fewer risks to the grower are Involved in an f. o. b. sale, and he knows the price he is to receive when the shipment is made. Apples that are not of the best quality and that are not in a standardized pack, however, cannot be readily sold on a f. o. b. basis, especially when the year's' production is large. </seg>
            <seg id="p574">■ REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The cooperative method generally consists of collective selling by hired representatives of one or more groups of producers and nearly every type of cooperative organization has been in operation. Local associations are formed, consisting of a single group of growers, who employ a manager to transact their business and sell the output. Federations of local groups also are formed, the managers of the local units acting as intermediaries between the central organization and the local unit. Some of the central organizations essentially con - trol sales, collections, inspections, and advertising, thus facilitating standardization and specialization. Local dealers may also purchase the fruit from growers buying outright for cash or on contract. Some local merchants have developed a merchandising department and advance supplies and equipment to growers whose fruit they buy or handle on consignment. A limited quantity of fruit is handled on a consignment basis by resident dealers. Such dealers often operate packing nouses where the fruit is graded, sized, and packed for a certain fixed charge per box, which includes box shook, materials, and labor. There are also cash sales to traveling or to resident buyers who represent firms in terminal markets. Some of these representatives also act as growers' agents and accept shipments on consignment. Direct sales or sales through brokers to firms in consuming cen - ters ars ; usually made on a f . o. b. basis. Various conditions make it necessary or desirable to roll a large number of loaded cars unsold. Usually these "tramp" cars are sent out to one of the early division points and thereafter diverted from day to day on their trip east and finally destined to territories that seem to promise the best returns and generally are sold when near to a market. If the prices are low and no demand exists and the fruit is good storage material, it may be temporarily stored to await better market conditions. If the fruit must be disposed of it may be put on the auction market. Many of these- sales are made through brpkers. Increasing production and a constantly increasing number of ship - pers have resulted in active competition with resultant improvement in the marketing system. As the volume increases and the marketing problems become more complex, the development of cooperation be - tween growers' selling organizations and sales agents becomes almost imperative. Washington Boxed Apple Bureau. — In 1929 the Washington Boxed Apple Bureau was organized. Its purpose Is stated as follows: "The Washington Boxed Apple Bureau Is an organization of growers, shippers, cooperative organizations and warehouse men who have united to promote Washington boxed apples for the mutual benefit of producers, dealers and consumers. The bureau is incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington. It has three principal "planks": </seg>
            <seg id="p575">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY (1) To aid in unifying the boxed apple industry of Washington. (2) To' build the confidence of the buying trade in Washington boxed apples — to let them "know they are producing a quality product and backing it up with sound advertising and merchandising methods. ( 3 ) To widen the markets for Washington boxed applus through intel - ligent promotion along industrial lines. In 1930 the bureau was more than 80 per cent supported by the industry through a total'of seventy - one organizations. The funds of the bureau are obtained by contri - butions of one-half cent per box, collections being made by the shipper or cooperative organizations. Lump sums are paid by allied industries, such as spray companies and paper and box mills. In 1931 about SI 00,000 was available for advertising needs. Advertising material is mailed to the trade, newspapers are widely used, "clip sheets" are employed, an export manual was prepared, and the radio has been utilized. Preparation for Market As production increases in volume, harvesting, packing and shipping problems become increasingly difficult. A large proportion of the labor employed during this period is migratory and temporary. This is especially true of packers, warehousemen, and those employed in loading the cars. Sorters, however, are quite generally local help and much local help is employed in all handling operations. The transient individuals move from the south to the north as the various fruit crops in the west are harvested. Rigid grading rules, strictly enforced, have resulted in an excel - lent pack. Standardization in packing-house methods has been In - creasingly applied. Modern appliances for handling the fruit, such as sizing machines and power and gravity conveyors, are generally used. Since washing for the removal of arsenical spray residue be - came necessary, a greatly increased proportion of the apple crop has been packed in central or community packing houses operated by shipping organizations. Community packing houses. — Some of the necessary conditions for the successful operation of the community packing house as an ' adjunct to cooperative marketing have been summarized by Folger and Thomson (1921) as follows: (1) The plan is feasible only where more or less intensive and centralized plantings of a relatively small num - ber of varieties occur. (2) There is, of course, a minimum number of cars (possibly 150 to 200 cars) that can be handled with economy. (3)The location should preferably be adjacent to a railroad or other good transportation facilities. (4) A community spirit and willingness of the growers to cooperate must prevail. (5) There must be some uniformity in quality and character of the fruit so there may be a common interest between the growers. </seg>
            <seg id="p576">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE These men have also nicely summarized the possible advantages of the community packing house: (1) A better standardization of grades, which may be the justifying factor. The expert supervising the grading and packing should be disinterested financially in Uie crop handled and of course absolutely impartial. (2) Competent help is attracted by longer periods of employment. (3) With the combined capital modern plants and facilities can be made available without too great an overhead. (4) Storage space as an insurance against loss can be economically provided. (5) Community trucks may be used in hauling fruit to the packing house. (6) A saving per package may be effected with good management, especially if supplies are purchased in quantities for the members. (7) It is more feasible lo profit from the advantages of "pooling of fruit." Most of the fruit is sorted and packed into the three standard grades: (1) Extra Fancy; (2) Fancy, and (3) "C". It should be kept in mind that the "extra fancy" grade is essentially a perfect exhibit fruit, and of uniform size and of uniform, excellent color. Box packing with the better grades as indicated necessitates very careful sorting as to size as well as regards color and quality. The size variation permitted is not in excess of one-quarter of an inch in dia - meter, and all grades are carefully sized. On the basis of a uamplt - amounting to approximately 40 per cent of the total shipments, the proportion of the different grades in Washington during the six years from 1922 to 1927 was as follows: Zxtra Fancy, 40.6 per cent; Fancy, 36.2 per cent, "C" grade, 19.6 per cent. Combination Extra Fancy and Fancy, 1.4 per cent, and all other grades combined 2.2 per cent. The proportion of Extra Fancy and "C" grade fruit appears to be decreasing slightly, while the percentage of Fancy seems to be in - creasing (Hampson and Dummeler, 1930). In the establishment of standards for color, advantage has been taken of the fact that a large percentage of well-colored specimens is usually produced in the Northwest. The market value of the fruit has been enhanced in this way. The state and federal inspectors have been active In guarding against the shipment of inferior fruit and dishonest packs, so that the northwestern crop has been handled and marketed in general conformity to more uniform and rigid standards then have prevailed in other sections. Standardization of Quality and Pack In the marketing of the northwest apple crop, striking proof has been afforded of the dominating importance of standardization as a factor in the successful large scale marketing of perishable farm products. These rigid standards for fruit are maintained by two primary means, i. e., (1) education of the growers, and (2) by rigid inspec - tion. There is, of course, a recognized imperative need for high stand- </seg>
            <seg id="p577">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ards when the fruit is shipped such long distances to market. The state grades proclaimed each year by the State Director of Agriculture, are jn conformance with recommendations set forth by an annual con - vention attended by both the growers and the shippers. It has largely been through cooperative marketing that the north - west has been so successful, first, in standardizing and improving production, and second, in standardizing and improving the grade and the pack. With respect to production, the fruit grower should make every effort to meet the consumer's demand, and the larger cooperative associations are often in a position to suggest mutually beneficial and suitable changes. Again, cooperative organizations through experience and adoption and application of findings of horticultural investigators have brought about improvement in production and promotion of a standard high quality of product in the communities. The more gen - eral utilization, through activities of the field men of the cooperative organizations, the state horticultural inspectors, and the county agents, of what have been shown by the investigators of agricultural experi - ment stations to be the best methods of spraying, pruning, fertilizing, and thinning, for example, should make for uniformity of color and appearance in the fruit. Thinning for large size, however, can be over-emphasized insofar as market demands are concerned. Cooperative organizations have played an important part in bring - ing about the improvement and standardization of grades to make them uniform from shipping point to shipping point and from time to time. The greater the control of the central organization over the production, the greater the possibility that a high degree of perfection may be reached. In the case of apples sorted and graded after delivery by the pro - ducer, control of the local receiving and central packing house enables an association to put into effect improved grading and packing and other handling practices on short notice. Improving and standard - izing grade and pack has made marketing more efficient by (1) raising and level of Quality of the product, (2) by improving its carrying iiuality, and (3) by permitting readier agreement between buyer and seller. It should bo pointed out that standardization of a high quality pack is a comparatively simple matter under conditions where 75 per cent of the crop can be packed as "extra fancy" and "fancy" grades, consisting of nearly perfect apples. It is quite another matter, how - ever, under conditions where, because of poor "color, scab, codling moth, other diseases and insects and blemishes, the reverse would be the rule and the bulk of the crop would not qualify for these two best grades equivalent to the U. S. No. 1 grade. </seg>
            <seg id="p578">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Cooperative Marketing History proves that intelligent cooperation pays. Cooperative mar - keting is most likely to be successful when it is apparently borne of necessity. It is most likely to fail when it Is organized from the top down and thrust upon a group of growers. Other important difficulties which capable management may overcome are: (1) It is difficult io maintain harmony between management and members. (2) Members become careless as cooperative citizens, failing to vote or making poor selections of officers. ( 3 ) There Is often a tendency towards extrava - gance. ( 4 ) Outsiders sometimes get higher prices than members even when an organization is functioning efficiently. (5) Members of a new organization often expect impossibilities. Some of the advantages of cooperative marketing have already been emphasized but the outstanding possibilities may be summarized (Erdman, 1925): (1) Standardizing and improving production, grade and pack; (2) Stabilizing production; (3) Controlling flow of market; (4) improving distribution between markets; (5) Advertising and the development of new markets; (6) Collective bargaining; (7) Financ - ing of marketing operations; (8) Making marketing more efficient; and (9) Maintaining favorable public relations. Reference has been made to pooling of fruit, which is feasible with cooperative marketing and community packing houses. The chief advantages of pooling are: (1) It gives the individual grower better insurance against the risks of marketing; (2) It facilitates the trans - fer of the control of the product from the members to the manage - ment; and (3) certain costs may be reduced. The chief disadvan - tages of pooling as compared with selling on the individual growers account are: (1) The difficulty of equitable adjustment between the members of a pool; and (2) the delay in the returns from the sale of the fruit (Ordman and Wellman, 1927). In further reference to cooperation there are three limitations not always recognized, as follows: (1) Cooperative associations can - not arbitrarily "fix" prices, although they can and do exercise a favor - able Influence on prices. (2) They cannot "eliminate the middle man" except in the sense of combining the function performed by a number of dealers at any giyon stage in the marketing process. (3) Coopera - tive marketing cannot cut costs greatly. The Box Pack The western boxed-apple industry has developed to its present commercial importance primarily within the last thirty years. For the six-year period ending In 1899, boxed apples constituted less than 5 per cent of the total production of the United States. For the six - year period ending in 1923, boxed apples averaged about 30 per cent of the total, and during the last six-year period, it approximated nearly 50 per cent. To a large degree, this increase has resulted </seg>
            <seg id="p579">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY because the increases in production have been in the districts using boxes. According to Park (1929) estimates relating to the 1926 season's apple supplies in thirty-six cities throughout the country indicate that 43 per cent of the receipts were in boxes, 35 per cent were in barrels, 14 per cent were in bushel baskets, 5 per cent in miscellaneous con - tainers, and 3 per cent in bulk. The bushel basket has apparently increased in popularity as a container during the last few years. It is not the place in this paper to discuss the mechanics of apple box packing. This is adequately discussed in a number of publications (Pallthorp and Klnsey, 1925; Talbert and Merrill, 1926). Rapid development of domestic and foreign markets for the northwest apple crop In the face of the keenest competition from; the old established apple regions, has resulted In a large measure Irom the reputation gained and maintained by the western box pack. East - ern districts still retain the barrel as the standard apple package, but there has apparently been a gradual perceptible extension of west - ern methods into the eastern territory. The barreled-apple states are rapidly Improving in methods of management and are planting many of the varieties of chief commercial importance in Washington. The chart (adopted from Rauchensteln, 1927) shows graphically the carlot unloads of 30 per cent of the 1926 crop in thirty-four cities and indicates the proportions coming from the box area and the barrel area. New York City had the largest number of carlot unloads with a total of 14,606 of which 8,472 came from the barrel area. Chicago was next in importance in apple unloads with a total of 7,834 carlots, of which a trifle over one-half, or 3,951 carlots came from the barrel area and the remainder of 3,883 carlots from the box area. This chart shows graphically that west of St. Louis more than one-half of the carlot unloads originated in the box area, while east of St. Louis with the exception of New Orleans In the south, more than one-half of the unloads came from the barrel area. The smaller middle-western and eastern cities received a larger proportion of their apples Irom the barrel area than did the larger cities. As might be expected cities west of Denver received nearly all of their apples from the box area. These figures may be affected now by the truck movement of fresh fruits and vegetables which amounts to nearly 15 per cent of the total shipments. Boxes versus barrels. — There are certain factors which must be considered before contemplation of a change in the type of package in which to market apples. Some of these factors are as follows: (I) varieties; (2) availability of experienced packers; (3) trade to which growers will cater; (4) ratio of cost of package and packing to market price and quality; and (5) cost of handling. Certain varieties are better adapted to box packing than others. Examples of varieties, which, when well grown and graded, can pos- </seg>
            <seg id="p580">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sibly be packed profitably in boxes are as follows: (1) Delicious; (2) Winesap; (3) Arkansas Black; (4) Esopus; (5) Stay man (6) Rome Beauty; (7) King David; and (8) Jonathan. Varieties that are coarse in texture, and lacking in quality, and, hence, better adapted to barrel packing, are, (1) Ben Davis; (2) Gano; (3) Baldwin; and (4) Stark. The barrel packing is not a difficult operation to acquire, and in regions where this package is used there is generally no real problem in obtaining satisfactory packers. Box packing, however, is not so easily mastered, since its principles are complicated and can be applied only with considerable practice. In all the markets there are two classes of customers. One class comprising a small percentage desires the highest quality attractive fruit and does not question seriously the price. Their, needs are pri - marily supplied by the boxed apples or other fancy packages. The other class, comprising the larger percentage, gives the matter of price perhaps first consideration. While they purchase apples at lower prices or not at all, they likewise wish to obtain as high quality and as attractive fruit as can be purchased at reasonable prices. These classes are perhaps the two extremes and there are naturally grad - ations of customers between these classes. There are differences in the cost of packages and packing be - tween the barrel and the box and this difference in cost per bushel is in favor of the barrel. It is true that a premium is usually paid for boxed apples over apples packed in barrels or bushel baskets, but the question can be raised as to how much more than the increased cost does the premium amount to. Park (1929) in comparing Chicago monthly prices on all grades of boxed Jonathans for the 3-year period of 1925 to 1927 inclusive with prices of Jonathans in bushel baskets, found that the boxes brought a premium of about 15 per cent over the bushel baskets. A similar comparison In the Case of Mclntosh apples in New York indicated a premium of only 4 per cent in favor of boxed apples. He also found that the Jonathan in Chicago and the Ben Davis in Kansas City sold at a small premium per bushel in barrels as compared with bushel baskets. The amount of the premium in the case of the Jonathan was about 5 per cent and in the case of Ben Davis, 8 per cent. It should be pointed out, however, that the price paid for apples depends more largely upon the quality and con - dition than upon the package. Estimated costs by Woodworth and Potter (1931) including ma - terials, use of land and ' appreciation and depreciation of trees, of producing a bushel of apples with normal yields in New Hampshire was about 52 cents. When packed in barrels at a cost for packing of about 31 cents, including all operations and overhead expense, (Schnelderhan, 1930) plus the cost of the barrel averaging about 40 cents, giving a total of about 71 cents, the average cost of the </seg>
            <seg id="p581">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY packing and package is about 24 cents per bushel for apples that cost iibout -62 cents to produce. This makes the total production cost per bushel when sold in the barrel about 76 cents. In the Wenatchee and Yakima districts of Washington, the three - year average (1926-28) total cost oi producing and packing a box of apples delivered at the warehouse, including interest on land and with an average yield of 50U boxes per acre was about $1.18. Of this the central box packing costs, including items of material, labor, and overhead, from the time the loose fruit is received at the central packing plant until it is ready to be warehoused or sold, amounts to about 42 cents, (Hampson and Dummeier, 1930). When interest is excluded the total cost of production and packing is about 98 cents. The cost of the packing and package per bushel when In barrels is about 24 cents and when in boxes about 42 cents. In other words, if the eastern grown apples are packed in boxes, the cost of the container is about 80 per cent of the cost of produc - tion and when packed in' barrels the container cost is less than 50 per cent of the production cost. In studies made in Detroit (Gaston, 1931) it was determined that the most common monetary unit of sale to the consumer was 25 cents. When the price to the consumer went above three pounds for a quarter the sales fell off rapidly. It was further determined that all dealers prefer convenient packages, preferably boxes or tub bushel baskets and insist on good packing and above all, uniformity within the package. The bushel basket, especially the straightsided basket, is apparently growing In favor as a container at the expense of the barrel. For display purposes the barrel is inferior to both the box and basket. The eastern fruit grower, therefore, with his lower cost of pro - duction, lower cost of package and packing, and lower transportation charges is in a position to sell his fruit to a large trade, which because of the lessened consumer cost, is not strictly competitive with the northwest box pack, and still the eastern growers' net returns may be proportionately as great or greater per bushel as that received by the northwest grower. If a smaller package than the barrel is desired the cheaper straight-sided basket may supply this need with certain varieties. The cost for harvesting, grading and packing and con - tainer in the case of the bushel basket amounting to about 30 cents according to Brodell and Brannen (1929). Iiocal Air Cooled and Cold Storage Early In the history of the apple industry in the State of Wash - ington, nearly all of the apples were stored locally in common storage. At present a large part of the later harvested varieties, such as the winesap, is retained in common storage for from four to six weeks until the crop can be washed and packed when it is then placed under cold storage conditions. During the last five years, there has been a </seg>
            <seg id="p582">REPORT. OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE big increase in the local cold storage space at the point of production. This is possible with apples because the large volume and the rather long average length of storage make It possible to profitably store at point of production. In'1930 about 40 per cent of the cold storage space in the Yakirna district was owned by growers and their coopera - tives, about 50 per cent was controlled by buyers, and consignment houses, and only 10 per cent by purely commercial cold storage plants (Hampson, unpublished, 1931). About 53 per cent of this cold storage space is refrigerated by direct expansion, 29 per cent by brine spray and dry air (indirect), and about 19 per cent by combinations of direct, indirect and brine circulation. The average capacity of the plants is about 192 cars, the range In size being from 8 cars to 663 cars (Hampsdn, unpublished, 1931). Storage at point of production has one distinct advantage in that the grower or shipper is not committed to any particular market, but may ship to any market which at the time appears promising. Furthermore, by retaining a portion of- the crop in regions of produc - tion, the tax on transportation facilities at harvest time is materially reduced. It also keeps more of the tax within the state. Likewise, the technical fruit men of the region can more closely observe maturity changes and can with greater certainty move the fruit on to the market in advance of over-maturity or breakdown when stored locally than when stored in the east. In areas of large production, storage of at least half the crop seems to be advisable. It the grower or shipper, however, has a well established special market, it may be advisable for him to store his apples in or near that market so as to make his fruit available for quick delivery when market conditions are favorable. Factors Involved in Returns to Growers Apparently when the total apple yields of the United States are much above 180 to 200 millions of bushels any one year, as was the case in 1912, 1914, 1920, 1922, and 1926, the price per bushel to the farmer is likely to be unsatisfactory (Chart). Other conditions, such as i purchasing power of the consumer and of money Influence the price. So long as the total apple Crop any one year is not ex - cessively high, some of the factors in the success of the most profitable farms are as follows: (1) moderate Investments; (2) high yields per acre; (3) popular varieties that bring the highest prices; (4) the production of high quality fruits so that the largest percentage can be packed In the best grades; and (5) the doing of as large amount of the work and supervision connected with the orchard management and production by the grower and his family as Is feasible. Production costs are divided into fixed and variable costs de - pending on whether the cost is affected by changing yields. Accord- </seg>
            <seg id="p583">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ing -to Johnson (1930) in his studies, the fixed costs made up about 43 per cent and the variable costs 57 per cent of the average cost of production in the Wenatchee district. Taking up some of the factors of success previously listed so long as the soil, site and facili - ties are good, the more moderate the investment per acre, the less the fixed overhead. The relation of yield per acre to profitable returns can. be emphasized as follows: (1) As yield increases, total cost per acre also increases, but under normal conditions and within normal limits, the cost of producing each box grows less. (2) Fixed costs are the charges that cause high per box costs when yields are too low to carry the burden. (3) Fixed costs grow less important with increasing yields. The significance of the value of variety popularity so long as yield is satisfactory is made clear by listing the average net prices to Washington growers from 1922 to 1927 inclusive, for packed apples by varieties for all grades and sizes, (Hampson and Dummeier, 1930), as follows : Delicious $ 1.800 Winter Banana . 1.323 Winesap 1.293 Yellow Newtown . , 1.192 Arkansas Black : 1.190 Ortley . :_._-_ 1.165 Esopus 1.090 Stayman . , 1.011 W. W. Pearmaln , 0.980 Rome Beauty 0.969 King David 0.966 Jonathan 0.943 According to Johnson (1930) the average cost under Washington conditions of producing, packing -and delivering a box of apples to the warehouse at the shipping point, including interest on investment was $1,113. This means that only the first bIx varieties representing approximately 60 per cent of the total shipment sold for more than the growers average cost of production. The variety also may enter into the quality of fruit produced in that during the six years from 1922 to 1927, the Delicious averaged 48.8 per cent Extra Fancy, Winesap 47.6 per cent, Jonathan 30.6 per cent and Rome Beauty only 30.1 per cent. The average prices for this period by grades were as follows: Extra Fancy $1,480, Fancy $1.136,. "C" grade $0,842, Combination Extra Fancy and Fancy $1,453, Orchard Run $0,824, Fourth grade $0,768, Hail Special $1,019, and other miscellaneous grades combined $1,082. The profitable grades are the Extra Fancy and the Fancy. </seg>

Discussion Question: How do they interpret the term, "Inspection Allowed"? It has been brought to my attention that there are two interpretations of the meaning. TBe buyer interprets it one way and the shipper an - other. In this district the shipper just allows the privilege of inspect- </seg>
            <seg id="p585">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ing the apples before the draft is paid but some of the buyers look at it as the privilege to use or refuse the car. Answer: I don't think they go quite that far in Washington. As a rule they use the car but the seller is willing to effect an adjust - ment. Question: I thought maybe they might have a rule. Answer: No, there is no standard rule that I know of. It Is a matter of working it out in each individual case as it has been brought to my attention. I feel that the sellers have found it a good thing to be fair. Question: I was interested a while ago in your fertilization. What do you do about your bees for fertilization? • Answer: The growers of the northwest have come to look upon . the bee as a necessity. The bee men feel that is a large part of their revenue to rent hives' to the orchards. It is a necessary part of their orchard management. Question: They don't keep the bees themselves? Answer: No. They simply rent them during the blooming period from the bee owner. Question: What do they pay? Answer: Fifty cents a hive. Question: Who owns the storage plants? Answer: About 40% of the cold storage space is owned by grow - ers or cooperatives and 50% by consignments and 10% by cold storage -plants. Many growers don't know where they stand as to how much of this money is put in their hands and how much in the hands of others. One of the salient features about cooperation is to have all of the cards on the table and be perfectly frank at all times. The cooperators try to do this. They try to get the growers together and discuss things with them. Question: Is the trucking business hampering the carload sellers? Answer:- I understand that 15% of the shipments are from truck. They have no means of knowing when truck loads are going into the market as they would with good organization. So the market can be affected by the trucks. Question: What grade of apples are shipped into Nebraska in baskets from Washington? Answer: I think that they come from Idaho or Colorado. Idaho puts different grades in the baskets, some of the . poor grades and some of the better grades. As far as I know, the State of Washing - ton has never shipped any apples In baskets. ' Questlton: When you were talking about the Delicious were you taking in the red and yellow together. </seg>
            <seg id="p586">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Answer: No. That does not include the golden. That has not been produced in sufficient quantities out there to give any figures. Question: In Missouri they were very good. Answer: Golden Delicious Is a superb apple and under some conditions does very well. In Washington it has not been produced as yet. Washington State likes to grow red apples. There is some demand in the Orient for yellow apples. The Chinese merchant has a superstition against red. To him red is associated with the Devil. This has been so ingrained In him that he has a prejudice against red varieties of apples. Question: Is the Delicious hard to keep free from worms? Answer: I hesitate to say "Yes" to that. Some growers will say so but the coddling moth is a problem with all varieties. We have to spray with all varieties. It is not possible to differentiate. Question: Dp you have the Illinois canker? Answer: No. we do not. They have the perennial canker In the Hood River Valley. MR. BAKER: Are there any more questions you would care to ask? I want to thank Professor Overholser for giving us those two fine talks. He gave us a very good talk this morning. The next subject on the program Is, "Is the Trucker a Blessing or a Detriment in Apple Marketing?" It seems as if this is to be a discussion by Mr. Porter, Mr. Kimmel and myself, and they have me on the program last, but I am the only one here so will take advantage of the oppor - tunity and beat the other fellows to it. However, we have Mr. Porter's talk and I will have Mr. Hoppert read that to you after I have given mine. </seg>
            <seg id="p587">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY is the: tkuckek a blessing ok a detriment in APPLE MARKETING? Mr. President, Members of the Horticultural Society, Friends: In discussing the subject "Is the trucker a blessing or a detri - ment in apple marketing" and keeping my remarks in the way of a discussion instead of a debate, I find it is nard to do. I know that some growers have a friendly feeling towards the itinerant truckers and feel that they are justified where their acreage is small and are located at such points that they do not have the outlets through the railroads and their production is such that they would not have . carloads In sufficient numbers to attract the big buyers. But I will later recommend a plan for such growers whereby most of their crop can go into carloads and they will not have to depend on disposing of their crop in this manner. The trucking problem is not local altogether but is of national importance also. It will be necessary for it to be controlled by rules and regulations passed by the National Congress before a very great amount of relief can be obtained by the grower, the commission man and local merchant. However, I feel that the producer or grower can help himself to a very great extent.' ' The main subject that will be discussed by the National League of Commission Merchants in its national convention January 12-15 at Miami will be, "Can effective regulations be worked out that will retain for the growers and shippers the advantage of truck transpor - tation and at the same time prevent the demoralization of local and terminal markets?" The question. is not easily answered and is one that must have careful consideration. I hope that you people will understand that I do not claim to have the solution to this problem, all that I can give is my ideas and the ideas of my associates and some facts that have been brought to my attention from other fruit growing sections. It must be of national Importance or national organizations would not be discussing it at their conventions. All we can do Is try and work out our own prob - lems and give our assistance to any national program. A few years ago when there was just a few truckers who were able to distribute our apples in parts of the state that could not use carloads we felt In our organization that it was proper to encourage this kind of outlet. At that time our production was small and our equipment was such that we could not put up the pack of apples that attracted the large carload buyers of the country. We were able to dispose of our fruit at a good price with very little expense, as to sorting and packing, so naturally we welcomed the truck driver who would back up to our door and take any kind or grade of apples </seg>
            <seg id="p588">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE j ' . . lliat we had to offer. Usually he was a merchant or a farmer who came after a load for his local community. Hut 'now the time has come when the truckmen have increased in such numbers that none oC them are able to handle a very large volume of business, and consequently you have a large number who are unreliable and the grower is taking a great risk when he permits this type of man to handle his fruit. For an example, four years ago we had one buyer who owned a large truck and handled 600 to TUO bushels of apples every week, but this year it was impossible for him to handle more than 100 bushels per week due to the increased number of truckers out in the territory. Surely there isn't a grower who is willing to go through another season depending on the same outlets that he had this year and not try to work out some plan whereby he may have more control of the marketing of his fruit. There has been more or less complaint among apple growers in our district over the operations of the wandering truck operators who have come into the apple section during the apple season, loaded their trucks in the orchard with cheap apples, scattering the fruit far and near, killing the demand for good fruit and making it im - possible to place straight cars in many smaller markets which in the past have been an important outlet for carlot shipments. Not only is there a discussion about killing such outlets but criticism is directed against these truck operators for demoralizing the market at the time of harvest. Had it not been for these buyers taking windfall fruit for prices that hardly paid for picking the apples off the ground, apple growers over the district feel that prices . for good fruit would have been much better than they were. Thousands upon thousands of bushels of low grade fruit that otherwise would not have been thrown on the market were picked up at starvation prices by these truck operators, displacing that much good fruit that it is believed would likely have brought profitable returns to the grower, and thus the truck operators are more or less responsible, according to the opinion of many of the apple growers over the district, and what is generally termed an unprofitable apple season to date. Some of the growers refused to sell to the trucker. Others sold at what prices they could get and the way the market was hammered down by the truck buyers is a matter of common gossip now that the deal is over. The buyer would go to one orchard owner and offer a price below that asked by the owner of the fruit. "I'll give you 30 cents (or whatever the offer might be) for I can buy from John Doe at that price. However, I'll load up here if you'll sell for my figure," he would say. Usually the truck would be loaded. It made no difference, of course, that the truck operator might or might not have been offered </seg>
            <seg id="p589">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY fruit at the lower figure he claimed. He got what he wanted at the price he wanted to pay. In years past there was not so much criticism of truck operators, perhaps because they did not buy so much fruit and did not have the effect of stifling the outlet to the extent they did this year. There must have been at least the equivalent of 100 carloads of fruit sold this season to truck operators, perhaps 20 to 25 per cent of the crop, and virtually all of it. was the poorest quality fruit produced. There are apple men here who will tell that this 20 or 25 per cent affected prices to such an extent that the entire crop brought far less to growers than would have been the case had this poor quality fruit been worked up into cider or another by-product and kept off the fresh fruit market. Some say that it would have been better had it been allowed to remain under the trees to decay rather than pick it up for the cheap truck peddler trade. Ab it was possibly 10 per cent of the fruit went to waste under the apple trees in the district, quality being such that it was not worth picking up for market purposes. There are some of the best apple growers in the country in the section between Omaha and St. Joseph. They know both the growing end of the business and the distributing end as well. They get carlot buyers in . here from all sections of the country every fall, sell in carlots and pack and grade the fruit in first-class shape. During the winter and spring they ship out what portton of the crop they place in storage, in the meantime watching markets conditions closely. The logical outlet for much of their fruit is Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and surrounding states, but if the smaller markets over the territory are glutted with poor fruit by wandering Truck drivers, it is going to force them to sell more at harvest time because they will not have the outlet needed for that part of the crop held by them for this particular trade. They do not want to lose this nearby market. They do not want to sell everything packed at time of harvest, yet some will nay that they will be forced to unless some system is developed whereby the irresponsible truck driver and his method of glutting markets with Inferior fruit can be controlled. In looking at the truck problem from the consumer's standpoint we find that merchants out over the state, that had been in the habit of handling a carload of apples every year up until two years ago, have been afraid and stated they would not handle a car on account of their home town territory being infested with truckers selling cheap grade apples for a high price and he could not use a car of good apples against such competition. We have on file several letters from people writing in and saying that they had purchased apples from certain trucks and that the truck driver had told them they were Shuberfs apples and that they </seg>
            <seg id="p590">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE were our No. 1 grade and the people later discovered the fruit to be of a very poor quality and was misrepresented by the truck driver. After an investigation we have found they were not our apples and in some cases they came from some other apple district, or from a grower who did not care about grade or pack. We spend hundreds of dollars each fall advertising the fine quality and pack of Nebraska grown apples and then turn around and let some Irresponsible truck driver, take out a load of cheap apples and tell the public it is our No. 1 grade. I might ask the question, "Who is it that 1 is tearing down the reputation and confidence In Nebraska grown fruit?" Surely it isn't the producer or the carload distributor. I do not want to leave the Impression that all truckers are of this type, as we have some very fine people in this kind of business, but I do mean the man who is in the business for just one season and doesn't care about any future years. I would recommend that the growers In the district who are affected the most by this condition call a meeting for the purpose of making plans for the future marketing of their crop. By working out co-operative marketing and packing units or associations. It Is not my idea that it is necessary that the fruit be packed in one building, but I do think it Is necessary that the selling in each district be handled by one organization and this Organization in the hands of men who have had experience and knowledge In the marketing and outlets for the fruit. There is no reason why the smaller grower cannot have the same advantage under this plan as the larger growers. Those growers who are not equipped to wash, size and pack their fruit can surely make arrangements to have one of the growers near him to do this at a very small cost per bushel. It seems to me that this is the only salvation: for the apple grower, big or small. And the sooner we realize the importance of tfiis kind of an organization the quicker we shall be able to show a profit for our efforts. It is also necessary that we co-operate with the National Organiza - tion of Jobbers, Commission Men and Local Merchants. We should meet with them, get their viewpoints as to how they would like to have the; fruit packed, sized and graded and where stored for their distribution. There is no question but that the average fruit grower of today; can raise a good quality crop, but he is not in a position to get it to the consumer without the help of the big distributor. In conclusion, I would suggest as one of the means of handling the trucking problem that the fruit growers organize In the district, also recommend to the National League of Commission Merchants that similar trucking ordinances, like the one passed and became effective January first in the city of St. Louis, be passed in all the large ter - minals and cities and towns that handle carload shipments. </seg>
            <seg id="p591">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The ordinance that was passed in St. Louis and became effective January 1, 1932, in brief, provides for a license. tax on truck peddlers of $200.00 per annum and also requires, with the issuance of the license, the filing of a bond of $500. 00 with the comptroller of the city, this bond being for the protection of purchasers in the event misrepresentation or deception has been practiced by the peddler. Any violator of the ordinance will be charged with a misdemeanor and will be subject to a fine of from $50.00 to $500.00 for each offense. Surely ordinances of this kind would eliminate the irresponsible trucker and put the business in proper hands. The grower would be safe in dealing with this kind of man and could demand better prices for his fruit. After considering the question from all angles and discussing It with growers from other sections it looks as though the trucker is a detriment to the grower in the marketing of his apples under present conditions. The sooner the fruit growers realize that they must work out these problems together and live up to their decisions the sooner we will turn losses into profits. Mr. Chairman, Guests, and Members of the Nebraska Horticultural Society: By GROVE PORTER, Nebraska City Distribution of apples by trucks has developed into an important factor in moving Nebraska's apple crop. The truck is here to stay. As long as we continue to build good roads, more and more apples are going to be sold direct to truckers. A few years ago, Mr. George Burt, in an address before this society, stated: "Nebraska apple men will soon have a market at their very door." This fall he visited our plant and said, "Well, It looks as though my prediction has come true. We, the George V. Burt Company, have been out of the apple business for the past thirty .days. It will be Impossible for us to sell apples in any quantity until these truckers are through." Generally speaking, selling apples direct to truckers is very un - satisfactory. Ninety per cent of them are unscrupulous, and will try your patience to the limit before a sale can be made. If they have the cash they drive a hard bargain. Taking checks Is risky business, and you are certain to lose in the long run. Truckers lie about the. price they pay for the apples they buy from your neighbors. Apples sold to truckers go into direct competition with the better grades of apples that must be sold. </seg>
            <seg id="p592">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Selling to truckers has eliminated about seventy-five per cent of the carlot buyers. In all fairness, though, it must be said that a great many of our present-day truckers were formerly carlot buyers, but have turned to the truck as a matter of self-protection. We, the Joy Morton Orchards Company, see many advantages in selling direct to truckers, although this past season has put some - what of a damper on our enthusiasm toward this method of selling apples. Direct sales to truckers practically eliminate selling and col - lecting costs. The buyer selects what he wants, and when he drives away the deal is closed, that is, providing you are smart enough to get cash or good checks. These truckers certainly distribute vast quantities of apples to consumers in all localities in a short period of time, for immediate consumption. Apples sold to truckers are rarely put into storage. In conclusion, the truck and truckers are here to stay. Orchard men must prepare to meet this new condition. We must organize and establish .standard packs and packages. Price schedules must be made for each grade, variety, and pack. Packages must be labeled exactly what they are so that truckers will be unable to sell any grade of apples and say that they are Nebraska's first grade. Orchard owners, and not the truckers, are to blame for what has happened this past year. Nebraska apple growers can handle this problem if they will get together — face the facts as they are — and keep control of the situation. MR. HOPPERT: That is the opening gun. I think the rest or you can enter into the discussion now. We would like to reach Borne conclusions at this meeting, or at least fire the opening gun to set something started. I am sure that we need something in the way of united effort to remedy the situation. MR. BANNING: I think I had considerable experience with these birds this summer. . I live up on the north end and get the first chance at them. The first thing I hear is, "I can buy them at Nebraska City 10c cheaper." Then they tell at Nebraska City that they can buy them cheaper at Shiibert. When they come to my place, I tell them to go on and buy them where they are cheaper. It is a foregone conclusion that the trucker is here and he is here to stay. The trucker is all right but he has to be 'controlled in some way. It is the growers that must take things in hand. I have had fellows say they can go to my neighbor's and buy for so much money. I tell them all right, that is a good place to go. to go on down. They tell you all kinds of prices. They come out of Omaha and say they can buy them cheaper there. I say, "Well, what are you coming down here for?" I think I moved my stuff and probably moved it at a higher price than the fellow down the line. After the fellow drove </seg>
            <seg id="p593">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY oft once, L never saw him again. When they came and said, "We "can buy them for so much down there," 1 never entertained them long. After we get together, about the first filing to do is to have a little publicity and educate the buyer to buy only in the package and basket as it comes from the packer. Educate him to buy that class of stuff and to not buy unless the trucker has proper credentials showing what he is holding. Even if men wanted to haul in bulk, growers could give them something showing that he had purchased a certain grade of apples from their orchard. You have got to do something with this fellow if he is going to be a blessing. I don't know whether he should ever be classed as that or not. I have advocated this for some time, but it is hard to get the growers to back the idea. There are lots of them who have two, three, four, flve and ten acres. Those fellows ought to be gotten into an association and gotten to cooperate in some way so that they will not everlastingly cut prices to peddlers. The larger growers put up the fund for advertising and the fellow with the two or three acre patch gets the benefit. We have just scratched the surface on this advertising. Many do not know or do not realize that we are growing apples down in southeastern Nebraska. We must not just say that we have apples but we must educate the public to buy a certain grade. We cannot all put up different apples and call them Number .1. We have to have a uniform grade and control the truckers. MR. BAKER: I am sure that Mr. Banning hit on the right Idea but the little fellow who does not spend any money can get the buyer. MR. WIGGANS: The thing that has struck me is that the trucker takes only our low grade stuff. Why cannot we help ourselves by insisting that the trucker take good stuff too? Sell mixed lots. Refuse to sell unless he takes it that way. That will establish in the state the fact that apples -do come in different, grades. That will force the fellows to sell apples at different prices, or if they set a general price it will have to be high enough so that all will be in better shape. I wonder if that situation would not be a salient factor at least. MR. BAKER: I think it would help a lot. Not only will this district have to organize but we must get the cooperation of the Kansas growers. We have noticed down our way that these fellows, if they find out that they can drive on down to Troy and buy apples five or ten cents cheaper, will go. We must either work with the Kansas district or have some kind of a law that will give us enougt protection to offset that. MR. LORD: I had apples piled in sheds and under trees this year. That condition has not existed before and may ntft again but we had conditions in the east end of the state that we have never had before. We had sixty days of drouth. About a week before we </seg>
            <seg id="p594">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE began to pick, the wind blew day and night. We could- hear apples falling In the orchard. The apple shed was full and I could not flnd George Hurt. I think the condition will largely clear itself up next season. We had an off season. I do feel that we are fortunate in one thing. We have our trees left. Had we not had that drouth and had the apples developed, there would have been two-thirds of the trees broken down. The wholesaler and jobber absolutely refused to buy apples at any price. George Burt and Harry Grainger would not buy them at any price. I had to sell. I could not pack them. 1 had to sell at any price. We did away with packing and washing and sold as the pickers picked them from the orchard. I don't 'chink we will have that to contend with so much any more but we must have organization to market this stuff. It seems to me we are going to have to renew the confidence of the jobber and carload distributor in the state by organizing and letting them know that we are hot in sympathy with the truck driver. ANOTHER GROWER: The apple jobber has not been worth any - thing to me. I thought I would force him to buy my stuff by Felling to merchants. This year I could not do that. I have not had tiny experience trying to sell to wholesalers. One does not have much chance with Lincoln wholesalers. They have an airtight organization. They do not want fruit dealers to sell Nebraska stuff. They do not want fruit dealers to sell anything unless they get a profit out of :t as it goes through. I think we were chumps the way we handled ttie stuff this year. We should have washed It and packed it and put it in storage. We should have kept our good fruit off the market and dumped the rest. If we had kept it off the market we would not have had the market paralyzed like it was. There was no co - operation or help. I want to call attention to another thing we need. The government comes out and gets a few samples and says they have too much arsenic on them. What do they do with the live or ten acre man. He can cover it up with arsenic and gets away with it. The big fellows cannot do it. They have to have state Inspec - tion on all their stuff. Let's make the other fellows get in the band wagon with the rest of us. Because we are producing on a larger scale Is no reason why we have to wash It. I have a neighbor with a truck who hauls apples. He went to Peru, Shubert, St. Joe and Wathena and loaded up and took the apples to the northwest. He sold as far as Alliance. He has been at it all fall and gets most of his stuff at Wathena. On the other hand I have known truckers to go to Stivers and take his culls and buy them for 25c a bushel and sell them in the west for number ones. They do not want any more Nebraska' apples. I had two carloads contracted for in Howard County. When I was ready to deliver them I could not sell them because they could get them for less elsewhere. </seg>
            <seg id="p595">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ANOTHER GROWER: It is going to be impossible for any one grower. to fight this battle alone. We thought this year we would not advertise for any truck trade or encourage any truck trade and we did not treat the truckman very cordially when he came. We told him we were trying to stick to the carload buyer. We priced our stuff at what we thought was a little higher than we did in the car - load. He would go down the line and buy his apples just the same, but the thing I think we should think about is to try to get the old rule in effect again whereby we can sell out of the carload. I think that rule that went into effect on the railroad prohibiting the sale has encouraged the truck. I know men that used to go out with several carloads every fall and sell right out of the car. This year, before he could do that, it was necessary to stip the car to one point and then hire trucks to get the apples out of the car. If the railroads want to fight this truck proposition, we should ask them to reinstate the law. MR. LORD: I sold some in Tecumseh three years ago in car - load lots. People came for ten and twenty miles and I sold to some of the merchants. I sold them at two dollars a basket. I sold 700 bushels in a day and a half. I repeated that with my winter apples. I took 300 bushels this fall. I went along and had some salesmen. We put in a line call. We had three grades. They ran from 75c to $1.25. We sold 35 baskets, nearly all at 75c. Of course, that was partially due to the financial condition of the country. MR. BAKER: The wholesaler will not buy a carload because he is afraid people will come in with a truck of apples. J. P. SHUBERT: I think it has resolved itself into this, that we must have cooperation in an organization in order to control the sale of these apples. I was the original objector to the trucks. Three or four years ago when there were just a few trucks, every time I had a chance I voiced my objections to them. I think they have been a nuisance. I have been in business for a long time. Until the last two or three years I have not missed selling twenty-five to thirty-five cars of apples throughout the State of Nebraska. Last year we sold very few. This year we hardly sold any. This state was flooded with apples of poor grade from one end to the other. We received one of the worst letters from a lady out in the state. It was a masterpiece. She said one of our truckmen had been to her town just a little way west of Lincoln and had sold her some apples representing the apples to be a certain grade. She found nothing but culls and rot. She called me more names than I ever, supposed a woman could think of. She demanded a check for so much money or she would have us arrested for misrepresentation. Of course the truth of the matter was that we knew nothing about the man who sold the apples. At first I felt like I would write her a letter and burn her up. Then </seg>
            <seg id="p596">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE after thinking it over I wrote her a courteous letter telling her that we did not run a truck and did not send out that kind of stuff. It brings out this point. We are sending too much of our low grade stuff out. j We should depend on Senator Banning to get something through the legislature that at least apples sent out in the state should be branded a certain brand and sold that way and there should be a penalty for misrepresentation. If we get together and resolve to work together on the proposition and act in a cooperative way we can overcome the handicap. MR. BANNING: I think there must be an organized gang In this state because I got one of those letters. She wanted ten dollars, but I was short and did not send it. MR. BAKER: There is another angle to look it, that of the freight rates. We should go into this as an organization. I flnd that the apple grower or shipper from Troy or Wathena or Blair can ship a carload of apples to Winner, South Dakota for 4SV5c per hundred, j It is 81c per hundred from Shubert or Nebraska City or Brownville. The Kansas growers have been able to put over a tariff on bulk apples to any point in the state at 15c per hundred pounds and it costs us in the South Platte Valley territory from 17c to 22c per hundred pounds to ship apples. They have been shipping these apples along the northern boundary of Kansas and trucking them over into j southern Nebraska. We cannot beat that competition. I fought the Burlington so much this fall on freight rates that they had every official out of Omaha and Lincoln down there three or four times. The way I happened to discover that we are being handicapped on freight rates was because we had an agent in our territory that thought Shubert was included in the line. He made out a freight list and he gave that tariff. I sold two carloads, one to Aberdeen and one to Winner, South Dakota, on that rate. They had to pay 81c. I had guaranteed it on a 49c basis. I put in a claim but it was of no avail. 1 1 had to stand the loss. Another thing, we asked the agent on routing of a car to a certain point; he gave us that routing and probably it would be different than what the buyer would request and we would find that there was a difference in the rate. The way the railroad would have us send it would cost from three to lour cents a hundred more. We should "go into that. If it is necessary to have aj committee from this organization to go before the railroad officials or the State Railway Commission and see that we are not handicapped in regard to this rate, I think we should do it. It not only benefits us but it benefits all the rest of you. This year we shipped about one hundred and fifty carloads of apples and when you get into that many carloads over a five or six week period you soon learn where you are paying more money for rates than you should. I would like to see a committee appointed from the members of this association. </seg>
            <seg id="p597">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY MR. HOPPERT: I think we should have two committees, one to look into the rate matters and one to look into legislative matters. GEORGE MARSHALL: From our fruit growers association ten years ago, Earnest Pollard and myself met the presidents of all the railroads in the state in Omaha. All of the presidents were there except that of the Union Pacific and they sent an attorney. That attorney let us know that they were running the railroad to suit themselves. We asked for a certain rate and we had the rates reduced at that time a lot. Since then our State Railway Commission takes that up. You would have to go before the Railway Commission. That would be the thing to do. MR. BAKER: The Railway Commission has been advised, be - cause I did it personally, that there will be a committee from this organization to go into this matter. They have expressed a willing - ness, to work out a new plan. The Burlington officials have given us wonderful cooperation this fall. They did all that was in their power to take care of us. All we have to do is to follow this up and tell them what we want. MR. MARSHALL: It was through the Burlington that we got what we wanted at that time so I think it will work out all right if you just take it up with them. :.It seems to me that in view of the cooperation of the Burlington officials that we owe that courtesy to the officials of the Burlington to have our committee go to them. It seems to me that it is quite likely that they would ask the Railway Commis - sion for some such ordinance. It would at least give them a chance to ask the Railway Commission. MR. SHUBERT: I make a motion that the Chairman of our meeting and Professor Hoppert jointly appoint a committee to confer with Burlington officials and ask them to ask the Railway Commis - sion for our rate. Question: How large a committee? Answer: Make it three. : I want to make a motion that the Chairman and the Secretary be two of that committee. MR. BAKER: You have heard the motion that the Chairman and Secretary appoint a committee and be members of that committee to meet with the Burlington officials in working out some plan In regard to the freight rates. Motion seconded and carried. : Mr. Chairman, we have a representative of the Burlington Railroad and while I know our time is limited, I would like to hear what he has to say with reference to the proposition. </seg>
            <seg id="p598">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. VA KUSKA: I do not know anything about the traffic but. I do believe if your committee will go to the railroad officials they will at least tell you the course to follow. You may not have to go through the Railway Commission. If it is an authorized rate they may merely ask that it be included In that rate. If you come to our people they will tell you what to do. They are really Interested In the problems. I am confident that they will cooperate with. you and do anything they can to help out in the matter . I am not saying they can do it or cannot but they will work with you and will appre - ciate what you folks have done for them and will try to help you out. MR. HOPPERT: I think we should have a legislative committee to talk over things which would help out on the trucTc proposition, such things as grading, etc., and legislation which would call for penalty if those things were not adhered to. There might be various things of that sort that could be included In legislation. MR. HOPPERT: I move that a committee of five be appointed from among the growers to meet and make recommendations con - cerning regulations by law with regard to the selling from the truck by the peddler. One thing to take Into consideration Is that if we appoint a committee it will be another year before legislature meets. MR. BAKER: It might be well to add to this motion that this committee report back at the next meeting of this society regarding their recommendations. MR. HOPPERT: It might be desirable to talk it over with the truckers. We have to live with the trucks. They might be interested in having the kind of legislation that would permit them to do busi - ness and drive out the fellows we do not want. MR. BAKER: We will let the Secretary of the society work Up that motion. 'Motion seconded and carried. DR. LUTZEN: I never thought I would be called upon to address a body of men in the horticultural field, that being out of my line largely, although we have a small orchard and have had some exper - ience with trucks. I did not hear what you had to say but when I received the bulletin of your program, naturally I wondered about what would be your attitude on the truck problem. Not being well versed in these lines, probably my opinions are somewhat at random from the opinions of others. One man made the remark that we have to live with these trucks. That Is true. By observation, the truckmen as they came into our place, gave the impression of being peddlers and shoppers. They would stop and look at part of the goods, get the price and pass on. I made the remark that there </seg>
            <seg id="p599">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY were probably forty trucks visited our place before we sold a bushel. We tried to adhere to a schedule of prices established by the organiza - tion In that section of the country. The trucker may not be entirely at fault.- Of course, the whole activity this year was- rather unusual. Men would come from remote parts of the state. They would say, "We can get better prices from so and so." Now It seems to me that the thing that should be done is that there be a committee or a group of men passing through at the time of selecting or establishing your article to sell and tell you what you should ask for that article and if people do not abide by that, there should be some sort of a penalty. There should be a uniform price and everyone should stay by it. Some had to sell about fifteen cents above what the basket cost. We should establish a price so that when they come to one farm, the price will be the same as the price at another farm. Let there be a uniformity of grading and prices among all the growers. There is one more thing I would like to bring to your attention. That Is bad checks. I don't know how to get around that. That was another phase that we met up against. So many of the truckers are unreliable. I don't know how we are going to handle It but there should be co - operative action. : Mention was made some time this afternoon about the possibility of getting some of that Federal Farm Board money. The Federal Farm Board is spending some of that money for organiza - tions of this kind. It is my opinion that in organizing cooperative organizations it is possible to get some of that money. MR. HOPPERT: I might mention that it was my intention when this program was originally proposed that we have Mr. Reese of the Federal Farm Board to talk about this particular matter and I had his promise at first that he would be with us but evidently they had a little affair of their own over in Washington that prevented his coming. I think we can get him at some time to discuss that par - ticular phase. I am sure that he can give us a lot of help in the organization and financing. He said that he was particularly Inter - ested in the financing of cooperative packing and selling organizations. We will try to get him here before next harvest comes on. MR. BANNING: I got one check for a truckload which was an insufficient fund check. I left the check at his bank and he did not take care of it and then I sent it to the County Attorney and still he did not take care of it so I had a warrant issued and had him arrested. He paid the check and all the costs. It 1b always well to take the number of the truck and know just where to get hold of him. GROWER: The growers should give the truckmen to understand that they have to have a certified check from the bank. All should stand for the same condition. </seg>
            <seg id="p600">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. OVERHOLSER: We do not have quite the trouble you folks had here last fall. There is a good deal of trucking to coastal cities. But these truckers have been more honest and are in business appar - ently to stay and we have heard no complaint. GROWER: I think the trouble was this year that a lot of peopie who owned trucks had no other means of livelihood and got into the truck business. ANOTHER GROWER: Maybe we should make them bring cash. MR. TURNER: In Missouri we make them bring cash. We had less trouble this year than any year. They are more particular about getting good grades of apples. Question: Do you have an organization in Missouri? Answer: No. Question: How do they know they are getting them as cheap as they would from the next fellow? Answer: Most of them have been hauling for four or five years. They know where they can get them cheapest. MR. OVERHOLSER: I would like to add another comment. Most of these apples hauled by truck were disposed of through cooperatives. There was no mixing of grades. The state inspectors were posted on the highway and stopped the trucks and inspected them. The whole situation was somewhat different. This is self-supporting. The fruit grower stands the charge. Question: Have you such a law? Answer: Yes. Question: That is one thing we should look Into. Answer: There is a standard set price that is fixed by the state director of agriculture. It means that the various costs are self - supporting. It is customary and the producers like it. A GROWER: Compulsory inspection is a good thing if you can get the growers behind' it. The small grower would not like it but that would be the desirable thing. </seg>
            <seg id="p601">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY THURSDAY MORNING SESSION JANUARY 7 — 9:30 P. M. Room 106, Plant Industry Building MR. HOPPERT: The first speaker on the program this morning is Professor Swenk and he will tell us of "Codling Moth Investiga - tions for 1931." CODLING MOTH INVESTIGATIONS FOR 1931 MYRON H. SWENK Entomologist, Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station* In this paper are given the results of the fourth year of study of the life-history of the codling moth in Nebraska. The results of the previous three years of study may be found in the reports of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society for 1929 (pp. 31-49), 1930 (pp. 27-46)' and "1931 (pp. 109-128). As in previous years, there is a summary of the principal meteorological conditions obtaining during the preceding fall and winter (of 1930) and on through the spring and summer of 1931, that may have influenced the life-cycle of the codling moth in 1931, and also a detailed report on the recorded life-history of the insect for 1931. Summary of 1931 Meteorological Conditions As Kelated to the Codling Moth For the eight months, September, 1930, to April, 1931, inclusive, the total precipitation was 9.81 inches, which is 1.56 inches below normal, and distinctly less than during the "wet" winters of 1928-29 and 1929-30, when the total precipitation was 13.80 and 11.93 Inches, respectively, during the eight months mentioned, but also distinctly greater than during the "dry" and unfavorable winter of 1927-28, when the total p'recipitation was only 6.39 inches. These conditions would not ordinarily have made for as heavy a survival of the codling moth larvae in 1930-31 as in 1929-30 or 1928-29, but were offset by the fact that the rainfall in the crucial month of November, 1930, was heavy, '3.40 inches as compared with a normal of 1.07 inches for that month (2.87 inches in 1928, 1.04 in 1929 and only .04 in 1927), thus sending the hibernating larvae into the winter in a con - dition favoring a heavy survival. 'Acknowledgement is made -of the services of Messrs. Edson H. Fichter, Jr., and B. Thomas Snipes, majoring students in the Department of Entomology, who carried out the actual manipulations and recording of the life-history studies for 1931 here reported upon.

            <seg id="p603">■ NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY In the months of March and April, 1931, the rainfall was 3.13 inches (normal 3.80 inches), as compared to 3.30 inches in 1930, 3.01 in 1929 and only 1.64 in 1928. For the first five months of 1931 the precipitation was 10.82 inches, higher than in any of the preceding three seasons, largely due to the heavy May rainfall of 6.41 inches. In the mean per cent of relative humidity for these five months we find an average of 53%, distinctly less than the normal (58&lt;7r) and less than in 1930 (56.7%) or 1929 (57.2%), but much greater than in the unfavorable season of 1928 (45%). In 1931, however, the rainfall during March was copious — 1.37 inches — as com - pared to a normal of 1.27 inches and only .58 inch in 1930, .46 in 1928 and .08 inch in 1929, while the mean per cent of relative humidity was high — 58% — as compared to a normal of 52% and only 53% in 1929, 43% in 1930 and 427 O in 1928. To this copious rainfall and high humidity of March, 1931, and the accompanying nearly normal mean temperature — 36.4 against a normal of 37.5 — preceded by mucK supernormal mean temperatures during January and Feb - ruary, 1931 (January, 1931, with a mean temperature of 34, tied that month of 1923 for place as the warmest January recorded at Lincoln in fifty years of record), we must attribute the extremely early pupation and emergence of the spring brood of moths, just as the ample moisture and high temperatures of April, 1930, accom - plished these results in 1930. The first wintering larva pupated on April 14 in 1931, as com - pared to April 15 in 1930, April 26 in 1929 and May 8 in 1928. Though pupation thus began even slightly earlier than in 1930, pupal developmental conditions during May, 1931, were less favorable than in 1930, the mean temperature and mean relative humidity being distinctly less. Consequently the first moth of the spring brood did not emerge in 1931 until May 22, distinctly later than in 1930 (May 8) or 1929 (May 19) and only a day earlier than in 1928. Egg-laying began promptly, however, and the first eggs of the first brood were found on May 26, only a week later than In 1930 and much earlier than in 1929 or 1928. Moreover, the earlier eggs laid in 1931 were fertile, and the first larvae of the first brood hatched on June 2, actually ten days earlier than in 1930 and still earlier than in 1929 or 1928. The last first-brood eggs hatched on July 3, about as in 1930 (July 1) and 1928 (July 2), but earlier than in 1929 (July 12). Although the first larvae of the first brood hatched on the very early date of June 2, the larvae did not hatch rapidly and it was not until June 20 that hatching Was at its height. This was a very slow early hatch, probably due to extensive overheating of the eggs by the high June temperatures, for the mean temperature for June, 1931, was 78.4, which was higher than for any previous June in fifty years except in 1911, when it was 79. The delay from first hatching to crest of hatching in 1931, as compared to the three previous sea - sons, may be shown by the following figures: </seg>
            <seg id="p604">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1928 — first hatching June 28, crest 4 days later, on July 1; 1929 — first hatching June 21, crest 11 days later, on July 1; 1930 — first hatching June 12, crest 9 days later, on June 20; 1931 — first hatching June 2, crest 18 days later, on June 20. This slow hatching may have been responsible for too early applica - tion of the first cover spray in 1931, in some cases. The first pupa of the first brood was found on June 26 — one day earlier than in 1930 and seven days earlier than in 1929 or 1928, but the pupal period of the first brood was exceedingly short, closing on July 28 as compared to August 24 in 1930, September 3 in 1929 and September 7 in 1928. This short pupal period was due tp the high June and July temperatures. The July mean temperature was 79.4, well above the normal of 76.5 (and exceeded only in seven years — 1883, 1890, 1901, 1913, 1916, 1919 and 1930). First brood moths were flying by July 4 (aB compared to July 7 in 1930 and July 13 In 1929 and 1928), and their flight ended on August 21 (as compared to September 14 in 1930, September 23 in 1929 and September 25 in 1928). This short and Intense season for the first brood of the cod - ling moth was an outstanding feature of the season of 1931. The first second-brood eggs appeared on July 12, one day later than in 1930 and four and nine days earlier than in 1929 and 1928, respectively: The somewhat lower July temperatures as compared to 1930 (79.4 against 82.8), produced a better hatch of second-brood eggs, and a consequently greater abundance of second-brood larvae, than In 1930. The first larva of the second brood hatched on July 16 in 1931, as compared to July 20 in 1930, July 22 in 1929 and July 27 in 19281 The larvae of this brood hatched more regularly than those of the first brood, reaching the crest of hatching on July 27. Com - parison; to previous seasons may be shown by the following figures: 1928 — first hatching July 27, crest 12 "days later, on August 8; 1929 — first hatching July 22, crest 3 days later, on July 24; }930 — first hatching July 20, crest 11 days later, on July 30; 1931 — first hatching July 16, crest 12 days later, on July 27. Evidently, in a season where July rainfall and humidity are not ex - ceedingly low (as in 1928), second cover sprays are to be applied during the last week in July. Second brood pupation began on August 5, as compared to August; 12 in ..19 30, and August 15 in 1929, and. the pupal period (not the pupation period) ended on September 4, as compared to September 5 in 1930 and September 24 in 1929. The mean tem - perature for August was about normal, but for September the mean temperature was 74.6, exceeded in fifty years only in 1897 and nearly eight degrees above normal. These high temperatures reduced the percentage of second brood larvae entering dormancy and increased the number pupating, thus producing an earlier and much stronger </seg>
            <seg id="p605">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY flight of second brood moths than obtained in any of the preceding three seasons. Second-brood moths were flying from August 14 to September 13, as compared to August 24 to September 22 in 1930, August 25 to October 16 in 1929 and September 9 to October 10 in 1928. Eggs of the third brood were laid in considerable numbers from August 22 to September 10, which dates compare with September 2 to 20 in 1930 and September 1 to October 1 In 1929. The first of these third brood eggs hatched on August 30 and the crest of the larvae resulting from these third brood eggs was reached on September 7. In 1931, for the first time in the past four seasons, the third brood of larvae would no doubt have been strong enough to justify a cover spray early in September, were the problem of spray residues not to have been considered. The Record for 1031 As usual, in 1931 wintering larvae were collected from under bands in the Agricultural College orchard at Lincoln early in April. A total of 278 larvae were collected, but 31 of these failed to pupate, and of the 247 that pupated 29 failed to produce moths, so are not included in this record. The larvae were, as usual, placed in cocoon - ing racks and kept in glass jars in the out-of-doors insectary in the Agricultural College orchard, under temperature conditions as nearly similar as possible to those in the adjoining orchard. They were examined daily for pupation. The first pupation occurred on April 14, when three of the larvae pupated, this being one day earlier than in 1930, twelve days earlier than in 1929 and twenty-four days earlier than in 1928. Other pupations followed daily for the next few days, and on each day thereafter, except on April 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26 and 27, May 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 28 and 31 and June 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, until June 16. One larva pupated on June 23, the final pupation. The crest of pupation occurred on May 25, which was 20 days later than in 1930 (May 5) but only one and two days later, respectively, than in 1928 (May 24) and 1929 (May 23). On this crest date of 1931, 151, or 69.3 per cent of the whole, had pupated, as compared with 54.8 per cent on the crest date in 1930, 50.1 per cent in 1929 and 89.4 per cent in 1928. The pupation period in the insectary covered 70 days, as compared with 57 days In 1930, 39 days in 1929 and 28 days in 1928. The last pupa gave up its moth on June 30, making a pupal period of 77 days, as compared with 70. days in 1930, 62 days in 1929 and 45 days In 1928.

The close of the season on June 30 corresponds fairly well with the close on June 22, 1828, June 24, 1930, and June 27, 1929. The height of the emergence occurred on June 7, when 24 moths emerged. By June 16, 193 moths, or 88.5 per cent of the whole, had emerged, which compares with corresponding dates of June 12, 1930, June 14, 1928 and June 17, 1929.

            <seg id="p610">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Of the 218 moths of the spring brood that emerged in the insec - tary, 15 were lost during subsequent manipulations, so that only 203 were carried through to the end of their lives. Ninety of these were male moths and 113 female moths. The length of life of the moths, considering both sexes together, varied from 3 to 22 days The average length of life of the male moths was 12.25 days of the female moths slightly less, 11.88 days, and of all moths 12.05 days. This is a shorter life tenure than for the average spring-brood moths of 1928 and 1930 (respectively, 15.41 and i5.38 days), but is longer than the average life tenure of the sprlng-hrood moths In 1929 (9 58 days). The, last moth of the spring brood died on July 11, the same date as the death of the last spring-brood moths in 1928, but four days later than the date of death of the last spring-brood moth in 1929* and 1930.

            <seg id="p612">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In Table 5 is shown In detail the observations of the ovlpositipn of 113 female codling moths of the spring brood which were confined with 90 male moths in 31 cages. The date of first oviposltion was May 26, which is 7 days later than the first ovipositlort in 1930, and 18 and 27 days earlier than in 1929 (June 13) and 1928 (June 22), respectively. The date of last oviposltion was June 27, which was earlier than in any of the preceding three seasons, July 1, 1930; July 2, 1928; July 9, 1929). A total of 2814 eggs were deposited. The average number of days before oviposition was only 2.9, the number varying from 1 to 7 days. This is a very short preoviposition period, comparing with 6.2 days in 1930, 6.9 days in 1929 and 9.5 days in 19Z8. The average number qf days of oviposltion was 7.9 (the minimum being 1 and the maximum 18 days), which is a longer period than in any of the three preceding years (6.6 days In 1930; 7.4 in 1928; 7.7 in 1929). The average number of days from date of emergence to last oviposition was 9.9 — a very short period again when compared with 11.7 days in 1930, 13.8 days in 1929 and 16 days in 1928, and of course due to the brevity of the preoviposition period. This extreme shortening of the preoviposition period was no doubt due to the excessively high June temperatures already re - ferred to. Of the 2814 eggs deposited between May 26 and June 27, 2359 were laid on leaves, and an effort was made to hatch them. A high per cent of the earlier eggs laid in 1931 were fertile, and the first larvae of the first brood hatched on June 2. This first hatching noted on June 2 was very early, comparing with June 12, 1930, June 21, 1929, and June 28, 1928. Of the 2359 eggs laid on leaves, 1766 hatched between June 2 and July 3. The total hatching per cent of the first-brood eggs was very high — 78. 86' per cent — as compared with the three preceding seasons — 54.79 per cent in 1930, 52.19 per cent in 1928 and 22.12 per cent in 1929. Egg-laying was at its height on June 16, which was 4 days later than the crest of egg-laying in 1930, and 5 and 9 days earlier, respectively, than the crests in 1928 (June 21) and 1929 (June 25). The incubation period of these 1766 eggs varied from 3 to 12 days, with an average of 6.24 days. This compares to an average incubation period of first-brood eggs in 1929 of 7.58 days, in 1928 of 8.53 days and in 1930 of 8.59 days. This very short average incubation period in 1931 was no doubt due to the very high June temperatures already repeatedly referred, to. Hatching was at its crest on June 20.

Thirty-one or these died as pupae, leaving 138 first-brood larvae to pupate and transform to moths. The first pupation among these first-brood larvae occurred on June 26, when 7 pupated. This is just one day earlier than the earliest first-brood pupation in 1930 (June 27), and 7 days earlier than the first pupation in 1928 or 1929 (July 3 In both years). The high point of pupation was July 13, on which day 20 larvae pupated. This crest of pupation compares to July 6, 1929, July 15, 1930, and July 17, 1928.

Both of these were from larvae reared In the lnsectary. On July 5 a moth emerged from a pupa formed by a first-brood larva collected under a band. This emergence of first-brood moths in 1931 was 3 days earlier than in 1930 (July 7) and 9 days earlier than in 1929 or 1928 (July 13). The height of emergence took place on July 21, which is comparable to July 15, 1930, July 18, 1929, and July 28, 1928. On July 30, 89.13 per cent of the first-brood moths had emerged, which about parallels 90.57 per cent on'July 30, 1930, 90.7 per cent on July 30, 1929 and 87 per cent on August 11, 1928. The residual emergence was exceedingly brief in 1931, the last emerg - ence taking place on August 7, earlier than in any of the preceding three years (August 11, 1929; August 24, 1930; and September 7, 1928). The flight period of the first brood in 1931 (July 4-August 21) thus not only began 3 to 9 days earlier than in previous seasons, but ended very much earlier, 24 days earlier than in 1930 (September </seg>

The length of life of these moths varied from two (one male and one female) moths that died the same day that they emerged to a male that lived for 21 days. The average length of life of the male moths was 10.34 days, of the female moths 10.51 days, and of all moths 10.43 days. As was also true with the spring-brood moths, the average life of the first-brood moths was longer than that obtaining in 1929 (7.89, 7.67 and 7.79, respectively) but shorter than that obtaining in 1928 (12.21, 11.69 and 12.02, respectively) or 1930 (13.71, 12.83 and 13.26), respec - tively).

The height of egg-laying was on July 22, when 354 eggs were laid. In previous seasons the height of laying of second-brood eggs was July 19, 1929, July 24, 1930 and August 2, 1928. A total of 2,392 eggs were deposited in 1931. The average number of days before oviposition was 3.50, the number varying from 1 to 8 days; this comparing to an average of 3.14 days in 1929, 4.15 days in 1930 and 5.92 days in 1928. The average number of days of oviposition was 7.45, the number varying from 1 to 13; this comparing with an average of 5.17 in 1928, 5.78 in 1929 and 11.22 in 1930. The average number of days from date of emergence to last oviposition was 10.45, the number varying from 3 to 15; this comparing with 7.21 in 1929, 10.2 in 1928 and 14^44 in 1930. These observations are shown in detail in Table Number 11. Of the 2,392 second-brood eggs deposited between July 12 and August 15, 1,913 were laid upon leaves and an effort was made to hatch them. Of this number 646 hatched. This represents a mortality of 66.20 per cent; much less than in 1930, when it amounted to 88.13 per cent (3,007 out of 3,412), but considerably greater than in 1929 (49.94 per cent) or 1928 (36.92 per cent). As in 1930, in 1931 the relative humidity was much below normal with temperatures above normal ' during the hatching period in July and August, and this accounts for the large mortality among second-brood eggs.

            <seg id="p625">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Discussion Question: Does the rainfall in our country down on the river vary quite a bit from the rainfall in Lincoln? Answer: Yes, I think it does,' but the same principles should hold. We would not want to assert that the conditions we ilnd in Lincoln are the same as yours, but when we work out principles of weather in relation to moths, they should work out the same there. Question: There is difference between Banning's orchard and Weaver's orchard. Do you recommend a different date or the same date? Answer: We try to use our best judgment. We use all the infor - mation -we have. We use Lincoln conditions as a basis. We try to find out weather conditions in different sections and place upon them the best interpretation we can. MR. HOPPERT: We have moth traps in several orchards at Shubert. We watch those and correlate our studies here in Lincoln with those traps. Shuberts have been very kind and cooperated. There is not much difference between Union and Shubert conditions. Usually we send out notices early enough bo there is about eight or ten days' time in which to put on a particular spray. Question: What effect would a wet fall have on next year's crop of moths? Answer: The character of the present fall, it seems to me, has been exceedingly favorable as I check up. We had a good deal of rainfall and humidity in November and much more in December and almost normal in October and in September it was more than normal. Conditions so far have been favorable conditions. Question: What do you think about the codling moth proportion as compared with previous years? Answer: I don't think it is outstandingly greater. We have laid it to better control. Generally speaking the state was quite free from worms this year. Good control was achieved. With moth traps as carried on at different places we are able to check up the localities directly and make allowance for any variations at these three points. Question: You and Mr. Hopper t appoint a committee to come down and show me one of those pesky moths. I never could find one in my orchard. Answer: I think it would not be very hard to demonstrate with a moth trap. Question: I mean flying around. I never saw any I could rec - ognize. Answer: That is not so uncommon an experience. You have to search pretty close sometimes. They hide away so well. </seg>
            <seg id="p626">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE'BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. HOPPERT: They fly quickly and usually at dusk. MR. SHUBERT: They are attracted by fermenting liquid. It you have anything like that in that section you ought to be able to catch one. Question: In the early day here, when the orchards were iirst set out, were there codling moths? Answer: The codling moth is not native to this country. It was imported to the United States in the latter part of the eighteenth century. I think it followed the apple-growing West pretty rapidly. It was found first around Brownville in the 1850's or the early 1860'b. Apple growing was not very old in the state at that time. i _____ MR. BAKER: I am sure that every fruit grower »n Eastern Nebraska appreciates the work that Professor Swenk and his depart - ment are giving us and I know that if we will follow the suggestions that they make on their cards, that we will not be very far off on the spray schedules. I see our President has returned. We are glad that he got over the flu as quickly as he did. There are two com - mittees to be appointed from yesterday's meeting. There is the com - mittee in regard to seeing the Railway Commission about the freight rates. On that committee, Mr. Hoppert and I went over the idea, and we appoint Mr. Hoppert as chairman of the committee, C. G. Marshall of Arlington, and myself. I think it was sugested that Mr. Hoppert and I be on the committee. The legislative committee that is to work out plans which we want to present to the next State Legislature, dealing with our prob - lems, will be W. B. Banning, C. A. Lord, J. P. Shubert, George Marshall and Grove Porter. They will meet at different times during the year; and work out these problems and submit them to the'organ - ization at the next annual' meeting. We postponed our business meeting from yesterday until this morning and we have a nice representation of the society at this time so will take up the business. The Secretary's report, he tells me, ts quite lengthy and we will not have time to have him give it. The first thing is the election of new officers. The first will be nominations for President. MR: SHUBERT: Mr. Chairman, I think Mr. Green Is Vice-Presl - dent. I think it is customary to nominate the first Vice-President and I move that rules be suspended and the Secretary be instructed to cast a unanimous ballot for Mr. Green for President. MR. BAKER: The motion has been seconded and carried. Mr: Joe Green of Fremont has been elected President. The next is the </seg>
            <seg id="p627">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Vice-President. I think it has been customary in the past that we have a florist and then a horticulturist. Are there any nominations for First Vice-Presldent? MR. HOPPERT: I move that the rules be suspended and the Secretary be instructed to cast a unanimous ballot for J. F. Shubert. Motion seconded and carried. .MR. BAKER: The next officer is Second Vice-President. MR. HOPPERT: We have had this past year, Mr. Oliver Steven - son but he has not been able to attend our meetings : Mr. Chairman, as Mr. Banning is not here, we will take advantage of him and I move that he be nominated for Second Vice-President and that the rules be suspended and that he be elected. Motion seconded and passed. MR. BAKER: The next for office is the Treasurer. MR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chairman, I believe our present Treasurer is Mr. Baker and I place his name in nomination to serve as Treasurer. I will not move that the rules be suspended. I am not tafraid of my man and I call for other nominations. : I nominate Mr. Marshall. MR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chairman, I move that nominations be closed with my name out and that the rules be suspended and the Secretary be instructed to cast a unanimous ballot for Mr. Baker. Motion seconded and carried. MR. BAKER: I might give the Treasurer's report. It is cus - tomary to call for reports before the election of officers. The only work that I have, had to do as Treasurer of this organization is to look after the funds that you have on hand. The vouchers are drawn through Mr. Jackson's office for any expenses that are incurred by this society. I only take care of the life membership dues and if we draw any money for national memberships, I take care of that. Last year we drew one voucher for twenty-five dollars to the National Horticultural Council. We have been members of that organization for two years. We had two life-memberships received for $10 which left in my hands a balance of $492.81. I might say at this time that we are always ready and willing to accept new members Into the society. This organization is allotted $1,500 in the state budget and last year (Mr. Hoppert just handed me the report) we spent 11,406.29 so we can see that we were Within the budget. </seg>

FRANKLIN: The next talk will be by Professor Gobs. i DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CONTROL OF APPLE DISEASES (PROG-EYE AND BLOTCH) R. W. GOSS Professor of Plant Pathology, College of Agriculture, University of Nebraska The subject for discussion was suggested by the Secretary of your society and is not intended as a report of investigations con - ducted here in Nebraska, but simply as a brief summary of the avail - able information regarding these diseases. You are all rather familiar with the scab disease. Including Its life history and control methods so I will not go into any detailed discussion of this disease. The disease Frog-eye, is one that has been Increasing in prevalence during the past few years. The disease known as blotch has never been very serious in this state owing to the fact that we are about at the northern limit for its occurrence. There is a certain amount of this disease occurring in Nebraska, however, and it is apparently increasing in prevalence. As many of you are probably unfamiliar with these two diseases, I will discuss each of them as regards their life history and control. The disease commonly known as Frog-eye on apples refers only to the leaf infection of a disease also known as Black-rot. This Is a fungus disease (Physalosoora cydonlae), and causes a leaf spot, a fruit-rot, and a canker. The leaf-rot seems to be the dominant form of the disease in this state, although some fruit-rot occurs in storage. The canker stage of the disease has not been reported as being severe in Nebraska, but as far as I know no detailed examination of orchards has been made for this canker and it is probable that cankers are present and are often the sources of infection for the leaf-spot. The disease occurs on the apple, pear, and quince and is also found as a saprophyte following winter injury or mechanical Injury not only to fruit trees but also to a large variety of other trees. In Nebraska the disease has been particularly severe on the Jonathan </seg>
            <seg id="p631">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY variety, causing extensive defoliation and also occurs commonly on the Delicious, Wlnesap, and Ben Davis. On the fruit the rot occurs chiefly In the form of one rather large rotted area, often occurring at the blossom-end or following insect injury. The rots are often characterized by concentric zones or different shades of brown or black, although this zonation is not always apparent. If the rot is well developed small black pimples will appear on the surface of the rotted area near the center. These are the fruiting bodies of the organism. In the final stages of rot the fruit becomes mumified and has a coal black, shiny appearance. The leaf-spot occurs as small circular spots varying up to one - fourth of an inch in diameter, usually with a very sharp outline and often with concentric circles of light and dark brown tissues that give the disease the name of "Frog-eye." The center of the spot Is brown or grayish and late In the season small black fruiting bodies will be found on the upper surface of these spots. In many sections of the country the leaf spot Is roported as occurring as soon as the leaves unfold from the bud, although In Nebraska our observation has been that the disease does not become severe on the foliage until the latter part of July, and August, and It. is probably because of this late appearance of the disease that it has not been more satisfactorily controlled by the early sprays applied for the control of scab. The cankers may occur on either small twigs or large limbs. In the former case often causing a die-back, whereas on the larger limbs the canker will often appear on the upper surface as a reddish brown discoloration later becoming slightly sunken and with a crevice appear - ing In the margin of the affected area. The increase in the size of the canker will often lead to concentric crevices giving the canker somewhat the same appearance as In the spots' on the leaf and In the fruit-rot. These cankers also contain the small black fruiting pustules which serve as a source of infection. The injury from black-rot can therefore be summarized as fol - lows: First, a reduction in the vigor of the tree due to a large amount of leaf spotting which may result In severe defoliation. Second, a rotting of the fruit just previous to maturity or in storage. Third, the action of cankers in girdling branches and causing die-back of affected twigs. . ■ Apple Blotch. This disease Is also caused by a fungus (Phylos - ticlta solltaria) and occurs as a leaf -spot, fruit-spot, and canker. On the fruit the disease does not cause a rot but rather a surface blemish in the form of an indefinite surface lesion which will, be either brown or black In color and vary from % inch up to 1 Inch in diameter and usually Irregularly lobed. These blotched areas are more con - spicuous, of course,' on light colored varieties. • </seg>
            <seg id="p632">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The leaf-spot is rather inconspicuous and does .not cause any great damage. It appears as very small yellowish or whitish spots scattered over the surface of the leaf with small black fruiting bodies present on the upper surface. It also occurs on the veins, and leaf - stems as elongated, sunken, tan-colored spots with the small black fruiting bodies present. These leaf-stem infections may cause some direct injury but they are also important as being the source of many cankers. The canker is the most common form of the disease occurring in Nebraska, and the canker is also the chief source of infection for the production of the leaf-spot and fruit-blotches the following year. The canker is considerably different from that caused by black-rot, fire-blight, or blister canker in that the mature canker is characterized by a tan colored slightly sunken area bordered by cracks and with a central flake which along with the presence of the small black fruiting bodies is the distinctive sign of the disease. Many times these small cankers coalesce, producing large scurfy areas on the bark. The organism lives over primarily in the margin of the cankers and In the spring these advancing margins will be slightly sunken, tan colored and contain the small black fruiting bodies. It is in this advancing margin of the cankers that the organism grows most vigorously! and where it produces an abundance of spores for new infections. The organism is capable of penetrating through the healthy surface of twigs during their first season of growth. Older wood is infected from the infected leaf stems and most twig cankers Will he centered around a leaf scar. Control Methods for Both Diseases. Inasmuch as the organism causing both diseases may live over in the cankers the cutting out of all infected parts of the tree is a prime consideration in controlling the development of these diseases. The leaf and fruit infections may also be controlled by proper application of sprays. I have been unable to find any recent information concerning spray tests for the control of black-rot. Many of the older papers report that the usual summer strength of commercial lime-surphur satisfactorily controls the disease. Other workers report that lime-sulphur is not an effective spray for this organism. Similar contradictory statements are found in the literature concerning the effectiveness of lime-sulphur for the control of Blotch. With both diseases, however, all workers have found Bor - deaux to be an effective fungicide. The most extensive work on Blotch has been conducted at the Indiana Station and they have found that a 2-4-50 or a 2-6-50 Bordeaux was as effective as a 4-6-60 and better than lime-sulphur. A 1-3-50 Bordeaux was not effective in years favor - able for this disease. Inasmuch as most of the Blotch infection occurs during a seven-weeks period after petal fall they recommend that the spray be applied two, four, and six weeks after petal fall. </seg>
            <seg id="p633">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY The Ohio Station on the other hand has reported that dry lime - sulphur 3-50 was as good as 1-4 0 commercial lime-sulphur and caused less injury. It was also the equal of a 3-9-50 Bordeaux for con - trolling both scab and Blotch. They also state that Blotch was con - trolled as well by a %-2»4-50 as by a 3-9-50 Bordeaux spray. They recommend after five years' spraying tests that a dry lime-sulphur plus hydrated lime as a 3-5-50 spray should be applied in the pink and followed by a 1% or 2-5-50 for the later sprays. We do not have any experimental evidence regarding the value of different sprays on either of these diseases in Nebraska. During the past few weeks, however, we have conducted some tests in the laboratory to determine the effectiveness of different strengths of Bordeaux mixture in killing the black-rot or Prog-eye fungus spores. The Bordeaux was made up with the following amounts of copper sulphate, 4, 3, 2, 1%, 1, %, and % pounds to 50 gallons. In these tests the Bordeaux solutions containing 2 or more pounds of copper sulphate completely prevented the germination of the spores in one test, while in another test only about 10 per cent of the spores germ - inated and these were inhibited in their further growth. Similar results were obtained with the 1% strength, while with the 1 pound it was found that about 15 to 20 per cent of the spores germinated but that they did not develop extensively following germination. With % and Vi pounds of copper sulphate no control was obtained, all the spores germinating and developing as rapidly as on the unsprayed checks. It would appear from these tests and from many other re - ported publications that I have not reviewed in detail, that a 2-4-50 Bordeaux would be effective in controlling Prog-eye and it has also been shown by other workers to be an effective control for Blotch. The 1 and 1% pound strengths may require further tests, particularly in the orchard, before we can definitely recommend them as being effective but it is quite probable that they would be sufficiently strong In most years, and of course with these weeker strengths there is much less danger of injury to the apple. There is no information available at the present time regarding the many new spray compounds that have appeared on the market, such as the emulsoid and colloidal forms of sulphur, and a number of other spray materials, such as zinc sulphate, that are being inves - tigated in connection with other diseases. It is possible that aome of these sprays which may not cause as much injury may also be effective against these diseases. It has been found that Bordeaux may be prepared rapidly by the use of the powdered form of copper sulphate commonly known as "snow" and chemically hydrated lime. These materials can be mixed directly into the tank and have been reported to have produced a spray which is as effective as the old type Bordeaux. Inasmuch </seg>
            <seg id="p634">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE as it is necessary for us in Nebraska to spray for the control of insect pests, it would seem advisable to include with the insecticide a Bordeaux spray in the later sprays to replace the lime-sulphur used in the early sprays and thus control these two diseases with very little added expense. Discussion Question: Will this Frog-eye attack all varieties? ' Answer: ' No. It varies with the variety. The Jonathan seems the most susceptible here in Nebraska. Most of the varieties will show it to some extent. It is quite serious on Black Twig, Winesaps and Delicious so far as making brown spots is concerned. We have omitted the fungicides in the past because fungus troubles have not been serious from the middle of June on and we are then primarily interested, in codling moth control. Other central states carry the fungicides right through the season. Question: Is there a question whether lime sulphur would con - trol Frog-eye? Answer: No. We know lime sulphur would control Frogf-eye but we have difficulty with russetting the fruit and burning the foliage in hot weather. Question: In the east they used some of the colloidal sulphurs and they claimed there was no burning at all. Answer: In some years there is burning even with the wetable sulphurs, i Question: In the summertime why not use Bordeaux. It will kill anything that sulphur will and is safe to use in hot weather. Question: Did you come to any conclusion about spray for cherries? j Answer: We took the records as usual the past year but there was not enough difference between the sprayed and unsprayed blocks to draw any definite conclusion. The season was dry and therefore unfavorable for the growth of leaf spot. These experiments and ob - servations will be continued another year. MR. FRANKLIN: Our next talk will be by W. W. Yocum. </seg>
            <seg id="p635">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY SPRAYING TESTS AT SHUBERT IN 1081 By W. W. TOCUM In 1931 our experimental spraying of apples took quite a dif - ferent trend from the course followed the few years previously. While continuing to test materials for codling moth control, more attention was given to fungicides this year. At Shubert and at Union various kinds and strengths of fungicides were tested . for scab control and an effort was made to reduce spray burn, by the use of various materials. No perfect insecticide for codling moth control has been found. We have long realized that lead arsenate fails to meet all the require - ments of a perfect Insecticide. Laboratory tests have shown that it gives only about 60 per cent control when used at the rate of 2 pounds per 100 gallons and that there is little gain in efficiency from using over 3 pounds to 100 gallons. Since it contains two substances poison - ous to man it has made washing of our fruit to remove residue a necessity. For these and other reasons a large number of men are kept busy testing new materials as possible substitutes for lead arsenate. Several of these materials are on the market and are being widely advertised. This experiment station along with others, have been testing some of the most promising of these materials during the last five years. We began with a test of the light summer spray oils back in 1927 and have continued to test them for the last five years. During the years 1929 and 1930 we gave most of our time to this test. Four different brands have been tested and they all seem to give about the same results. Oils have been tested along and in combina - tion with lead arsenate, and nicotine sulfate. They have been used in the early cover sprays and late cover sprays. We have found very little evidence to recommend the use of summer oils for codling moth control in this state. Oil alone has given very little control. When . used in combination with nicotine sulphate it gives control about equal to lead arsenate and when added to lead arsenate it makes the lead arsenate effective over a longer period of time by acting as a sticker. However, this combination builds up a high residue which is hard to remove. Summer oils are also more expensive than lead arsenate. When all these things are considered I think that summer oils are of little use in our codling moth spray schedule. The only places where they might be used to advantage are (1) in case of a very heavy infestation of worms, in combination with lead arsenate for second brood worms and (2) with nicotine surphate late in the season to keep down spray residue. I understand that In the northwest the use of summer oils is increasing for these two purposes. </seg>
            <seg id="p636">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Another material showing considerable promise as a substitute for lead arsenate in the arid sections of the Northwest is a fluorine compound. In fact there are two of the compound!) which are being tested, barium fluosilicate and sodium fluoaluminate. These are min - eral products available in large quantities so should become cheaper with increased demand. These fluorine compounds have been thor - oughly tested in Washington and have proved -equally effective with lead arsenate and has been given a place in control. The fluorine compounds are supposed to kiil by extracting calcium from the, insect's body, and there is very little calcium present in the codling inoth larva. Now in the Irrigated sections of the Northwest little or no fungicides containing lime are used. But in this section and elsewhere where lime surphur and bordeaux are used, more or less calcium from the lime is doubtless left on the trees for a time. When a fluorine spray is used following soon after these fungicides, doubtless its demands for calcium are satisfied from the residue of these sprays and the worms are left unharmed or but little affected. For thar reason in this section when lime sulphur or Bordeaux arc used the fluoride materials are not recommended except for the second and third brood worms when these fungicides are omitted: In 1931 one of the fluoride materials, sodium fluoaluminate, sold under the trade name "Kalo," was tested in the Shubert orchards. It was used only In the late brood sprays when no fungicides were used. In the young orchard where control of the worms was in general very good, the best control was in the plat where Kalo was used late. In the old Jonathan orchard the material was given a severe test by applying it to trees that had been dusted some years past, and control, was very poor. Because of these conflicting results no definite conclusions can be drawn at this time. The fluoride spray will be tested again in 1932/ In the test of fungicides no results were obtained for very little apple scab developed and no burning resulted from this season's spraying, even when lime surphur 2-50 was used. MR.; BAKER: I want to say that the growers in our neighbor - hood are very much interested in the experiments you have been mak - ing down there and I regret to hear you say it will be necessary vo discontinue the service. I think it should be' carried on if at an possible another year with this in mind, that we should work out a spray program whereby we could control the codling moth and end up with the least amount of residue at the end of the season. I was in hopes you would be able to show tests that had been made on the fruit and the amount of residue, left on the fruit. We all know we have to clean the fruit and we are interested in working out a spraying program 1 where we will have the least amount of residue. For the last three years in Mr. Shubert's orchard we have put on eight pounds </seg>
            <seg id="p637">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY of lead to three hundred gallons of water and put on two cover sprays Tor the first brood and one for the second brood. and no more, and 1 think we got just as good control of codling moths as in some of the other orchards with the same amount of lead and using two cover sprays per brood. If there is anything the growers could do or vhis organization could do that could induce the department to continue one more year 'along that line I think we should do it. I think last year it was brought out that we were to have a committee to suggest some kind of experiments. I don't know whether they ever functioned or not. MR. YOCUM: We have tried all of these things in the past five years. That has been one of our aims. Until this last year we were not equipped with washers and we were interested in helping growers keep down the residue. We have not been able to do those things. If you get control of the worms early in the season, I think you will not have to worry so much about later ones. Question: Would it have been possible to have eliminated one of the sprays? Answer: . That depends upon the orchard. If it is a young orchard, and the codling moth has not become firmly established, the late sprays ought to be omitted without serious results, but in old orchards there is danger of heavy infectation until early in September. Question: I had just as good control in my old orchard as in my young one. MR. SHUBERT: I want to ask why it is that you are discontinu - ing your experiments. MR. YOCUM: We are not discontinuing exactly. We feel that there are other pressing needs more urgent than tills one. We feel that we Ought to work on Frog-eye. MR. SHUBERT: That was not the answer I had hoped to get. My idea was that perhaps there were insufficient 'appropriations. MR. YOCUM: That is not the reason. MR. SHUBERT: Then I want to protest and I think I represent the growers in our section. This is an important matter. There was a time when I did not think these professors amounted to much. • I thought they were a joke. But after I commenced to attend these meetings, I found out that there was a joke all right but all I had to do was to look Into the glass to see it. I did not know the service they were able to perform. And so I make that statement. I ad - mitted a good many years ago that I was wrong. These men are necessary to us. They are educated along that line. We have the thing started and we have been getting the experiments made and have gotten a lot of valuable information from them and I want It to continue . I don't see any reason why it should not continue. I </seg>
            <seg id="p638">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE don't think they could do any more valuable work. I got the idea here this morning that sometimes we spray before it is necessary. We could save expenses if we could get a card showing when to spray. Maybe we could have saved money this year if we had not sprayed quite so much. We are going to shoot and we don't know what we are shooting at. At first we did not know one thing about the life history of the worms. We just sprayed by guess. Maybe I am overly scared about this matter. If there is anything about appropriations in the 'wind, I want to protest so the work can be carried on. We want this information from the department. MR. YOCUM: Perhaps I made that a little too strong. We plan to continue some of this investigation at Union along with our regular orchard program. MR. LORD: If you are going to quit sending us those cards and telling us when to spray there will be trouble. MR. YOCUM: Mr, Hoppert has charge of the spray service to the growers and I'm sure that he intends to continue this service as a part of his extension work.. MR. LORD: The last two years I have gotten along with two less sprays and my stuff has been clean. I followed the directions Mr. Hoppert sent out. You must not discontinue this service. MR. HOPPERT: The idea that Mr. Yocum has with regard to experimental work, is that the Union fruit farm is growing up to the place where experimental work can be done there. This orchard is a part of the University, a sort of horticultural substation set aside for the purpose of carrying on experiments. Furthermore it is closer to Lincoln and can be supervised more cheaply. As far as the spray service is concerned, there is nothing to worry about because we expect to continue that like we have always done it. I think what Mr. Yocum had in mind is that we have about come to the end of our rope in trying to control the codling moth with materials other than lead arsenate. There are some materials that have been- used in other sections but they either are not suited to Nebraska conditions or they are so expensive at present that we can not afford to use them. There are two different types of materials that we haven't tried thoroughly at present, namely, the fluorides and an organic com - pound that the Department of Agriculture at Washington says shows promise, namely, rotinone. Both of these materials could be Used In the late cover sprays and thus avoid the necessity of washing the fruit. But the costs are still very high and it is doubtful whether they are as effective as lead arsenate. At present there is a more urgent need to try out various sub - stitutes for lime sulphur in the control of fungous pests like scab and Frog-eye. We know that lime surphur is dangerous to use when the weather is hot or the atmosphere very humid. Bordeaux is dan- </seg>
            <seg id="p639">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY gerous in cool, wet weather. A number of new wettable sulphurs are on the market that might be used but we have no experimental facts to back us up. The. Horticultural Department, through Mr. Yocum, is planning some experiments along this line for the coming season. It was planned to carry this work on at Union but it the growers feel that a duplicate set of experiments should be carried on near Shubert and the Shuberts are willing to cooperate as they have done so splendidly on the codling moth investigations, I think perhaps It can be arranged. PRESIDENT FRANKLIN: I am sure I voice the sentiments of the growers around Shubert when I say that they appreciate the help given them in £he past and hope that the work will be continued In the future. The growers feel that you can get closer to their prob - lems and to their solution when the work is close at hand. Next on the program is an Illustrated talk by our Secretary on Fruit Growing in Colorado. FRUIT GROWING IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AND COLORADO By E. H. HOPPERT The Horticultural Society Board authorized the Secretary to make a trip into Colorado to study the fruit growing regions in that state and to bring back to our meetings a report and pictures concerning the Industry as developed there, but first I want to tell you a little about the growing of fruit in southern Illinois. The Extension Specialists in Horticulture from the central states met the latter part or June in southern Illinois to talk over their problems. The meetings started at Harrlsburg, Illinois, the so-called gateway to Little Egypt, as the southern part of this state is some - times culled. Whether it is called this in fun or in all seriousness I don't know. It doesn't impress one as being comparable to Egypt In topography nor in fertility. The agricultural portion of Egypt lies adjoining the Nile and I have imagined that it was a low rich soil of great depth and fertility. The Little Egypt of southern Illinois is rough, rolling and the soil generally poor until it was devoted to fruit trees and made to blossom and produce once more. In the early days the grain crops were grown here but soon the good soil was washed away leaving yellow clay hills that for a long time produced little of agricultural value. Then fruit growing was tried and the soil built up with legumes. Now this territory ships many hundreds of carloads of peaches and early apples to the middle western cities. The peach crop was unusually heavy in southern Illinois last year. The apple crop was likewise very good. The group visited many </seg>
            <seg id="p640">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of the good orchards around Anna, Illinois. The county agent or this county is Mr. Blerbaum who was formerly -Extension Horticulturist in Missouri. Fireblight is one of the serious problems in this section and blossom blight is one form of injury. In some seasons fireblight does considerable damage on Jonathans in our state but I have never seen outbreaks as serious as were a common occurrence in this territory. Yet the growers were not worried about it. In recent years some ef - fort has been made to control blossom blight by spraying the trees' when just starting to bloom . with 2-4-50 Bordeaux. Mr. Blerbaum took us to an orchard where this type of control was tried. We could see very little difference between th blocks that were sprayed and the check blocks that were not sprayed . There was plenty of blight on both blocks, so much so in fact that I know our growers would have been greatly worried. Soil improvement is one of the principal projects in this county. Sweet clover was being used extensively to add humus and nitrates to the soil. In some cases the young trees were set out and then the area between the trees seeded to sweet clover the same year. This type of treatment was being compared with clean culture. Some orchardlsts practice clean culture throughout the life of the trees, using some nitrate fertilizer or a complete fertilizer to keep the trees growing and producing. Peaches seem to do fairly well with this sys - tem but it was claimed that better results are secured where the le - gumes are used occasionally. We^ saw one pear orchard that has never been sprayed nor cul - tivated. This was a 40 acre Kieffer orchard. The owner said "Of course the pears became wormy but the Jew peddlers will buy them worms and all for 35 to 50 cents a bushel and peddle them out in the large cities. I have always received an annual net return of $2,000 $3,000 from this orchard and what's the use of going to the trouble of spraying and thinning when you can do this well with so little trouble?" ; Another interesting place we visited was the packing house of the American Fruit Growers, Incorporated, at Anna. This company owns about 750 acres of bearing peach trees adjoining Anna. The packing house in which the fruit from these orchards is prepared for market was an interesting place to see. Naturally to handle such a large acreage of a perishable crop like peaches, it would have to be arranged to speed up the packing operations and to avoid un - necessary labor. There were two large grading machines arranged side by side. The peaches were first brushed, then sized, then graded, and then packed In bushel baskets. The packed baskets were carried ; along on a chain carrier, turned over and the lids put on. Then on I their way out to the loading platform they were stamped. The same carrier that takes the full baskets to the car is used to bring back </seg>
            <seg id="p641">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY empty baskets. During the busy picking season three carloads or peaches are packed and loaded every hour. One hundred and sixty persons are employed in and about the packing house but the cost per bushel for packing Is only about 5 cents. On returning from this trip the secretary talked to members of the Shubert Orchards Company about some of the features of this packing house and Dearie Baker was sent to Anna to get some Ideas first hand that could be used in the new packing house that' was erected at Shubert the past season. So much for the southern Illinois trip. # iiifctfifaTi irft'*iFr^ M^^BMlB^BBMBBBiM^B^B &gt; B^B^B^tWBBy^ H t it ,'fc'S{U'-" ' — ' — ' — * — "*^^»^™I^^6?-^^^^^^H^bM B - '' BwHBwVsX^BVBBlBwrfiiufBwfl ■^^[^■f ■■■■■• - . ■■ ■■ i •» ','zi •' ■ i\' ' -Up ' ■ * ; '"fr*^^™^^~=3!BffBByP"B R..~ BtB^B^B^B^BW'^lHB^'^^^^^i^ftL i^HH • Scene in the packing house of the American Fruit Growers Inc.. at Anna.

The packer places it on the bench under one of the chutes. After it is filled the form is placed on the conveyor near the wall. The trip to Colorado was likewise interesting and instructive. The first fruit region visited was the cherry district between Fort Collins and Loveland. This is a comparatively new venture, the old - est commercial planting being only about 20 years old. The plant - ings are scattered out on the flat table east of the foothills of the Rockies and in the valleys in the foothills. Occasionally there is a new planting on a gentle slope of one of the foothills. We visited the oldest commercial orchard just outside of Loveland on the road to Estes Park. The owner came from Missouri and planted his trees about as he would have in Missouri. The trees were headed about as we head them around Nebraska City— 18 to 24 inches from the ground. But it was found that this method was not well adapted in the clear atmosphere so typical of mountain regions. The south - west side of the trunks of most of the old trees was injured by sun - scald. All of the young plantings have their branches arising close to the ground. The trees are not Irrigated. It has been found that </seg>
            <seg id="p642">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the chenjy does not respond well to irrigation and the fruit becomes insipid and undesirable for canning. The 1931 crop was almost a total failure, a late freeze in Mav having Wiled 95 per cent of the bloom. But the few cherries J£ were produced were being harvested while we were there In early July. The product certainly is attractive. The chorries were large and of a very uniform dark color. Unfortunately the price was not up to expectations There was only one canning company operating In the Loveland re%lon. The other four or five were closed because of poor crops and low prices for the finished product. The laree carry over of cherries was having its effect first in this territory The growers were receiving only 2 to 2% cents per pound and about half of this went to the pickers. If the period of depression continues for several years and the production is Increased as it promises to be. the profits in cherry growing will be small or entirely lacking.

            <seg id="p643">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Thence we drove west across the mountains over Monarch Pass to Montrose. At Montrose we turned north to go to the Delta county fruit section. Delta county at present grows more apples than any other Colorado county on the western slope. Those of you who have shown fruit at any of the Midwest Fruit shows in the last decade will probably recall that when such classes as Jonathan, Winesap, Rome, Delicious, Stayman Winesap, Gano, and Grimes, came to be judged — whether in trays, boxes or plates, there was bound to be some keen competition from Delta county. The exhibitor, Mr. Charles Dyer of Cedar Edge in upper Delta county, is known to some of you. He is county fruit commissioner or inspector. He has a ten acre orchard on one of the upper tables and he graciously showed us around. He explained that the codling moth finds such favorable conditions for development in the lower valleys that it is almost im - possible to control them with our present methods. The higher cooler portions of the county raise a better quality, better colored apple than do the lower valleys. Hence the more recent developments are closer to the mountains. Of course the lower valleys have prior rights to the water that flows down the irrigation ditches and in years like 1931 when the snow fall in the mountains was light the orchards suffered from lack of water. It seemed a shame he said to see the sparkling mountain streams rushing down through the orchards carry - ing the life giving moisture to the alfalfa and grain fields in the lower valleys many miles away, when their own fruit, crops were suffering. But the orchard owner dared not divert the waters until the others had all they wanted to use. The courts have upheld these prior rights and woe to the orchard owner who tries to use the water for his own crops. Mr. Dyer showed us many good looking apple orchards during the course of the day. The trees do not attain .very great size, the largest being about the size of well grown 15 year old trees in this section. Thinning is a regular part of the program. The crop from his orchard is generally sold as extra fancy, packed in' boxes especially for one of the large chain groceries and sold locally through Colorado and eastern Utah. In general, however/ the crop moves to the south into Oklahoma and Texas. Washing is compulsory. There are a great many home made washers being used in the district. We visited the Experimental Orchard at Austin. Mr. F. M. Green is in charge here and he explained some of their problems to us. The principal problem is the control of the codling moth. Every tree in scraped and banded with treated bands. These sanitary meas - ures are absolutely necessary in addition to spraying, in order to raise even a fair proportion of worm free fruit. The bands would average 300 to 400 larvae. There is practically a continual emer - gence of moths from early in May until in September. This means </seg>

As a rulie seven sprays are needed after the calyx application. The water for irrigating in this part of the county conies from the lakes on top of Mesa mountain. This is supposed to be the larg - est fiat topped mountain in the world. It is 10,500 feet above sea. level and has on its summit about 250 lakes of various sizes. Fir trees abound about the shores of many of these lakes and there are flowers of many kinds on the mountain sides. The Columbine, the state flower of Colorado, was at its best right at this time on Mesa Mountain. i A tank waKon carries the spray -material to the sprayers. .The water is drawn nut or a pond. In the meantime the materials are being mixed with an apparatus that resembles an ice cream mixer and when thoroughly mixed it is emptied into the supply tank. From Delta County we drove to Grand Junction. The valleys around Grand Junction had in the early day produced many thousands of carloads of apples but when the codling moth became firmly estab - lished the apple trees were pulled out and these low valleys are now largely devoted to. dairying, alfalfa being one of the principal crdps. There are still quite a lew apple orchards here and there, espec - ially around Fruitvale. But pears are being grown on about as large a scale. There had been practically a complete failure of the apple and pear crops in 1930 so that the codling moth received a severe set - back. The following year the crop was fairly free from worms where good spraying was done but I was assured that the worms were on the increase once more and that it was a rather hopeless fluht to keep ahead of the worms so far as growing apples are concerned. The County Agent at Grand Junction told me that a new packing house was being erected south of Fruitvale and that a homemade washer &gt;'as being installed, so I drove out to see the new plant. The house was arranged on two different levels. The apples and pears </seg>
            <seg id="p645">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY wore to be delivered at the upper level where two homemade washers were being installed. These were of the same general plan as the ones Mr. Banning and Mr. Weaver built the last year. However, there was no separate compartment for rinsing the acid off after leaving the acid bath. A large belt carried the fruit from the acid bath into a flume about 14 inches wide, carrying water directly from an irrigation ditch. This flume led to the lower floor into a large box-like compartment and the fruit was elevated from this box onto another belt that led to the sorting bins. No effort was made to remove the water from the fruit at this point but it was explained that the dry atmosphere • prevalent in the region would soon remove excess moisture. The girls who did the packing graded the fruit into fancy, extra fancy grade and culls, and this grading was done right in connection with the packing. The girls were paid by the box rather than by the day. 1 asked the foreman whether there was not considerable variation in the grades as put out by the different packers. He assured me that there was not after once the packing got under full swing, but that there was at first. On the road out to this packing house I noticed several mature pear orchards that were piped for the stationary type of sprayer. Most of the growers, however, were still using the port - able sprayers so common in most of the central western orchards. A red raspberry plantation in southern Illinois. The hill system Is used, the canes from one hill being tied to a single stake. On the way to Clifton, Bridges and Palisades, one sees more of the stone fruits; apricots were just beginning to ripen and roadside stands were offering ripe apricots at very reasonable prices. The main crop of fruit in this region is peaches. The climate seems wonderfully adapted to their growth. Spring frosts are seldom encountered and winter injury practically unknown, due primarily- to the protecting influence of • the Palisades mountains. Prom a distance these look </seg>
            <seg id="p646">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE more like a high bluff of yellow clay. Evidently they are responsible for tempering the mountain breezes, so that peaches are a sure crop. One of the advantages of this region is that there is an abundance of water available from the Colorado River. This year the river car - ried less than half the normal flow of water but there was more than enough for all of the irrigated lands adjacent. One thing that interested me regarding the marketing of the crop was that peaches were transported in bulk in trucks to points as far east as Grand Island. Evidently the peaches were quite green to be marketed satisfactorily in this way. In years of a depression such as we are passing through, quality does not count for as much as low prices to put the product within reach of the depleted pocket books of the central and western Nebraska farmers. MR. FRANKLIN: We will now have a discussion of apple stor - age problems by Professor C. C. Wiggans, chairman of the Depart - ment of Horticulture. i ■ APPLE PACKAGES AND STORAGE C. C. WIGGANS The unpleasant experiences of Nebraska apple producers during the past season have led some of them to raise the question as to whether some adjustment as to packing and storing methods might not be worked out. A large crop of fine fruit at the University Fruit Farm in 1931 furnished an opportunity for the Department of Horti - culture to begin a study of this problem. This is merely a prelimin - ary report on the project. For many years the barrel was considered the standard package in the Central West for apples- — both for sale and storage. In more recent years bushel baskets of various types have become more popular due to demands of market convenience and have very largely replaced the barrel. The ease with which these packages can be packed and handled and the relatively small amount of storage space needed for empties, have also commended them to the grower. The cost Is ap - proximately equal on a per bushel basis. In the Pacific Northwest the standard bushel box is about the only package used. It has not ap - pealed very strongly to Nebraska growers, however, because the suc - cessful use of this package requires more uniformity of size and possibly also of grade, than the average orchardist has been willing to give. The possibility or even the necessity of utilizing such a pack - age has been forcibly brought forward by the unprincipled trucker - peddler who is willing to purchase only enough good apples to use for facers and then fill the basket proper with lower grade fruit. </seg>
            <seg id="p647">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Naturally he represents this fruit as so and so's first grade and then the grower gets a black eye when the package Is opened at the con - sumer's home. As a matter of self protection, the grower may need to adopt the box or some other distinctive package and then use this exclusively for his first grade fruit. The project to which reference has been made contemplates the gathering of information and data upon a number of different points and will be carried for a number of years. Whenever fruit is avail - able in sufficient quantity, comparative storage tests will be made with the several fall and winter varieties of different types of packages and different methods of packing. In brief the plan of this experiment for this year was to pack from 50 to 100 each of ten different varieties, some being in baskets and some in boxes, some with shredded oiled paper and some without, and some with oiled wraps in the case of the boxed apples. Originally it was intended to pack some at the orchard south of Union and bring a similar lot to Lincoln in lug boxes for packing here — the latter operation being more or less a duplication of the procedure involved in the use of a central packing plant. However, it was found unfeasible to carry out the latter phase except for the Jonathan. An effort was made to secure as uniform packing as possible. All baskets and boxes, except for those in which paper wraps were used, were packed by the same man. A good face was put on both the basket and box and the other apples "jumbled" in. With the wrapped fruit, more uniformly sized fruit necessarily had to be used and it was properly layered also. Considerable variation in weight was found especially in the packages where wrapped fruit was used due to the inexperience of the packers. Such a difficulty would, of course, be eliminated in time where considerable quantities of fruit were being handled. It was recognized that conditions last September were unfavor - able to proper coloring and maturity and consequently some of the early varieties were harvested while they were still green in color. However, either this procedure was necessary or drop apples would have been the only ones available. Generally speaking, the fruit used was in fine condition and was of good size. Lack of a sufficient quan - tity in. the case of a few varieties made it impossible to have as much uniformity of size as might have been desired but the various lots of a given variety were kept quite uniform in this respect. The fruit was picked, put through the acid and rinse water and packed the same day. Only first class fruit was used. On the fol - lowing morning it was sent to the Beatrice Creamery Storage plant in .Lincoln and placed in a storage temperature of 32-33° P. Harvesting with the earlier sorts was begun about the middle of September but the later sorts stayed on until late October. </seg>

            <seg id="p649">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Several packages of each kind and of each variety were removed from storage for examination at monthly intervals throughout the winter. Removal began November 1st with the earlier sorts and January 1st with the late varieties. Bach variety was divided into five lots. Data being taken are weights, both gross and net. number of apples in the package, — number of apples with skin broken in pack - ing operations, number of rotten apples, etc. Observations are also being made upon the general appearance of the package, the general condition of the fruit and the amount and severity of storage scald and internal breakdown. With only three observation dates on certain varieties and a single one for the others, it would be of doubtful value to give even general conclusions at this time. Net weights for the fruit in the various types of packages and the different methods of packing are available, however, and are given in the table. After this fruit was examined it was then ready for sale. At the sales stand in the corner of the orchard apples were offered in both boxes and baskets. Others were placed in the coarsely woven burlap bags such as are used for onions. The public preference seemed to be for the basket. This may indicate that if boxes are to be used, the main outlet for such packages is to be the fruit stand or grocery where fruits are retailed on a piece basis. It is planned to continue this work through several season!; be - .fore definite conclusions can be reached. In this period tests will be made with various other packages, such as paper cartons, etc., which may be available for use.

This would mean that to be on the safe side the growers who expect to ship across state linos ought to equip thcniRelvea to wash their fruit. A movie illustrating the operation of fruit washers was shown and explained by Mr. Ingerson of East Lansing, Mich. A committee. was appointed to look into the advisability and the possibility of amending the cedar law passed at the last session of the legislature so that it would be more fair to the fruit grower. This committee consisted of W. B. Banning, George Marshall, J. L'. Stivers, Frank Shubert; and Chas. Lord. The Secretary of the Society was drafted as an ex-omcio member. Legislative Committee Successful in Securing Amendment At first several interviews were held by Mr. Lord with Governor Bryan as to the possibility of getting Mr. Bryan's new Secretary of Agriculture to proceed under the Nursery Law. But it was the opinion of the Attorney General that such action would be criticized since no specific mention is made in this law whereas a law specifically "^9m The Council of Garden Clubs of Omaha contraated the Nebraska farm houne of 18CT with the modern farm house and its surroundinus. State Fair .of 1931. mentioning the red cedar was recen-tly passed. Then it was decided to amend the law if possible and the committee had the amendment drawn and brought- out in the senate. After considerable personal work on the part of the committee and Mr. Bowers of Verdon, the amendment was passed and the Governor signed it. It is possible now to have the Secretary of Agriculture or his agents condemn cedar trees near apple orchards and the owners must remove them. </seg>

In all there were about 150. people on this trip coming from Douglas, Sarpy, Saunders, Lancaster, Gage, Cass, Otoe, Nemaha, and Richardson counties. In addition we had some out of state visitors. One group came from Iowa, another from northwest Missouri, and another from northeast Kansas. There was even one prospective carlot buyer from Chicago. By 9:30 the group had gathered in Senator W. B.

This spring each tree received 4 pounds of ammonium sulfate. The dark green foliage certainly indicated that the trees had not been slighted.

            <seg id="p655">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY just how complicated the fruit business Is becoming. Twenty-five years ago the orchardists set out their trees and when they came into bearing they harvested the crop and marketed it. Not so today. The grower today provides bees for pollination. He must spray to control the insect and fungous pests and now he must wash the lead arsenate off the apples before he can sell them. This washer is merely a vat about 20 feet long and three feet wide and divided into two compartments. The first one into which the apples go contains a % per cent solution of hydrochloric acid. The second one is a rinse of clear water to remove the acid. The apples are floated thru the tanks propelled ahead by paddle wheels. This outfit has no drying attachment but the apples are packed while wet. The next stop was the University Fruit Farm a mile and a half south of Senator Bannlng's orchard. Here we saw a forty acre block of trees planted mostly in 1918 and 1919. Most of the varieties are carrying a fair crop of apples. At the start the soil was not in the best of shape and the trees have not made quite as much growth as have Mr. Banning's. One interesting thing noticed was that the block of Jonathans that have been under constant cultivation showed a great deal of twig blight or fire blight, whereas the adjoining blocks that had been in red clover sod showed very little of this trouble. Undoubtedly the cultivation has Induced a very succulent type of growth that makes the trees more susceptible to blight. The east half of the forty is planted to fillers of King David and these trees were well loaded with fruit. This forty will yield in the neighborhood of 5,000 bushels this year. There are a lot of interesting things to see on this farm, but with the schedule outlined to cover 4 counties it was deemed advisable to merely visit this orchard this year and next year spend a whole day of a half day going over the various experiments. So we drove on toward Nebraska City to visit two of the Jay Morton orchards. The first one was a solid quarter section of apples 5 and 7 years old carrying a light crop on the older plant - ing. If these trees were all in a single row and spaced as they are they would make a row 38% miles long. You can see that the spray - ing operation alone is quite a task here and will be much more tedious as the trees become larger. The next orchard visited was a 40 acre block of 18 year old trees under the same management. This orchard was heavily loaded," in fact many of the trees needed thinning and were to receive it immediately. Thinning is a comparatively new prac - tice to most of our growers but In years, when an unusually heavy crop sets it will have to be done if good quality apples are to be grown. Next, the route led past the Nebraska City Canning Company's orchard where we saw plantings of sour cherries varying in age from one to eight years, the oldest planting being an 8 acre block in which experimental work is being done by the College of Agriculture.

            <seg id="p657">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY principal problem ill growing sour cherries is shot hole I'hiikus which causes the leaves to turn yellow and drop. This year there was found no dlfliculty in controlling the disease, but In some years it isn't so easy. The trees have that dark green thrifty look that indicates a fine crop prospect for next year. This year the crop was rather light, a late frost having killed about 50 r /r of the bloom. Going south out of Nebraska City on the pavement we passed several fine young cherry orchards, the outstanding one being Henry Heisch's 10 acre planting of trees about 4 years old. Then just before reaching Auburn we drove thru Dr. C. H. Lutgen's 80 acre apple orchard. Cultivation here is rather dangerous on account of the rather steep slopes and the soil was rather thin by the time the apple trees reached 6 years of age, so Dr. Lutgen had the greater part o£ it seeded to red clover. It takes good soil to produce good annual crops of fruit and this orchard will surely yield profitable crops to repay its owner, providing of course the other necessary oper - ations are carefully carried on, The striking thing here was that the Jonathan trees were losing a great many leaves. Dr. Goss of the Pathology Department of the College explained that this was brought about by a fungus commonly known as frog eye or black rot. It causes brown spots on the leaves with distinct blackish rings toward the center. As the spots enlarge the leaves may turn yellow and drop. It was very evident that there was quite a variation in the dropping of leaves on the different varieties. Most of the varieties showed some infection, but none compared with Jonathan in leaf drop. Frog eye, Dr. Goss explained, is not difficult to control. Weak lime sulfur sprays or Bordeaux applied during June at the time or the first and second cover spray for the codling moth will generally do It. This year the weather was rather hot during the latter part of June and most of the growers omitted the fungicide at that time to avoid burning the leaves and russetting the fruit. Hence the infection this year. The next stop was for dinner at Brownville, and then we visited the old Governor Furnas place now managed by J. t. Stivers of Au - burn. Most of the old orchard planted by Governor Furnas has been cut out but part of the original planting is still bearing. In the early day a great many varieties were used. This orchard at one time contained over 90 different varieties. Most of them can't even bo bought from nurseries at present. Today people want high color more than anything else. Therefore, the old Rambo, Genet and Russett have been discarded even though of fine quality for such highly col - ored varieties as Jonathan, Delicious, and Winesap. Mr. Stivers led us through his young orchards constituting about 250 acres, over 100 of wiiich are planted to peach fillers. The intention is to keep the peach trees until such a time as the apple trees will need all the room. In the meantime several paying crops may be harvested from </seg>

The peach trees here were two or three times the size of the apple trees and carried ii fair crop of fruit. Unfortunately a severe hail storm in early June greatly reduced the size and quality of the crop. Prom the old Purnas orchard one gets a good view of the coun - try round about since it is located on a rather high knoll overlooking Drownville. Here and there on the steep hillsides one sees vineyards, small orchards, and small fruit plantings, and of course some hill - sides are still in timber. Then off in the distance to the east one sees the bluffs of Iowa and Missouri. One can't see the Missouri itiver from this point but it meanders along this side of the hazy bluffs. From here our route goes south past the Moore orchard near Nemaha, then thru the town of Nemaha, then south across the upper Nemaha River and then past the McCandless orchard which lies on the east side of the road. Then we came to a section where rather large orchards became more conspicuous. Up to now the orchards have been more Isolated. The section around Shubert has more acres of orchard than any other section of the state, and Shubert proudly boasts that it is the apple metropolis of Nebraska. This year there will be produced in this vicinity oveT 300 cars of apples. The Shubert Orchard Co. operates all told about 800 acres and will harvest close to 100,000 bushels of apples. Former Governor Weaver has several orchards in this section but most of his 300 acre holdings are closer to Falls City. Congressman Moorehead has two orchards in this vicinity. Before coming into the town, however, we drove through an 80 acre orchard belonging to the Shubert Orchard Company, known as the Lewis orchard. Here Jonathan and Winesap predominate with Missouri Pippins as fillers. . The trees are about 12 years old and are pretty well loaded. Next we drove by the King orchard owned by the same company. This orchard comprises 120 acres of 14 year old trees. The soil here has been rather poor and the trees are small for their age, but sheep manure was applied several years ago and the orchard seeded to sweet clover and red clover, and now the trees are becoming more thrifty, and this year have a fair crop on them. Next we looked over one of Governor Weaver's orchards known as the ReaveB place. This is an 80, half of which has trees 5 years old, and the other is 15 years old, showing a fine crop primarily of Delicious and Jonathan. This was one of the best orchards we saw on the trip, though not as heavily loaded as some of the others. This orchard has been in red clover which was broken up this year. The trees showed lots of vigor and the foliage was a healthy dark green, plainly indicating that the soil is rich in nitrogen. Next we-visited the Burson 40, another Shubert orchard.

The two varieties do not pollinate each other and about 100 trees have been top worked to other varieties to provide suitable pollen. This year bouquets of suit - able varieties were scattered through the orchard near the hives of bees about 40 stands being used, and the crop is very good as a result, but it is the first good crop this orchard has produced. Then we went to the Slocum 80 just west of Shubert to see one of the most profitable orchards in this region. Here are Winesaps, Jonathan, Grimes, and Delicious interplanted with Missouri Pippins. The trees are 17 years old with a heavy crop in prospect estimated at from 15 to 20,000 bushels. Here we saw some experiments in thin - ning and spraying. One Grimes tree had 1,158 apples removed and it had a good crop. When harvest time comes we will count the apples and measure and grade them to compare the product with the un - thinned tree nearby. I won't go into detail on the spraying since that would overrun my allotted time. Next we went down to the new packing house being erected by the Shubert Orchard Company. Here we saw a Cutler washer and grader in operation. The machine is operated by a motor and handles about 800 bushels a day washing, drying, and sizing the apples in one operation. In the new building a similar machine but of much larger capacity will be installed by September 1st. This outfit will grade and wash 2,000 bushels a day. Naturally it will take a lot of help to operate. In order to facilitate matters a long loading platform was built along a siding. The packed apples will be loaded directly into cars. State Fair and Ak-Sar-Ben Exhibits In cooperation with the State Fair Board the Horticultural So - ciety sponsored fruit, flower and nursery exhibits at the State Fair. The nurserymen cooperated in making an attractive exhibit of a small outdoor living room. The border consisted of evergreens of various kinds, labelled so that people could tell what they were. As a central feature there wab a small pool with lilies and fish. A stone seat added a touch of livability. This year a new feature was added to the or - namental exhibits, namely garden club exhibits. Two Omaha clubs and our Lincoln Garden Club competed in this class. Each club was allotted a space 10x14 at the north side of Agricultural Hall and they were to depict ways of making the yard attractive. These exhibits attracted a lot of attention. The flower exhibits were unusually fine this year and there were more entries than usual. Unfortunately a protracted hot dry spell hit Nebraska right at this time and some of the exhibits did not re - main fresh looking throughout the fair. Next year it is hoped to change the premium in such a way that new exhibits will be entered about the middle of the Fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p662">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF A-GRICULTURE With the exception of plums the fruit classes had more entries than for several years. A large number of peaches were entered and some of these were unusually good. The apple exhibit was better than usual because of the large crop being produced in eastern Nebraska. The Society arranged an apple exhibit for the Ak-Sar-Ben Stock Show in Omaha, Oct. 31st to Nov. 7th. Advertising Nebraska Apples The apple crop this year was the largest produced in Nebraska in 10 years, there being between 500 and 600 cars. In view of tho general financial situation it was felt that there was a stringent need for advertising Nebraska apples to Nebraska people. The apple grow - ers of southeast Nebraska requested that the Horticultural Society help out with a small folder telling of the value of apples in the diet and giving some recipes for using them. The Secretary prepared a folder embodying these ideas and 25,000 copies were printed. Copies were distributed to visitors at both the State Fair and at the Ak- Sar-Ben i Stock Show. Other Activities The Secretary was authorized to visit the fruit regions of Colo - rado and to take movie reels showing the practices employed there and to report to the winter meetings. </seg>

            <seg id="p669">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION FEEDLOT JiOSSKS DR. LOUIS V. SKIDMORE Introduction The feeding of lambs Is one of the most important livestock indus - tries in Nebraska. Approximately 1,000,000 lambs are fed annually in our state. Most of these are western lambs coming from the states of Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Colorado. It is estimated that more lambs are being fed this year in our state than were fed last year. Lamb feeding is one of the principal ways of marketing our grain and forage crops. Getting the Lambs in Our Feed Lots In the moving of such- large numbers of lambs into our reed lots, there are many problems which require careful study and con - sideration in order to make lamb feeding profitable animal husbandry. First, there is the problem of shipping, with all the details or securing and proper preparation of cars; good judgment in loading; the feeding and watering in transit; and the weather conditions to combat. All these play a part in getting the lambs into our reed lots in good condition. Almost every year something arises in these various phases which requires study and changes. During the past few years the lamb producers, the railroads, commission firms, experi - ment stations, and, in fact, all parties interested in lamb feeding have been working in hearty cooperation to reduce the losses to a minimum. This fall I received an excellent publication prepared by Agricultural Agent O. O. Waggener of the Burlington Railroad, which gives con - structive information concerning the shipping of livestock. Second, these Iambs . brought to our feed lots are raised in a section of the country entirely different from our own; different en - vironmental conditions, different climate; and accustomed to different foods. On account of these different conditions feeders expect a normal loss of about 2 per cent of lambs handled. However, sometimes losses far exceed this figure. In fact, in some instances the losses incurred during the first two weeks of ownership are so great that all likelihood of making a profit from feeding lambs is wiped out. I believe that contract feeding, or cooperative lamb marketing. Is a good method of making all parties concerned cautious in feed lot enterprises. I wish to quote briefly from a recent article published in the "Country Gentleman" on this subject: "A new method of marketing lambs on a cooperative basis was evolved last fall between Montana sheepmen and Middle West feeders, which worked out so satisfactorily that it will probably continue to - be used." "Eight thousand Montana Iambs were shipped last fall into </seg>
            <seg id="p670">: REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE [ Minnesota and North Dakota for feeding on a cooperative basis. Death losses averaged 1.7 per cent. The average sale price on central mar - kets for these lambs was $7.55 to $8.50. The average return to the • feeder was $1.95 per lamb, while the grower averaged from six to six and a half cents per pound." "The feeder made money, the grower made money, and the method greatly relieved the supply of feeder Iambs to be put on the market in the short fall season." "This method, of marketing lambs takes out all the gamble, and protects both the grower and the feeder. If there are any profits to be made, they are shared equally." This explains the points I want to bring out on cooperative lamb marketing. The Losses The losses that occur in feeder lambs may be considered under three headings: 1. : Those incurred in shipping, due to injuries, suffocation from overloading; excitement to animals preventing them from eating and especially from drinking. Also those losses due to infectious and para - sitic diseases, many of which are definitely known and can be con - trolled. Other diseases still require considerable study before de - finitely understood. 2. Losses which occur from the shipping of unfit lambs; those physically unable, on account of lack of development or disease, to withstand the hardships of transit. 3. The losses in the feed lots due principally to various feeding practices. These three points we can consider only very briefly at this time. . ■ I Pneumonia One of the most common diseases acquired during shipping is pneumonia. This condition seems to be brought about principally by the exhaustive conditions accompanying the shipping of lambs. For this reason it has been popularly designated as "shipping fever." Pneumonia can be prevented to a great extent by conserving the vitality- of the lambs as much as possible during transit. Proper protection during unfavorable weather should be given to the animals in transit. Such procedures as the walling up of the sides of the cars with building paper, proper bedding, careful handling, adequate feeding and watering facilities, and good shelter will materially reduce the incidence of pneumonia. This disease is self-limiting. However, several animals may die. Upon their arrival in the feed lot, especially in wet and stormy weather, provide adequate dry shelter for all lambs. Then sort out all apparently affected lambs and keep them as quiet as possible. Light feeding of prairie hay, grain, and oats should be </seg>
            <seg id="p671">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION given. Such animals are about in the same condition as a man affected with pneumonia. Nasal Catarrh and Bronchitis These affections are observed Quite often in lambs arriving in feed lots or in a few days after arrival. These conditions are brought about by exposure to cold weather, rain, and dampness during transit. The lambs blow their nose and cough. Such animals should be pro - vided with dry quarters, not crowded, nor excited any more than necessary. The feeding of dusty feeds is to be avoided. Individual medicinal treatment of any kind is useless and rarely does any good. Proper handling of such cases in the beginning may prevent the development of pneumonia. Usually the symptoms disappear in a few days. Sore Eyes Occasionally there come with some shipments of lambs a number affected with sore eyes. The eyes are severely inflammed. This ap - pears to be an Infectious disease. As in the treatment of any infec - tious disease, the affected lambs should be separated from the non - affected ones. The eyes may be washed with some weak antiseptic solution such as borac acid. The yellow oxide of mercury may be applied to the affected eyes. Sore Mouth and Sore Feet This condition may be seen in sheep of any age. Warty or scabby-like sores usually appear on the lips, nose, and also may be found on the gums and inside of the mouth. Sometimes sores are also found on the legs, feet, and belly. This is caused by germs which gain entrance to the body tissues through injuries and abrasions. Infected yards and pens are usually responsible for this type of infec - tion. The lambs may have come in contact with other diseased sheep. Lambs walking and lying down on cinders or sharp rocks will result in abrasions and cuts in the body, which will allow ready access to the entrance of infection into these parts. The feeding of coarse, stemmy, and woody forage may allow infection to gain, more readily, entrance to the tissues of the mouth. Affected lambs cannot eat normally. They may be seriously hampered in getting about if the feet are diseased so that they cannot, especially when even slightly crowded, get sufficient feed and water. These lambs become thin and emaciated. The loss may be quite heavy. Treatment is quite satisfactory but, of course, requires considerable time since each indi - vidual animal must be treated two or three times a week until cured. Treatment consists in scraping off the scabs with a strong piece .of wood and applying a mixture of one part of chloroform and two parts of tincture of iodine to the affected parts. Sometimes good results may be obtained by the application of a 3 per cent solution </seg>
            <seg id="p672">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of any of the cresol or coal tar dips. Very severe sores of the mouth may be treated with a 10 per cent solution of nitric acid. This must be used with caution. A mixture of equal parts of glycerine and tincture of iodine may be used when the belly is infected. Dry bed - ding and lots are necessary for a speedy recovery. Dysentery or Diarrhea Diarrhea may be due to any one of a great number of causes such as germs, parasites, various feeds, and overfeeding. The cor - rection of outbreaks of diarrhea can be affected only by finding the cause and eliminating this factor. In some cases it may necessitate changing the lambs to new lots to get away from contaminated soil. Gravel or Stones Wether lambs may have an obstruction of the urinary passage. This prevents the passage of urine. The obstruction is caused by the accumulation of mineral salts forming calculi. The formation of these stones or gravel is thought to be due to heavy feeding of feeds rich In lime salts such as sugar beets, mangels, etc. The symptoms are straining and frequent attempts to urinate. The treatment may necessitate amputation of the penis or immediate slaughter of the animal. Anthrax and Scab Anthrax is a fatal disease of sheep. It may make its appearance in those sections and on farms where anthrax has previously been found. In lots where this disease has appeared sheep should be vaccinated annually. It may be the best plan to move the lambs to another part of the farm where animals have not been previously kept. In an outbreak of anthrax the state veterinarian must be notified and the proper measures will be taken to control the disease. Anthrax germs can infect humans. Sheep scab or mange is not common in feeder lambs. It is caused by a parasite and Is a very injurious disease. The most common form is psoroptic mange. Likewise, when sheep scab is found the state veterinarian should be notifled. Scab is best controlled by dipping in solutions of lime and sulphur and nicotine and sulphur. Internal Parasites. The most common internal parasites encountered are stomach worms, Icoccldio, and tapeworms. Sometimes in the early fall ship - ments of lambs, stomach worm infestation may be a serious problem. Lambs become infected in stock yards or in Infected feed lots. Prob - ably the best and most economical treatment for stomach worms is a one per I cent solution of copper sulphate. </seg>
            <seg id="p673">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Coccidiosis or Moody Scours CoccidiosiB Is a parasitic protozoan disease of the intestinal tract causing scours. In many cases the feces is bloody. Some call this bloody scours. Lambs most often pick up this infection in stock cars or stock yards during transit. Sometimes they contract this infection after being put in lots which have previously been infected by other lambs. A positive diagnosis of this disease is made by a microscopic examination of the feces in which the parasites can be found in great numbers. Lambs having bloody scours or blood streaked feces should always be -suspected of having this disease and should imme - diately be isolated to themselves. Dry, well drained lots, cleaned often, and the prevention of contamination of the feed and water with the feces of affected animals will materially aid in controlling cocci - diosis. Lambs should be discouraged from eating and drinking from the ground. Periodic rotation of the lambs to other lots and pastures will prevent severe infestation. Some feeders report favorable results following the feeding of iron sulphate mixed with linseed meal or bran. It is useless to attempt individual treatment except in small flocks. Several years ago this department in cooperation with the state and federal departments investigated a very severe outbreak of coccidiosis in a band of sheep. One year there was a loss of 350 lambs out of 2300. The following year 300 died out of 2128. This same year our own university feeder lambs became infected but the loss was very slight, due to the proper management of the lambs. ' Two species of tapeworm are most often found. The Moniezlae, parasites which grow to a considerable length. Various treatments are recommended such as Kamala, oleoresin of male fern and nicotine sulphate given in conjunction with copper sulphate solution. The other species of tapeworm known as the fringed tapeworm is found in western range lambs. They bring these parasites with them. No successful treatment is known at present to combat these parasites. Unfit Lambs The shipping of physically unfit lambs, due to lack of develop - ment and disease, has been discouraged to a great extent because of the heavy losses incurred of such animals. This loss has been done away with almost entirely in contract feeding and cooperative market - ing because it means, a loss to all parties concerned. Feeding Practices i • Now we have arrived to the third point for consideration. The one which has caused more discussion than any other — that is the question of death losses due to feeding after we get the lambs into our feed lots. Perhaps the reason for so much discussion is because there is yet so much to be learned about the feeding of lambs. The </seg>
            <seg id="p674">; REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE feed these animals receive In our feed lots, as stated previously, is entirely different from that to which they are accustomed. They are required to adjust themselves, many times too rapidly, to feeds whose chemical make-up is different from that of any feed they have pre - viously received. The heavy feeding with the highly nutritious feeds raised in our section may be almost as effective explosive as dynamite to these lambs. Most of these range lambs have never tasted grain. It is a long known principle In feeding livestock that a sudden change in feed usually ends in disaster. These animals have not in their very nature been raised capable of adjusting themselves to the rapid and sudden food changes practiced by many of our feeders. To get these lambs on feed they should first be allowed to till up on dry, bulky roughage such as prairie hay or a mixture of equal parts of alfalfa and straw. Alfalfa and like roughages when fed alone are likely to cause digestive disturbances such as scours and bloating. After filling up on roughage for a few days they may be given a very small amount of grain, about one-tenth to one-twelfth pound per lamb. Sufficient feeding space at trough, 12 to 15 inches per lamb, should be allowed so that each animal can readily get Its share of feed. Spoiled or questionable feed of any kind should never be fed because lambs appear to be particularly susceptible to digestive troubles, especially at the beginning of the feeding period. The feed - ing of too much concentrate, such as corn, wheat, barley, etc., within a few days is always a dangerous practice.. Losses will be greatly overcome if a longer time is taken to get the lambs on full feed. Perhaps 25 to 30 days is soon enough. Heavy protein rations are believed by some to produce degenera - tive conditions of some of the internal organs. This has not been definitely proved. Linseed and cottonseed meals are the usual protein supplements fed to lambs. Most feeders prefer linseed meal. Others claim that cottonseed meal is just as economical to feed. Sometimes we are led to believe that linseed meal may be responsible for sudden deaths occurring in feed lots. Flax plants that have been damaged by un - favorable climatic conditions may form excessive amounts of hydro - cyanic acid. This is a question that needs further study. Of the concentrate, corn is favored by most feeders. Other grains such as wheat, barley, etc., may also be fed. Always keep in mind that these concentrates must be given at first in very small amounts. They are gradually Increased over a period of approximately a month before it is safe to feed in large quantities. It is true that some feeders get the lambs on full amounts of concentrates within ten days or two weeks but this Is always done with the risk of suffering heavy losses. </seg>
            <seg id="p675">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOClATIOt' A roughage such as prairie hay is good to start the lambs. How - ever, alfalfa is perhaps the best roughage to feed during the entire feeding period. Sweet clover is also very good. Silage fed in con - junction with other legume roughages is considered good practice. Sudan grass pastures may cause losses due to prusslc acid poisoning. The properly cured Sudan hay is not dangerous. A little molasses given to weak and exhausted lambs seems to have a stimulating effect. Salt and Water Lambs should be provided with salt at the rate of one pound to each 100 lambs. Blocks of salt may be placed about so that all lambs can get the desired amount. Sheep can resist fasting very well but they cannot get along without water. Water is very essential to normal digestive processes. A good water supply, readily available at all times, should be provided. The water in tanks can be kept from freezing by means of tank stoveB. Closing Remarks Lamb feeders have many and varied problems to contend with in the feed lots. . Like any other phase of animal husbandry, success or failure will depend upon the knowledge the feeder has of the various problems involved In lamb feeding. The amateur may be "lucky" as the beginner in a poker game, but it .is a fact that exper - ience in lamb feeding counts for much. We should seek advice from those livestock men who are, so to say, professionals in this business. In many sections you will find competent veterinarians who will be able to give you valuable assistance in your lamb feeding problems. You may also obtain valuable information by reading some of the bulletins concerning sheep published by the United States Department of Agriculture and the various experiment stations. Such publica - tions have been freely consulted in the preparation of this paper. ADDRESS OF W. MARSHALL ROSS AT "THE SHEEP UROWEUH" MEETING, FARMERS WEEK, 19S2, LINCOLN, NEBRASKA It is with a good bit of trepidation that I come before the "Sheep and Lamb" raisers of Nebraska at this time. The sheep industry is at its lowest ebb financially, and its highest in production in over thirty years, numbering at this time about 53,000,000 head, an increase of about 15,000,000 over war time pro - duction. Fortunately for the Increase of the use of lamb as a food, mostly brought about by advertising the last few years, and also because of the cheapness and palatabllity of the meat, it is being consumed in </seg>
            <seg id="p676">, REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE much greater quantities now than ever before In this country and especially in the West. The market has been so low on ewes and especially old ewes, that she did not pay more than the expense of letting her go to market: Therefore, about the only thing to do was let her raise an - other lamb. As one man put it — we need a hard winter on the range. This would be good for the small raiser but a calamity for the range - man, and is not to be desired because it is not well for one man to profit at the expense of another. The reports are coming in from the range country that the lamb crop at its best will be 10 to 15 per cent short of last year on account of loss of old ewes and reduced conception due to poorer feed follow - ing a droughty year. It being the history of the sheep business that ewes do not bring forth a good lamb crop following a dry year. Also the yearling crop of ewes must be small this year and will be next year on account of practically all ewe lambs coming to market the last two years. If no ewe lambs were kept for five years, ewe herds would almost be decimated. However, we of the sheep fraternity at this time are probably more interested in the spring lamb crop for early market. The report comes from California and Arizona that the crop of spring lambs from there will not cut a very big figure in the market supply. If this proves to be true, next April and May, it would not only be a boon to our early market lambs but also to our late supply of feed lot lambs. Now is probably as important a time in the life of the young lamb asi after it is born. In the first place, care should be used in a selection of a buck to breed to the ewes. It has been demonstrated in Missouri where two neighbors, both good sheep men and good feeders, were raising early spring lambs. One neighbor used a common grade buck while the other used a registered buck from a pure bred flock. Both crops of lambs were handled the same way and marketed about the same time, but the lambs from the pure bred ram were enough better quality, and carried enough more flesh to make a differ - ence of $ 1.9 6 per head. When we consider that a good yearling ram can take care of 40 or 50 ewes, the profit on the investment in the pure bred ram is very apparent. As to wintering a flock of ewes, now is the time when the most care should be used. If the ewes were bred early they are now getting rather heavy and inclined not to take much exercise. If the farm is fenced sheep tight, and it can be arranged to have some feed at the farther side of the farm so that they may use their own leisure in going back and forth, they will take the exercise which they must have if they are going to avoid certain conditions that are sure to happen if they do not. One of these is a sort or paralysis that over - takes the thriftiest and best ewes in the flock. You will find a ewe </seg>
            <seg id="p677">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATIOI" down, apparently all right but not having any use of herself what - ever, and later when death overtakes her, she will be found to be carrying twins or triplets. This, and weak lambs can be avoided by. plenty of exercise, which is better if it can be taken in the regular pursuit of a living. Those who are using range ewes should have a much better class of ewes as to age and constitution this year than a few years ago when old carrier ewes were selling for one year breeders at five and six cents per pound. After the lambs are brought forth care should be taken to keep the ewes separated from the Hock for a few days, and especially so if there are a pair of lambs. The tag locks should be clipped from around the bag, as often a lamb keeps sucking at one of these until it comes loose and then swallows it, which may later cause its death, and we cannot at that time decide what was the matter with the lamb. The ewe should be brought into good flesh early in her pregnancy if she has not been before breeding. Being thrifty and in good flesh with plenty of good alfalfa and a small quantity of grain and the use of a winter pasture for exercise, there is no reason why she should not give a large quantity of milk and start her lamb or lambs off in good shape. As soon as the lamb is two or three weeks old a creep should be made on the sunny side of the shed near where they are in the habit of going in and out, with openings just large enough so the ewe can not get in. Two six-inch boards horizontal placed about 16 inches apart, the lower one on the ground with 1x4 slats nailed on per - pendicular about 6 inches apart will keep the ewes out and let the lambs in. As for the feed used for the lambs, good yellow corn coarsely cracked with a little pea sized oil meal — about six parts corn to one of oil meal makes an ideal ration where the lamb has access to good leafy fourth cutting alfalfa. Lambs coming in February and handled in this way should weigh on an average of 70 to 75 pounds by June first. The profits from these spring lambs will be much greater if they can be marketed before flies and hot weather comes on. After hot weather lambs do not make much gain and it will pay to clean up even the lighter lambs if fat, than to carry them through the hot weather. ' vv "• As, to shearing the ewes, I have always made it a practice to shear as early as the weather would permit which is usually in March or early April, as I had sheds for theni to get in out of the weather. Of course, to get the most out of your wool it is necessary to market it through the Midwest Wool Marketing Association, a co - </seg>
            <seg id="p678">', REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I operative built up for the benefit of wool growers. This is composed of a selling agency called the National Wool Marketing Corporation, owned and controlled by 32 regional associations who assemble, grade into lines of like grades, and warehouse the wool until the National sells and orders it shipped direct to the mills for consumption. Each regional is required to own one share of stock for each one hundred thousand pounds of wool handled during its fiscal year. The National receives % cent per pound for selling and 14 cent to build up a reserve and pay expenses, making 1 cent cost in handling the wool at Boston. It Is controlled by directors elected from districts which handle not less than three million pounds of wool. These directors meet once a year to map out policies and elect officers for the following year. The Midwest wool is handled by a warehousing corporation, who organize, assemble, grade, warehouse and ship out the wool to Eastern mills upon an order from the National. This work is done for 2 '4 cents per pound, and in this way leaving the Midwest without any investment whatever. There is a reserve fund built up from 35 cents per cwt. in the Midwest to take care of expenses and losses that may be incurred. The capital stock is $30,000. We now have almost 8000 individual members and about 65 co-operatives that market the wool for their members through the Midwest. This makes about 10,000 individuals using the Midwest as a marketing medium. We have warehoused a fraction less than 4,000,000 pounds of wool in 1931, against 3,161,000 in 1930. Our cash advance this year was, as a rule, as much as dealers paid for the same grades, and quite often 1 cent to 2 cents more. In addition we will be able to make from 1 cent to 4 cents final settlement. We are anxious to get this final settlement out before the spring clip, so members will be able to make comparisons with other ways of marketing. There is an invisible profit to all growers, which is not always taken into account, and that is — -.that the organization of the Co-op holds the price up to a certain standard that dealers are compelled to recognize. There is no doubt that in 1930' it amounted to as much as 5 cents per pound and made wool growers of the United States twenty million dollars. Nearly one-third of the wool in the United States was marketed through the regional associations in 1930 and 1931, which goes to prove that it is popular with a large per cent of the wool growers. The Midwest hopes to manage Us business In such a -way that an ever increasing number of members will have confidence in its ability to handle their wool, so that the member may be confident when he ships In his wool that he is not only going to get good grades but that he is going to get the full market value for his product each year. But to do this we must have boosters and not knockers. </seg>
            <seg id="p679">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Here's hoping that the year of 1932 will prove the turning point for sheep and wool and that we may have a profitable and a happy pleasant New Year. MEAT MERCHANDISING UP TO DATK F. M. SIMPSON, Swirt &amp; Co., Chicago This meat merchandising up to date has a good many phases to it and I am just going to try to take up one phase of it — that dealing with the new method of merchandising meat by putting it in packages at the packing plant. I want to take a few minutes to trace back the development that has taken place in the merchandising of meat. About 25 years ago the retailer of meats bought from the packer a side of beef or an entire carcass of beef. A little later in the de - velopment of merchandising he bought a quarter of beef — hind or fore. The next development a few years later was the buying of wholesale cuts. We are now down to the point where we believe -this is the next development, that is, the packaging of meats in cuts ready for the 'home and consumer right in the packing plant. These meats are all frozen. (Displays packaged meat). This freezing pro - cess is different from the one most of us are familiar with. The packers have known this process for a good many years. Possibly the thing that has made it possible to use this system of merchan - dising has been the development of- the mechanical refrigerator, be - cause that has enabled the retailer to get a' case for displaying his meats that will carry a temperature below that he carries his unfrozen meats at. He usually carries meats around 35 to 40 degrees above zero. Frozen meats should be carried down around 10, 15, or 20 above zero. The development in mechanical refrigeration has made that possible. Swift and Company has been putting out meat in this form about three and one-half years. There are some of the other packers that have started doing this and there probably will be others that will get into it in the near future. Now this freezing we shouldn't think of as meaning that the meat is an inferior product. A frozen product or storage product is just as good as any other product if It is put in in that condition. It comes out in just about the condition that it goes In. Formerly we put products in storage if we couldn't sell them fresh and that is what gave frozen products the bad reputation. Now if you put this in the freezer in a good condition it will come out in good con - dition. Freezing is the best preservative that is known. </seg>
            <seg id="p680">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This process that we are using here is different, from the one which you probably are familiar with in that it is done very quickly and at a very low temperature. It is done so quickly that the meat fibers and the juices aren't allowed to spread out from the water. You preserve the flavor and palatability in this method of freezing that you can't preserve in that old slower method of freezing, because, it is done so slowly that the fibers spread out from the water in the meat juices and you have a piece of meat that many times tastes like a piece of wood. It forms smaller sized crystals compared to the slower method of freezing. The large sized crystals formed in the slower method of freezing puncture these meat fibers and when the meat thaws the Juices run out. We are packaging all kinds of fresh meats at the present time. I have here some few samples. We are selling over 100 different items of this sort now. I have here some calf liver, and some pork tenderloin. These are put up in that same form. Here is a leg of lamb. I think Mr. Loeffel will show you this method of cutting in which the shank is removed and the meat put in. In that way we reduce the size of the leg of lamb to fit more nearly the average family. Here are spare ribs, pork chops. This is a pork chop that is trimmed and is just about as nice looking product as you will find. Here is a veal steak; there is a lamb steak, and here are hamburger meats. We have tried to put this meat up in the handiest possible way. Here is a standing rib of beef. I think you would like to see the grade of that meat later. I hope you will ask me questions that come to you as we go along. Someone has asked whether the meat should be put on to cook when frozen. It should be put in just as it is. I will tell you more about that later. I brought this piece of dry ice to show you. It is 110 degrees below zero and must never be handled without gloves. The slightest touch with the bare hand will cause a blister to form. We used it in the beginning in shipping this meat. We do without it now, how - ever. It is carbon dioxide compressed under 1000 pounds per square Inch. ; • I ' am going to try to tell you some of the advantages of this method of packaging meat from the standpoint of the producer. I think we can count upon the attractiveness. It seems to me that it is hard to find a package of meat that is any more attractive than that. , Now that is just as attractive as a box of candy or any other product that has an attractive wrapper. Now that certainly will have an appeal to the housewife and will result in her buying more meat, which ' we as packers and you as producers want. We are putting up three grades of this meat. We have the red and blue, which is the top grade. We have the red label, which is second grade. We have a green label which is called clover prairie. You are getting the top 25 grades put up this way — what we normally call good. </seg>
            <seg id="p681">• NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION choice, and prime. We are putting up one-fourth of the animals mar - keted packaged in this way. Then there is the handiness of it. Here is a leg of lamb cut down to the proper size. Here are pork chops put up just the way you want them. Here are lamb chops — three cut just the proper thickness that the average consumer wants. We are putting these pork chops up cut thicker and two chops to the package. That has an advantage. Then we are putting them up in a handy package for hotels and restaurants. We are putting these into drums of 60 pounds and in 10 and 5-pound barrels. That way it serves the purpose for hotelB, restaurants, clubs, dining cars, etc. That is quite an advantage in moving the greater amount of the product — the handiness of the package. , Now another big advantage is the meeting of a specific demand. We have different cities that are chop cities or roast cities and certain shops in the big cities that sell only steaks or chops, others that sell only roasts. They have to buy a cut that contains both roasts and chops in order to meet their demand. By this new method the retailer can buy a carton of so many steaks and get just what he wants, or he can buy a carton of rib roasts. He does not have to sacrifice any other part of the carcass. Then we do not have to pay the freight, which we charge back to you. Why should we pay freight on a lot of meat to Boston that isn't wanted and which might be wanted down in Philadelphia? Another advantage — the retailer knows the cost. When he is cutting meat he has to figure if he gets so much out of the chops, how much he will have to get from the steaks, etc. This way he knows his cost; he knows his cost of doing business; he can add these two and know how he can sell his meat to realize some return. Then the matter of uniform Quality. We find that lots of times a housewife goes in and buys some meat this week. She goes in the next week and buys again and gets a piece that is less tender than what she had the week before. She gets disgusted and then she •does not buy any meat for a week or ten days. That hurts us. If we can guarantee her a uniform quality she is going to buy meat right along and we believe that in this way we can guarantee the quality better than in the other way of merchandising. As an example, here is a standard rib roast. There are times of the year when at the Chicago market less than one-half of one per cent of the cattle that come to market will make that grade. The same is true of the lamb. There are times when we could cut prime cuts out of more than, one-half of one per cent of the lambs that come to market. That is how much we are guarding the quality of this patented product. A packer is going to protect the brand where he wouldn't an un - branded product. That is an advantage. </seg>
            <seg id="p682">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE . ■ Then — the advertising value. I think when we get this better established than we have now. and we run into periods of lower prices we can go out and advertise in the daily papers and on the billboards and say "Buy Swift's Premium Beef — It's Cheap Now. Buy Swift's Branded Lamb." We will do that — we will spend money to advertise our own brand. We do not like to spend money advertising just beef or lamb. There is an advantage, it seems to me, to you and to us in being able to advertise a branded product, which we will never do to any extent as long as we have to advertise just beef or lamb or pork, or even the government grades of these products. We do not wish to spend money to do that because every competitor would get the same advantage and might not spend any money advertising. There is this advantage. We think freezing makes the meat more tender. Our chemists tell us it can't be, yet when we cut a piece out of this steak that has been frozen and cut another off of one that has not been frozen and we know which is which but they don't, in every instance they have said that the frozen was more tender. Then there is. the advantage in economy. Trimming wastes — when we size up these lamb cuts we have 15 per cent that is trim - mings. In the country shops this is thrown away. If we can process this in the packing plant and put it up as lamb stew, it is worth 6 to 8 cents per pound to you, where it is worth out in that shop one - fourth cent per pound or is thrown away. So there is an advantage to you there in using 15 per cent inore of the lamb carcass and 18 per cent of the beef carcass. There is an economy in preparing. We can take two men and a machine and put up 75,000 pounds of pork sausage in a day. That certainly is a big advantage. While we are talking unemployment, still I don't believe we should let unemployment stand in the way of progress. That is all the advantages I have. We now come to some of the problems we have to overcome. There is one — the Public Relations problem. I would rather not discuss this publicly. We had been shipping this meat by dry ice. We are now shipping this product without dry ice up to 1000 miles and holding It In a good firm con - dition. This is necessary. This piece of meat is just as good as if it were frozen, but it does not look attractive. These display cases have overcome that. The retailers are able to buy cases at very reasonable figures. Then home refrigerators have come along and they are putting in larger places where this meat can be kept frozen and, of course, that is helping out. We have a plan to start packaging by price — that we hope to do later. That is, we want to put up a package of lamb chops and other cuts in such a way that the house - wife can go in and pay a certain price for them any time. That is an advantage because when the price goes up on a product they </seg>
            <seg id="p683">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION react and do not buy. If we can hold a steady price on this over a long period and sell it at a price per package and not at a price per pound, I believe that would be an advantage. One reason we have to do that — you can see how this rib roast has been trimmed. We have to get a higher price per pound for that trimmed in that way than if it were cut right ofT in the shop and weighed and then trimmed. You can take maybe 15 cents per pound more in that way and your price will be no more. But the housewife who is offered two pieces of meat of corresponding quality and grade, one at 20 cents and the other at 30 cents, will buy the 20-cent piece. This Is a problem we must overcome. There is no necessity of thawing that meat before it is cooked. If it thaws out it is all right, but it shouldn't be thawed. You have got to educate the people to not thaw this meat out. Above every - thing else, do not put it in water to thaw it out. That is all I have on this unless there are some questions. Question: How far is this available to the consumer? Answer: It has gone slowly. We can't push it as we would like to because of the Public Relations matter,, but there are five A. &amp; P. stores in Chicago handling it. Some of the smaller towns are taking it because they have never been able to get meat of good quality. The small town meat retailer can buy one or two of these packages each week and have all he needs. MR. ALEXANDER: We have Mr. Simpson on our program to - morrow for a talk on soft pork. Owing to another engagement it will be Impossible for him to stay so we have asked him to give us the soft pork talk at this time. SOFT PORK PROM THE MARKET STANDPOINT By F. M. SIMPSON, Swift &amp; Co. Soft pork has been known in the southern livestock market for many years. Its entrance into northern markets is comparatively recent. Southern soft pork, for the most part, has some merits in the way of a' very appealing flavor. Northern soft pork, insofar as we know at the present time, is without merits. I am coming to you as a "jack-knife" scientist and not a bona fide one. This explanation is made because some of the statements that will be made have not been proven scientifically and others cannot be easily proven. It is our hope to raise questions in your mind and provoke thought. In general, we are going to give you a </seg>
            <seg id="p684">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE statement of our experience in the packing business and our beliefs regarding soft pork in the Corn Belt. Some years ago our operating' men and salesmen noted an in - crease in the amount of soft pork at Corn Belt plants. The sales - men, of course, noted this from the standpoint of dissatisfaction on the part of the retailer. The operating men noticed it from the standpoint of an Increase in the amount of pork products that were too soft to meet the requirements of our Premium products. Three years ago we started keeping records of the amount of soft, semi-oily, and oily hogs slaughtered in Corn Belt packing plants. In these records we eliminated softness due to lack of finish. In this con - nection, a distinction' should be made between immaturity and lack of finish. These records show at some plants a very large increase in the amount of soft pork. We believe this is due in great part — we do not know how much — to soybeans. The reasons for this belief are: 1. Experimental proof that soybeans make soft pork. 2: Concurrently with the large increase in the soybean acreages in the Corn Belt states there has been an increase of soft pork at some of our Corn Belt plants. 3; Our Chicago plant shows an increase in soft pork in three years of more than six times. Further, in the two months in which we would expect the largest receipts of soybean hogs the percentage of soft pork at our Chicago plant fias Increased from less than one-half of one per cent to more than ten per cent. Contrasted with this we have practically no in - crease in the amount of soft hogs received at our Omaha, Nebraska, plant. A comparison of the results at the two plants is significant from a soybean standpoint when it is realized that the states of Illinois and Indiana have approximately one-third of the soybean acreage of the United States, while Nebraska and the territory from which [the Omaha plant receives its hogs does not have even 1,000 acres of soybeans. We realize that the foregoing is very incriminating for soybeans and we also realize that the soft pork that we are receiving at our plants! has not been due entirely to soybeans. It is our feeling that - likely ipart of the soft pork is due to the influence of the big type hog which came into the hog world in about 1915. It is possible that this hog has produced a type which matures at weights consid - erably: above the present market weights of 220 to 240. In view of this we feel that the agricultural colleges could do a fine piece of work in forwarding the "Registry of Merit" system of proving out hogs that is now being followed by several states. In conclusion I want to say that the purpose in giving you the foregoing was because we as meat packers are very much concerned </seg>
            <seg id="p685">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION over the increase in soft pork in the Corn Belt states. We are not set on the reasons for it and we hope that the colleges can do some - thing to seek out and fix the blame and then do something to help avoid the present menace that we see. MR. ALEXANDER: Mr. Loellel will now give us a Iamb-cutting demonstration — Lamb at Its Best. Mr. Loeffel gave a very interesting and instructive demonstra - tion on lamb-cutting. Tuesday, January 5, Afternoon Session HOUSES — HORSES — HOUSES* By WAYNE DINSMORE Secretary of the Horse Association of America, Before the Nebraska Livestock Breeders and Feeders Association. I have long since ceased to advise anybody regarding what they should -or should not do. It is wasted energy. All that any of us can undertake to do is to put the essential facts respecting the horse and mule situation before horse breeders and farmers and then let them act on their own judgment. If they do not act wisely, they are the ones who must pay the penalty in money lost, or in higher prices paid for replacements they might have raised. Exhaustive surveys by the Horse Association of America during the past ten years have established that the average life of horses is fifteen years; of mules eighteen years. In other words, where breeding has gone along at a normal rate one-fifteenth of the horses and one-eighteenth of the mules can be expected to pass away each jear. ., ■ , Horse breeding reached its low point in 1928 and the number of foals dropped has increased gradually since that time. Most of the de - crease in the total number of animals on farms between 1920 and 1930 was in animals under four years of age. The actual decrease in horses and mules on farms as shown by the census was from 25,199,552 in 1920 to 18,737,524 in 1930, or a decrease of 6,462,028. In 1920 we had five and one-half million horses under four years of age, in 1930 we had less than two million of that age; and where In 1920 we had one and one-half million mules under four years of age, in 1930 we had less than one-half a million. Consequently, * Horses — for the purpose of this address — also will Include mules. </seg>
            <seg id="p686">I REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I of the total decrease of 6,462,028, more than four and one-half mil - lion was in animals under four years of age, April 1, 1930. Nebraska had, at the census April 1, 1930 — 747,338 horses of which approximately 86,000 were under and 661,000 were over four years of age. She also had 98,973 mules, of which about 15,000 were under and 84,000 over four years of age. . The estimates of the United States Department of Agriculture for January 1, 1932, will not be out till about January 25th, but it is a fairly safe guess that the figures when released will show about 730,000 horses and about 90,000 mules, of which approxi - mately 110,000 horses and 16,000 mules will be under four years old January 1, 1932; but nearly half of these will be rising three or four years old in the spring of 1932, hence old enough to work — and in the case of the horses, old enough for reproduction. This means, therefore, that you now have available about 685,000 horses and 82,000 mules old enough to work on farms, and about 340,000 mares old enough to breed. Nebraska needs for replacement purposes — to keep her present total from declining — about 50,000 horse colts and 5,000 mule colts, surviving to January 1st following foaling. The state has 340,000 mares rising three or over next spring, from which to produce the 55,000 colts needed. ' ■ Even if we were to discard 140,000 of these mares as being too old, or small, or unsound, or Incapable of reproduction we would still have 200,000 selected mares left for breeding, and all of you who are practical horsemen know that if Nebraska bred 200,000 selected mares, you would raise around 100,000 colts, surviving Jan - uary 1st following, or nearly double the number needed for replace - ments. But some say, there are not enough sires. There Is no way of determining how many stallions and jacks there are in the state; but a stallion or jack that cannot sire 40 colts that survive to January 1st following is not much good, and on this basis it would take 1,250 stallions and 125 jacks to sire all the replacements needed. As you have 93 counties this would mean about 14 stallions per county or 2 jacks' to each 3 counties. It would necessitate the existence of only 1 stallion for each 272 mares of breeding age, and I have no question but that there are enough stallions and jacks in the state to sire the needed replacements. It will be admitted that many of them are not as good as they should be, and they may not be as well distributed as we would like, but there are enough In number to beget all the colts Nebraska will need. The states east of Nebraska are not producing enough for their own needs. </seg>
            <seg id="p687">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Many States Must Buy Iowa exported to other states 4,103 horses and 233 mules in 1930, but shipped in. 10, 337 horses and 480 mules, actually importing more than she exported. Michigan imported 10,539 horses during the fiscal year 1929-1930 and 9,408 horses during the calendar year 1930. In 1931, up to December 9th, she Imported 9,102 horses. Exports, same years, were negligible. Wisconsin imported from other states 25,635 horses in 1929 and approximately 24,000 in 1930. Figures for the shipment of horses into Illinois, Indiana, and states east are not available at present, but the figures for Michigan, and Wisconsin will serve to show how extensive are the purchases of horses by farmers in states that do not produce enough for their own use. The United States is short three and one-half million young horses and one million young mules, as compared with 1920; and by this, I mean animals under four years of age. A lot of farmers appear to have had the idea that horses and mules of working age would just appear from "Somewhere West" when needed; but this is a fallacious idea for the eleven most westerly states — Montana, Wyom - ing, Colorado, New Mexico, and states west thereof — had only about two million horses and one-tenth as many mules at the census of 1930 — less now. This explains why prices have been rising during the past three seasons and why good young horses have been selling substantially higher this year in spite of the fact that all other farm commodities have gone down. It is a striking illustration of the operation of the law of supply and demand. Horses and mules have had no stabilization committees, no Federal Farm Board support, no cooperative selling agencies, and no government aid of any kind. They have had the vigorous support of horse breeders and men in allied Industries whose business depends upon horse and mule use. This support has been given through the Horse Association of America, created to combat the hostile and misleading propaganda put out by manufacturers whose interests would be served by a discontinuance of the use of horses and mules. The Horse Association of America from the outset urged com - plete discontinuance in the breeding of small, inferior, and unsound horses, an increase in the number of animals used per man through more efficient methods of hitching, and a reduction in the cost or producing good work horses and mules through larger use of pas - tures, cheap forage, moderate use of grain and the elimination of expensive stables and shelter equipment; for horses are essentially outdoor animals and will remain vigorous and healthy if allowed to run out the year around with access to very simple shelter. An open straw shed on a well drained hillside, with exposure to the south, </seg>
            <seg id="p688">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is better than a $20,000 stable, if the outdoor animals have ample range . of pasture and plenty of good forage. Pastures Produce Horses Cheaply The present low prices for- grain will probably improve gradually but there is no reason to believe that they will be high for many years to come. So long as wheat remains under ninety cents a bushel, corn, barley, rye, and oats will remain comparatively low in price. All this will bring an increase in grasslands. Much experimental work has been done on pasture within the past ten years. It has been found that by a wise selection of grasses best suited to a particular community, and fertilization of land with lime, phosphates and nitrates where needed, and by regular rotation of stock on pasture, it is possible to get from three to four times as much feed from pasture, as under the old system of letting the pasture take care of itself. The use of temporary pastures such as rye, barley, sweet clover, soybeans, and Sudan grass for late fall and for mid-summer pasture, is also increasing very greatly the amount of stock that can be carried on a given acreage of land. A; mixture of Sudan grass and soybeans for Instance, will carry three animals per acre during July, August and the first half of September, thereby relieving permanent pastures at a time when they most need relief because of dry weather. Inferior Horses Bad Investment No one should raise more than he needs for replacement pur - poses and small inferior, unsound animals should not be raised at all, for they will certainly lose money for everybody who has any - thing to do with them. Trash is not wanted now nor will it be wanted in the future. The men who always have bad luck with their young horses and mules had better stay out of the game for they are not adapted to the production of good animals. As horsemen or mule producers they are veritable cobblers— Incompetents, who because of lack of judgment, observation, and good horse sense, will not succeed as producers of horses and mules. There is a decided shortage of good young stallions in Nebraska. This can and will be overcome gradually either through the purchase of good mature stallions by groups of farmers on the stallion fee plan, or by the purchase of two-year-olds by individual farmers who will buy such two-year-olds for a moderate price ($200 to $500 per head )and also will put these two-year-olds into work, using them on their own mares, breeding a few outside mares, but without making any effort to engage in business as a reguar stallloneer. The latter will be the plan most generally used from now on as thousands of farmers are beginning to realize that a stallion makes </seg>
            <seg id="p689">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION a good work animal; for he is more vigorous, more docile when worked regularly, and he is a better - animal individually and as a sire, if he is kept in harness every day and used in a team when one is needed on any job around the farm. That this is a sound practice is well attested by the fact that the Percheron stallion which won the grand championship at the 1930 International Livestock Exposition was worked steadily as a two-year-old and a three-year-old until about four months before the show, when he. was taken up and fitted for the show. He was broken and worked by ordinary farm hands on the farm of Dean C. P. Curtiss, Ames, Iowa, who bred and raised the colt in question. There is nothing difficult or mysterious about breaking and work - ing stallions. It is just as easy to break and work them as any other horses if they are taken in hand when they are two-year-olds. There are thousands of corn belt farmers who will do this during the next two or three years in order to have a good sire available for their own farms. No up-to-date farmer would think of being without a good boar or good bull and it will only be a matter of time until farms having eight or more work animals will count a stallion as a part of their regular livestock equipment. Wednesday, January 6, Morning Session RUSSIA AND THE FIVE-YEAR 1'IiAX IRVING McKINLEY One thing that would compare quite favorably to Russia the last couple of days is the weather. Where I was located we had weather like this from the middle of December until the middle of March. Last December I bought these mittens in Russia. I paid 18 rubels for them— that is about $9.00 in United States money. I came down on highway 77 yesterday. I was thinking about how it would be traveling that way with a Ford in Russia. There are no roads in Russia. I .used to have to go about eight miles in my work. I had a horse about seven years old that I had to depend upon to get me where I wanted to go. He could go that eight miles in about 45 minutes. I was "in Russia about a year. I landed on my farm about the middle of September, 1930. My farm contained 9200 acres with four sets of buildings. The main buildings were a farm estate formerly owned by a duke. The main structure was a very beautiful building but had run down since 1917 until it was almost unrecognizable as the home of some duke. This farm was in the Leningrad district. </seg>
            <seg id="p690">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It has been called St. Petersburg and Leningrad. Like my interpreter said, she had been in St. Petersburg and in Leningrad but she hadn't moved at all. I jwas placed in charge of the hog raising on this farm. It was a swine farm but it had 300 head of cattle. To be sure, put in charge there means you are responsible for everything, even the death losses. You have to say why each pig died. The secret police come out and check up whenever there is a death and someone has to be responsible. Over there the police take charge of everything. There were 350 sows on that farm when I went there, with a farrowing barn containing 23 pens. They claimed they would have room for 500 pigs by the first of November. I told them if they got the build - ings finished we should be able to keep 500 sows there during the winter. Well, the first of October some material came but the build - ings did not get finished. The order came out for winter farrowing. January and February came. They said they would have the building and have it satisfactory. A year ago now I had 50 sows and litters with 25 pens. By the time spring came we figured our loss and it averaged 85 per cent, up to two months of age. They didn't get the buildings done and we had no place for the sows and litters. The secret : police took charge and discharged some of the farm directors. When we asked what they had to feed they said rye bran. This is very high in fiber content and is extremely unpalatable. They had pressed flax seed and some sunflowers. All the oil was pressed out and the .feed was just a slab. You have to grind it up and feed It. I said, "Didn't you raise any crop here this year?" They said "Yes, but we have to turn this into the center for distribution." The government owns everything. The crops are turned in and dis - tributed from the center by the government. You order feed and supplies from the center in Moscow. We put in an order for a three - months' supply of feed for these 500 sows. That didn't come for very long. We got some in the spring. We had the sows but didn't have the feed and didn't have the buildings. That brings up this plan. In December they make out what they call a commercial financial plan. - That is a part of the five-year plan. This requires each farm to make out a plan. This is called the com - mercial financial plan, by which they will work the next year. The five-year plan said we had to have so many sows In 1931. We had to work this into that commercial financial plan. We had to make out a plan of just how much feed we would need in January, how much in February, how many sows would farrow in' January, how many In February. They have farrowings every month in the year. That way they have more economical use of the buildings, they say. They didn't take into account the advantage possessed by nature for summer farrowing. By. requiring this plan they have everything on paper. </seg>
            <seg id="p691">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION It came March — so many hogs, no feed for them. The plan failed there. That Is the way the whole plan Is. It is just a theoreti - cal plan on paper. In 1917 everything in Russia was destroyed. They had nothing left but their man power. The Bolshevik element controlled. They had a meeting, and decided how they would run the country. They lasted until 1923. That was about seven years of civil war. Prom 1923 to 1928 they had another period where they tried to build up a few things. In 1928 some communistic leaders had a meeting to draw up a live-year plan to make Russia one of the most commercial nations on the earth. It is a theoretical proposition put down on paper what Russia .will be in 1933. Their slogan now is to finish the five-year plan in four years. It is the first time any country ever started from scratch to build up what Russia is today. The first question asked me when I got back was "What about their five-year plan. Will it succeed?" It won't succeed 100 per cent because they figure everything 100 per cent. They don't figure on any back turns in the factories. They figure on ten pigs per year in two farrowlngs. That is a good average for good hogs. We had 150 purebred sows with foundation stock brought in from England. The boar that they had Imported in 1925 was still alive when I got there, but he went bad and we made sausage out of him. We had four sows that had been imported in 1925 and some imported in 1928. They use the large Yorkshire from England. They imported 10,000 hogs from Astonia. If this plan should fail it is no sign that Russia will fail. Lots of plans fail in this country and the country still keeps going on. It doesn't seem as if the plan could succeed where you have 80 per cent loss of pigs and the plan is figured on ten pigs per sow. How would this plan affect the United States? What will this plan mean in the business of this country? Russia is dumping her products on the world market. Dumping, as given by some great economists, means selling products on a foreign market for less than they will bring on the domestic market and products that are not needed on the domestic market. But Russia is selling products needed at home. She will sell her products abroad. She is trying to capture the English bacon market. There is a packing plant in Leningrad where 75 per cent of the meat butchered in that plant is exported. You say what does the Russian eat? Well, he doesn't eat much meat for one thing. We ate all hogs that were sick on the farm. Hogs never die in Russia after they are two months old — if they see that one is sick they will kill it before it has time to die. I had a talk with a man in that plant who had worked in our plants for three years. I learned that 60 per cent of the sausage made there had to be horse meat. You could export that. Well, it was good meat as far as that goes. </seg>
            <seg id="p692">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Did you have milk? I had about 300 cows on the tann where I was located. They had lots of milk and lots of butter. When 1 left in August the average allowance per person per month was fUieen quarts. Last winter it was down to eight quarts per month. We ordered some feed for the hogs — bran and flax. The Russians said, "We have milk. We fatten our sows on that." I said, "That's a waste of feed in our country. Can't you get a separator and feed skimmed milk?" That did get a separator but the rubber didn't come for the bowl and we had to wait two months for that. That is the way the plan goes. We finally got it and separated some milk. I went back there another time and they had started feeding whole milk again. .About that time we discovered the pigs began to get scours, etc. The veterinarian told them that the reaction of the skimmed milk and sow's milk caused the disturbance. " So we had to use one of the high-up authorities on hogs and quit feeding skimmed milk and feed whole milk. We were exporting a halt ton of butter per day this spring, while the people on the farm had to go without butter. The average normal allowance of butter per person per year is two pounds. Russia has exported for the last three years 30,000 tons of butter per year. An engineer told me that he paid 25 cents per pound for Russian butter in Poland. It cost us 85 cents per pound in Russia. They are selling products abroad that are needed at home. The people have quite poor living conditions. They are duty bound to turn in everything they raise on the farm. The government redistributes it. There are two classes of farms — what they call the collective and the state farms. I was on a state farm. On these the govern - ment owns and hires the labor. The other is the collective type of farm, j The people go together of their own free will and work together as one big family and in the fall after the crop is harvested they turn that into the government for redistribution. In the Lenin - grad district 50 per cent of the farms were state farms. Last year some of the private farmers were taxed 75 eggs per hen. Lots of these hens didn't lay over 50 eggs. They were taxed 25 bushels to the acre for rye. In a good season rye won't yield over 25 bushels. On these state farms people asked me about comparing wages. It Is impossible to compare wages. In Russia they don't pay wages — they! pay in store credit, taxes, insurance, and things like that. You say why pay insurance and taxes? Everybody is taxed on his barley. After all these things are deducted they do not have much left. They wouldn't get any pay anyway. They work for the govern - ment so many hours a day, etc. The government says they work for so much money. The government gives them so much food and clothing for them to exist on. Everything comes out even — if they raise wages they raise living costs. ' </seg>
            <seg id="p693">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The average living space per person on that farm where I was is about ten square feet. We were very crowded there. We had seventeen young people in one room at once. That was their home. They work for the government at so much wages, so much food is allowed them. They just come out even each month. If they had anything left they, of course, could buy something. The people there can't go from one job to another. They are not a free kind of people. They can't quit a job and go to another like we can in this country. If you didn't do what these people wanted you to, they will take your job away from you. There is a communist at the head of each of these farms. If you lose a job in Russia it is lost for six months. You can't buy anything because in Russia you have a food card which allows you so much food and clothing per month. You have to show this when you want to buy something. When you lose your job you lose your food card. It is just a matter of starving to death or just existing. It is just about like convict labor in an ordinary country. To think of Russia you can't think of it as a failure. In 1928 when this five-year plan was made up these communists said, "We are going to make Russia the foremost industrial country in live years." That was promising the people something. They have taken these promises. They are ■ paid In hope for the future. They are hoping for. big things after the five years are up. As long as these people take hope instead of butter and meat and good living, probably everything will go all right. When they quit that, things will happen. Russia has a big excuse for Belling these things, abroad. They have to have machinery, they have to buy tractors, and they have to pay us in gold. Their money Is no good. Russian money has no exchange value. Their reason for exporting Is to get money to pay for these machines. They say a rubel is worth 50 cents but you can buy them for less than that. You can't take them out of the country, for their money is no good any other place. They have to dump to get gold. They are producing very cheaply — It is really unbelievable. The people are living in hope that after these live years things will be much better. People are now suffering quite a bit for good living conditions and are living In hope for the future. As far as comparing conditions in this country and in that country, there is no comparison. An unemployed person here lives better than an employed one in that country. They are simply living in hope that things will be better when this five-year plan ends. DR. DERRICK: After all the United States isn't a very bad place to live. Just this morning I had a surprise. In talking to Mr. McKlnley the question came up, "How many of the boys are still In Russia?" He said none had come home since he did. This morn- </seg>
            <seg id="p694">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ing as I stepped into the ollice, here was one of those boys supposed to be 'in Russia. I am going to call on Bud Stenger for a few words. ALFRED STE.NGER: I was located down in the Volga valley on a 1000-acre state farm. On this farm we had about. fifty tractors and we were milking about 800 cows. When 1 came there we had about 300 sows. They laid their plans on the table- and said we were to raise 100,00(1 pi-gs a year here. When I was employed there the man with whom I worked suggested that I go to a farm nearby and see how things were done there. We drove over — it was in the winter time — and arrived about dinner time. We had meat cutlets. After dinner we went out to inspect the farms. There were many pigs freezing to death. I came on to a group of little pigs about eight or ten days old that were frozen. One member stopped and said, "Are these pigs good to eat?" I said "No." He said. "Well, you had some for dinner." I have eaten horse meat and no meat. I do not believe any American will say that he was ■ mistreated because it was the wish of the government. They make an attempt to make you comfortable in their own way. If you are mistreated it is because of their ignorance. It is easy for two nations so widely separated, not only in distance but in fundamental history, to mis - understand each other. Russia has stood still for 300 years while other nations have advanced. There has been a great deal of unfavorable publicity on Russia. I could go on for 20 or 30 minutes and tell you of personal hardships I have seen in Russia. I will try to tell, you a few things that are favorable to Russia. Russia has socialized medicine. It used to be if a person should break his leg he would have to travel 300 miles to a doctor. Then they educated their students, and clinics were set out. The work Is done free of charge. They only require, that the patient to receive the work is employed. Those not employed In productive work are not entitled to this. I had my teeth filled and cleaned in Russia. The only charge was 10 or 15 cents. I appreciated that very much. There is one law in Russia that is very good. That is the law against tipping. I was fortunate enough to see a man arrested for accepting a tip and he was hurried off to jail. I got a great kick out of that. Every American, I think, is more or less interested in the mar - riage laws. In Russia it is simply a system of registration. They just register and are- married. If either one should decide he is married long enough, one of them will go and have his name stricken from the register and he is free again. If there are any children the husband is made to take care of them. My assistant had been married six times and he was 29 years old. </seg>
            <seg id="p695">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Another thing difficult for Americans to understand is bathing In the nude. The people bathe together — men and women. There is a different attitude toward sex over there. There is not that curiosity between the two sexes as we have it in America. Keally it is a step in advance perhaps. Their attitude should not be criti - cised. At least I had no personal objections to it. The best description of Kussia is to describe it as a huge cor - poration. It covers one-sixth of the globe and employs 160 million people. Naturally, such an organization is apt to have graft in its rank. The penalty for graft is death. Well, it is very effective. The result is there is not much graft. There are no traveling salesmen. The largest private enterprise is a bootblack on the corner with his box of rags. Every American who goes to Russia is asked innumerable ques - tions. Some of these are rather embarrassing. A liussian came to me and said. "Comrade, is it true that in some parts of America they forbid the teaching of evolution, and is it true that they lynch negroes in America, the most enlightened nation of the world?" They asked me many questions like that which I hated very much to admit of our country. We often overlook our own shortcomings in criticising other countries. If these things can happen in enlightened America, things are bound to happen in- Russia where there is such gross ignorance. It is a nation of harassed men. Naturally there is little interest. To stimulate this they organize street brigades. They go to work marching and singing. They go where the work is lagging. They organize the old people, young people, women and children and go singing to work. That is the way a great deal of work is accom - plished in Russia. There is a fear of responsibility in Russia that is really very tragic. A Russian was in charge of a state farm near where I was located. He was a very good Russian. He lost about 5(10 hogs in June from cholera. Immediately the secret service hunted him up and charged him with counter revolutionary movement. Because of the ignorance this man was sentenced to six years in Siberia. It is a. result of ignorance entirely. A friend of mine came to me in Russia with a caracul mackinaw. He wanted to sell it to me. I couldn't understand why he wanted to do this. Finally he told me that it made him look like a capitalist and it is bad to look like a capitalist. Eating in Russia is still a necessity. I managed to buy a few eggs for 15 cents apiece. When winter came they refused to accept rubels for eggs. Finally I managed to trade an old peasant woman an old pair of pants for ten eggs. Clothing is very difficult to get. They will do most anything to get sufficient clothing to carry them through the winter. </seg>
            <seg id="p696">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It Is a custom when traveling in Russia to, when you get cold, stop for a glass of tea. One day we happened to stop at a house where there was an old lady and her two daughters. The two daugh - ters were running spinning wheels. I noticed that the foot which ran the wheel was bare. I mentioned it and the old lady said if I had to work as hard to get a pair of socks I would be more careful how I wore them. Russia cannot complete her plan 100 per cent. If she completes it 50 per cent it will be a great thing for the Russian people. MR. DERRICK: I really feel that we have had a pretty good introduction to Russia this morning. These two fellows have given us different sides of the country and I know we have all enjoyed their talks very much. Mr. Hildebrand, president of the Nebraska Breeders and Feeders, will take charge of the program from now on. MR. HILDEBRAND: I am sure it is a pleasure, even under adverse road conditions, to be here today. To me the most interesting part of the talk on Russia is the fact that Russia will not succeed. Let's hope at least that these boys who went over there gave them some bad lessons and that they do not succeed in their undertaking of being able to supply the world with all the food products needed. The next speaker on the program is a man who has a timely problem on his hands because I know. that Iowa and Nebraska have lots of mortgages to lift. It is my pleasure at this time to introduce Mr. E. Z. Russell of Washington, D. C. THE MORTGAGE LIFTER E. Z. RUSSELL, Washington, D. C. I agree with you that you have given me a job. If the hogs won't lift the mortgage off your farm, what is going to? I want to assure you that it is a real pleasure to get back to this good old country and exchange experiences with Nebraska farmers. I have a feeling of pride that I was a Nebraska farmer for some little time. Since I have moved away from here I have been privileged to travel over the country a good deal and I think the more I travel the more I am convinced that we are living in a good country. I feel that there are mighty few of us on the farm who are qualified sufficiently to make a success of any one of our various activities to the exclusion of all others — to be a hog man in the live - stock business and raise only hogs, or to be a wheat farmer and raise only wheat, or in the South to be a cotton farmer and raise </seg>
            <seg id="p697">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION nothing but cotton. I feel this way, that the success of our farming activities Is going to come to the largest extent by diversifying, not only our grain production but our livestock production, and I believe the farmer who is going to succeed is going to give a little study to this matter. He has to consult first his personal likes and dislikes. It's pretty hard for a fellow to go out and milk cows when he doesn't like t.o. Now that kind of fellow shouldn't make a dairyman out or himself. Maybe he should be a sheep man or a hog man. I think we should find out first what we can do best and when we do find that just kind of stick to It. I am not one of the fellows who can tell you when the time comes to breed our females for future sows or what we are going to get for our efforts when when we put them on the market. Hogs are one of the quickest turnovers, along with sheep. We breed our sows this fall and in about a year the pigs are on the market. Who knows what the price will be? It seems to me that our best success will comp If we get some plan of livestock production that will satisfy our own personal desires and fit into our crop production and, as near as possible, make our livestock and crop production come together. We can't do it alto - gether, but we can to a certain extent. I believe when we get to some good sensible level of production we are going to succeed best if we just sort of stick to it year in and year out, regardless of what the price of the top animal may be at the time we are mating our animals. The producer hasn't very much to say about what he gets tor what he produces. But he can at least have something to say about 'the cost of production and putting this down, this cost of pro - duction, is going to solve to a certain extent his problems. I am going to take a little time to talk about some plans in the hog busi - ness that may save a little money in the cost of producing them. In our work with the government we fortunately have access to a considerable amount of data. I have some figures taken from ten years' work in different parts of the country. We have one station in Montana and some in other states where we are producing hogs and we have the. data from that production so I believe the figures we have are fairly average. Some of you may think that because the government is running these farms we have superior everything. Well, we haven't. We have mighty inferior equipment in some respects. I believe that the results we get In our productive work are fairly comparable to our managed farms and I am just going to take your time for just a little bit to give you some of the figures in production which we got. In the first place, how many sows farrow litters according to the number that are bred? Well, in ten years at this station we have bred 21,096 sows. Seventy-six per cent of them farrowed litters. Just think, 24 per cent never farrowed. There were a few aborters, a few sterile sows — I do not know what else. </seg>
            <seg id="p698">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE Now we have one factor in this that I am very sorry to say I have no suggestions how to improve. That is the per cent of pigs farrowed dead. Seven and .81 per cent of all pigs farrowed are dead at farrowing time. Now during that time the number of live pigs farrowed per sow farrowing was eight. That is not very big. We have about seven or eight different breeds represented in the terri - tory covered. We figured only six pigs per sow to the number of sows that wefe bred. We have weaned at approximately 70 days of age, during that time, 5.7 pigs per sow farrowed. That doesn't look very big, but it is facts just the same. • We have weaned 70.72 per cent of the pigs that are farrowed nlive at approximately 70 days of age — 70.7.2 per cent, not quite 71, of the pigs farrowed alive were weaned at about 70 days of age. I took the time to split this ten years into two five-year periods. It was very interesting to me, naturally, to see that in each case but one these stations have made some progress. The second five years we made a little bit of progress in getting a larger percentage of the sows farrowing to the number bred. We got a larger number of pigs farrowed and all the way down the line except in pigs farrowed dead. That checked exactly in the two five-year periods. There has been a question in my mind, which gain the fastest in the feed lot, barrows or sows? Well, the only thing I had on that was the average daily gain. The barrows gained 5.43 per cent faster than the sows in all this time about which I am telling you. There is one item that is mighty interesting to us all, and really the outcome of this is rather odd. What -does it cost in terms of pounds of feed to bring a live pig to weaning time? Well, I got some figures. It cost us in pounds of feed 153.88 pounds of feed during the gesta - tion period and it took 153.77 pounds of feed during the suckling period. Rather odd, isn't it? Of course, the gestation period is longer than the suckling period. I am going to tell you how we handle these sows during gesta - tion. I realize very fully that the labor problem with you. folks isn't what it was at one time and some experiments we have carried on have been along the line of conserving not only on feed but also labor. You know some of us don't like to work as well as our grandfathers used to. We carried on quite a little bit of experimental work in connection with handling the brood sow during gestation and we just handled them something like this. We do not separate the young and old sows at all. We put them all In the same pasture. Our maximum area for handling our brood sows during the gestation period is fifteen acres and we have handled as many as eighty sows in that lot. We feed 1% per cent ration of corn.- Our sows usually average about 400 pounds and they get six pounds of corn per day. After a sow Is bred she goes into this pasture. After they were all bred we fed this six pounds of corn per sow per day, scattered out </seg>
            <seg id="p699">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK UREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION in the field — shelled corn. We scattered enough to last a week at a time. Naturally you will think that won't do — a' sow will eat it all up the first day. I want to tell you she won't eat it all. A sow can go just about so far before she gets tired. When she is tired she will lie down. We watched this very closely and we found that there would be feed there' the last day and then we would throw it in again. In this way we fed these sows just once a week. We know that one of the most important factors in gestation for sows is exercise. The feed is scattered over the lot, so it is needless to say that they get exercise when fed in this way. What about protein? We fed one-half pound of tankage and one-half pound of shorts mixed, dry, once a day. We generally fed this at noon. Then they have all the alfalfa hay they will eat out of a rack. We carry them that way right straight along until farrowing. Since we have been running experiments on that five or six years, there have been but three sows that we have taken out because they were too thin. One of these never did get in trim. We slaughtered her and she was condemned. The other two were grades which we took out and fed. We are figuring about 100 sows for spring litters and about half that many for fall. In feeding under that plan It costs, us about 154 pounds of feed per sow during that period up to the time the pigs were weaned. I will tell you how we handled them during the suckling period. We carried on some experiments during that time too. We used the self-feeder for the sows and pigs during suckling. When the pigs are about ten days old- — two weeks .or something like that — we take theni out of the farrowing pens and put them out on pasture if we have it and there is a self-feeder of corn, tankage, and an ample mineral mixture. The sows and pigs stay in there until the pigs are weaned. We fill that feeder about once every ten days. We don't have any creep, we don't keep the gilts away from the barrows. We have acre lots and we generally put in five or seven sows and their litters. One fall we had a pretty fair stand of alfalfa in a live-acre field. I put twenty sows and litters In that and they did just as well as if there had been only five in the field. By following that plan we found somi very interesting results. We found that in the whole average of six periods of experiments, the sows on the Belf-feeder gained 12.77 pounds apiece during the suckling. They gained that much. The sows that were hand-fed the feed, lost almost the same as the other sows gained — 11.6 pounds to be exact. They lost that much while the self-fed pigs gained. The pigs weighed within less than one-third pound average when they went in but the gain during the experiment, or during the suckling, was nearly 3% pounds per pig in favor of the pigs on the self-feeder. Now figuring the pork produced from the standpoint of both the sows and litters, we got 145 pounds of pork produced per sow and litter </seg>
            <seg id="p700">: REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE on the 'self-fed lota and 109 pounds on the others. Feed per. 1 on • pounds of gain on sows and pigs in the self-fed lot, it cost, us 441 pounds per lot to make the gain. In the hand-fed lot it cost us 603 pounds. The self-fed lots were so far ahead that we did not include this year's work in our report. In- feeding the pigs this way you get the; results I told you about a while ago. Just a word or two about our handling these sows this way. One of the good results we get in weaning. We get many inquiries about possible setbacks from weaning. We don't have that. When we want to wean a pen we just build a fence around the self-feeder. We put: in a couple of gaps so the pigs can get to it. If they are on pasture, the sows don't get any feed. We just drive the sows away and that is all there is to it. One other advantage in that. Where two litters a year were raised, we found that 40 per cent of the sows on the self-feeders were bred and settled for a second litter before weaning. Now here are some figures that were a little bit surprising to me in our work. That is; this spring and fall litter business. I have ten years' data on that. In the spring litter we had 898 sows and in the fall 317, which makes a little over 1200 sows. There were over 27,000 pigs farrowed. The average number farrowed per sow in the spring was 8.79 and in the fall litter 9.29. The percentage of dead pigs farrowed was 7.4 in the spring and 8.3 in the fall litters. Why should we not have a less percentage of pigs farrowed in the spring than in the fall? . The average pigs weaned per sow in the spring litters was .3 pig higher than it was in the fall litter. We got exactly three pounds per head heavier weight at weaning time on the spring litters than we did from the fall litters. Now we got 1.2 per cent more pigs weaned to number farrowed out of the spring litters than we did out of the fall litters. The pigs during the feeding period in the spring litters made an average weight at weaning of 33.3 pounds while in the fall it was 29.7. I really thought maybe our fall litter would show up better than that. Prom a practical standpoint I should think that should not deter us from raising two litters a year. I believe it is quite an important thing. I have the results of some experiments carried on in South Dakota. We have completed five years' work' up there on the plan of taking the pigs, at weaning time, putting them on the self-feeder, and getting them to market as soon as possible. The other half of the pigs were put on alfalfa pasture. On a limited ration of one pound of corn per day with no supplement, it cost us 290 pounds of corn to produce 100 pounds of pork. On full feed these pigs made an average daily gain of 1.67 pounds during the five years, after going on a limited ration for six months. They weighed approxi- </seg>
            <seg id="p701">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION mately 100 pounds at the time while the others weighed 200 pounds. In the combined feeding,' that is your limited feeding in South Dakota and full, feeding here, it cost us 349 pounds per head for 100 pounds of gain and for the other 342 pounds showed practically the same. The interesting part of that Is the prices we get for these pigs. The pigs on self-feeders were on the market in September at Omaha. The others that were shipped down here and fed out went on the market in December. During the five years we averaged getting $2.30 per hundred more for the pigs seir-fed from weaning and sold in September than we did for those fed out and shipped In December. I thought it might be interesting to you to get some of theRe facts. If we are going to get what we are entitled to out of this game, the best we can use of it, let's get hold of some system and stick to it rather than to a speculator's system and try to hit the high places. MR. HILDEBRAND: It might be of interest to you to know the reaction of the retail men with reference to meat prices just now. I was in Chicago In December attending a meeting of the National Livestock and Meat Board. At this meeting naturally the livestock men were concerned with the prices cattle, hogs, and sheep were bringing on the market. The reaction from a retailer who oper - ates a chain of stores in Chicago was to advise the packer that it wasn't price just now so much as it was the unemployment. He Bays unless you can give the people who really buy meat employment we can't hope for any increase in consumption. THE SOFT I'OKK PROBLEM By WILLIAM J. LOEFFEL For many years the problem of sort pork has been recognized as an important one in the south. This has been due largely to the use of certain feeds such as peanuts and mast. It has been the prac - tice of packers for years to discount Southern pigs at the market unless they were guaranteed to kill hard. Within the past ten years the problem has moved northward and now takes on an exceedingly important aspect in the cornbelt. Extensive studies by the Depart - ment of Agriculture cooperating with many state experiment stations and also by the Illinois Experiment Station have established beyond all question of doubt that the cause of the Increase in soft pork in the cornbelt has been the Increasing use of soybeans. Soybeans as a crop have increased in importance. They ofTer a means of diversification and have a further advantage being a legume and in - creasing the store of soil nitrogen.

At the present time it appears that the entire world is suffering from a surplus of fats and oils of all kinds and the demand for soybeans for oil manufacture has fallen to a very low point, forcing them almost entirely into the channel of animal feed. According to the Agronomy Department of the Nebraska Experi - ment Station, the yield of soybeans in eastern Nebraska is approxi - mately one-third that of corn. In other words, the price of soybeans must be approximately three. times that of corn in order that soybeans make as great return per acre. Since July .8 last summer the Nebraska Experiment Station has l&gt;een carrying a lot of pigs on shelled corn and ground soybeans self - fed free-choice. This ration was compared with corn and tankage, wheat and tankage, and rye and tankage. Many of you saw the pigs at Rooters Day last fall. When pasture was no longer available the pigs were continued on their respective rations in dry lot. During the first 90 days, the corn and tankage pigs gained 1.52 pounds per day, the ground wheat and tankage pigs 1.64 pounds, the ground rye and tankage 1.29 pounds, and the soybean pigs only .82 pound. After Rooters Day we attempted to increase the gains in the soybean lot by feeding steamed bone meal.. While the gains were stimulated for a short period, we finally found it necessary to add some tankage to the ration and for the past month and a half, tankage was included in the ration of the soybean group. Because of the large gains made by the corn and tankage and wheat and tankage lots, we marketed from time to time the heavier pigs from those lots: On the other hand, from the soybean lot we discarded the low-gaining. pigs, retain - ing only those that were making the best gains. In this way the original lots of- 13 pigs were reduced to 6 pigs per lot. The average weight of the corn and tankage pigs on December 27 was 314 pounds, of the wheat and ta'nkage pigs 321. pounds, of the rye and tankage pigs 280 pounds and of the corn and soybean pigs 270 pounds. All pigs Were tattooed and sold in one group to Swift and Company at Omaha, who slaughtered them December 29. After sufficient chilling, three' pork men all working independently graded the 24 carcasses. All of the pigs from the corn and tankage lot graded medium hard, with one exception which graded medium soft. All the pigs from the wheat lot graded as hard, except one which was graded as medium hard. I The rye pigs graded the same as the wheat pigs. For the second year, wheat-fed pork proved to be firmer than corn-fed .pork. Of the pigs which had received corn and soybeans, three graded soft and three medium soft. The results of this test coincide with those of other experiment stations.

            <seg id="p703">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION tin No. 366 have demonstrated that when soybeans were used to an extent sufficient to balance the ration, will produce soft pork. It was formerly believed that pigs which had become "soft" as a result of feeding soybeans might be "hardened" by using some other ration for a short period of time. This does not appear to be the case, however. If Nebraska farmers desire to produce soybeans, that, of course, is their privilege. If they decide to feed them to hogs, that is also within their rights. If they decide to do this, however, they should -do so with their eyes open, realizing that they will lower the quality of the pork produced. Nebraska pork has always had an enviable reputation on the markets of the country. As witness of that, we may cite the heavy purchase of shippers on the Omaha market. The popularity of Ne - braska, hogs is due to the fact that Nebraska farmers have had an abundance of feed grains and they have produced good-killing high - quality hogs. If any considerable number of Nebraska hogs kill soft at our markets, it will force the packer to discriminate against them. Since the packer cannot distinguish soft hogs from hard hogs on foot, he will be forced to discount all hogs or to buy only on guarantee. If the use of soybeans reduces the cost of production for Nebraska farmers, and this -is seriously open to question under Nebraska conditions, the Nebraska hog men must decide whether the reduction in cost of production will be sufficient to offset any depreciated value which the packer may be forced to establish. The time to decide is the present while the problem has not yet assumed important proportions in this state. MR. HILDEBRAND: The next speaker is a gentleman from Mis - souri who is going to continue this discussion on hogs. Mr. Weaver. HOG FEEDING ' L. A. WEAVER University of Missouri I_ was interested in the talks that have preceded me this morn - ing and especially this soybean situation. The statement was made that in Missouri we produce a good many soybeans. We do, and possibly the acreage in Missouri will increase rather than decrease. We can't produce legume hays as readily as you folks do in Nebraska and for that reason we believe that soybeans in Missouri have a very good place. From the atandpoint of a hog feed, we are not inter - ested in soybeans. </seg>
            <seg id="p704">I REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In recent years there has been accumulated at the various experi - ment stations a large amount of valuable data upon pork production subjects. Many of these experiments, however, were conducted and conclusions drawn when economic conditions differed materially from those obtaining at the present time, so that it may be .profitable to review some of the more important results with a view of adapting them to the present prices of corn, other feeds and hogs. Before doing this it should be pointed out that what follows applies only to normal, thrifty fattening hogs for unless the pigs to be fed have been raised under sanitary conditions and are at least reasonably free from parasites and disease the feeder is whipped before he starts. Assuming that this has been done then it may be desirable to briefly outline the requirements of satisfactory rations for hogs as determined by extensive swine feeding experiments. These requirements include: 1. ■ Energy producing nutrients — corn, wheat, barley, rye, oats, hominy feed, etc. 2. Protein — tankage, linseed oil meal, dairy by-products, wheat shorts, pasture or alfalfa hay, etc. A combination of protein supple - ments may be better than a single one. 3. Minerals — especially calcium and phosphorus — protein feeds mentioned above contain fair amounts; also may be supplied with mineral mixture such as equal parts of ground limestone, bone meal and salt. - . 4. Accessory substances — vitamines — important ones supplied by pasture or by green, leafy, cured legume hays. It would be impossible in the time allotted to review the im - portant, experiments having to do with each of the above require - ments, interesting as this might be. In the corn belt, corn will usually, be the most economical and therefore the principal source of the energy producing nutrients needed in swine rations. It is of course recognized that there are times when corn substitutes are indicated and feeders must therefore know the relative value and manner of using the various carbonaceous concentrates which may take the place of corn. Likewise, under certain conditions, a lack of minerals may be the limiting factor in swine rations but in general a simple mixture such as equal parts ground limestone, bone meal and salt kept before the hogs will adequately take care of ■ the mineral requirements. It is seldom under practical farm conditions that the lack of vitamines will be responsible for the ration for fattening hogs not giving maximum results, although it should be recognized that the ration for small pigs especially should contain either pasture or green, leafy legume hay.. The Important problem in feeding fat - tening swine, therefore, usually has to do with the protein require - ments including both the question of the amount and kind to be </seg>
            <seg id="p705">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION used. With corn at the present low price then probably the most important question which the feeder has is — Is it desirable to use any supplementary feed with corn and if so what kind and how much? The price of corn unquestionably has an Influence upon this ques - tion, as is, of course, also true of the relative price of the different protein supplements. In order then to determine which of two rations is the most profitable to feed, the price or cost of the ration must be taken into consideration as well as its efficiency. So far as the hogs themselves are concerned they can always be counted upon to make more gain, i. &lt;■., a more rapid daily gain H corn is properly supplemented, since we know that corn alone does not adequately meet the hogs' requirements due to the fact that it is lacking in protein and ash. It is possible, however, that corn may be so cheap and protein supplements so high that the additional gain made by the hogs fed the supplement will not be enough to make up for the additional cost. On the other hand, conditions may be such that it will pay to feed some supplement even though . it will not pay to feed as much as the hogs really need in order to make the most rapid gain. What is the situation-, then, as regards this point with present economic conditions? A study of hog feeding experi - ments should help to answer this question. Smith in his book. Pork Production, summarizes fifteen feeding trials at six different experiment stations where a ration of corn alone was compared with corn and tankage, fed in the proportion of nine or ten parts corn to one part tankage. The average amount of feed required to produce 100 pounds gain was 545.9 pounds when corn alone was fed, or 380.2 pounds of corn and 40.2 pounds of tankage when the corn was supplemented. In other words, one pound of tankage replaced 4.12 pounds of corn. Based on this saving or re - placement value alone, if corn was worth 20c per bushel, tankage could have been fed with profit only when it cost less than approxi - mately $30 per ton; corn worth 30c would give the value of tankage as $44.08; 40c corn, $58.83 tankage; 50c corn, $73.50 tankage, etc. These data would indicate then that with corn at less than 40c per bushel, it would not be profitable to feed $50 or $60 tankage with corn in the proportion of corn ten parts, tankage one part, which is the ratio that on the average products the most rapid gain when fed to fattening hogs in dry lot. However, this does not mean that it will not be profitable to feed $50 tankage with 30c or 35c corn, for there is data to show that if the .proportion of tankage to corn be decreased that its replace - ment value will increase. For example, results at the Iowa Station gave the replacement value of one pound of tankage as seven pounds instead of four. pounds of corn, when the proportion of tankage fed was reduced from 10 per cent to 4 per cent.

            <seg id="p710">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in the smaller ratio then tankage could be fed with 30c corn if the supplement could be .purchased for less than $75 per ton. While the replacement value of tankage was greater in the case of the corn plus 4 per cent tankage ration, it should be remembered that the hogs gained faster when the ration was corn plus 10 per cent tankage, thus indicating that the latter ration more nearly met the feed require - ments, of the hogs. To summarize, then, considering the present feed prices, it may be advisable to decrease somewhat the amount of supplement fed in order to make the ration the most profitable, but at least some supple - ment should be supplied. However, before reducing the amount of supplement below the amount needed to adequately balance the corn consumed the price of both corn and supplement should be carefully considered as well as the time it is desired to market the hogs since, as has been pointed out, .even though a reduction in the amount or supplement fed may mean a lower cost of each 100 pounds gain, such reduction will also mean a slower rate of gain resulting in a longer feeding period which may or may not be an advantage, depend - ing upon the price of the hogs when marketed. In passing it might be said that even with corn relatively low in price it will usually pay to feed enough protein supplement to produce maximum gains so that the question of kind of supplement rather than amount is usually the important consideration. It has been pointed out that experimental work has demonstrated that in order to have a practical ration the hogs should either be on pasture or receive some green, leafy legume hay. If these con - ditions are met then, in general, the most economical supplement will be the one which supplies this nutrient at the cheapest price per pound, and feeds containing a relatively high percentage of pro - tein will, as a rule, do this more cheaply than those containing low percentages of this nutrient. It is obvious that a 60 per cent protein feed will contain less energy producing nutrients which are usually best furnished with corn, than will a supplement containing only 20 or 30 per cent protein and that the smaller the percentage of protein the larger the proportion of the supplement which must be fed with corn in order to have a balanced ration. At Missouri, as at most experiment stations! one question which has received considerable study is that of the relative efficiency or proteins from different sources and particularly the value of protein supplements derived from a combination of feeds as compared with less complex mixture. It so happens that usually the complex mixtures contain a relatively low percentage of protein, while the simpler ones run considerably higher. This is true because tankage has been the feed used as the principal feed in the less complicated mixtures. The results secured in a test conducted the summer of 1931 are more or Jess typical of the others and may therefore be of interest in our </seg>
            <seg id="p711">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION study of the kind of protein to use for feeding fattening hogs which are either on pasture or which are being fed legume hay in dry lot. .In this test all lots of hogs were pastured on Sudan pasture from June 26 to early September at which date the supply of pasture was exhausted. All lots were self-fed. a mineral mixture composed of equal parts precipitated calcium phosphate, bone meal and salt. All lots were fed ground corn and some feed or feeds furnishing more protein than corn contains.

It will be noted in -this test where the hogs were on pasture for approximately sixty days after starting them on feed that there was no significant difference either as to rate of gain or feed required per 100 pounds gain regardless of whether the protein supplement used was tankage or the more complex mixtures provided the same amount of protein was fed in each case. The ration to use then would depend upon the relative price of feeds including both the price of corn and supplement. For example, if corn is cheap. Bay 35c per bushel and the price of all supplements the same, viz., $2.00 per cwt., then the cost per 100 pounds gain for the lot fed the 23 per cent protein .supplement would have been </seg>
            <seg id="p713">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION $5.43 while 100 pounds gain put on by the hogs fed the 60 per cent protein feed would have be^n only $3.02. On the other hand, if corn is high, let us say $1.00 per bushel, then the relative cost of gains for the low and high protein lots would have been $8.28 for the former, and $7.69 for the latter. In other words, the higher the price of corn in proportion to the cost of the supplement the smaller the advantage for the high protein supplement. This is true because of the smaller proportion of corn used with the low protein supple - ment. Since it is true that more corn and less supplement is used per each 100 pounds gain when the percentage of protein in the supple - ment is high it might be interesting to determine how high corn would have to be to make it advisable to use the low protein supple - ment. Such figures show that in this case the corn would have to be worth more than $1.80 per bushel. In making the above computations the price of the various supple - ments have been considered the same. With corn at a given price, say 56c per bushel, and tankage worth $2.25 per cwt. it might be interesting to figure how much the low protein -supplement would have been worth. The answer in this would be $1.20 per cwt. or $24.00 per ton. i These data then seem to substantiate the statement previously made to the effect that for feeding hogs which are on pasture or being fed legunle hay" in dry lot feeds containing a relatively high percentage of protein will, as a rule, be the most economical supplement to use with corn. The lower the price of corn the more apt this is to be true.- To summarize, then, it might be said that — 1. Fattening pigs cannot be expected to respond satisfactorily even to good rations unless healthy and thrifty. 2. Corn will usually most cheaply furnish the energy producing nutrients needed by fattening hogs, but the feeder should know the value and manner of using corn substitutes. 3. The mineral requirements are usually adequately supplied by self feeding simple mixtures such as equal parts ground limestone, bone meal and salt. 4. Pastures or green leafy legume hays should be included in the ration to furnish certain accessory substances. 5. Supplying the protein requirements as to kind and amount is usually the most important consideration in feeding fattening hogs. 6. The lower the price of corn the less one can pay for supple - mentary feeds. 7. When less than enough protein supplement is fed the replace - ment value of the supplement in terms of corn increases, although slower daily gains are made by the hogs. </seg>

MR1 HILDEBRAND: Mr. Pollock, who is listed as our next speaker, is unable to be here this morning so we have asked Pro - fessor Gramlich to say just a few words at this time. PROFESSOR GRAMLICH: Just one thought on this subject which Mr. Pollock was to give you — this matter of meat consumption and meat publicity. A few weeks ago the chairman of the farm board came out with a statement to the effect that while farm animals had gone down considerable, the price of meat in the East had not fallen in line. I think the prices of meat have gone down in the East during the last few weeks. We are trying to get considerable publicity out on this subject, .and are issuing releases each week. Mr.. Loeffel put one out last week and Mr. Hildebrand will handle one in the near future. We are trying to educate people to the fact that meat is down and should be eaten. In the first article which went out I made the statement that pork chops were selling at 12 cents per pound. ,The next day' I had a letter from Mr. Auld, a banker at Red Cloud, telling me that pork chops were selling at 12 cents per half pound. He had apparently misinterpreted a sign which quoted chops at 12^4 cents per pound. It is a good idea to let. people know that pork chops are today available at that price. A certain outfit of stores is today selling T-bone steaks at 19 cents per pound. Why are we having these excep - tionally low prices? First of all, the people down East can't buy. The big rank and file of people are out of work and can't buy meat. Since the working people keep the demand for meats steady when they are employed there is no demand now. This whole situation is really like a game of ten pins. You know when we knock any one person we knock ourselves. All fall we have .been buying cottonseed meal at tremen - dously low prices. We think we are profiting by that. Yet when we look into the matter we find that the producers are getting almost nothing for their cotton. What is the .picture? We find the people in the South, normally our best pork buyers, unable to buy because their main crop is worth nothing. I do not believe I am going too far by saying that hogs today would be $1.00 per hundred higher </seg>
            <seg id="p715">•NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK HREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION if cotton were selling higher. The more I watch, the more I study this thing. I' think after all it is really a great game of ten pins. I am sorry Mr. Pollock isn't here to cover this subject. The 25-cent charge you are paying on each car of stock is being well expended. I believe after all the livestock and meat animals will be the salvation of Nebraska. MR. HILDEBRAND: We have just one more number before lunch, time. We have at this time Mr. A. R. Hecht of Kearney who will address us on "Portable Hog Lots." PORTABI..K HOG IX)TS A. R. HECHT Portable hog lots is not a new subject up for consideration at all. You have heard it discussed here a number of times, you have seen motion pictures of it, you have heard Dr. Van Es discuss it. It is something that. isn't being practiced by very many farmers. It hasn't been sold. We have all heard it discussed, but as yet It hasn't been put across to very many people. Last spring we had a committee of sixteen farmers in Buffalo county meet with Mr. Derrick and a man from Washington, D. C, and spend a day figuring out just why • more farmers were not using portable hog lots. It is a good thing, we find, where it is being practiced. We made some studies of the farmers and found that the average farm produces thirty-three pigs per year and that seven sows are kept to produce those thirty-three pigs. We have among these men some that were using clean ground and some that were not. Those using clean ground maintain that the same number of hogs could be produced with five sows on clean ground. We. went still further, and tried to figure what other lessons there were. We found first that the average price decline ran into considerable. These men maintained that they could sell the pigs raised on clean ground at 195 to 210 pounds. It was also brought out that the pigs raised in the old lots would have to be fed two months longer and during this two-month period the average price would decline $1.25 per hundred. Usually spring pigs are marketed In September or in November and December. We have a few men this year Who sold pigs in August and September at $7.00. We know what they are bringing now. Another thing that these farmers maintain Is that there were less minerals fed by men on clean ground than those In the old lots. We feel in our section of the state that the men who are feeding </seg>
            <seg id="p716">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE protein supplements— balanced ration in other words — are not needing minerals. Right now our alfalfa hay is noted for its mineral content. People in dairy sections are coming to. us for alfalfa hay primarily because of its mineral content. We figured the interest on investment and the interest on invest - ment of the two sows and on the thirty-three pigs carried two months longer and found these items, together, made a loss of $225.00. We spent a whole day working on their figures and checking up on them. I will give you the figures: I Feed for the two sows and for carrying the thirty-three pigs two months longer.. $121.22 Price decline — $1.25 per hundred during the two-month period 92.80 Interest on the two sows and the thirty - three pigs extra two months 14.00 ! Tonics (50 cents per barrel) 16.50 An easy, yet not expensive way of transporting water lo hogr* on clean ground when located nvvny from the water supply. It wouldn't be fair to look at it only from the saving standpoint. What does it cost to put these hogs in the portable hog lots? We used only five sows to raise thirty-three pigs on the clean ground, the cost being $65.00. Of course they need a water system or a tank to haul: water out to these pigs. The cost of this was $20.00. They will need additional fencing. A portable fence, possibly using hog wire, would cost $72.00. That gives a total cost of $157.00 for the equipment necessary for these hogs in the portable hog lots. This equipment will last ten years, showing an annual charge of $15.70. Someone asked, what is the average tax paid by the average farmer </seg>
            <seg id="p717">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION in Buffalo county? They looked it up and found it to be $184.00. If we could go out as a group of salesmen and guarantee a man to return his tax to him every year he would be pretty apt to take on our proposition. The trouble with this portable hog lot business, it is intangible. It is something that you can't hold. All men who use these hog lots haven't had success. The reason for some of the failures is that the men do not consider one essential — that is a snow fence. A good many litters have been lost because these A-type hog houses have been put out on clean ground and along conies a blizzard. Unless the houses are fenced many litters will be lost. It is only a small item, but it is a little thing that might spell success or failure. Tlan for hoir lot sanitation -Makint- preparation for fall farrow-inn on Mr. Kinder'* form. A narrow atrip or Sudan Klaus and squaw corn had been planted across the field early in the Bummer. Later this part of the field was divided into acre plots usinu temporal y fences and five clean "A" type houses put in each lot. Attcr .he feed in these small lots was cleaned up. the back fence was removed and the sows and piRs allowed to ko into the corn field shown in the pack or the p.clurc. You know men in this college have made surveys where this work has been carried on. They find that about 2 per cent of the men are following this hog lot sanitation down to the last letter. The men who follow it out to the letter are having perfect success. The men who are using it only half way are getting only half results. I am sure each one of you men have in your county examples of men who have had success. I am going to relate to you three men whom I have come across In my experience. One young man invested all his money in hogs. He put them in a lot where they had raised hogs, for years. His hogs got sick and he got discouraged and was going to quit the farm. I saw him before he left and told him there was another way out. I told him </seg>
            <seg id="p718">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATEBOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1 . about the hog lot sanitation method and he believed me and tried it. That was about 1921 or 1922.' That man has raised two litters of pigs each year since from each of his sows. He shows pigs here at the State Fair and. they have been consistently in the money. He con - tributes his whole success to the portable hog houses. Then there was a Bohemian farmer who had a low spot in the hills. He was raising hogs in old lots and was about to lose every - thing. • He called me and I told him what was wrong. He went to a lumberman and bought six A-type houses. I went back in 'that neighborhood later and noticed that he had put those houses back in the old lots: I told him his mistake, that it was getting on clean ground that would make him successful.

DERRICK Last fall I went out on a hog lot survey. We worked in sections where hogs were not depended upon and others where they were raised for profit. Some people had quit because they had not been able to make money. We started this Pig Crop Contest to stimulate interest in hog raising. I believe our first contest was in 1926 or 1927. This year we have the greatest poundage of pork produced per sow of any time. Mr. C. F. Waldo of DeWitt produced 1980 pounds o'f pork per sow with twelve sows. Mr. Waldo, will you say just a few words to the men and tell them something about your success in this year's contest? C. P. WALDO: I was glad to receive your letter but I didn't like to come down here and tell people how I won. As I told my wife, hog feeding and public speaking are two different jobs.

            <seg id="p720">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOAKD OK AGRICULTURE I Derrick's letter I began to think what I could say when 1 came down here. I, thought back years ago when I was doing work for a hog man. One day this man says to me, "I wish you would give these hogs a little less feed and more attention. See that bedding under that sow's feet? See that board with, a nail in it? A sow might step on it and get infection." Right then I began to give the hogs better care. I I have been bringing hogs to the State Fair lor about twenty-nine years. About ten years ago I found that the hogs didn't do very well. That is when I first started using hog lot sanitation. Since that time I have used It In different degrees. Part of the time I didn't carry it out entirely. The more completely I followed it out the better the hogs did. Just this year I put a new fence around twenty-five acres of new ground . I never use an old sow. I watch the sow and have her on clean ground when she is ready to farrow. I always have good brood sows, good stock, and good type of hogs. The last few years I have been trying to breed a medium-type hog. MR.

            <seg id="p726">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Thursday, January 7 — Morning Session THE BEST FOR DENVER ; Parade of livestock to be taken to the National Western Stock Show at Denver. All animals taken will be sold at Denver. PROF. GRAMLICH: Now that you have seen these animals, Mr. Ray R. Thalman is going to talk to you on "Feeding the Corn ■ to Calves." FEEDING CORN TO CALVES RAY R. THALMAN There is no longer any doubt but that the calf, or at most the yearling, does and will continue to fill most of the cattle feedlots in this and other cornbelt states . No doubt there is a place for the big steer and he will probably be with us for some time but only in a very limited number. Consumer demand and economy of produc - tion have been the contributing factors in the change to- lighter and younger cattle. As a result, many new feeding methods have come into being. The practice of feeding a straight shelled corn and alfalfa ration to calves from weaning time until they are ready for market is gradually being replaced by a more diversified system. Feeders are now making an effort to have fat cattle when the market wants them rather than to sell every year on a declining market when all cattle seem to be ready at the same time. Summer feeding has be - come more popular, especially that of feeding corn on grass, or corn on alfalfa pasture. But the success of summer and fall feeding in the case of calves depends to a large extent upon the previous winter ration. Wintering well has proved the most economical under most conditions, but to winter well and still keep, down the cost, it is necessary to utilize insofar as possible the low-priced roughages pro - duced on the average farm. Two years of experimental work on the utilization of these roughages at the Nebraska station have demon - strated that the roughage from the corn plant fits admirably into the wintering ration for calves. In these trials the corn plant was fed in three forms; as shelled corn, as silage, and as ground corn fodder. Cottonseed cake was also considered as a protein supplement to take the place of alfalfa in the silage and fodder rations. The trial that is being carried on at the present time is a duplication of the first two except that two more lots have been added to this experiment. In one of these calcium carbonate is being added to a ration of silage and one pound of cottonseed cake. In the other, cane silage is being </seg>
            <seg id="p727">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION compared to corn silage when supplemented with one pound per head daily of cottonseed cake. Full feeding shelled corn to cattle in view of producing finished beef as Boon as possible has for many years been the standard prac - tice among cornbelt feeders. With a two- or three-year-old steer it is the only economical way to feed corn. However, it may or may not be in the case of the calf, especially steer calves. Since most of the calves are purchased in the fall at weaning time the feeder has one of two alternatives; he must either rough the calves through the winter or full feed them. Calves that have been full fed all winter will be too fat the following summer to turn on grass or hold until late summer or fall and still make economical gains. This type of feeder must,' therefore, market when his calves are ready. In addition, it is not possible for him to utilize cheap winter roughages or summer pasture. The success of this practice is dependent upon* market conditions during the spring or early summer and upon the relative price of corn. From the commercial feeder's standpoint, it is no doubt the best method of handling calves, since most of his feed is purchased and he cannot afford to bother with cheap roughages on account of the labor and expense Involved in handling. This is especially true when the price of corn is below 50 cents per bushel. Furthermore, the commercial feeder is not interested in how many pounds of beef he can produce from an acre of corn; he buys by the bushel. The practice of limiting the shelled corn allowance is of most interest to the man with an abundance of cheap alfalfa, and who wants to rough his calves through the winter and still get a reason - ably good gain. In two trials at this station this method of wintering has been the most expensive and least satisfactory of any of our roughage-wintered, lots. I should not recommend this practice unless alfalfa is abundant and low in price. A second way in which we have experimented with the feeding of corn to calves is in the form of silage. This practice has proved very satisfactory where calves are being carried through the winter months and fed out during the summer. Because of the growing practice of wintering stock calves and the drouth last summer, there was a tremendous amount of corn that found its way into the silo for the first time on many farms last fall. It is estimated that some 2000 or more trench silos were dug in this state alone last year. Some of these silos hold upwards of 300 tons of silage. Many feeders have asked regarding the gains that can be pro - duced on calves by a. silage ration. In two trials we. have received very good results. Last winter we were able to produce an average ' of two pounds of gain per head dally for 150 days on silage supple - mented with one pound of cottonseed cake. This was only a total </seg>
            <seg id="p728">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of forty-two pounds per head less gain than was produced by a full feed or shelled corn and alfalfa hay. To give some idea of the con - ditions that it produced on the calves, may I say that in sixty days on a full feed of shelled corn the calves sold for the same price as similar calves fed 205 days on shelled corn and alfalfa. The silage calves had consumed twenty-six bushels of corn and the full-fed calves forty-six bushels. The showing made by silage on the basis ol returns per acre to the farmer is illustrated by the fact that the silage - fed calves had consumed the corn from one-half acre and the full-fed calves the corn from one and one-third acres. With feed grinders becoming so numerous in this state the feed - ing of ground corn fodder has become quite popular in the winter ration for stock calves. The corn plant fed in this form was incor - porated into the feeding trials the past two winters and compared to corn silage. The results that we have obtained have been -fairly satisfactory, though the gains have been slightly lower on corn fodder than on silage when supplemented with either alfalfa hay or cotton - seed cake. On the other hand, the gains produced by fodder have been slightly more economical than on silage. Last winter we were able to produce 1.9 pounds per head daily on calves receiving fodder and cottonseed cake. Grinding is, however, a rather disagreeable and difficult job unless, a large mill is available. It mUBt be done at least once each week and oftener in wet weather. When fodder is damp it is not safe to store it in a barn in large piles lest spontaneous combustion result. Two barns in this state were lost by fire from this practice last winter and another barn was similarly destroyed not more than two weeks ago. For the man without a silo the processing of corn fodder offers a possibility for many feeders who wish to make economical use of farm roughages with little or no cash value. Since the corn plant in any of its forms is very deficient in protein content it is necessary to supplement it with a. protein-rich feed. The most popular of these feeds among cattlemen in Nebraska is alfalfa hay. Unfortunately we had a very short crop last year. Many feeders contend that alfalfa is not to be purchased in their community at any price and their only possibility is shipping long dis - tances. The latter is, of course, out of the question, since the price of cattle will not stand expensive feeding methods. Fortunately, cot - tonseed cake is cheaper this fall than it has been for many years and at present prices makes a very efficient protein supplement. While an exact comparison cannot be made between alfalfa and cottonseed cake, it is safe to say that for all practical purposes one ton of cake is worth, conservatively, three tons of alfalfa hay. In other words, cake at $25.00 per ton is cheaper than alfalfa at ?8.00 per ton, espe - cially where it is being fed with ground corn fodder or silage. It is not necessary to feed a dry roughage with silage; in fact, in each of two trials better gains have been produced on silage or fodder when </seg>
            <seg id="p729">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION supplemented with one pound of cottonseed than with three pounds of alfalfa hay. 'it might be well, therefore, for the man with a limited amount of alfalfa to supplement his winter ration with cake and save the alfalfa for the summer feeding period where shelled corn will form the basis of the ration and where a roughage of good quality is necessary. With the shortage of alfalfa has come another problem — that of minerals. While cottonseed cake is three times as high in protein content as alfalfa, it does not supply the calcium or limestone that alfalfa does. Apparently this lime is very beneficial to the animal organism in supplying bone material as well as being a regulatory factor in many of the bodily functions. The question regarding the use of ground limestone to supplement cottonseed cake is, therefore, one deserving of consideration. At the Kansas station very good results were obtained when one-tenth pound per head daily was added to a ration of prairie hay, cottonseed cake, and shelled corn. The seventh lot in the present trial at this station, is receiving one-tenth pound of ground limestone per head daily in addition to cake and silage. The eighth lot in this winter's cattle experiment is receiving a ration of cane silage supplemented by one pound of cottonseed cake per head dally. This lot was introduced into the experiment thts year for the first time in the hopes that a comparison between cane and corn silage could be made as silage crops. Both the cane and corn were grown on the experimental farm and the yields per acre are known. Comparisons will be made on a galn-per-acre basis as well as the comparative feeding value on a pound-for-pound basis. The conclusions that can be drawn from the past two years' work are many, but as has been said before, there is no royal road to success, and neither is any particular ration best under all condi - tions. The practice on individual farms can best be worked out to the one that most nearly fits into that system of management. Among the most outstanding conclusions to be drawn from these trials is that stock calves can be wintered successfully and economically an practically any Nebraska farm where the corn plant is available. Such methods of winter management leave several possibilities open to the feeder during the spring and early summer and, in addition, reduces the initial cost on his calves. The greater flexibility of feeding opera - tions is in itself a big factor in taking the gamble out of the cattle feeding business. PROF. GRAMLICH: We have two little girls with us this morn - ing from Wheeler County. They are going to give us a creep-feeding demonstration. Creep-feeding is becoming more and more important to Nebraska stockmen all the time and I am sure these girls will have something very interesting for us. </seg>
            <seg id="p730">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE CREEP-FEEDING DEMONSTRATION MISS MEYER — MISS HAHN MISS HAHN, No. 1 : Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the Ne - braska Livestock Breeders and Feeders Association, and Friends: We are members of the South Side Baby Beef Club of Wheeler County. Along with our regular baby beef work this year our members have been doing some work on the creep-feeding of calves. This is really a family affair, Everyone is interested in it. All the parents have agreed to give the members one-fourth of the profits on these calves. MISS MEYER, No. 2: Wheeler County is a very good place for the feeding of calves. We have good pastures of fine hay. The south side of the county produces grain and alfalfa as well as hay. There - fore, you can see that the feeding of calves on pasture is very practical in our county. No. 1: Most of the pastures contain 160 acres. They are some - times larger and sometimes smaller. They are usually hilly or rolling. If the pasture is away from the home, we must have a well. The well should be on high ground near the center of the pasture, and you must have a windmill to pump the water. You should have a tank which is large enough to furnish water for the cattle for at least a week. You can keep a float in the top of this so you can see when the supply -is going down. The same water system is also satisfactory in the home yards. CREEP FEEDER EQUIPMENT FOR FEEDING BEEF CALVES Feeders need not be costly. These pictures show feeders built of second-hand lumber. A feeder should be built so as to hold a sufficient quantity of feed, also to protect the feed against wind and rain. </seg>
            <seg id="p731">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION No. 2: The next thing of importance is the creep. It is usually ten feet square. It may be larger or smaller with openings which will let the calves in and keep the big cattle out. These may be made in two ways. No. 1: In the creep a self-feeder should be placed. This should be low to the ground, not over two feet high. These feeders should hold at least twenty-five bushels of corn. In the creep a salt box should be placed. No. 2: We win try to locate the water and creep near shade. If we do not have shade we must build something. A very satisfactory shade Is made by setting four posts in the ground six to eight feet high. Straw can be placed on this to make a good shade. This is all the equipment this project cost us. We have found this project to be satisfactory for both suckling calves and bucket calves. No. 1: Now that we have explained to you about our equipment we should like to tell you about our results. In this group eight creep-fed calves were fed and five were fed on pasture alone. The average calving date was April 15. The average weight when taken off feed was 315 pounds. (Quotes figures). No. 2: On October 14 both groups of calves were put in the feed lot. The creep-fed calves weighed '85 pounds and 30 days later had gained 79 pounds. This shows that creep-fed calves are used to grain and naturally wean themselves. Since our county is adaptable to creep-feeding calves and our equipment cost little, we have proved that our summer's work was profitable. CREEP FEEDER EQUIPMENT FOR FEEDING BEEF CALVES Creeps for calves should be built near the watering place. The cows usually loaf around for awhile and the calves have an opportunity to visit the feed box locatd inside the creep. </seg>

We Just wanted to show you what these 4-H youngsters could do. We more or less purposely kept from you the information that they were champions and at this time we are going to award them with the cup which they have won in the competition. I take pleasure In asking Mr. Frisble of the 4-H Club office to come forward and do the awarding at this time. MR. FRISBIE: Folks, I should not have been called here to present this cup, but since I am up here I want to give you a word or two about this club and the work it has been doing. This club is from Wheeler County, a county in which there is no county agri - cultural agent so it hasn't had the benefit of the work of the extension agent. However, there have been two men within that county that have been giving a lot of time and work with these boys and girls. I think you folks should know the leaders of this club. The leader is Mr. Warren Savage. Another man who has given a lot of time is Mr. Kizer. You folks who have had work with 4-H Clubs will realize what these folks have done when I tell you this is the largest 4-H Baby Beef Club in the state of Nebraska. It has an enrollment this year of forty-two members scattered over the south side of Wheeler county. Every one of the members completed the work he - started out to do this year. That is a better record than they had last year. They won the cup last year. Last year they had only forty-one members. The ordinary size of the baby beef clubs over the state runs a little under ten. This year Wheeler County finished up forty-two, while last year they finished up thirty-two. Mr. Eighmy of the Gooch Milling Company will present the trophy. It is presented by this company each year. MR. EIGHMY: I think we will all want to join together in congratulating this club for its outstanding activities. There Is no doubt but what they have earned this cup. They won it last year and came back again this year and won it, which makes it their permanent property. Since the club members are not in the room, I am going to ask Mr. Savage to come forward and accept this cup. Mr. Savage, this is our token to. you as the leader of the outstanding and champion baby beef club of Nebraska. MR. SAVAGE: I want to say that this cup accounts for that 100 per cent finish. It gave us just a little more fight to put across and finish our work. When we received that cup last year we made a solemn pledge to win it back and we did. I want to thank the Gooch Milling Company for the cup. MR. GRAMLICH: It means a great deal to us to have so many here even in the face of this snow storm.

He has been doing some wonderful demon - stration work in Kansas along the line of creep-feeding. We are all interested in creep-feeding and. we certainly are glad to have Mr. Moxley here. . We are working together in many, many ways and we are very happy indeed to cooperate one step further and find out what Kansas is doing in creep-feeding. WHAT CHEEP-FEEDING IS DOING FOB KANSAS BEEF CATTLEMEN J. J. MOXLEY Animal Husbandry Specialist, Kansas State College As Mr. Gramlich said, we are very glad to accept this invitation to come up here because we don't feel that Nebraska is much different from Kansas. I think perhaps you have a little more snow, some - times possibly a little better football team. We had a pretty good team- this year until the last few minutes. Now I certainly want to compliment the little girlB on the way they gave their demonstration. This information I am going to give here you may use as you see fit. The creep-feeding of Kansas produced calves on Kansas pro - duced crops has done, much to relieve the situation of our average Kansas cowman during 1931. Not that they all made a profit — as they did not — but the loss they experienced was slight compared to most others. Those who sold previous to the middle of November were clearing from $8 to $20 above all charges against the cow and calf. Since .that time some have had a hard time balancing their receipts against their charges; others have continued to show a profit. The creep-feeding of calves is becoming a popular practice among the cattlemen of Kansas who desire to market their calves as a fin - ished product. By feeding the calf grain while it is nursing its mother, the owner has been able to finish it for market at less cost than by other methods. Since it is not exactly nature's method of developing a calf, the man who is successful must not only give the calf permission to eat but may need to use persuasion. We have in Kansas this year over 18,000 head of creep-fed calves which are used as demonstrations. Most of these have already been marketed; the bulk of them weighing about 700 pounds. About 9% per cent of the beef calves in the state are creep-fed, with the major beef counties showing up. to 20 per cent being creep-fed. </seg>
            <seg id="p734">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This method of handling calves has become popular for several reasons: First, because of the usual market preference for light weight finished cattle. Second, because of the introduction of drouth resistant grains into the western half of Kansas, which needed a market. Third, because it permitted the heifers to be marketed at a weight when their carcasses were practically as desirable as those of the steers. And fourth, because of the safety of a beef production practice by which the calf is produced, fattened and marketed from the same farm. The information which we have gathered from our Kansas cattle - men shows that creep-feeding does several things. First, it adds weight; usually for each bushel of grain fed, ten pounds of additional weight is obtained. Thus a calf which ate seven bushels of grain before weaning is usually seventy pounds or more heavier at weaning time than he would normally have been. If not creep-fed. Second, it adds finish; the degree of finish it adds is dependent upon the amount of grain fed. if five to seven bushels are fed, the calf will usually have his grade raised enough to sell for con - siderably more per hundred weight at weaning time than the calf not creep-fed. Third, it makes the calves more uniform; as the calves with poor suckling mothers will eat more grain and thus make up for the shorter milk supply. Fourth, it saves shrink at weaning; as the calves notice the absence of their mothers less and .there is not such a radical change in getting them over to dry lot feeding. Fifth, it permits earlier marketing; as the dry lot feeding period is shortened, due to the added finish they have at weaning time. Sixth, it reduces the amount of grain necessary to finish the calves. And seventh, the cows will carry more condition at weaning time as the calves do not worry them so much when they are being creep-fed. Success is dependent upon several factors. There are several very desirable factors that assist materially in creep feeding calves, and one's success in handling calves in this manner is dependent upon just how well you can persuade the calves to eat. Who Can Creep-Peed? The early calf has a decided advantage over the late calf, since it can be taught to eat grain before it goes to grass with its mother. It will then usually make some effort to get grain that is placed in a feeder, whereas the late calf may or may not learn to eat. From the standpoint of getting the most return for the year's keep of the cow, the early calf that has considerable size when it follows its mother to grass in the spring has also proven the most desirable. To have the most desirable pasture for creep-feeding, the cows should water at a central place daily In order that the feeder may be </seg>
            <seg id="p735">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION placed near this loafing place where the calves can have access to It every day. In some cases this loafing place is not by the watering place but may be in a shady place or on a breezy mound in the pasture. The small size : pastures usually allow the cows to congregate more regularly each day at a certain place than the larger ones, however, this handicap may be overcome to a considerable extent in some of the larger pastures as will be mentioned later. These two factors, the age of the calves and the suitability of the pasture, have more to do with making a success of creep-feeding than all others. In creep feeding calves it is well to recognize a few handicaps that are ever present. .First is the fact that the calf naturally prefers milk to other feeds, and to induce it to eat grain, conditions must be very favorable, especially when it is very young and has a plentiful supply of milk. Second is the nature of the calf to grow rather than to fatten, and for this reason a concentrated feed is necessary. The amount of grain that a calf will eat before going to grass is usually very little, but it is the habit of eating and not especially the amount that is so essential at this period. Even though the early calf is eating considerable grain before going to grass, the feeder should not be disappointed if it lets up when turned to grass, as the flush flow of milk from the cow does not leave much of an appetite for grain until a little later when grass is not so good. How to Make the Creep As mentioned before, if at all possible, the calves should be early enough at at least some of them early enough to eat a little grain before they go out to grass with their mothers. They will usually eat a little shelled corn, oats, or other grain when three or four weeks old, if in a dry lpt. When the cow herd is taken to grass, a self-feeder should be placed inside a creep that is located near the loafing place of the cows. The self-feeder should have wide eaves to protect the grain from the weather. Its size will depend on how many calves are to be fed. A feeder ten feet long will usually be sufficient in size to care for forty or fifty calves. The creep fence, which Is placed around the feeder to keep the cows out and permit the calves to enter, may be made of any suitable material, as woven wire, poles, or boards. This fence should be at least ten feet back from the feeder on all sides. Many of the cattlemen are making their openings for the calves to enter at the corners. The fence is solidly built with the exception of several openings where the calves are to enter. These openings are usually made by setting posts with about a 16-inch space between them and tying them together across the top to prevent the cows from crowding them apart. </seg>

            <seg id="p737">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION What to Feed The calves which were fed in Kansas last summer were fed on various kinds of grain. Shelled corn was the most widely used and has several advantages. It works well in a self-feeder, stands the weather well, and is a good fattening feed. However, if it becomes too hard it may need to be ground in the latter part of the summer. Ground wheat was used as a part of the grain ration in many cases. Care should be taken to see that the calves do not get too large a proportion of wheat and thus ■ make them scour. A grain ration composed of one-half wheat and one-half corn has been used in some cases with good results. Ground barley, kaftr, milo, or feterita may be used to a good advantage. A partial feed of oats may have its advantages if the calves do not get to the feed dally, as its bulk will possibly prevent their' over-eating. However, very little trouble has been experienced from this cause, since a calf that is getting a fair supply of milk usually will not. care for too much grain. Oats are hardly as fatten - ing as the other grains and have been used more in developing pure - bred calves than in fattening commercial calves. When the milk flow of the cows has diminished in the latter part of the summer, a good many of the men have added a little cotton - seed to the grain in the feeder with good results. A mixture of ten or twelve parts grain to one of cottonseed has proven satisfactory. If whole corn is being fed, the pea size cake will work better in the feeder than cottonseed meal from the standpoint of remaining more evenly distributed throughout the grain. Overcoming Obstacles in Creep-Feeding If the pasture has more than one central watering place, it is often desirable to place several creep-feeders where the cows may loaf, such as near several watering places or along a stream that flows through the pasture. The calves may be attracted to these locations by salting the cows nearby. Where there are no trees In the pasture, a shade may be built over the feeder to attract the calves. In the latter part of the summer when the grass is usually dry, a little bright alfalfa or succulent feed sometimes is useful in coaxing the calves to the feeder. In case the calves seem slow in learning to eat, a skim milk calf that knows how to eat grain may sometimes be used to decoy them into the creep. Some men have herded their cows and calves up toward the feeder daily with good results. The Results of Creep-Feeding The results obtained in Kansas during the past four years have proven quite profitable. The information that we have gathered from cattlemen co-operating with their local farm bureaus has been rather widely spread and used. Herds which kept records have varied in </seg>
            <seg id="p738">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE size from 12 calves up. to 125. Though it is easier to creep-feed a small group of calves, the results with some of the larger herds have been equally satisfactory. As mentioned before, most of the calves have been sold when weighing about 700 pounds at market; and though some are marketed at weaning time, this is not the usual practice as they ordinarily must obtain a weight of about 700 pounds before they are fat, which usually requires a dry lot feed of about 60 to 100 days. At this weight good quality creep-fed calves have been turned out carcasses which were government graded as good, choice, and a few of them prime. The early calves gave the best results in creep-feeding, yet calves which come at any time of the year may be creep-fed. The early calf does 'not require as much grain as the cow calving early supplies milk over a longer period of time than the late calving cow. Calves which come in November, December, January, February and . March are very desirable; and if protection is adequate, the strong preference in Kansas is for the calf which comes around the first of the year. The average January, February and' March calves have been marketed at ten months of age weighing 700 pounds and with a total of approximately twenty-five bushels of grain in them. Later calves require more time and more grain. Precautions in Creep-Feeding Experiences in creep-feeding bring out the fact that the grain should always be kept clean as calves do not relish grain that has been spoiled by. the weather or otherwise. The feeder should always have grain in it as big early calves which have eaten considerable may be thrown off feed if they have to go without feed for several days and then get an over feed. . Conclusions i The creep feeding of calves offers a method to get the greatest weight and the most finish at the earliest age, with the least cost. To get the best results, go.od quality early calves that can be taught to eat before going to grass, and suitable arrangements for creep - feeding are necessary. With the information obtained from other cattlemen during the - past few years, our Kansas, farmers are eliminating many of the risks of producing cattle, by utilizing our most certain crops, grass and roughage through the cow, and finishing the calf on the least amount of grain by the creep-feeding method. MR. GRAMX.ICH: I think I shall ask Mr. Baker to give us some remarks regarding this work. While Mr. Moxley has been the leader </seg>
            <seg id="p739">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION in that field. Mr. Baker holds the unique distinction of being the only experimental man who has a project under way. Discussion of Mr. Moxley's talk by Marvel L. Baker. MARVEL, L. BAKER: We have been doing some work at North Platte. We started this last spring and it checks very closely with what has been said here this morning both by the girls and by Mr. Moxley. There are a good many angles to this creep-feeding problem. What every man has to do is take the facts that are available, study them in the light of his own conditions, and use them to the best advantage. I think that is a better solution for our economic prob - lems than all the patented medicines that can be handed out to us. In Nebraska we have the problem of utilizing roughages. In our experiment we used March and April calves because it seems that they are most typical of the calves in our section. I think creep - feeding will be more valuable with early calves, but you can't talk that to a man who is running a large number of cows with a maxi - mum of equipment. We tried to handle the March calves as normally as possible. They didn't start eating grain to any appreciable extent until summer. They got ten pounds additional feed by summer time. We weighed them October 9. We have weights on them for three months since they were put in the feed lot. The first month there was quite an advantage in favor of the calves that had graia during the summer, both from the standpoint of gain and economy of gain. The second month there wasn't so much difference. This was true the third month. We will feed the calves until we think they are ready for market You can't get away from the fact that the judgment of the experimenter has something to do with the way the project turns out. If we consider the period from the time the calf is dropped until it is marketed, I don't know just how much advantage there is going to be In creep-feeding calves under our conditions as far as the economy of gain is concerned. This is a program that will have to be worked on f.or some time before we can make very definite state - ments as to what we can expect, but we expect- to continue that work Undoubtedly the calves fed grain in the summer carry more flesh they wean better, and those calves in our lots now have more finish than the calves which didn't get grain and under normal con - ditions they will net more profit. MR. GRAMLICH: Are there any questions? QUESTION: 'Do you grind the corn? MR. BAKER: No. MR. MOXLEY: No. QUESTION: Does it pay to feed the cows grain while the calves are running on pasture? MR. MOXLEY: We just run them on pasture. </seg>
            <seg id="p740">report of Nebraska state board of agriculture MR. GRAMLICH: In case you think this is theoretical and inir practical, let me cite you one instance. Here in Lincoln we have a chain of stores handling sixty carcasses per week weighing 300 pounds in the carcass. That means calves of about 500 pounds live weight. This man has a standing order at Kansas City for calves of this type- Kansas creepers they are called. Evidently there is a fixed demand in some communities at least, for the kind of carcasses these little calves produce. MR. GRAMLICH: One of our biggest problems is abortion. The minute you start raising your own calves you are brought face to face with contagious abortion in cattle.. I think we have two of the leaders in their respective fields to discuss this part of the program Dr. L. Van Es as the veterinarian, and Mr. E. M. Harmon as the layman. I take pleasure at this time in calling on Mr. E. M. Harmon. THE ABORTION PROBLEM FROM THE LAYMAN'S STANDPOINT E. M. HARMON Associate Editor Successful Farming It takes considerable nerve to follow as competent an authority on this question as is Dr. Van Es. He is known all over the country and recognized as being one of those who is the last word. There are just three or four points here that I will bring up very briefly in connection with this problem that is bothering most of us. I am coming to you as a layman — as one who has actually come up against this problem. One of the most unfortunate things in connection with the disease commonly known as contagious abortion in cattle is the name which has been applied to it. From this very name the average man is inclined to think that his herd is not infested as long as he does not have abortions. Or, putting the matter the other way, he is likely to feel sure that he has an outbreak of the disease as soon as an abortion occurs. Abortions do not prove that the disease com - monly known as contagious abortion is present. Neither does the fact that there are no abortions prove the absence of the disease. It would have been much better had this disease been called by the name of its discoverer, or Bang disease, from the start. There are many other symptoms of Bang disease other than abortions. Re - tained after-births, breeding trouble, sterility, udder troubles, reduced milk production, and even big knees, are all probably just as safe indicators of Bang disease as is the actual abortion itself. There is only one way to know whether or not it is present. That is the blood test. </seg>
            <seg id="p741">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Losses from tMs disease are enormous. Y.our own experiment station has estimated these losses at something like $100 every time a cow aborts. The Connecticut station estimated the losses at $44 a year "for every reacting cow, whether she aborts or not. These two figures probably check pretty closely since It is probably safe to say that not more than 40 per cent of the reacting cows abort, if ever. If 20 per cent of all the cows in the country are reactors, if this loss is $40 per cow per year, the disease is costing dairymen something like $175,000,000 a year. You are primarily interested in beef cattle. You know that if your beef cow aborts, or if you cannot get her bred, then your entire year's Income from that cow Js lost. I would not estimate the losses to beef cattle and hog men. Suffice it to say that it is too great a tax and that the man Who does not eliminate the disease from his herd cannot meet the competition offered by those who do have clean herds. My own experience with this disease dates back seventeen years, when" I was taking blood samples for Dr. J. W. Connaway in one of the University of Missouri herds. I saw that herd cleaned of the disease by the same methods of blood testing, sanitation, and isolation which are still recommended. Later, as a county agent, and still later for eight years as an extension specialist In Missouri I was brought face to face almost daily with the ravages of this disease. Just recently it has been my opportunity to work closely with another clean-up- campaign on Meredith Farm. We started with a badly in - fected herd. More than 40 per. cent of the cattle had to go, but by following these same practices of blood testing, throwing out the reactors, and cleaning up, we are now free of the tremendous losses that the disease was entailing. These experiences, and watching those of hundreds of others, have proved to me that we do know how to control Bang disease. I know there are doubters. I know there are those who dis - believe the blood test. If any of you are among that group, I must say that you are mistaken. The blood test properly applied is as reliable a test as Is known. Mistakes are made but that is not the fault of the test. The worst of it is that most of the mistakes that are charged to the blood test are actually made on the farm by the man who takes the samples. The one who is having his herd tested thinks that he wants to check one laboratory against another. Con - sequently he sends blood samples to two laboratories. We all know how easy It is In a barn full of cattle to get samples mixed. It is just as easy to get one sample infected and not another. Or, on the other hand, it Is possible that the samples get mixed in the labora - tories. Most of our good laboratories, however, now have their tech - nique reduced to a point where this seldom if ever happens. I am fully convinced that most of these difficulties happen right in the </seg>

            <seg id="p743">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION barn where the samples are taken. At any rate, when mistakes do happen, and when a person gets conflicting reports from different laboratories, these are due not to any fault of the blood test, but to mechanics somewhere. I want to repeat that the blood test itself in the hands of a competent laboratory Is reliable and where the right kind of care is taken' to keep the samples clean and to keep them from being mixed in the barn, the results of the test are satisfactory. All of us are confronted every so often by someone who claims he has a cure for this disease. While I would not recommend anyone to try it, I would hardly blame any individual for getting down the old family shotgun every time such a medicine peddler shows himself on. the farm. There is no known cure. If a cure ever does become known, it will be discovered by some of our real students of the disease, such as your own Dr. Van Es rather than by some, quack medicine peddler whose chief claim to knowledge is a fluent use of the English language. The farther we all stay away from such quacks, the better off we will be. Another set of conditions which presents itself to us frequently is the matter . of vaccination. We are frequently offered both live and dead ' cultures. So far as I know, no one has ever yet demon - strated any effects from the use of dead cultures. Recently most or the claims have been made for what are called A- virulent cultures. These are supposed to be cultures of the organism in a live but weak - ened form. Personally, I consider the use of such cultures not only unwise, but dangerous. The Michigan Experiment Station has shown that when these are transferred from one guinea pig to another, inside of two or three transfusions they are likely to become virulent. If we will use a little .reasoning as to how the disease acts on a herd under practical conditions, I think we will be inclined to agree with this viewpoint. We know that they lay dormant in a herd for years and then suddenly break out with a storm of abortions. Isn't it perfectly logical to think that it is laying in that herd in an A-virulent fonn and. then suddenly is transferred to a cow in whose system it becomes virulent? I can best express my own opinions of vaccination for abortion by saying that I consider it a dangerous practice. I would just as soon see a man steal cows from Meredith Farms as to let him vac - cinate them with live organisms, whether of the virulent or the A-virulent type. One other point I wish to stress in this connection is that the control of this disease depends more on the man than anything else. Any man who really wants to learn and who will make an honest effort to control this disease in his herd can do so. Most of us are inclined to procrastinate. We want to half-do something and hope to get by that way. I can Illustrate this by referring to our own </seg>
            <seg id="p744">; REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE experiences on Meredith Farm. When we started blood testing our original, farm manager was only half sympathetic. We agreed to blood test every sixty days. The first test showed a large number of reactors. It was four months instead of two months before we could get him into action again. When we tested the next time, we ■ not only found a lot more reactors because the place hadn't been cleaned up after the first test, but to our' dismay we' found that two of his favorite cows which had reacted were still on the main farm with the clean herd. There can be no half-way measures. A com - plete, thorough program such as your own experiment station recom - mends, including the test, isolation of reactors, and thorough sanita - tion, will overcome these losses and gb a long way towards putting the herd back on a profitable basis. H. J. GRAMLICH: I wish we had time to go into a discussion; however, I doubt whether we do have that time. As I said before, I am hoping you will all stay with us. This next speaker on our program is known the world over. He is truly a philosopher and will talk to us on "Feedlot Philosophy." There are only four real philosophers in the world. Possibly the first one is Will Rogers, then there is ] old Abe Martin, and, of course, out here in western Nebraska we have a philosopher known as Cul Wright. The fourth one of these philosophers is Captain Dan Casement of Manhattan, Kansas. He has every calf in his feed lot named. Some of these names will not be given here. I take' pleasure in calling upon Captain Dan Casement. FEKDLOT PHILOSOPHY DAN CASEMENT . The topic assigned me might perhaps arouse in you some expec - tation or more probably apprehension that this short paper aims to deal with profound and philosophic problems. You may set your minds at ease on that score. I consciously adhere to no definite system of philosophy either in the feedlot or out of it. My regard for philo - sophic systems has not been increased by reading recently the bulky volume entitled "Living Philosophy." In its pages nearly a score of the acknowledged leading thinkers of today disclose their views on the significance of human life, its logical purpose, and its possible future. The reading of this book, I fear, has enriched my mental equipment by one item only, viz.: a definite conviction that even our most profound thinkers actually know very little beyond the limits of the wide field which the positive sciences have already ex - plored and platted. Nor has my regard for pure philosophy been increased by endless discussion with my son just out of college, wherein he majored in </seg>
            <seg id="p745">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION that subject. Apparently, however, it didn't take, for I feel certain that he concurs in the opinion of his mother who terminates most of our abstract and speculative metaphysical discourses with the flat assertion "It's all rot." And I feel quite sure that no system of pure philosophy propounded in Princeton can today help in the solution of this boy's immediate and pressing problems. For those problems are the very real ones that now sternly confront him and his bride starting life in a log cabin on an isolated ranch in western Colorado, periodically snowbound and daily confronted with the responsibility of hauling hay to 150 head of hungry cattle, and the necessity of rustling wood and packing water for the household needs. Although his companion in this primitive manner of living is doubtless quite able to support her side of any philosophical debate, since she holds degrees from both Vassar and Columbia, it is safe to surmise that her mind is at present . more concerned with pancakes than with Plato, and that bisecting a snow covered haystack with a dull hay knife, loading the sled, chopping wood and milking Evalina leave him no leisure for mental gymnastics in the field of philosophy. However, I may be mistaken in this belief, for I can recall that forty years ago on the same ranch I myself used sometimes to impart a mildly philosophic trend to discussions with my partner. Tot Otis. He reminds me that, in combating his complaints against the menial character of our toil and particularly bearing on the discomforts that attended the hauling of manure from the corrals each spring, I was accustomed to lay down the principle that true happiness abides rather in anticipation than in realization of the object sought. Thus I argued that, with the proper mental attitude, we might, perhaps, be happier at that moment forking manure at the ranch than we would be later at the climax of our annual excursion to New York to make whoopee at the Yale-Princeton football game. Nothing could more clearly attest the futility of philosophy than Tot's reception of this proposition. He ridiculed it roundly and straightway in his vocab - ulary the word anticipation became a synonym for manure. Today, a sedate man of large affairs in an eastern city, he seldom fails on the occasion of our too rare reunions, to remind me of the times when we used to fork, shovel, and haul "anticipation" on Waterfall Ranch. That recollection, I think, marks the modest height attained by me in the expression of philosophic thought. But I- suspect that the generous purpose that prompted the assignment to me of this topic on the present program aimed to give me latitude to speak on almost any subject that might come into my mind. If that was in truth the intention, I have thus far at least fulfilled it. You in this audience who are chiefly Interested in the production of beef and pork and lamb might reasonably expect a feedlot phil - osopher to deliver himself of sage opinions on the probable trend </seg>

Should I attempt this, I am sure I would stamp myself a fool rather than a: philosopher — or possibly both, if the terms are Identical, as my wife appears to believe. I am led to refrain from predictions concerning the future of our business, because it is today surrounded by so many elements of uncertainty. It now seems that not only our industrial problems but our political and social problems as well are to some extent incapable of solution by our own individual initiative or even by national action. Their successful solution so far as we are concerned appears to await the determination, either by international agreement or by tragic or fortunate circumstances of problems more momentous, more difficult, and more perplexing even than our. own. In short, today as never before the fate of our business and the condition of our existence depend; largely on the fate of the world, which one, even without a pronounced pessimistic bent, might easily picture as tottering on the brink of chaos. The situation, I think, is well summed up in a letter received from Emporia two weeks ago. It says: "What is the answer to this calamitous problem which is en - meshing civilization? I remember, well the depression of the '90's; even the panics and flurries of the '80's, and I have often heard men talk who went through the panic of '73, and I remember dis - tinctly the grasshopper plague of '74, but I have never seen times so black for everybody as they are now. If I were absolutely despot of any unit of population from a city to our entire western civilization, I just couldn't issue ukase number one. I wouldn't know what to do. "If I can ever be of any assistance to you in your small imme - diate problem, please let me know. I suppose about all we can do is to tinker here and there at the small immediate problems, 'and with God be the rest' — if any. Faithfully yours, W. A. White." Some of our friends with more assurance, perhaps than "Old Bill" could issue "ukase number one' 'without hesitation. Two days before Christmas, driving home from Texas, I dropped In on Arnold Berne at his feed lots in Peabody. He was busy with preparations for sending to the Chicago market that evening a fifteen-car train of fat steers, having dispatched a similar shipment the day before. Almost in his very phrase of greeting, Arnold urged the need of "a cheaper dollar." To this end he would remonetize silver. Then he showed me a letter from a mutual friend and well known cowman - economist at Kit Carson, Colorado, whom doubtless many of you know. Charley would solve our ills by empowering the government to issue $100,000 in greenbacks every month for two years, redeem - ing these at the rate of $50,000,000 per month in that nebulous period "When times get better." </seg>
            <seg id="p747">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION You will recall that in the. dark days between '93 and '96 the first of these remedies was widely supported. That issue then con - cerned mainly this country alone. The question at that time was fortunately solved by the rejection at the polls of a policy that spelled repudiation and the path of honor was promptly made more smooth for us and other nations by the discovery of new supplies of gold in Alaska and South Africa. In the absence now of any such happy occurrence, I am unable to see how dollars can be made more abundant without deliberately debasing our currency and defrauding our creditors. Values can never be created and maintained by decree. Higher prices for our com - modities would serve the same purpose for us as more plentiful dollars. But how are prices to improve materially while supplies are over abundant and consumption is curtailed by reason of wide spread unemployment. It we look abroad for a market we Hud our former customers impoverished and resentful because our high tariff has - excluded many of their products from our markets. A partial ex - planation of our four-cent hog lies in the 40 per cent decrease in our export of pork products during the past year. Frankly, as a feed lot financier, I can see no quick and certain remedy, reasonably within our grasp to mend our domestic economic difficulties. An international survey discloses almost the entire world in sad predicament. To defend the rights and property of her citizens in Manchuria, Japan makes warlike gestures against China, a country seemingly without responsible government and apparently powerless to preserve order. India presents the strange paradox of an innumerable, undernourished horde of ill-assorted human beings led by a saintly man into a war for liberty with no more formidable armament than the doctrine of non-resistance. The millions of Russia, seeking the theoretical blessings of com - munism are tamely enduring the hardships imposed by a system of state capitalism directed by despotic, inferior minds. A throne falls in Spain; Italy. and Turkey are ruled by dictators as absolute in their power as were the Emperors of Old Rome. The fate of the new German Republic trembles in the balance. Some well informed opinion holds that the government will soon be seized by the Hitlerites, who will at once repudiate all international obligations. This would undoubtedly lead to armed invasion by France and the probable beginning of another long and destructive war involving many other European countries.

We may possibly find some measure of reassurance and hope for the ultimate survival of democracy in the fact that France appears today to be in better care than most of her important neighbors. If we look to the continent to .the south of us, we see countries and municipalities defaulting, in the service on their pledges held in the United States with the exception only of Argentina. Many distraught nations of both hemispheres are our debtors in sums that add up to a staggering total. Their delinquencies impair the stability of our financial institutions and the solvency of our citizens, while the wheels of our own industries turn slowly, our transportation en - counters heavy adverse grades, fear of the future prompts hoarding and a curtailment of normal activities on the part of the individual, and. In consequence, our earning power decreases to a point whereat we are unable longer to support our accustomed manner of life and the extravagant costs of government with which we have carelessly permitted ourselves to be saddled. In the face of all these untoward circumstances how can a feedlot philosopher make any certain prediction as to what the near future has in store for us personally? However, one conviction at least he can state with rather posi - tive assurance, viz. : Our country now needs as never before inspiring and supremely competent leadership. In the course of the coming summer and autumn we shall once more, with deep concern observe the progress and direct the course of the clumsy political mechanism by which a representative govern - ment nominates and. elects its executive head. Let us hope that some - how, somewhere in the political turmoil attending this process the identity of this leader will be- revealed to us, even though another four, years must elapse before our destiny can be committed to his hands. He must miraculously combine in his personality almost superhuman qualities in order adequately to measure up to the mag - nitude of our needs. - The sympathy and deep human understanding of a Lincoln, the patience and humility of a Gandhi, the common sense and humor of a Will Rogers, the dash and dramatic appeal of a Roosevelt and Incomparable courage. In the humble opinion of a feedlot philosopher this paragon is not today clearly recognizable in the person of anyone either holding or -openly aspiring to prominent public place, although I doubt not that he lives and will manifest himself at the appointed hour. Our proper province is promptly to recognize him when he does reveal himself and ardently to follow his leadership. </seg>
            <seg id="p750">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I 1 have stressed courage in the catalog of his requirements, because deficiency in that quality appears to be accountable for a very large bulk of our present misfortunes. In the face of an unprecedented wave of lawlessness it would seem that courage might prompt the purpose and effect means to employ an idle army in compelling respect for law. For there can be no more insidious invitation to anarchy, no more direct threat against the very life of a government than contempt for its laws on the part of its people; and clearly our armed federal forces exist solely for the defense of government. Courage and the will to legislate for the country's good, rather than to serve a false conception of self interest, could have success - fully combatted the demand for adjusted compensation on the part of a politically militant minority. Courage to stand against a noisy clamor for so-called Farm Relief might have saved half a billion dollars to the National Treasury and ourselves for many months of futile agitation. For today although the prices of farm products, which this legislation aimed to elevate, commonly stand at no more than 40 per cent of the figures prevailing when ; the Farm Board took office, the man on the farm Is widely acknowledged to occupy a more secure position as regards his ability, to obtain food, shelter, and the other actual necessities of life, than the members of almost any. other group composing our population. But it is senseless to speculate on the causes of our ills or to waste: time in regret, theories have no bearing on the actual condition that confronts us. To my mind the Kansas City Star lately struck a true and re - sonant note when it printed the following In its editorial columns: "Thirty years ago the distinguished psychologist, Wm. James, wrote an essay entitled 'The Will to Believe' that made a profound impression — it was a call to action. Its point was that obstacles usually could be surmounted If we believed they could be, and made the effort. If we sat back in the belief that nothing could be done, then we made failure certain. "As the New Year opens we need the will to believe and go forward." "The West was founded on courage. The men and women who treked up the Missouri . Valley and spread out on the Kansas plains had nothing— absolutely nothing. They had to raise a living from the soil, build themselves shelter from the weather, organize trade and markets, build roads and railroads. They had to do all this without reserves to tide them over the years of drought and grass - hoppers. "But they were not flabby creatures. They faced the future resolutely determined to wring success from adverse conditions. Noth- </seg>
            <seg id="p751">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION ing daunted them. If one season went wrong they took a hitch in their belts and drove ahead. Only after years of relentless effort was their courage rewarded with the building of a stable civilization west of the Mississippi. "Men and women of such stock would be unworthy of their great heritage if they failed to meet present difficulties with the old spirit. True, times have been hard. But 'they are nothing like so hard as they were for the whole generation of the pioneer. "We have a vast- modern farm and industrial plant. We have houses and stores and hospitals and public buildings. We have rail - roads and highways and markets and sound banks. We have large reserves and great resources. We have experienced and competent workers and industrial leaders. "In the last year the country as a whole has faced real dif - ficulties. But these have been greatly increased by timidity and loss ot nerve that almost parallzed action. Difficulties remain. But they can be overcome If they are intelligently and courageously met. "The country is down to. brass tacks. It is up to the West to show that it has not grown soft since pioneer days; that it has not lost the spirit of its forebears. If it has the old will to believe in the future, it can make 1932 march to its command. "Courage is the first need today — and courage is the inheritance of the West." • It is with that spirit, it seems to me, that we must carry on now. And while we await the appearance of the competent and inspiring leadership which will certainly conduct us triumphantly out of our difficulties, what better can we do than adopt Bill Whites' suggestion and "Tinker here and there at the small immediate problems." A practice which all of us farmers, I believe, might now, at the turn of the New Year, Inaugurate to our great advantage, is carefully to plan our operations for the coming months and make actual budgets reflecting our plans and expectations. I have followed this practice for years and have found it most helpful. I am sure he succeeds most often who has a clear mental picture of his objective and has studied his approach, plotted his course and computed the probable cost of reaching it. One of my own small, immediate problems is a load of fat yearlings, which I am going to exhibit next week at the Denver Live - stock Show. I take solid comfort in their companionship. I have found that, while putting in my best licks to contribute to their comfort and chance of winning in the coming competition, I am abso - lutely not oppressed by a consciousness of the reality of the great depression and our difficult plight. </seg>
            <seg id="p752">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE If I merit the title of feedlot philosopher it is by virtue of a Bure recognition of the fact that hard physical labor can justly -take rank among man's greatest blessings. Another of my. small, immediate problems has been to assemble a bunch of promising calves with which to carry on operations during the present year, for I do not doubt that, -whatever happens to the world, our livestock markets will continue to function and beef will still have a place in our diet. In line with that purpose I have lately been down, on the Matador Ranch prowling for calves. There, riding from dawn until dark, over a wide, rugged, snow-swept landscape, ■ I found complete absorption and surcease from worry in my small, immediate task. And momentarily I was in expectation of coming upon the legendary "wonder calf" who in his finished form, might perhaps contribute to the winning of a carlot championship at the International. Evenings we sat before a big fire of mesquite branches in Rustler Camp — Shorty, "Little Boy", L. D., Billy and I — and dis - cussed subjects that have no bearing on the breakdown of the world or the fate of civilization. Sometimes a farmer would ride in through the dark from his humble, home miles away on the high plains above the Caprock — his mission to obtain a permit to cut mesquite for fuel inside the Matador fences. Invariably these visitors were cheerful, in spite of the fact that their cotton was selling for less than 5 cents per pound and "bundle feed" at 2% cents a bundle. In the language of one of them, whose small immediate problem included the support of a wife and twelve small children, they were quite generally better off "as far as actual eating goes" than they had been for three years past. ! They had raised and canned . vegetables during the summer, and had laid in enough cheap wheat at threshing time to supply them with bread for a year and a few maize-fed ' hogs furnished their meat, supply. The point- is, they appeared to be happy and, after all, what more can we demand of life than happiness? Of the stamp of these Texas farmers — in their economic and social status — were our forebears, who ventured into this country beyond the Missouri, three score years ago and made it what it is today. Who is not proud to own blood kinship with these sturdy men and women? Who dares to claim they lived in vain? If we invoke their spirit now and combat adversity as courageously as they met it, then, we shall win as gloriously as they won. With that spirit let us tackle our small immediate problems and "With God be the rest^if any." H. J. GRAMLICH: We have one more paper. We are now going to hear from our Nebraska Dan. </seg>
            <seg id="p753">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATE IF WE WEATHER THE STORM *~~" DAN HILDEBRAND The subject that has been assigned to me covers plenty of terri - tory, for which I am thankful, "If We Weather the Storm." Unfortunately, there Is a large number of worthy feeders of livestock who question just now whether they will be able to weather the storm or not. In checking back over the past two years, the records probably disclose that paper profits of Wall Street stocks van - ished from day to day until there was no value left. We have seen our livestock prices go down from day to .day, in which the losses have run Into the millions of dollars. Livestock is so different than stocks that sell in Wall Street In that when one realizes that they must suffer a loss, they of course can place a "stop loss order," which eliminates any further loss. With our livestock we must continue to feed them from day to day, regardless of the loss that we know is apparent, on account of the livestock not being finished, and of course, having very little value in Its unfinished condition. However, out of adversity must come success to those that are able to weather the storm, for the lesson they will learn will bear fruit as the years roll along. I am wondering if a better balanced farm is not in process of being built just now on account of the problems that we have had to deal with on account of the world wide depression. Probably we will go to raising just a little more grass. Probably we will creep - feed our calves instead of attempting to buy a large number of feeder cattle in the fall of the year. Probably we will raise our feeder pigs, arrange to feed a better balanced ration, and cut production to. the point where we know a fair profit can be made on the class of livestock that we produce. Never in the history of our country has the farmer and livestock grower been confronted with the many marketing problems that he is confronted with just now. Consequently, those that have the cour - age to look to the future when conditions will be different, are the ones that will weather the storm, for the character building of such men and women cannot help but be the strong and outstanding citi - zens that have always gone forward in times of trouble and distress. I believe that we are facing a period in which agriculture and the livestock Interests will be put on a more profitable basis and it will likely continue over a period of time. It has been clearly demon - strated to the satisfaction of everyone that regardless of the articles produced or the merit it may have in the human diet, that the price cannot be artificially held high without disastrous results to </seg>
            <seg id="p754">REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1 the future crops or the marketing of the surplus that accumulates under such conditions. . Every country that has ever tried to hold up a commodity price that is used universally, has been doomed to failure. That has been clearly demonstrated by our wheat and cotton program promoted by the present Farm Board. In fact, the old law of supply and demand will eventually win out, and it behooves each and every individual to study the market conditions more closely than | they have heretofore, in order that they may not produce an excessive amount so they can market whatever surplus that they might have on a basis that will bring them a fair return. i It certainly takes a stout heart, a lot of will power, and con - fidence in the future to attempt to either grow or feed livestock under present conditions, but in the years that have gone by, success has come to those that would - have confidence in the future, and made every effort to make this great country of ours a larger, better, and happier place to live in. I am sure that there is a larger number of individuals in Ne - braska who have weathered Just as hard a storm as the present one, yet they had the confidence, and have been rewarded richly for the. efforts that they have put forth, so let us look to the bright side of the coming of tlie year 1932, and each and every one work to the end where confidence will be restored and business will move forward and put aside any prejudice. that we may have had to the manufactur - ing centers to our east in that we realize we must have a market for the products that we produce, and on account of the world's con - dition, in which foreign markets are almost closed to what we have to sell, means that we must strive just that much harder to build within our own borders a better marketing system in which the larger portion of our grain and livestock is marketed on a domestic basis. Let this be the cornerstone so that we will be able as time goes on to recall the time that we did weather the storm, which is likely to be the longest and most disastrous depression the world has ever known. I thank you. </seg>

As one looks through seed catalogs and literature advertising seed' potatoes, the long list of variety names of potatoes is appalling and confusing. Too often seedsmen are want to apply a new name to an old variety. A certain field, let us say, of Rose potatoes, because of good soil, good care, and favorable weather, pro - duces an. exceptionally large yield of fine quality Rose potatoes. The grower wishes to sell the crop as seed. The name Rose is a very common name so he decides to call his potatoes Extra-Early- Fullbasket, or Somer's Extra Early. He advertises his large yield and thus we have another name added to our long list of Rose po - tatoes, but no new potato has been offered to the public. As a result of this and similar methods, we now have Clark's No. 1, Early Durham, Early Fortune, Early Maine, Early Norther, Holton Rose, Lee's Fa - vorite. Seneca Beauty and twenty other names all applied to the Rose potato. True, all of these twenty-eight named Rose potatoes are not exactly alike. However, many are identically the same, and the differences between the others are only small, and probably do not justify being named as different varieties. Practically all potatoes have been renamed and mis-named until now a grower can hardly know what kind of a potato he is getting when he purchases seed under a given name. William Stuart, horti - culturist m the U. S. Department .of Agriculture, has attempted a classification of potato varieties grown m the United States. Dr. Stuart has classified all of the long list of names into eleven groups. His work is published m United States Department of Agri - culture Bulletin No. 176. This bulletin may be obtained by writing this department at Washington, D. C. The twelve groups here set forth are: Cobbler, Triumph, Early Michigan, Rose, Early Ohio, GDDFG GLEN HARTMANN University -of Wyoming </seg>
            <seg id="p760">KEPOHT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE ■ i . Hebron. Burbank, Green Mountain, Rural, Pearl, and Peach Blow. Practically any potato grown commercially in the United States. will classify into one of these twelve groups. After. all, we do not have so many different kinds of potatoes. Potato varieties are identified and classified by studying and de - scribing the vines, flowers, tubers, and sprouts of the tuber. The sprouts must be grown in the dark. Potato vinos differ in their size, shape, color (darker green or light green) size and shape of leaf, and in, dates of maturity. The flower differs in color, size, shape, and number upon a vine. .The tubers vary in shape, color of skin, size, number, and color of eyes. The sprouts when grown in the dark differ in shape and color of their base and leaf scales. To illus - trate, the Bliss Triumph has a dwarfed, compact, not much branched, and dark green vine. The Burbank has a large, rugged, much branched, and lighter green vine. The flowers of the Triumph are. purple or rose - lilac in color, while the flowers of the Burbank are white. Triumph tubers are round with blunt ends with slight to distinct shoulders. The Burbank tuber is long, cylindrical, or slightly flattened' in shape. If you . are interested in identifying potato varieties I would again refer you to Dr. Stuart's bulletin. In this particular section we are interested chiefly in the Cobbler and Bliss Triumph varieties of potatoes. This is because we find a more ready market for these varieties than others and these varieties are reasonably well adapted to our soil and climate conditions. How - ever, at least some improvement is desirable. We should like a potato which would not become diseased, would produce a better yield under our conditions and which would not give us so much trouble in storage and transportation. As a result, much effort is now being put forth to develop new varieties or new strains of old varieties which will be an improvement over. the ones we now have. Much progress is being made. It behooves us to keep posted in these devel - opments because they may' change our market demands and may make it necessary to change varieties. Our standard and commercial varieties of today were originated during the period of 1850 to 1890, some fifty years ago. Since that time progress has been made in obtaining better varieties. The absence of progress has not been due to the lack of effort, but probably duo to the use of wrong methods of improvement. The potato is a native of America. When the Spaniards invaded Peru in 1524 they found that the potato was a common article of food among the Indians. The Incas of Peru had developed innumer - able varieties. Potatoes were introduced into Europe in the latter part of the sixteenth century. They came into general cultivation in Europe and North America about two hundred years later. It was not. however, until about 1850. that progress was made In either Europe or North America, in producing varieties better adapted to </seg>
            <seg id="p761">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION (afferent soil and climatic conditions. Since that time little improve - ment has been made in spite of the many efforts made toward im - provement. The methods employed to secure improved varieties of potatoes may be conveniently divided into (1) clonal or tuber selection and (2) sexual or true seed breeding. These two methods are funda - mentally different. Much work has been done by selecting tubers. Selections have been made in the field and in the bin. Tuber unit methods and hill selections have been used. Seed stocks from seven growers were used in a study. All seven seed stocks were of the same variety. Two of these stocks had been selected by the growers for twenty years. Both the growers of this seed stock and their neighbors thought they had a superior strain of this variety. However, when they were brought under controlled conditions and accurately tested, they were found to be no better in yield or quality than the other five seed stocks which had not been selected. In fact, one of the five unselected stocks proved to be slightly higher in yielding ability although the difference was not significant. The results of the study on productivity of the seed stocks led to the conclusion that selection for twenty years by two growers has had no effect in increasing the yield of these two stocks above the normal yield of that variety. The results strongly suggest that there was no inherent difference in productivity among these seven lots. A study of 84 seed lots of the Early Ohio variety indicates that there was no significant difference between these seed lots, if each lot was free from disease. In 1926 we gathered seed samples from two growers of Bliss Triumph potatoes. The growers lived in different localities. Each had been selecting for fifteen years and selecting for type. One was a true desirable type. Tubers of the other were rather long in type. These were planted side by side in 1926. Both produced tubers of the same type. In 1927 seed from both lots which had been grown at Laramle in 1926 was planted on the farms of each grower. Both lots produced tubers of the same type on each farm. In one case both lots produced tubers of the round type, in the other case, both lots produced tubers of the long type. Again in 1928 seed of both lots were again planted in Laramle and again produced tubers of identical type. In 1929 and 1930 this test was repeated in six different localities of the -state. The same results were obtained. The results of the five years' work show that the two growers who had practiced selection for fifteen or more years had failed to isolate a form of tuber differing from the normal of the variety. It was further found that differences in tuber type between seed from different growers was not carried over to the progeny. The difference in type was evidently due to different growth conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p762">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE j In all the studies of variability within a variety the evidence obtained points strongly to the conclusion that important hereditary differences are not occurring in the variety. No evidence has been obtained that would Justify the practice of any of the methods of tuber selection other than as an aid to the control of disease. I may say here that I do not intend to infer that tuber selection is not important. In the case of certified seed production such forms of tuber selection as tuber indexing, tuber unit, hill selection, and mass selection have a very important place in freeing the seed stocks of disease and making them uniform in date of maturity. However, such methods have not developed any changes in the inherited characters of the variety. They have been useful In lowering the disease content and controlling certain disease, but have not brought about any im - portant change in the variety Itself. Still it is not to be denied that some changes or Improvement In varieties is desirable. The early types will Illustrate this condi - tion. Bliss Triumph, owing to its red tuber color and its limited climatic adaptability, is restricted In production to special regions and In consumption to certain markets. Furthermore, great difficulty is experienced In maintaining seed stocks of this variety free from diseases. The Irish Cobbler has deep eyes .with a consequent incon - venience in peeling and waste in utilization; a condition that is a trial to the housewife and should. not exist. Early Ohio has a ten - dency to form knobs and growth cracks when growth conditions vary slightly throughout the season. This frequently results in serious economic losses to the grower. The American grower who desires to produce early potatoes, or who finds quick maturing varieties more desirable for his condition's, is limited to a choice of these three varieties. . , In recent years much attention has been given to sexual breeding of potatoes. True seed is produced in "seed balls" produced by the flowers in the top of the vine. These seeds are produced by the union of pollen and egg cells, which produces new combinations of characters. Hence new kinds of potatoes are produced. The potato is normally self-fertilized. That Is, pollen from a flower fertilizes the egg of the same flower. Hence the characters of two plants are not combined. However, they will cross pollinate. This Is what the plant breeder does. Hence, the characters of two plants are combined. This process of deriving new varieties requires more time than it may at first appear. This is because of technique problems involved. Many varieties do not produce seed balls freely and hence seed Is hard to obtain. Again some varieties produce but little virile pollen. Many crosses, when made, prove to be sterile and cannot be continued. These seeds are very small and difficult to handle and secure plants. Plants must be carried over In the green- </seg>
            <seg id="p763">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION house as they do not produce tubers until the second year. Then again, when plants are produced, they must be studied carefully, the desirable ones selected and carefully tested. So one can see that while this method of potato improvement appears to have great possibilities it requires much time to produce results. Much work is now under way. The United States Depart - ment of Agriculture on its various farms, such as their farms in Maine and at Greeley, Colorado, have already produced many thou - sands of new plants from true seed of the potato. Many of these new varieties are now being tried and tested. Many give promise of being much improved as compared to the standard varieties. Many states such as Minnesota, California, New York, and others are conducting this work through their state colleges. So it may be that the potato grower will soon be able to avail himself of new varieties better adapted to his climate and soil conditions and at the same time be better suited to his market demands. POTATO INSPECTION GROWS BECAUSE OF BENEFITS OFFERED . E. F. McKUNE U. S. Department of Agriculture, Denver, Colo. Ladies and Gentlemen: This section of Nebraska holds an enviable position m the potato industry. of the United States. You, through your certified seed organ-' izatlon, probably ship more certified Triumph potato seed than any other state m the Union. You have a good reputation. This reputation has come as a result of long and tireless efforts on the part of your directors, manager and growers. You have persistently fought to establish and main - tain your reputation through the shipment of fine quality products. You have given the buyers m your markets the grades that were demanded. Had you permitted your quality to be - come poorer, or had insisted on shipping the size or grade that were not wanted by the southern buyers, the reaction would have been immediate. Your trade would have looked elsewhere for their seed stock. They would have found it, too, for any potato district In the country would be more than glad to "grab" your markets. DGFDFFGDF E. Y. McKUNE Bureau of Market! Denver, Colo. </seg>
            <seg id="p764">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I This season your directors and manager have arranged for Fed - eral-State inspection. It was not their purpose to thrust any more expense or Inconvenience upon you. Their idea was, I believe, to add a service that would assist your organization to maintain your quality standards and at the same time add a service that would assist in the selling of your products. This brings us to my subject — Federal-State Inspection of Pota - toes. In discussing this subject I will endeavor to show how it applies to Nebraska and particularly its application to your organization. Inspection of fruits and vegetables is not. new. In fact. Federal inspection has been in operation since 1917, when it was first adopted as a war measure. This first service was restricted to receiving mar - kets only. This limited service functioned until 1922. Then by an act of Congress the department of agriculture was authorized to extend the service to shipping points. The shipping point service since the first has been carried on In cooperation with the various state departments of agriculture. Here in Nebraska the work Is only possible through cooperation with your state department of agriculture, and. if It were not for your state department of agriculture, inspection would not be available in Ne - braska today. Early in the history of the service only a few states availed them - selves of Inspection. As time passed more and more states were added. At the present time all but two states are cooperating. The two-excep - tions are states which produce very few cars of fruits or vegetables for shipment. You may be interested in knowing something of the volume of the work. The number of cars inspected each year has shown a steady growth. At first comparatively few cars carried certificates. Last year more than 300,000 cars were certified, covering more than seventy different kinds of fruits or vegetables. In addition, inspections were made on nuts, flower bulbs and root stock. Early in the history of- inspection Nebraska had inspection, but because of lack of support It was practically dropped in 1923. In 1929, Klmball county petitioned your secretary of agriculture for inspection. That year Kimball county was the only part of the state using the service. Last year Scotts Bluff asked for and was given the service. This present season we find the work available in Kimball, Scotts Bluff, Morrill and Dawes counties. Also, arrangements are made whereby all certified seed potatoes originating in other counties can be inspected and certified as to grade. You may ask what are the benefits to be derived from inspection and why it is necessary for you to -have your certified seed potatoes inspected, especially in view of the fact that you have your own certi - fied potato inspectors who are entirely competent. </seg>
            <seg id="p765">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION The answer to the first part of the question is this: When a car is Inspected by a Federal-State inspector a certificate is issued. This certificate can be and In many cases used as a basis of settlement between the grower and buyer. It is not necessary for either the grower or buyer to deal on the statement of the other. The trans - action is based entirely on the findings ot a third and disinterested person. After the transaction between the grower and buyer, or, in the case where the grower ships his own car, the certificate' is valuable in forcing acceptance of sales. This is especially true since the "Borah bill" or properly the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, has gone into effect. We find that shipments carrying a Federal-State certificate are much less apt to be rejected than those not inspected. And when rejections are made they are generally based on reasons that are justified. A third advantage of an inspection is in the adjustment of rail - way claims. While a certificate may sometimes stand in the way of claim settlement, we have never found them to hinder the settle - ment of a legitimate claim. In fact, there are numerous cases recorded where the certificate caused prompt settlement of claims in full, where, if it had not been for inspection, considerable controversy might have resulted. Your particular conditions here are somewhat different. You have your own certified potato inspectors who will not certify a lot or load until they meet certain specifications of your own design. Probably the greatest benefit of Federal-State inspection to the certi - fied grower is that it gives you an official document showing that you have met all the requirements of your part of the contract. If the receiver does not live U0 to his part of the contract, then by means of the certificate you have a means of forcing him to accept. </seg>
            <seg id="p766">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOW THE 8EED POTATO CERTIFICATION LAW WAS SECURED J. S. STEELE State Representative, Kimball, Nebr. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I will try and give you an outline of how the Potato Bill became a law. I was asked by the Certified Potato Growers to introduce a bill giving the certified growers some protection from crooked dealers who were passing off uncertified seed for certified seed and wrecking the certified business. I must give Professor Werner and others of the Nebraska Agri - cultural College, the credit for writing the bill at the request of those who were interested in certifying seeds of all kinds, as I knew very little about the certified business at that time. After we had the bill drawn I placed it on file with the house clerk; it was the sixty-seventh bill filed and was numbered as House Roll No. 67. All bills after being filed are read in the House twice and then referred to a committee. This committee goes through them and decides whether they are worth taking up the time of the whole House. If they feel they are worthy they report the bill out on general file. The bill is taken up and considered by the house, when its turn comes. The House resolves itself into what they call the "Committee of the Whole" to take up bills on general file. The bills are taken up a section at a time and considered. The clerk reads the first section and the chairman asks the House if they have any amend - ments to offer to section one. If there are f£ny amendments offered they are debated pro and con and then voted on to see whether amendment will be adopted or not. Often this is the way the oppo - sition takes to kill a bill. House Roll No. 67 was read the first time on January 19, then laid over till next day and read the second time January 20. The Speaker of the House referred it to the Agricultural Committee. The committee gave me a hearing on the bill January 26. They passed the bill out and reported it on general file and it was taken up in committee of the whole January 28. I found I was going to have trouble passing the bill on account of some of the wording that some of the members did not understand. I realized the best thing to do was make a motion to have the bill referred back to the Agricultural " Committee for an amendment, which I did. We rewrote the bill and it was reported back on general file January 30 as amended. It was taken up again by committee of the whole February 3, passed and ordered engrossed February 6.

House Roll No. 67 was read February 10 in the Senate for the first time, read second time February 11 and referred to the Senate Agricultural Committee. About that time the Potato Association, in company with some of the potato dealers in western Nebraska came to Lincoln with an amendment they wished placed in the bill. I was able to get the Senate committee to take up the bill while they were there and give them a hearing. The committee adopted this amend - ment and reported the bill out on general file as amended February 18. The bill was taken up in committee of the whole March 4 and advanced to third reading as amended. It was read the third time and passed 31 to 0 March 10. Then it returned to House March 10 with this Senate amendment. The House took it up and considered the Senate amendment March 11. The House concurred in Senate amendment 87 to 0. The bill was signed by the Speaker of the House March 12, presented to the Governor March 13, and signed by the Governor March 16, thus becoming a law. This is a general outline of the procedure all bills pass through to become laws. I thank you. HOW THE SOUTH VIEWS THE POTATO SITUATION In brief the gist of remarks made by J. W. Western at the annual meeting and show of the Nebraska Improvement Association, Alliance, Nebr., December 19, 20, 21, 1931. General economic conditions, over the country, do not warrant an increase in the acreage planted to potatoes by Southern growers next spring. In addition to this is the limited funds, in the hands of the Southern grower, to finance so expensive a crop, to grow, as that of early potatoes. Improved practices of building up the soil with legume crops prior to planting the potatoes, have reduced the chances of crop fail - ure. The increased use of high analysis fertilizer at higher rates of application per acre has increased the efficiency in production. The increased use of seed that is capable of producing a maximum number of healthy hills, properly spaced for the production of uniform sized tubers, makes for increased yields, better grade, and more uniform product to meet the market requirements. Thus, some of the hazards of climate are being overcome. The growers belonging to this association, by cooperating with the experiment station and extension department of your state college, have been able to improve the general quality of the certified seed </seg>
            <seg id="p768">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE' potatoes produced. This has been possible on account of an under - standing of the fundamentals of potato seed requirements, by the men in charge of the rules and regulations covering the certification of your seed potatoes. Second, their effectiveness in teaching, as well as the receptive minds of the growers interested, and third, strict enforcement of the regulations by well trained inspectors. It is apparent that the differences in the vim, vigor and vitality of seed potatoes from different states is evidence that there is merit to the work that 1b being done through the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Association, to make the best better. We in the South, believe that those sections having the natural advantages of soil, climate and proximity to market, will be in a position .to remain in business as long as the returns generally exceed the costs. Good uniform productive strains of potatoes that will be ready for the early market crop will be a powerful factor in helping those Southern sections determine which will remain the dominant factors in the early potato game. We have found in the past, to a considerable extent, and still do find sources of certified seed from Nebraska that still lacks uni - formity in tuber type, maturity and yield, but are still comparatively free of the apparent virus diseases. These variations have a decided influence on the appearance . of the potatoes produced, particularly the tubers produced from the late maturing plants. It would be my suggestion that the best of the seed should always be kept for foundation stock to be used for your own planting seed. A good big 'seed lot should be maintained by every grower. Only seed from the best type healthy plants should be saved for planting. All off type plants should be rougued from the fields before harvesting. Your location, high elevation, light rainfall, and freedom from a great host of insects, probably does exert a real influence on the high quality of the product you produce. This, coupled with intelli - gent planting on the parf of the grower, should continue to make this a leading quality seed producing section of the country. Too much success will certainly bring competition. We In the South, are going to watch your progress. Our favorable sections, so fortunate as to be in position to secure the sources of seed that will give the best results for our present market, will probably be the section that will be dominant in the production of the early potato crop. As a parting word of caution, let me ask that you keep your standards high and your prices within reason. </seg>

            <seg id="p776">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE SPECIAL/ MEETING Minutes of the Special Meeting of the Directors of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association In Conjunction with the Directors of the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative, Held at Alliance, February 13, 1931,— and a Brief Statement of Subsequent Events Pertaining to the Establishment of the State Seed Certification Law. Owing to the developments In the certified seed potato business in the previous season, it became evident that something should be done to put the certification work on a basis where it would have a legal and official status. Consequently during the fall of 1930 and early winter of 1931 a bill was written and In January. 1931, was introduced into the State Legislature by Representative Steele of Kimball. This bill provided for all seed certification work to be done by the College of Agriculture or some one agency designated by It for any one crop. As there seemed to be considerable question in the minds of those who had given this matter considerable thought whether the Agricultural College could designate the Nebraska Certi - fied Potato Growers Cooperative as its agent for certifying if the latter continued with its sales contract with growers, a meeting was called at Alliance to consider ways and means of organizing the seed potato industry, so that the certification law, if passed, could be put into force. : The following three propositions were given consideration: 1. That the certification work be transferred to the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association; 2. That the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers Cooperative be approved as the agent for certifying seed potatoes, providing that It make the matter of a sales contract optional on the part of each grower desiring certification; 3. That the Cooperative be designated the agency for certifying with Its compulsory sales contract in force, providing certain conces - sions should be made to those able to find a market for their own seed potatoes. The first or second of these plans were favored by the Agricul - tural College, which organization felt that the bill as then in the Legislature, would not permit the third plan. After a very thorough and animated discussion in which practically everybody participated, the meeting went on record as favoring the third plan. The Co - operative appointed a committee to come to Lincoln to confer with proper parties In the Agricultural College and to see such members of the State Legislature as might be necessary in order to find some </seg>
            <seg id="p777">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION way out of the difficulty. (A very detailed record of this meeting la on file among the records of the Secretary. This brief abstract, however, seems to be an adequate record of this event.) On February 14, William Morrow, manager of the Cooperative, and Mr. Metz, the attorney for the Cooperative, conferred with the various men from the Agricultural College concerned with this matter. On February 17 a committee of western Nebraska certified seed potato growers appeared before the Senate committee on agriculture, re - questing favorable action on the seed certification bill and requesting further that the bill be amended so as to permit the College of Agriculture to appoint as its certification agency for potatoes, a co - operative that might require a sales contract of Its members. In due course of time this bill was passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor and became the present State Seed Certification Law. A Special Meeting of the Board of Directors Was Held at the Alliance Hotel, August 18, 18S1. Those present were: Nielsen, Pedrett, Young, Kutchara and Werner. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved. After discussion concerning the vacancy caused in the Board by the death of A, H. Hullng in February It was decided that the vacancy should not be filled until the election In December. On motion by W. T. Young, seconded by Max Kutchara, Marx Koehnke was appointed acting secretary-treasurer to serve while H. O. Werner is out of the state on leave of absence for advanced study from October, 1931 to June, 1932. Passed unanimously. Motion by Werner and Kutchara and unanimously passed— that 4-H Club members be permitted to enter any one exhibit of potatoes in only one class, but that they be permitted to enter the standard classes with separate exhibits — also that more emphasis be placed on cups and ribbons and less on cash prizes. Motion by Young and Werner: That the annual potato conven - tion and show be held at Alliance preferably the week of December 8th and prior to any general agricultural meetings of western Or - ganized Agriculture. Passed. Motion by Pedrett and Kutchara: That Werner be allowed to expend up to $250 for travel expenses In the interest of the Nebraska potato industry while he is at Chicago on leave of absence.

President Jake Pedrett called the meeting to order in the offlceB of the Certification Department of the Nebraska Certified Seed Potato Growers. The following members were present: W. T. Young, Jr., Kimball; Jake Pedrett, Kimball; Max Kutchara, Hay Springs; C. A. Buehler, Gering; Anton Stenberg, Alliance; Marx Koehnke, Alliance. Minutes of the last Annual Meeting and Executive Meeting were read and approved. Discussion relative to the New Orleans meeting of the Potato Association of America followed, after which a motion was made by. W. T. Young, Jr., seconded by C. A. Buehler, as follows: That Dr. R. W. Goss be requested to go as representative of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association, to the New Orleans meet - ing of the Potato Association of America, and in the event that Dr. Goss found it impossible to go, Marx Koehnke was selected as alter - nate. Motion carried. ■ Discussion relative to the next potato show followed. In this discussion it was decided that encouragement' of 4-H Potato Clubs throughout western Nebraska was one of the most valuable means of promoting both the show and the potato industry in general. The next matter discussed was means of Increasing the attend - ance of the next show. All expressed their opinion that the small attendance was deplorable, in face of the fact that we were expending considerable money for speakers and other arrangements of the show. The increase of exhibits was also discussed. A vigorous opinion was expressed in regard to having meetings of the potato show at the same time meetings were being held before Organized Agriculture. The opinion was expressed that it was satisfactory to have the meet - ings during the same week, but by all means not simultaneously with Organized Agriculture. One means suggested of increasing the num - ber of exhibits was that of payment for each entry made. This matter was not definitely decided, however. President Pedrett appointed Win. Morrow and Marx Koehnke to answer Professor Werner's letter as read before the banquet meeting. Motion for adjournment was- made at 10:30 P. M. MARX KOEHNKE, Acting Secretary. </seg>

HARRY KNUDSEN, Secretary. NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION MINUTES OF ANNUAL MEETING January 7, 1932 The annual meeting of the Nebraska State Poultry Association was convened on January 7, 1932, m the Garden Room of the Lincoln Hotel, Lincoln, Nebraska. The meeting was called to order at 8 o'clock P. M; by President Erie Smiley. PRESIDENT: We will listen'to the roll call. Roll Call by the Secretary showed all officers present. PRESIDENT: We will have the minutes of the last meeting. The minutes of the last meeting were read by the Secretary. PRESIDENT: You have heard the reading of the minutes of the last meeting. If there are no alterations or corrections they will stand approved. There being none, they are approved. </seg>
            <seg id="p782">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE There being nothing presented under unfinished business the- President called for the report of the Secretary. SECRETARY'S REPORT The Forty-seventh Annual Exhibition of the Nebraska State Poul - try Association was held at Lincoln, Nebraska, from January 4th to 8th, inclusive, 1932. This was held at the College of Agriculture In a building formerly known as the Judging Pavilion. This was the nrst time that the State Poultry Show was ever held on the State College grounds at Lincoln. During the week of the Poultry Show every other organized effort of Agriculture was taking place, as this was the week of Organized Agriculture. All in all, this should have been a week of great success, as the poultry show, while not as large as usual, was top-notch with many fine specimens, and a great variety of not only the standard breeds, but also of the rare as well. However, the weather was the one handi - cap, for it began to snow and blow the day the show opened and did not subside till after the show had closed. Those that were at the show were favored as they could not get away, and those that were not at the show, never got there for the roads were impassable. A wonderful program, with good speakers, demonstrations and discussions was gotten up by the State Poultry Department, and It really was a shame that more people could not have attended. It was a free admission show and should have drawn well, if the weather had permitted. An unusual 4-H Club display was staged this year at the Nebraska State Poultry Show, under the auspices of the Agricultural College, Poultry Department. The Nebraska State Poultry Association alloted one hundred dollars in caBh for premiums in the 4-H Class for poultry and for eggs, and an unusual exhibit was brought out by the boys and girls of Nebraska. " • ■ The Hatchery Flock display which was eligible only to flock owners who sold their eggs to a qualified hatchery, was the bright spot of the show. Competition was keen and birds were of the finest quality. It was a sensation to Nebraska and the surrounding states to see the wonderful quality in the hatchery class. Many beautiful silver loving cups and trophies donated by the Omaha Poultry Asso - ciation were awarded in the hatchery class, as well as several cash prizes donated by the Nebraska Baby Chick Association in addition to the regular cash prizes. The Egg Show was also unusual. There were over a hundred dozen eggs on display and was without a doubt one of the finest egg displays ever held in the State of Nebraska. This department has grown, year after year, due to the fine co-operation of the State Poultry Department. </seg>
            <seg id="p783">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION The banquet which was held In the Garden Room of the Lincoln Hotel, was very well attended. A wonderful group of short speeches were given. Among them was a short talk by the Honorable L. P. Harris, breeder of Brown Leghorns from Lincoln, Nebraska, who has attended and exhibited at almost every show during the life of the Nebraska State Poultry Association, and who is of course the oldest living member of the Association. Much credit is due to Judge Erie Smiley of Seward, Nebraska, for his help in this past show, and he, too, gave a short and interesting speech. The guest speaker of the evening, however, was Perry Reed, president of the State Fair Asso - ciation, who spoke some very fine words in favor of the State Poultry Association, officers and members. It has always been the fond hope of Secretary George Jackson of the Agricultural Department of the State of Nebraska, who is also Secretary of the State Fair, who by virtue of his position has the handling of the funds appropriated by the State of Nebraska for the Nebraska State Poultry Association, that the State Show could be held during the Week of Organized Agriculture on the State Agricultural grounds, and of course his wishes were. fulfilled this year, and had not the weather interfered we believe it would have been one of the greatest State Poultry Shows ever held. In Burning up the year's work of your secretary It is well to remember that the Nebraska State Poultry Association is not only Interested in putting on an annual State Show but that it is interested In every phase of the poultry industry. Your president and secretary are always alert to attend any meeting in the state that pertains to the industry. This past year they have attended the American Poultry Association meeting held in Peoria, Illinois, International Baby Chick Association meeting at Louisville, Kentucky, the Nebraska Improve - ment Association meetings, all meetings . held at the Agricultural College, such as the Nebraska Hatcherymen's meeting, the Nebraska Poultry Dealers meeting. Field Day, and last, but not least, the annual Poultry Show at Lincoln. We believe we are safe in saying at this time, that of all the agricultural interests on the farm in these days of seemingly bad depression, that the poultry industry stands out head and shoulders above all other farm commodities as a dollars and cents value upon which the farmer can depend. PRESIDENT: We will now have the report of the Treasurer. The Treasurer presented his report, which was as follows: </seg>

The motion was seconded and unanimously carried. PRESIDENT: Are there any committees to report? No response. PRESIDENT: Are there any communications or correspondence? SECRETARY: I might say that all bills are paid, and the. only item of correspondence I have is a letter from the Chamber of Com - merce of Grand Island, signed by their commissioner, inviting the </seg>
            <seg id="p785">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION State Poultry Association to hold our next annual meeting at Grand Island. PRESIDENT: Are there any other communications? SECRETARY: That is all. PRESIDENT: Is there anything under the head of New Business? If there 1b nothing else, I would say that in 1923 our then Secretary not only disappeared with the money we had in the treasury, but also with our books, all the books the association had. In the last few years we have been operating under suspicion; no one knew what the by-laws or what the constitution was. At the semi-annual meeting at the State Fair I was appointed a committee of one to either find the old by-laws or rewrite, to the best of my ability, by-laws for the Association. I spent a great deal of time in going over the files in the state library and in the Secretary of. State's office, and the only thing I could find was the Articles of Incorporation, original, passed in 1892. We found an old book and we took out what we could find in there, and now we have a set of by-laws that I am going to submit to you tonight; and first I will submit to you an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation. The reason this amendment had to be placed as it is, is that the officers used to be elected every year. And now Article 9 is to be amended as follows: "Article 9 — The officers of this corporation shall consist of a Presi - dent, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall consist of nine members of the Associa - tion, to-wit: The President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and live others. The officers shall be elected by a majority vote by ballot at the annual meeting of the stockholders." Now here is where the change comes in: The amendment provides that the Board of Direc - tors shall consist of the President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer and six others instead of five, making ten members of the Board of Directors. Then here is the main change: "The President, Vice Presi - dent, Secretary and Treasurer shall serve for one year or until their successors- have been elected and qualified. Two members of the Board of Directors shall be elected each year to serve for three years. Vacan - cies in office occurring during the term by resignation, removal or death of any of the above mentioned officers shall be filled by the Board of Directora." That is the by-law under which we have been operating for several years but there was no record of it. What will you do with it? MR. KNUDSEN: I move that the amendment to the by-laws be adopted as just read. MR. SCHWERIN: I second the motion. PRESIDENT: You have heard the motion; all in favor say Aye, contrary No. The motion is carried (No dissenting voice). </seg>

Ballot having been taken- the tellers reported the following vote- For Erie Smiley, 18; for Mr. Klingeman, 1; for Mr. Tlmmons. 1. Mr. Ellis moved that the informal ballot be made formal and the Secretary cast the unanimous vote of the meeting for Erie Smilev for President. The motion was seconded, carried unanimously, the Secretary cast the ballot as directed and declared Mr. Smiley duly elected. PRESIDENT: The organization has been rather kind to me. Last year when I decided I would be a candidate for office I put on a big campaign, as you know. Well, in fact there was quite a little scrap - ping as to whether we would have a candidate for President at all but you elected me. You people do not realize how much you can help your officers. There are many things to be done in connection with an exhibition; getting the coops to the ground; getting feed to the ground; getting the bedding; and the fact of the matter is we found we had. let our Articles of Incorporation slip until we were In arrears lor four years and no one knew we had a tax to pay, and that had to be looked up and taken care of. It looks like all a President had to do was to preside at a few meetings, but that is not by any means the case. But you have given me a great deal of assistance, but there is one thing I wish you would do; when I write y6u a letter I would like to have you answer me; and that goes for a lot of you. I will perhaps have occasion to call on most of you men for a little help this year, so please remember that and answer me. I thank you very kindly for giving me the office again. You will prepare your informal ballots for Vice President. Your present Vice President is Martin Norberg. The report of the tellers showed for Mr. Schwerin 3 votes; for Mr. Klingeman, 1 vote; for Mr. Norberg 15 votes, and for Mr. Jewel 1 vote. " On motion of Mr. Bender, seconded by Mr. Schwerin, the Secre - tary was instructed to cast the unanimous ballot for Mr. Norberg. The informal ballot was made formal, the ballot was cast by the Secretary and Mr. Norberg was declared unanimously elected as Vice President for the ensuing year. MR. NORBERG: I thank you very much for the office. PRESIDENT: You will now prepare your ballots for Secretary. On this ballot the tellers reported 18 votes for Mr. Knudsen and 1 vote for Mr. P </seg>
            <seg id="p794">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mr. Ellis moved that the informal ballot be made formal and the Treasurer cast the unanimous vote for Mr. Knudsen as Secretary. The motion was seconded and carried. MR. BURNHAM: By your ballot you have elected Mr. Knudsen as your Secretary for the coming year, and I hereby cast the ballot. Mr. Knudsen was declared elected. MR. KNUDSEN: Men and Ladies — It has been really an unusual pleasure this year to work with. Mr. Smiley. You men who have been on the Board for some time learned to work with Mr. Tharp. There are some things Mr. Smiley has been able to bring out more thoroughly and his help this year has been wonderful. ' It almost seems a crime that we should go on last year and this without an inventory to learn what is the matter. It may be the conditions. I don't want to make a speech, but I want to give you a thought. The matter is among the exhibitors themselves. I wish some of you could go through the premium lists of Missouri, Kansas and Iowa, their state shows catalog, and compare it with ours, dollar for dollar, and you will find our entry fee Is less than any of the rest and the premiums are about thirty-three per cent higher than any of those states. Then it simmers down to the point of whether the organization is functioning correctly. I don't think it is. I think Mr. Smiley has some Ideas that will bring to light some things that will be necessary in order to make this next show a more permanent and a better show. In closing I want to thank each of you folks here because your exhibits, your help and your influence has had a great deal to do with the success that we have had this year. And I want to thank Mr. Smiley again, and also Mr. Mussehl and Mr. Reddltt of the University, and in fact the whole University Poultry Department for their assistance, for what they did and they did it well. You perhaps didn't notice the 4-H exhibits; Mr. Jackson allotted $100 for that department and it was not quite taken up, and I want to warn the department that next year we will have that much more in addition to the $100, and wherever we meet we will have that for our use. One man told us today at the Capitol that the appropriation from the State is not enough for the 4-H depart - ment, and we may be able to get something there, one-way or the other. And wherever the next show may be I assure you I will do my utmost to serve, and try to please everyone. MR. REDDITT: One remark about the catalog put out this year. We have seen several that were put out this year and the more we see of them the more we think of the one put out by the officers of this association. We can compliment the officers here for a very fine catalog which they put out this year. Ballot having been taken for the office of Treasurer, the tellers announced the following result: Mr. Burnham having no opposition, received the full nineteen votes. And may I say that is the fourth </seg>
            <seg id="p795">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION time that I know of that Mr. Burnham has received every vote Jn the room. MR. SCHWERIN moved that the Secretary cast the unanimous ballot for Mr. Burnham as Treasurer for the coming year. The motion was seconded, stated by the President, and was carried unanimously; and Mr. Burnham was declared elected. PRESIDENT: Next you will prepare your ballots for two mem - bers of the Board of Directors. The out-going- members are Mr. Skinner and Mr. Bender. While I was in New York this year a little organization was completed to be known as "The Old Guard," and I attended the meeting, and in order to become a member a man must have been a breeder of show birds for more than twenty years. I wonder how many of you can qualify. Mr. Harris, Mr. Timmons, Mr. Jewell, Mr. Skinner, Mr. Burnham, Mr. Knudsen and Mr. Smiley were. found to qualify for this distinction. Mr. Smiley and Mr. Knudsen were found to be the only two mem - bers to qualify as having attended every State Show for twenty-one years. The tellers reported on the ballot for members of the Board of Directors, as follows: For Mr. Bender, 12 votes; Mr. Skinner, 15; Mr. Klingeman, 7; Mr. Timmons, 3; Mr. Popisil, 1; Mr. Lips. 1. Mr. Ellis moved that the rules be suspended, the informal ballot be made formal and the' Secretary cast the vote of the entire organiza - tion for Mr. Bender and Mr. Skinner as members of the Board. The motion was seconded and carried, the Secretary cast the ballot, and these two members were declared elected. MR. BENDER: I wish to thank you all for your votes, and any time 1 can be -of service to you if you will let me know I will do my best. MR. SKINNER: I am not going to promise to do any more than I have, and I hope it is satisfactory. Is all that I can say. • PRESIDENT: Is there anything further? MR. REDDITT: On behalf of the" 4-H clubs I would like to express our appreciation for the co-operation given us by this asso - ciation. These boys and girls try. in every way they can, and are very appreciative of the assistance given them. I am sure you will find, as the years go on, that their work will prove their appreciation to this Board. The 4-H did not show in the poultry show this year, mostly because some of the boys lost birds and they thought there was mismanagement. But I think another year we will bring in just as many birds as Oklahoma. In judging this year Illinois won the contest, Nebraska was second and Oklahoma third. Iowa was </seg>

PRESIDENT: Tomorrow morning we are supposed to meet for our Anal meeting of the old Board and the organization of the new Hoard. In view of the weather conditions most of us have come to the conclusion it would be better to clOBe earlier and get home by Sunday if possible. So the Board will meet immediately after the adjournment of this meeting, for the adjournment of the old Board and the organization of the new Board. And if there is nothing further a motion to adjourn will be in order. A motion to adjourn was made, seconded, and carried, and the meeting was declared adjourned. </seg>

We would all like to know what the future may bring forth, but no one seems willing to accept the privilege and the responsibility of prophecy. Even the best prophets reason, as did the gentleman representing a large produce house who was sent to New York a few weeks ago to size up the demand for turkeys during the past holiday season. After a few days investigation and a few hours of deliberation he wired his partner at the buying end thusly: "Some think turkeys will be in great demand, and others think there wont be any demand at all. I do, too. Whatever you do will be wrong. Act at once." We may as well face the situation frankly and analyze our assets as well as our liabilities with respect to this turkey production job. On the asset side of the ledger we have in Nebraska all the feedstuffs needed to produce the very finest turkeys, a very favorable climate, and a liberal supply of labor wanting to be employed. On the other side of the ledger we have the disease problem which is not, however. Insurmountable, and some indefinlteness as to the probable demand next fall. There is a good possibility that the purchasing power of our customer friends will be much better, during the fall of 1932 than it was in 1931. We can face the future with sensible optimism, and still recognize that present conditions require a close scrutiny of production costs. The very difficulties of the present period may be converted into cash in the bank if we form the habit of carefully studying costs and develop a skill in keeping them down. If we do this, we here in Nebraska can surely meet any competition which will develop in turkey production in the future. ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p798">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Analyzing Costs Not much attention has so far been paid to the economics of turkey production. We do, however, have sufficient data to estimate with reasonable accuracy the cost of growing turkeys when good man - agement is exercised. The outline herewith included is not intended N n.s factual, but only to indicate the factors which must be considered in estimating possibilities. Cost analysis should always precede the actual starting of any job whether it be building a residence, a com - munity schoolhouse, or a turkey raising enterprise. Premise— Start with 1OOO Poults — Market 8OO Birds 1. Eight hundred poults raised to marketable age @ 40c each...? 320.00 2. Twenty per cent mortality — (depends on management). _ 80.00 3. Brooder house overhead (6% on $800.00 per annum) 48.00 4. Fuel for brooding (2 gallons distillate daily for 125 poults for 40 days — 6c per gallon) . 38.40 5. Litter : ..... 6.00 6. Land rental and seeding expense (6 acres @ $15.00) 90.00 7. Feed (60 lbs. per bird @ l&gt;4c per lb.) : 600.00 S. Roosting shed overhead (10&lt;# on $400.00 — 8 -units) 40.00 $1222.40 The cost per bird (average 7 months), not including labor and managerial service, is on this basis — $1.53. With good management turkeys should average 14 pounds at seven months. We do believe that even under present conditions there are good opportunities for those who really become skilled in turkey production. It is to be expected that' not all who are called will be chosen. This turkey business is no midsummer picnic adventure, but calls for faith - fulness and real discipline. This again may be a good thing because if it were too easy we might shortly have as many turkey farms as filling stations, and someone would have to take an economic spanking for overdoing the thing. A program that will work,- as the experience of many successful growers demonstrates, is built on these principles: 1. Artificial hatching of the poults so that we can use the turkey hen's time to best advantage. Good incubators with efficient operators can beat the turkey hen at the hatching job anyway. 2. Artificial brooding because it reduces labor and constitutes the first step in the sanitation program. Confinement to clean ■ brooder houses with a small board or screen floored yard so poults can be exposed to direct sunshine. Use brooder house for eight weeks. </seg>
            <seg id="p799">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION 3. Move 'eight week old poults to simple and inexpensive roosting sheds on clean range for balance of the growing period. 4. Peed complete rations but watch the costs. Feed plenty of green feed, alfalfa, clover, sudan, rape, etc. 5. Use every practical method of providing clean feed, clean water, and a clean range. If we practice the principles which we now know are sound, we can certainly control blackhead. BROODING WHITE LEGHORNS IX 8OO CHICK UNITS By MRS. C. W. WIPPERMAN Lincoln, Nebraska There is no one best method of brooding baby chicks. There are advantages and disadvantages to all methods. The method that is practical for some is not so practical for others, so every poultryman will adopt a method that best fits his poultry program, and that he, as an individual, can best manage. Some of the advantages of brooding 800 Leghorn chicks in a unit are: 1. Only one stove is necessary. 2. Fuel cost is reduced. 3. Labor costs are reduced. 4. Housing expenses are reduced because a 20x20 unit is not only adaptable for brooding chicks, but also easily converted into a standard laying house when the brooding season is over. Some of the disadvantages are: 1. The chances of crowding is greater. 2. It is more difficult to get every chick started growing quickly 'because competition is keener. 3. A large accumulation of filth in a very short time, especially when chicks are several weeks old. 4. If anything unusual should happen, such as a disease break - ing out, the danger of losing chicks is greater. Therefore, in taking care of so many chicks in one unit, we must be prepared to have the right kind of equipment. 1. A 20x20 brooder house which is 400 square feet or one-half square foot to each chick. The building should be well In - sulated, and preferably have a cement floor. 2. A large capacity oil burner brooder stove, at least a 1000 chick size. </seg>
            <seg id="p800">REPORT OF NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 3. Ten (2 ft.) chick size mash. feeders to be replaced by ten 4 foot growing size hoppers. 4. The same number of quart or half-gallon water founts to be replaced by 5 gallon water founts later. 5. Three 10 ft. wire netting roosts and usually more are needed as the chicks grow. 6. Frames made of hardware cloth on which mash hoppers are placed to keep chicks from eating wasted mash. 7. Material for making a temporary partition. In getting the brooder house ready, we thoroughly clean ceiling, walls, and floor, paying particular attention to the floor, and the walls to a height of several feet. This cleaning can be done quite effectively with hot water and lye because lye not only loosens the dirt, but also acts as a disinfectant. Use one can of lye to 15 gallons of hot water. After the room Is dry the entire interior surface is sprayed with a standard disinfectant. The hoppers, waterers and roosts are cleaned with the use of a stiff-haired scrub brush. When the chicks are small, they do not need all the space in a 20x20 so a partition is placed two feet off center. Then a 12-lnch board is placed 12 feet from the rear wall of -the 12x20 space, thus making the space 12x12 for starting the chickB. ■ The stove is set in the center of the 12x12 space. This provides enough space to properly start 800 chicks. A small compartment like this is more easily heated, and chicks will be more comfortable when cold weather prevails. After the chicks are placed in this ideal environment with sand for litter, they are given pure tepid well water to drink. The waterers are placed in a zigzag circle around the stove. Then the chick size mash hoppers filled with mash are placed between each waterer in the same relative position that the spokes of the wheel are to the hub. This puts feed and water in close range to each chick. In a couple of days the chicks are allowed more space and some of the mash hoppers are moved to the front and placed on hardware frames. This then gives room for roosts. As the chicks grow, they are given more space until at the age of six weekB, they can make Kood use of the entire 20x20. At about three or four weeks of age the chick size mash hoppers are gradually replaced by growing size, and the chick waterers by larger fountains. The -.chicks have free access to a hardware cloth sun-porch. Some of the factors which have been quite helpful to us in raising a healthier and more uniform brood of chicks are as follows: 1. A dim light at night for the first week or two gives the chick n better start because all the chicks .will be assured of feed and water. </seg>
            <seg id="p801">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION 2. It is more satisfactory to clean and disinfect the water foun - tains each time they are filled than to dope the water with cure-all remedies. 3.. The use of Band as litter has given us the very best results for the first couple weeks. We have tried straw, peat moss, alfalfa leaves, and ground corncobs. 4. A good mash well fortified with one per cent of tested cod liver oil prevents troubles with leg weakness. 5. Breaking strong rays of light through the windows and in - creasing the humidity of the room makes the chicks less nervous. Keeping the chicks calm prevents undesirable and destructive habits, the chief of which is cannibalism. 6. The more often the house is cleaned during the brooding season, the better the results. 7. The adoption of .the starvation method of preventing and con - trolling coccldiosis has been of remarkable value to us in coping with this problem, since the control of coccldiosis has always been our greatest problem. Keep feed away for four or five hours, and then give a light feed only. Repeat this procedure, clean the house thoroughly. In conclusion, it can be said that brooding 800 chicks in a unit is sound in spite of the fact that it is subject to many hazards. If all conditions are right, it is possible to raise 95 per cent of the chicks started to the age of eight or ten weeks. "WHAT EGG CONSUMERS WANT" By W. W. DAYTON This question "What Egg Consumers Want" might be dismissed with the statement that consumers want the best quality eggs at the lowest cost, but to stop there would mean failure on our part to properly visualize the possibilities of our Industry. People generally believe that eggs are good food, and they should be a part of their dally diet. They have heard quite a lot about the vitamlne contents of the eggs, and how they produce health and energy. They have been termed "edible sunshine." The public thoroughly realizes the value of eggs as food and that they .are Indispensable in pastry, not only for the flavor they convey, but In tieing together, or cementing as it were, the different Ingred - ients together. It isn't my purpose to go into a discussion of the analysis of the- value or function of eggs, but simply to make the point here that consumers of food have in mind making certain definite </seg>
            <seg id="p802">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE uses of these eggs so that besides recognizing the value of eggs they must be able to get the kind of eggs they want and like, before we will notice any increase in the use of eggs. Not all consumers demand the very finest quality of eggs. There are large qualities of medium to low grade eggs disposed, of in all markets, to people who buy on a price basis. They want a reasonably good edible egg that can be bought for the least money. These people admittedly buy this class of eggs because of their financial circum - stances, and while this represents quite a large group of people, I take it we are not so much concerned here with this class of con - sumers, for there will always be an abundance of eggs to supply them. We are interested here in what the better class of consumers want, who are willing to pay somewhat more money for their eggs, as it is in this direction we have a possibility of finding increased revenue and profit from our market eggs. Real progress has been made in the production and preparation of practically all food commodities, and people expect better quality in the food they buy. People are creatures of habit; they follow pretty much the same routine dally — at least it is their natural inclination to do this. This follows through consistently with their, selection of food for the table. It is possible with the majority of items of food to purchase by brands. If the housewife finds a brand of food that is satisfactory, she will designate that brand of food in the future when ordering from her grocer. It is easy to order; she knows what to expect; she knows the product will be satisfactory. They follow exactly the same line or reasoning when buying eggs for home consumption. The consumer wants, above all things else, uniformity of size, shape, cleanliness, texture of shell, color of shell, color of yolk, flavor of egg, and of course, it must be fresh. Uniformity of size and shape are important price-Influencing fac - tors. Little needs to be said about the importance of the cleanliness of eggs, for that is the thing that at once appeals to the eye of the consumer and Influences to quite a little extent the value of the eggs. We are all inclined to judge things by comparison and so it Is with the consumers. Not many consumers, for example, would complain about the shell texture. They wouldn't think of it in those terms. They might say those eggs didn't look so nice, or they didn't like them s-o well, without stopping to analyze, or even caring about the reasons for it. They wouldn't take into consideration that some of those eggs were produced by 25 to 50-egg hens while other eggs in the same dozen were produced by hens producing 150 to perhaps 175 eggs per year, with unbalanced rations and Improper care. Uniform shell color is extremely important, although perhaps not fully reasoned out in the minds of the consumers who may demand </seg>
            <seg id="p803">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION uniformity of color. It cannot be denied, however, that it has its appeal. Even to one who is not familiar with the problems of egg production, they are more impressed with the product if it has a standardized appearance, indicating care and attention in production which will appeal to the housewife as insuring for her a greater likeli - hood of the product being superior to miscellaneous colored lots of eggs she can buy for less money. Variation in yolk color is even more undesirable, as it also means variation in flavor, and that is the thing that will not be tolerated among the class of consumers we hope to serve. Just as people de - velop a liking for any standardized brand of goods, because of the flavor, so do they with eggs. The Secretary of the Poultry Puroducers of Central California has this to say about the yolk flavor of our Corn Belt eggs: "One of the main reasons why the eggs produced by the farm flocks in" the Corn Belt are not preferred on the market is that the yolks of the eggs contain an excessive amount of dark yellow pigment, which is caused by the hens making up a large part of their diet by the consumption of jgreen feed, upon which they range, and also by eating relatively large quantities of yellow corn. Incidentally this kind of feeding the Corn Belt hens causes a very pronounced strong or "eggy" flavor, which is not noticed in the eggs produced commer - cially in Central California where the hens are more scientifically and more carefully fed." This statement certainly presents ' a challenge to the Corn Belt egg producers. Again, however, I want to say the objection quite frequently expressed against the flavor of our Corn Belt eggs is based largely upon the sharp contrast or variation in that flavor. This, of course, reflects directly back to our production. Consumer demand cannot be built upon the variation in egg yolk flavor we have from the Corn Belt section. It is often pointed out to us that the Pacific Coast eggs are selling from 5c to 20c per dozen above the eggs produced In the middle west. That statement cannot be denied, but we can deny that it is wholly the result of the fact that they are producing a white shelled, pale yolked, or a mild flavored egg. The consumer will take a somewhat higher colored yolk, and more highly flavored yolk if it is uniform, and a trade can be devel - oped for that type of egg just as it has been developed for a light colored yolk and mild flavored egg. People acquire a liking for a high quality product that is standardized. The consumer does not object to the egg flavor from eggs properly produced, but It is the ptrong flavor from eggs improperly produced. The Pacific Coast people have built up a very large demand for the white shelled, pale colored yolks and mild flavored eggs. They </seg>
            <seg id="p804">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have gone In (or egg' production on a commercial scale; they have standardized on the breeds, standardized on the quality of eggs they produce. Their success, hasn't depended alone upon the fact that the color of the yolk Is pale or the flavor mild; their success is the result of consistently delivering to their customers a uniformly high quality egg. Eastern merchants buy their eggs with confidence, because they know the quality to expect. They pass those eggs on out to their consumers feeling sure their customers will be satisfied. Their cus - tomers call for those eggs, because it is possible for them to designate what they want, and they know they are going to get what they call for. That is not true generally of the eggs produced in the middle west section. It Is not necessary, or advisable, in my opinion, for us to attempt to copy the Pacific Coast producers In the production of pale-colored yolks. We have a different problem, and we should work it out accord- Ing to the conditions and circumstances In this section. Climatic conditions, an abundance of- sunshine, and the best and the cheapest feed, make it easily possible for us to produce- the finest., most nutritious eggs that can be produced in any section of the country at the lowest cost. Corn Is our basic feed in this section, and always will be. It Is produced here. It must be supplemented, however, with other grains and mill feeds In the proper proportions to give us a high quality product. A higher color to our yolks when properly produced in the Corn Belt, instead of being a handicap I think is a distinct advantage, provided it is absolutely uniform and produced In sufficient quantities to enable it to get proper recognition in the markets. Just in this connection, I want to say that too much emphasis cannot be placed on the importance of marketing these eggs while they are fresh. By that I mean they must get Into the hands of the consumer while they are fresh. Go into any of the markets of our country, and talk to the better class of consumers about the source of their egg supply. In many Instances they will tell you of being able to locate some merchant or dealer who has strictly fresh eggs brought to him two or three times each week. These eggs can always be depended upon as being fresh, and they get all of their eggs there. It is not at all uncommon that a family will buy their groceries from a nearby grocer but make their purchases of eggs elsewhere be - cause they are sure of always getting strictly fresh stock. People that are not fortunate enough to have this source of supply at hand, are looking for it. . I think there Is some confusion In the minds of the consumers as to the kinds of eggs they should buy, because quite' often they do not get what they think they have purchased. They get a variety of kinds in each dozen they purchase. </seg>
            <seg id="p805">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Freshness in eggs is the principal requirement among the better consumers, but unfortunately, quite often when the housewife specifies that she wants fresh eggs, she does not get them, and when she orders fresh eggs from different merchants, she is likely to get a different quality of eggs in each instance. This may be due to a number of different reasons. The merchant may be buying his supplies from miscellaneous sources; he may not be the best judge of eggs himself, and probably has been misled as to the quality of eggs he is buying, or else he perhaps has bought on a price basis, thinking they will answer the purpose with his trade about as well. Or the eggs may not have received the care while in his store,' or perhaps have not moved out to the trade as quickly as he expected and are not actually as good quality as when he purchased them. Then, too, there is often no definite standard of grade In the minds of the merchant. The same known quality of eggs would per - haps be called by a different name by each merchant. The housewife naturally feels her helplessness in knowing what to call for to be sure of getting a high quality of eggs, and I am quite sure it directly affects the consumption of eggs. The consumer is not going to be content each time she wants a dozen eggs, to go out and hunt bargains in eggs. This is impossible as thorough inspection cannot be made until the egg Is broken out finally, so this makes bargain hunting unsafe. Eggs must be bought by the final consumer largely on a basis of confidence — confidence based on a known history of those eggs. If they are produced in a section where breeds, feeding, methods and movement to the market are largely standardized, the consumer demand for those eggs will Increase. . We have felt at times that certain of our eggs going to markets from this middle west should bring more money relatively, with the Pacific Coast eggs. There are some eggs I think, that go to the eastern markets from the middle west section that are not only equal to, but are superior in quality in every sense to the Pacific Coast eggs. How - ever, they do not go there in sufficient quantities to establish a proper outlet for them. The eastern markets are looking for a de - pendable supply of eggs from the middle west that will be uniformly high quality, coming from flocks that are standardized as to breed, feeding, and care. I think we can actually get a preference in the market, if we can produce these eggs in sufficient, volume. The egg buyer for one of the largest chain stores In this country, not many months ago told us in a conversation that unquestionably the middle west section must come to more standardized production if they hoped to command better prices for their products. We cannot gain consumer preference until we can produce a uni - form flavored egg. The world Is drifting towards standardization. </seg>
            <seg id="p806">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We have long since passed the stage where we produce eggs alone for home consumption and a few of our neighbors in the same community. Eggs are an exportable crop, and since we export the majority of our egg crop, we must study our production from the standpoint of the kind of product we must deliver to the consumer in order to gain that consumer preference, not only of over other egg producing sections, but also that preference over many other competitive items of food that are taking the place of eggs to some extent in the home. Producers looking for the best outlet for their eggs must handle these eggs fast and get them into the hands of someone who in turn will see that they get into the consuming market while they are still fresh. This isn't enough, however. In addition to this, we must have a standardization of the flock. We must have more standardization of our feeding methods and our care of the flocks. We must have more such people as you who are gathered here today, that regard (he poultry business as one of their major important products on the farm, and who go Into it to the extent that you are willing to give it quite a lot of time and study, to make it worth your while. The Nebraska College of Agriculture for several years has advo - cated a very definite program in this connection. They suggest the raising of poultry in quantities of 50 hen flocks, or 500-or-more hens per flock, the theory being that the 50 hen flocks will supply the demand for home consumption. The 500-or-more hen flocks will result in better breeding, better feeding and. care, since the investment will be large enough to justify and make necessary the extra attention. I am sure every firm attempting to handle eggs on a quality basis by buying eggs on a grade, are in full accord with this. In several localities where buying eggs, on a grade has been followed for a number of years, it is quite noticeable that the same clasB of producers continue year in and year out to sell their eggs on a grade, but there hasn't been any general inclination for them to greatly enlarge their flocks, and usually the largest percentage of the producers in those localities do not improve their methods of production and enlarge their flocks to the point where they feel justified in selling their eggs on a grade. This at times has been somewhat discouraging; I am sure it has been discouraging to the men here at the Agricultural College who have worked hard for years to Improve these conditions. I think pro - ducers, however, are commencing to turn in the right direction, and that efforts of the Agricultural Department are commencing to bear fruit. '. We need an expansion of egg production on a larger scale opera - tion. Not necessarily on an extremely large commercial scale, but on a basis where it will be one of the major developments of the farm operations. The production of eggs is a manufacturing process. Mrs. </seg>
            <seg id="p807">NEBRASKA STATE TOULTRY ASSOCIATION Housewife is the final inspector of the products we manufacture. She is critical; she wants a product she can always depend upon. She Is going to find it if it is in the market. The demands of the consumer may seem rather rigid — and they are. They of course don't realize the ramifications of poultry produc - tion and how difficult it is to produce the quality of eggs they want. As a matter of fact, the consumer of eggs doesn't want to be bothered about this, nor do they care how difficult it is. They are going to buy eggs from the source that will meet their particular requirements. I don't think we want them any different, for we have everything in this section that should make it possible for us to meet her demands. You are not only interested in' producing your own eggs so they will meet this requirement, but you also have a vital and direct interest in your neighbors doing likewise. Those neighbors who are taking an indifferent attitude towards their poultry and therefore are produc - ing an indifferent quality of eggs which are going to the market, directly affect. the sale of your products. Those people are not here today, but it seems to me the contacts that go out from this meeting, if an effort is made in that direction, should be influential in creating a desire and the determination on the part of more producers to in - crease their flocks and standardize their production in order that we may pbtain in this middle western section this "consumer preference" for our product. WHAT KIND OF EGGS SHALL WE SET? H. E. ALDER University of Nebraska The question, "What kind of eggs shall we set?" may be partially answered by asking ourselves what we expect to get from the eggs? For convenience we may classify all egg characteristics under two headings as follows: ■ 1. Internal characteristics. 2. External characteristics. The former may be discussed under two general headings, the genetics of an egg, and the physiological constitution of an egg. The latter includes such factors as size, shape, color, shell quality, and cleanliness. The Genetics of an Egg Everyone is familiar with -the fact that an animal is made up of a countless number of cells, each one having a definite structure and function to fulfill, and that an Individual and his characteristics are the result of the mass action of all of these different kinds of cells. </seg>
            <seg id="p808">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Each body cell has a certain number of chromosomes, the num - ber in each case depending on the species of animal. - For instance, man has 48, horses 60, the crayfish 200, the fruit fly 8, and the domes - tic fowl 36. Each chromosome has a large number of determiners or genes. These determiners or genes are responsible for the animal's inherited traits. In other words, if a hen has a determiner or gene for broodiness, she naturally becomes broody. If she has a gene for a winter pause, in spite of all of the good feeding and management, the bird pauses for four to eight weeks in the fall. It is perfectly possible to set eggs that carry determiners for broodiness, small egg size, slow maturity, winter pause, early molt, short cycle, irregular rythm, and low vitality. We get a fowl that shows similar charac - teristics, certainly a poor layer and a non-profltable bird. On the other hand we may have in that egg determiners for non-broodlness, large egg size, early maturity, late molt, long cycle, good rythm, and high vitality. The former egg can be worth no more than the market price, while the latter Is almost priceless. The genetics of the egg we set is highly important. The Physiology of the Kgg The first egg we shall consider is one from a hen hatched April 1st, 1929, and commenced to lay October 1st, 1930, and kept at it until October 1st, 1931, at which time she quit laying and molted. During October, November, and December, she lost her old coat of feathers and grew a new one. Incidentally, while she was doing this joy, she overhauled her entire system. Every cell of the body was inspected and an inventory made of everything that was lacking. Min - erals, vitamins, amino acids, endocrine materials, etc., were restored. Every adjustment was completed that was necessary for making each and every cell of the body just as nature had ages ago when our domestic chickens loafed all fall and winter, laid a setting of eggs, went broody, and hatched them. This hen on January 1st, 1932, lays an egg. Will it hatch? One may gamble that it will if Biddy was fed and managed properly during the molting season, and carries the sort of breeding she should have.- Such eggs do not have watery white, easily broken down yolks, and a weak germ. Contrast this with a pullet that commenced to lay October 1st and up to January 1st has produced 50 to 60 eggs. The physiological make-up is not as good as the first egg was. But that is not the worst of it. With most breed - ers and hatcherymen the hatching season, will not commence until about February 1st, or even later. During February and March all the eggs laid will be set. Those produced in March have been mate - rially reduced in quality. Hatchability is not good, and the llvability and growth rate of the chicks is not satisfactory. Let us not overlook the fact that a cell is made out of millions of molecules, and that each molecule has from several to more than a thousand atoms, and that each atom is further structurally built up from a large number of </seg>
            <seg id="p809">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION electrons and pratons. These millions of particles in a cell are very definitely and complexly put together so the whole is a properly organ - ized unit. Each and every hour this whole system is being disarranged and reconstructed. We, therefore, can see why it is difficult to feed and manage heavy laying hens so one may realize good hatchabllity after 50 or 60 eggs have been laid. External Characteristics One of the most important of the external characteristics is size. Eggs must weigh 24 to 26 ounces to the dozen to command the best prices. If one continues to set eggs from 20 to 30 ounces to the dozen he will get females that will produce the same thing. Eliminate all the small ones and the extra large ones. Uniformity In any product is highly desirable. Egg size may be improved very rapidly by careful selection. In the past not enough attention has been given to egg shape. A large number of the eggs produced are longer than they should be. They do not pack well for shipping, they do not fit trays for hatching, they work indifferently in some of the turning devices, and are not artistic in appearance. I can think of no reason to justify continuing to use such eggs. An egg should be about 1.30 to 1.31 times as long as wide. An egg weighing at the rate of 26 ounces to the dozen should be 2% inches long and 1.92 Inches wide. Such an egg will be just as high as the filler in which it rests, and will touch it on alt four sides. Such eggs may be shipped around the world without having the ends crushed. Shell texture is important for two reasons. Poor quality shells neither hatch nor ship as well as good quality ones. Shell quality may be modified both by management and breeding. Some birds carry a marked tendency for producing poor shells and while the shell may be good for a short time, soon the strain of egg manufacture will cause unsatisfactory shells. It only eggs with sound shells are set, such birds will soon be eliminated from the flock. COMPETITION IN THE EGO INDUSTRY — HOW SHALA. WE MEET IT? ARTHUR W. MEDLAR Department of Rural Economics, University of Nebraska Competition may be defined as "the effort of two or more sellers to Bell to the same person or persons, each seller acting independently in his own Interests without regard to the interests of other sellers." This doubtless means that the sellers may be trying to sell the same kind of product to the same person or persons, or it may mean that </seg>
            <seg id="p810">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the sellers are trying to sell a product which may be substituted lor the given product by the consumer. In the egg industry it means that our competitors in the market consist of two classes of producers. The one group comprises the producers of eggs. The other group com - prises producers who have a product which may be used instead of eggs. . . It Is impossible to locate all of this latter group. They live in our own land and in foreign lands. They offer meats, fruits, vegetables and chemical compounds which contain vitamines and other necessities for a proper diet. They offer recipes for foods which require only one egg instead of two or perhaps no eggs at alt. In a hundred ways they feed us about as well as formerly and yet reduce the number of eggs required in the consumer's diet. This group of competitors is difficult to handle. By advertising they create a desire for a new food. By salesmanship they make us want to try to reduce our living f-xpenses. By psychological means they turn us from the products which we grow to those made from other products or brought in from other lands. Probably the wisest way to deal with this class of com - petitors is to meet them on their own ground. Do they advertise the excellence of their goods? Let the poultryman tell the consumer the real value of eggs in the diet and In the health. Do they go into the laboratory and discover how to use more of their product and less of eggs? The poultryman must do likewise. Let him find how to make a better food through the use of more eggs and less of other foods. Let the consumer be satisfied that by the use of eggs he does get more satisfaction and value for his money than he could get by the purchase of any other food. ■ It has been said that the stomachs of the world can be satisfied with a certain amount of food. It is the job of the poultryman to see that eggs constitute the largest possible per cent of this bulk. Let the work be done scientifically, economically, honestly, appetiz - ingly and profitably. It may be accomplished through advertising, through education, through maintenance of uniform quality of eggs, through proper distribution and display and in a dozen or more other ways. The poultryman must meet his competitor in all these fields and prove to the consumer that eggs are really better for him than any or perhaps all the substitutes offered by competitors. It is no easy task to meet this class of competitors and perhaps It is not desirable to eliminate them entirely. But if the poultryman wants the consumer to continue to use eggs, he must be alert and hot allow substitutes in the diet to crowd eggs from the consumer's table. The class of competitors which more directly annoy the Nebraska egg producer is the group who try to sell eggs to the same person or persons as the Nebraska producer tries to sell to. These competi - tors may be roughly divided into two or three groups. First is the </seg>
            <seg id="p811">' • NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION competitor from foreign lands. We complain against him largely be - cause he Is a foreigner. The second class comprises those in areas within the United States where eggs are produced in quantities above the local need. They enter markets which the Nebraska producer once supplied or those markets which logically belong to him, or those markets which the Nebraska producer could supply— if it were not for an unusually strong competitor. The third group includes the marginal producers of eggs in Nebraska and in the other surplus egg areas. Perhaps you would like to exclude them since they are irreg - ular producers, or producers of a low quality product, or even because the total amount of their product is relatively small. Of one thing we may be certain— If the marginal producer in Nebraska and all other egg surplus areas could be eliminated, competition In the egg market would be greatly relieved. Perhaps It will be best to consider the problems involved In these three groups separately. First then, will come the foreign egg pro - ducer. The Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture shows that in 1913 foreign countries were shipping into our markets 1 348,000 dozen eggs and 228,000 pounds of dried or frozen eggs. The eggs in shell have gradually decreased until in 1929, we imported only 291,000 dozen eggs— and 254,000 dozen of these came from Hong Kong and China— or, about one-fifth as many as in 1913. The imports of dried frozen, preserved and otherwise prepared eggs have greatly increased since 1913. In 1921 we imported 14,830.000 pounds of this class of eggs but by 1929 It had more than doubled, reaching a total of 32 549,000 pounds. China furnished about 86 per cent of these eggs. An interesting comparison for the Nebraska producer to make is to change the dried eggs to dozens by allowing four-tenths of a pound tJf dried egg per dozen of whole eggs. The results would be a total of 81,663,000 dozen imported eggs— Nebraska's annual produc - tion may be conservatively estimated from 67.000,000 to 72.000.000 dozen'. The Nebraska producer's problem is first to determine whether the eggs In shell and the dried or prepared eggs are really competitors in the marketing of his eggs. Eggs in shell from China are of low quality but In so far as they crowd out the Nebraska egg from the market, they are competitors. Next, what can be done about it? Wheeler Macmillan in his book "Too Many Farmers" suggests that dried, preserved and prepared eggs from China are not used for the same purpose that American eggs are and therefore, should not be considered as being In competition with our eggs. This may be true, but It is certain that most of our producers would like to see them excluded from the markets. To accomplish this, we have erected a tariff wall of ten cents per dozen on eggs in shell, thirty-six cents per pound on whole dried eggs, sixty cents per pound on dried albumen and thirty cents per pound on dried yolks. Whether this is the best or final solution for the elimination of our foreign competitors will </seg>
            <seg id="p812">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE remain an open question so long as the tariff remains a political foot - ball. Economists are inclined to favor free trade, division of labor, and fair competition. They would, therefore, suggest as a better remedy than, the tariff a reduction of production costs so that the foreign competitor would be unable to compete with us In our home markets. The next competitor is the poultrymen in other egg surplus areas. Outstanding among these states are the two Dakotas, Kansas. Iowa. Missouri, California, Washington, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Statistics are given for the six leading egg markets in the United States showing the state of origin of eggs shipped to each of these six markets. The two western markets, San Francisco and Los Angeles, received prac - tically all of their eggs from five states, namely, California, Oregon, Washington Idaho and Utah. In fact, all other Btates together con - tributed less than one-half of one per cent of eggs received at San Francisco any year from 1922 to 1929 inclusive and no more than three per cent of the eggs received at the Los Angeles market during the same years. In the western market then, the Nebraska poultry - man is not a competitor with other surplus egg states. On the Boston market for 1929, five states sold more eggs than Nebraska. These were, In order, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. On the Chicago market, Nebraska ranged sixth, being surpassed by Iowa, Minnesota. Missouri, Wisconsin and South Dakota. On the New. York market for the same year. Nebraska ranged thirteenth. Washington, California, New York and Tennessee joined the central states to compete with Nebraska In the sale of eggs to New York consumers. Should these two western states logically market eggs in New York? They enter this market at certain seasons and with eggs of high quality. Their competition with Nebraska eggs partakes of the nature of the mar - ginal producer. When fresh Corn Belt eggs are scarce — October to December — western eggs reach the New York market in large quan - tities, the volume often being from forty to fifty per cent of the receipts on the New York market during these months. Throughout the period of our heaviest production — March to July — western eggs constitute only a small per cent of the eggs arriving In New York. There is a great deal of discussion about the competition of Pacific eggs but after all, it really is not so serious as the competition of marginal producers in the Corn Belt states. In the Philadelphia market, Nebraska ranked fifteenth, but none of the far western states were among the close competitors. Taking the question by and large then, our serious competitors in the large eastern markets are the states of the Corn Belt. They are states wltn production much the same as Nebraska, the only difference being the amount of different products grown.- Before going Into the question of how to meet this competition Jt will be well to discuss briefly the marginal producer of eggs. This </seg>
            <seg id="p813">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION group comprises a large array of producers. Some produce a few eggs as a side-line— it makes little difference to them what the price of eggs may be. If the price is high, they will sell all they have — if the price is low, they will eat them all. Some marginal producers have' many eggs for sale but their cost of production is so great that only during the high price period is there any profit left them. When prices are low they become discouraged and drop out of the game but there are always new ones to take their places. At first though, this class of producers may seem insignificant but in reality they furnish the regular poultr y man much of his stiff est competition. We might remove some of them by showing them that their costs of pro - duction were greater than the market price. We might eliminate some of. them through regulation of the quality of eggs which may be offered for sale. But when we have done our best, the class of mar - ginal producers will probably continue to sell eggs enough to jeopard - ize the profits of efficient producers. Now how may we best meet the competition of good poultrymen in the Corn Belt states? These are the poultrymen who put the largest volume of eggs on the market in direct competition with ours. Their eggs are produced during the same period as ours. Their eggs are of the same quality as ours and their customers are the same as ours. Among the remedies which may be valuable are the following: 1. Concentrating on volume in the hands of fewer handlers. This may require a cooperative marketing association or a corporation which extends over enough territory that it may secure a large volume of eggs. One of the functions of this organization would be to edu - cate producers. They should be instructed in practical ways of breed- Ing, feeding, culling, selecting eggs for market, — anything which will make the grading and distribution of eggs an easier job for the or - ganization. 2. Reduction in costs of production. It is true in the field of unrestricted competition that the producer with the* least costs has an advantage in the market. The law of competitive prices bars any entrepreneur from setting a price which he must have for his product. However, cost of production, in the long run, sets both the maximum and minimum price at which producers will offer eggs. This means that poultrymen with the lowest production costs will be offering eggs to the consumers in the market after his competitors are forced out. One economic truth in cost of production stands out like a thorn and snags many a poultryman who does not think his problem through carefully. "Past costs of production are not the important costs" — eggs once produced must sell under the law. of supply and demand. Prices are not fixed by production costs of goods now existing. Too many times the poultryman believes that he will be able to command twenty-five or thirty cents per dozen for his eggs because it 1b now costing him that much. But other producers may be securing their </seg>
            <seg id="p814">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE eggs at a less cost and they will continue to offer eggs. It Is the low cost producer who is last in the market. Nebraska poultrymen niay continue profitable egg production and drive out some other Corn Belt producers only if they are able to keep their costs of production under those of their competitors. 3; A careful study of economic conditions affecting the consum - ers of eggs. This is the other half of the shears which economists talk so much about. It is the demand side of the question. Con - sumers will want eggs so long as eggs are appetizing and Industry pays good wages. The egg producer should watch the trend of em - ployment and wages; he should watch the price of- rent and clothing; he should know the purchasing power of the consumer in the city. II the Nebraska egg producer knows these things he will be enabled to keep the proper volume of eggs moving toward the market. 4. A study of the cycles of egg production. Thoughtful poultry - men recognize that the "Cure. for low prices is low prices and the cure for high prices is high prices." This statement means that when eggs are low, many poultrymen recognize that they are losing money and drop out of the game, then the low supply of eggs with the same demand raises the egg prices. When egg prices are high more and - more eggs are offered on the market until prices break. The law of supply and demand continues to operate and low prices result. Stu - dents of egg prices have found that thlB movement occurs quite reg - ularly every four years. One of the best ways for Nebraska egg pro - ducers to meet the competition of other Corn Belt producers is to regulate their production of eggs so that when they are near the high or low point of the cycle, the flow of eggs will more nearly meet the demand of the consumer. By this regulation prices may be main - tained more nearly at the Nebraska producer's cost of production^— granting, of course, that this cost of production is lower than that of the competitors. 5. Making contacts with the consumer. Consumers are just like all other people. They like to meet the man with whom they deal. Individual egg producers can not deal with individual egg consumers. This must be done through the middlemen, the men who buy, store and sell the eggs. The egg producer can watch the market road of his eggs and see what can be done to keep the consumers wanting eggs. If buyers are careless it may require the work of a specialist to help keep the eggs attractive and of a high quality while passing through the buyers hands. If merchants fall to display eggs of uni - form shape, color and quality, the producer may have to hire some specialist to enter this field and make favorable contact with the con - sumer. Perhaps Nebraska producers' could sell more Nebraska eggs if they had someone making these contacts with consumers. Informa - tion about eggs and consumers must be gathered and published. This may be an added cost of production but it may lower the total cost of </seg>
            <seg id="p815">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION production to the producer. It may require an extensive advertising campaign to keep eggs in the mind of consumers. If it does, the producer had better recognize the fact before his business strikes the rocks. In other fields producers are working every avenue to the consumer. Nebraska egg producers might do well to study their methods and select those methods applicable to their business. These are a few of the outstanding problems' and some remedies for each of them. The field merits further study. The Nebraska pro - ducer must know and follow the fundamental economic laws in the problem. He must not trust to legal barriers or false organization to long thwart the ruthless laws of economics. His safest plan is to make Nebraska the area of low cost of production of quality eggs. He may then depend upon the consumer to want his eggs. MY KXPEIUENCE WITH MASH CONCENTRATE WILLIAM BRANDT Martel, Nebraska The mash concentrate has solved one of our biggest problems in raising poultry. We operate a 10,000 capacity incubator, produce and sell quite a lot of broilers on the market, and keep a flock or 500 laying hens. We have been mixing most of our feeds since we went into the poultry business because there didn't seem to be much in the poultry business if we bought all commercial feed. But we felt more or less dissatisfied because it was hard to get into this home mixed feeds some ingredients that we .really felt were needed. So I went to the Agricultural College to find out more about feeding and the men there suggested mixing or buying a mash concentrate. This proposition sounded good, so I mixed up a batch and started feeding it right away. If you want to rid yourself of a lot of annoyance and risk of "guess work," and be sure you are doing things right without the expense of experimenting, why I'd say "try this concentrate way of mixing your feed." I wasn't long deciding whether or not to continue the use of concentrate. We found It was a better and easier way to get the protein supplements and essential minerals Into the ration. Just what we needed, and it gave better results than any ration we had ever tried before. . . Our broilers made faster, more uniform growth, there was less death loss, no cannibalism, and another thing that was an aid in main - taining the health of the flock — they did not pick and scratch at the droppings as some will sometimes get started to doing. The chickens relish the feed, they clean out the hoppers uniformly instead of picking </seg>
            <seg id="p816">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE out purl of Hie feed and crying for more. I believe it stimulatcx and tones their digeRtive system in a way that keeps them healthy and growing. Our pullets developed faster and evener and our heavy breed pullets were laying at five to six months. The pullets that were culled out of the laying flock were all in fine shape when we sold them on the market. Many folks believe in feeding the best feed but evidently consider that quality is determined by price. This is frequently true, no doubt, but in the use of the concentrate our experience has been that It Is economical to use and this is another good reason why we use it. Mash Concentrate No. 1 in your poultry mash will enable you to use home grown feeds to a large extent but makes* it easy to supplement these so that you have a complete feed at a low cost. EXPERIENCE WITH A POULTRY MASH CONCENTRATE HARRY A. CUMMINS Seward, Nebraska I have been asked to address this meeting on the subject, "Our Experience with Mash Concentrates." This could cover a very large held. There are for instance, several different kinds of mash, some made from grain products. I understand corn and rye are the popular, brands. I claim no knowledge of the mixing or sale of this kind of mash. The mash concentrate I suppose I am to discuss, pertains to poul - try feeds, as this is a meeting of the Nebraska Poultry Association and I am in hopes your interests are confined to poultry mash. A concentrate mixture used to make a laying mash, for example, is a mixture of high protein feeds and minerals .required to make complete mash by adding some ground grains. Our experience has been confined almost entirely to the manu - facture and sale of the concentrate. You will find many feeds adver - tised telling the amount of money expended on research and experi - mental feeding. I must confess we have not expended any amount of money in this work. As you all know, we have our own experi - mental farms and laboratories within our state that are available to us if we wish information. This has been furnished to the farmer and we should profit by their experience and pass the saving to the farmer rather than spend large sums in duplicate experiments and charge this against the costs of the feeds or concentrates. There are several, formulas for concentrates that make a very practical mixture. These should vary to a. certain extent, dependent </seg>
            <seg id="p817">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION upon relative prices of the different ingredients. I do uot expect to go into the merits of different concentrates as we can obtain this information from our own Poultry Department of the University of Nebraska. - What I am interested in telling you is the value of buying a concentrate mixture. We buy everything in car-lots and the various ingredients are purchased on an analysis basis.' We have found that we can make considerable saving by purchasing on the open market, specifying analysis and preparation. It is very expensive to buy one hundred pounds of concentrate if you have to buy each Ingredient separate. Nebraska Poultry Mash No. 2 consists of 40 pounds meat scraps, 12V4 pounds soy bean meal, 25 pounds alfalfa meal U. S. No. 1, 10 pounds dried buttermilk, 7% pounds ground limestone 98% pure calcium carbonate, and 5 pounds salt. Can you Imagine what a mixture of one hundred pounds of this concentrate would cost if the buyer had to buy In these small quan - tities and mix them? We have found that we can mix several tons -of concentrates at one time and sell one hundred pounds mixed for considerable less money than we could sell each item separate and many are not located where these ingredients are available. In marketing a concentrate we give written instructions as to how it can be used with home grown grains. Our first experience with mash concentrate was about eighteen months ago. Last winter in Seward County alone we sold enough concentrate to mix with grain that would have made twenty carloads of poultry feed, 90% of the ration grain. It has been our idea to centralize our buying and mixing of con - centrates and to distribute to the poultry raiser or to the local elevator to resell. A great many of our local elevators are equipped with grinders and can furnish a complete mash mixture by adding the con - centrate to their grain. This eliminates the freight charges on the bulk of the mash mixture, renders a service and makes a saving to the poultrymen. We make concentrates both in closed and open formulas. The university is compelled to insist on an open formula before they can recommend it and we have cooperated with them in furnishing an open formula according to their recommendation. The concentrate Idea should not be emphasized to the point of discouraging entirely the mixing of a complete mash. There are many . customers that depend on buying this mixture in small quantities and it can be mixed and sold to the farmer at reasonable costs within a limited radius of distribution. There are times when mill feeds are lower than grain costs and can be used to substitute a certain amount of grain profitably. I am convinced that the feeder that buys any laying mash from a reputable concern has profited compared with the average method of feeding. </seg>
            <seg id="p818">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Commercial feeds have been responsible to a large extent for the advanced methods of feeding with the average farmer. It has now resolved itself into a method of furnishing a good concentrate or com - plete mash at the most reasonable cost. ' - California has many cooperative feed mills and sells direct to the poultrymen. Their situation is different than ours. They buy every - thing that goes into the rations thus giving a feed mill large volume in a small territory, as there are many commercial feeders. Our problem is to buy cooperatively the concentrates in large quantities for distribution to the local cooperative so they can make a laying mash at a low delivered price. There is no mystery about commercial feeds. A commercial teed is a mixed feed made to merchandise. I am very sorry to have to say that there is very little intelligent buying of commercial feeds. A certain class of folks are susceptible to high pressure salesmanship and ridiculous advertising. We are not selling any product that is "kind to the throat" or have we testimonials of movie actresses. On the other hand there is the over-cautious customer that is unduly skeptical of all commercial feeds. Commercial feeds are being made by a large number of small feed mills that are so located that they can furnish a good mixed mash at a reasonable cost. Volume cuts the overhead but this cannot be carried to the point of distributing to distant points. . It is our. aim to pool the buying of the feeds so as to make a great saving in quantity purchases. The concentrate is approximately only one-tenth of the entire ration. This can be distributed to the local elevator where it can be mixed with the home grown grains, saving transportation charges on a large per cent of the mixed feed. A feed mill in a locality that is buying its protein concentrates in car lots is an asset to the community, as this saving is reflected in the costs to the feeder. You are • not compelled to buy certain formulas. You can have your own formula made up if the quantity justifies the separate mixing. Poultrymen tell us- that poultry is coming to market in the poor - est condition they have ever known. We know 'that there, is lots of grain back on the farms. It is cheap and we believe the farmers have fed it liberally. We cannot account for the poor condition of poultry unless it is due to the fact that the farmers have not fed protein supplements as they did in former "years. We believe that the farmer or breeder that will stay with the poultry business at this time and will continue to care for and feed as he should, will be in a position to reap a harvest. The poultry business will again become profitable just as sure as day follows night. </seg>
