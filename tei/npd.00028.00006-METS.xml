            <seg id="p003">SECRETARY OF THE STATE BANKING BOARD 3 State of Nebraska, Department of Banking, Lincoln, January 18, 1913. To His Excellency, JOHN H. MOREHEAD, Governor, HON. WILLIAM B. HOWARD, Auditor of Public Accounts HON. GRANT Q. MARTIN, Attorney General, Members of the State Banking Board. I beg to submit herewith the Twenty-first Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Banking Board, covering the period from December 5, 1911, to November 26, 1912. Two examinations of the banks of the state were made during the year. In submitting this report I am handing you a tabulated summary of the condition of the National ami State banks of Nebraska for the year 1912, as shown by reports made to the Comptroller of the Currency by the National banks, and reports made to this Department by banks under state supervision. I am pleased to report a very satisfactory condition of the banks under the supervision of this Department, and that no failures have occurred during the year 1912. RThe statistical information set forth in this report shows a most gratify - growth of the banking power of the state, and reports -made to this artment and information obtained through its Examiners will bear me out in the statement that the banking business of the state is being conducted along safe and conservative lines with little or no indications of high financ- t speculation or other dangerous innovations that so often prove disastrous inks of deposit. Rnrw banking act embodying the guaranty feature, which was in 1909, was held in suspension by injunction until March 30, 1911, ich time the banks have been operating under the law as it now exists, res have occurred since the passage of the act, and the guaranty i now reached the sum of $774,414.58. More or less friction occurred between the Department and the banks relating to certain obscure provisions of the law, but on the whole the banks have acted wisely and in time accepted in the right spirit the interpretation of the Department, except in three instances where the matter has been appealed to the courts for adjudication, or will be soon. Banks generally have shown a desire to comply with the law and to sustain the Department in its enforcement. The guaranty feature of the law has without question, increased the confidence of the people in the banks. So far few, or none, of the bad effects anticipated by those opposed to its enactment have occurred. Ee the crucial test of the law has not yet been made and will not be jeriod of depression, panic or general distrust appears, which we hope may never occur. No law is perfect, and especially is this true of a new law with many new and untried features. Some of the defects of the present act were cor - rected by the preceding session of the legislature, and in my report for 1911, I called attention to some amendments that I thought should be made to </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Pof which I deem of such importance that I desire to submit ith a sincere hope that the present legislature in its wisdom law that which experience and practical application has demon - the banks and the people. I would again respectfully recom- As a basis for levying assessments for the guaranty fund, section 45 of the banking act provides that banks shall on the first day of June, 1911, and each six months thereafter, make and file with the State Banking Board a statement showing their average daily deposits for the preceding six months, exclusive of public money otherwise secured, while section 46 provides that no bank which has complied in full with all the provisions of this act shall be required to give any further security or bond for the purpose of becoming a depository for any public funds, but depository funds shall be secured in the same manner that private funds are secured. These two sections of the law being in direct conflict with each other should be amended so as to define more clearly the banks' rights and requirements in protecting depositors of public funds. In this connection the Department has acted upon the opinion of the Attorney General, and has required banks to include all public as well as private funds in their statements of average deposits, which opinion had just been sustained by the Supreme Court of the State. section 45a, entitled "New Banks," should be amended so as to define more clearly the intent of the law. As the section now reads its meaning is obscure, and is in fact somewhat contradictory in its provisions, and requires an arbitrary ruling on the part of the Board, which should not be. This section provides that an amount equal to four per cent of the capital stock shall be paid into the guaranty fund when a bank begins business, and authorizes the Banking Board to adjust the assessments of such banks so that the first two assessments, together with the credit fund of four per cent, shall equal at least one per cent of the average daily deposits. It makes no provision for paying back to such banks any part of the fund, should the full four per cent not be necessary to make the required one per cent of the average daily deposits for the two six months periods. This section should be re-enacted and made to define more clearly the requirements. Another amendment to the law that I would urgently suggest is one to remedy what I consider a serious defect as instanced in a case where a bank voluntarily liquidates, clearly designating what shall be done with the guaranty fund accumulated in that bank. If it is intended that the fund accumulated shall remain intact and inviolate, except to pay loss to depositors of failed banks, the law should so state explicitly. If, however, it is the intent to compel the bank to set aside this fund as its share as long as it shall par - ticipate in the hazard and once it withdraws from the system the amount it has on deposit to the credit of the fund is lost to the fund and returned to the stockholders, such provision should be so plain that the courts would not be burdened with determining the point. Another suggestion which I have made in a previous report is that the limit on loans provided in section 24 of the banking act be either increased or repealed entirely, as the practical results clearly show that the effect is to needlessly force the surplus reserves of the country banks, occasioned by </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 K limitations, to the money renters, to the detriment of the banks and the 8 of the communities in which the banks are situated. Especially does it work a hardship during the winter months when the demand from the farms is* greatest. This section without question is a positive injustice to the various communities of the state outside of the reserve centers, and places the state banks in competition with National banks at a disadvantage, as no such limitation is imposed upon National banks. It would afford some relief if the section was amended so that the limit on loans would be raised from eight times the capital and surplus to ten times the capital and surplus, if the legislature should decide to continue an arbitrary limit on loans. The last legislature defeated a measure for an amendment to the banking law authorizing the Kanking Board to exercise its discretion in accepting an application for, or issuing charters to banks in places, in its judgment, already adequately supplied with banking facilities. This is a provision that I have heretofore recommended, and I want now to repeat this recommendation. Such authority is successfully exercised by the Comptroller of the Currency and Bank Commissioners and Supervisors of other states. In my opinion the interest of the promoters and the community are best protected and subserved by rejecting an application for a bank charter where the field is too limited to justify its establishment. Such authority should not be exer - cixcl. however, until the Board is fully convinced after a thorough and care - ful investigation that the conditions warrant it. State banks that nationalized prior to the time the assessments provided for in section 4.5 of the banking act became due and payable, are resisting the penalties provided by said section, and have been sustained in their conten - tions by the courts. Ethe Honorables Chester H. Aldrich, Governor, and Silas R. Barton, of Public Accounts, retiring members of the Banking Board, and Martin, Attorney General, I extendmy sincere thanks for the uniform and consideration given to all connected with this Department. &gt;sire to commend the excellent services of the Examiners and other ■es of the Department for their loyal and efficient services. Very respectfully, E. ROYSE, Secretary Slate Hanking Board. </seg>
