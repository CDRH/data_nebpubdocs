THE ESSENTIALS OK AN IDEAL HOG HOI SE rief summary of a discussion of the important ivell-designed hog house given in the Iowa Agricultural Bulletin No. 152: Warmth. — Newly farrowed pigs as well as stock hogs and sows reasonably warm shelter. Avoid sudden wide range of tem- Dryness. — It is not logical to expect thrift in damp, musty Mmndant-f of light and direct sunlight. — Sunlight is necessary royer and to better hygienic conditions. Pens should be rinn the farrowing months of February, March, and April. Shade. — The hog should be protected from the heat of summer as from the cold of winter. Ventilation. — The hog demands an abundance of fresh, pure air to thrive. Sanitation. — -Buildings should have smooth walls and floors free acks and openings to permit of perfect disinfecting, also en - hem to be kept sanitary. Avoid dusty quarters. Safety and comfort. — Care should be taken in the construction intrs to prevent discomfort to the sow at all times. Avoid high ;w doorways and rough, uneven floors. "Convenience. — House details may be arranged to lessen the [i labor required to care for the swine herd. What is considered n's convenience, however, may be an inconvenience for his Yet the following suggestive features are all more or less house building: Roof doors in small houses and alleys in large houses for quick asy feeding, removal of litter or manures, and handling of herd. Bins for storage of feeds. Doors and windows which open or close easily and quickly. Room for supplies and appliances, such as veterinary medicines istruments, feed cooker, water heater, stove, sleeping cot, and so on. Abundant water supply for drinking and flushing. Ventilators, readily adjustable. Litter carriers for removing manure Shade devices, handily managed Attached runners, for quick moving of small houses Dipping tank, in or near house. Troughs arranged so as to be filled and cleaned with dispatch &gt;ut interference from hogs. Feeding floor, located in or near by the house </seg>
