The Nebraska Agricultural Situation, 1925-1926 The discussion of the progress of Nebraska agriculture for the biennium, 1925 and 1926, cannot be fully appreciated with - out a review of the factors affecting agriculture during the past decade and particularly for the period of agricultural deflation which began during the latter part of 1920. Nebraska agriculture has improved somewhat since the deflation which began the latter part of 1920. Despite this tendency to come back, the general farm conditions are still unsatisfactory. The sudden and marked increase in prices of farm products caused by the war demands are largely responsible for the present situation, because this resulted in marked in - crease in land values, farm equipment, taxes, freight rates, etc., all of which increased the farm overhead. Along with this came the marked increase in price of commodities which farmers buy. Failure of these prices to come down on a par with farm products, coupled with the greatly increased overhead expenses such as higher land values, freight rates and taxes are the real causes for the unsatisfactory conditions on the farm. </seg>

Note that the period for 1924 to 1926, inclusive that corn was 35% higher; wheat, 45 % higher; oats 2% higher; hay 12% lower; beef cattle, 23% higher and hogs 28% higher than for the pre - war period, 1912-to 1 9 1 4,. inclusive. For this same period, 1924 to 1926, inclusive, the index of prices for commodities that farmers buy was 56% higher than for the period, 1912 to 19 1 4, inclusive. The ratio of prices received by farmers to the prices paid was 89 which in other words means that the farmers dollar will only buy 89% as much as it would before the war. Farm prices were lowest in 1 92 I and at that time the pur - chasing power of the farmer's dollar was only 75% of what it was before the war. This improved, and reached 92 in 1925 and then dropped to 87 in 1926. The farmer, like others tried to maintain the higher standards of living that the high war prices brought. He has been forced to bear the greatly in - creased cost of farm operations in addition to the greatly in - creased overhead from high land prices, taxes and freight rates with a dollar that has been worth (0 to 25% less than in pre - war days. Working against such odds, it is obvious that agri - culture cannot be satisfactory until farmers prices are placed upon an equal footing with those of other industries. </seg>

            <seg id="p010">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Figures on gross income prepared by the State and Federal Division of Agricultural Statistics give a good view of the struggle of agriculture to come back under the handicap which the economic situation had placed upon it. Supreme effort on the part of Nebraska farmers to meet the situation after the deflation coupled with confidence in their industry has produced results upon which Nebraska farmers can look backward with considerable pride. As shown in the following table, the in - crease in gross income from sales of farm products from $289, - 100,000 for the year ending June 30, 1922 to $432,378,000 in 1926, or 50 ' \ despite the great odds under which the in - dustry is operating is concrete evidence of the ability and fore - sight of Nebraska farmers to adjust their production to demand through diversification and other adjustments of their business to meet the new situation. NEBRASKA GROSS FARM INCOME FROM SALES OF CROPS, LIVESTOCK AND ITS PRODUCTS (Given in thousands, i. e., (000) omitted) Year Ending June 30 I 1921 | 1922 | 1923 | 1924 | 1925 | 1926 Crops _ $160,716 $97,237 $93,997 $92,096 $120,239 $102,723 Livestock &amp; Its Products 224.61) 191.862 239.635 256.270 303,908 329.655 Crops and Livestock .... $385,327 $289.099 $333.632 $348,366 $424,147 $432,378 The foregoing records are derived from actual carlot ship - ments of crops in nearly all cases and the market receipts of livestock and absolute records of livestock products all of which are calculated on the basis of monthly sales and average monthly prices and are therefore authentic and comparable in every respect. Farm prices began to tumble about the last quarter of 1920. Crop production was good in 1920. Fortunately, much of the wheat was sold before the prices dropped. Other grain crops as well as livestock brought fairly satisfactory prices although they were low as compared to previous years. The deflation was most serious in 1921. Prices were ex - tremely low, while expenses were still on a high level. Crop </seg>
            <seg id="p011">BIENNIAL BEPORT— 1925-1926 production was only fair. Fortunately, the prices of dairy products, poultry and its products were comparatively higher than for other farm products. These industries had been neg - lected during the period of high prices of grain and other live - stock and its products and production was at a low point. Farmers naturally turned to dairying and poultry production and by 1926, the production of creamery butter had increased over 50% since 1921, and the poultry business from 25% to 30 %. Farmers put forth their supreme efforts to conquer the ex - tremely adverse situation under which they had been placed. In addition to crop and livestock diversification to meet the new difficult situation, there was' a marked increase in cultivated crop area from 16,182,000 acres in 1920 to 17,548,000 acres in 1926, an increase of 8.4%. Corn area was increased from 7,560,000 acres to 8,994,000 acres; wheat from 3,593,000 acres to 3,630,000 acres; rye from 129,000 acres to 253,000 acres; all hay from 3,934,000 acres to 4,291,000 acres; sweet clover, mostly for pasture, from 30,000 acres to 361,000 acres. Much of this increase in acreage occurred in western Nebraska. While there was a slight change in other crops, the most marked changes were in those crops which are essential to increased production of livestock and its products. The biennium 1925 and 1926 shows a considerable im - provement in agriculture as compared to the previous four years. Both grain and livestock prices had advanced somewhat and the gross farm income for the year ending June 30, 1925 had increased to $424,147,000 as compared to the low return of $289,100,000 in 1922. Further improvement in prices was noted for the year ending June 30, 1926 and the farm income reached $432,378,000. This came largely from the improve - ment in prices of cattle and particularly hogs. Nebraska ranked high in crop production in 1925, being fourth among the states. Nebraska ranked second in alfalfa, and wild hay; third in corn, winter wheat and all hay. The state ranked fourth in all livestock; second in hogs; third in cattle other than milk cows and fifth in horses. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Crops were extremely poor in 1926 and the income from the sales of cash crops dropped materially. In fact, crop produc - tion in 1926 was the lowest for years and one of the poorest crops on record. Shortage of hay, pasture and forage com - pelled farmers to sell off cattle which was unfortunate because cattle prices had just begun to advance. Hog prices continued abnormally high throughout the biennium and contributed heavily toward the increase in gross farm income. For the year ending June 30, 1925, hogs brought $133,191,000 against $106,879,000 from cattle sales, and for the following year, hogs sold for $135,419,000 despite the reduced numbers as com - pared to $129,246,000 received for cattle. Despite the extremely low crop production in 1926, Ne - braska ranked first in wild hay, second in sugar beets and alfalfa; third in all hay and 1 4th among the states in all crops. The state held its fourth place in all livestock; second in hogs and third in cattle again. Dairying maintained the impetus obtained soon after . the price slump in grain and meat prices in 1920 due to the relative - ly better prices for butter fat. The state had raised its Tank in creamery butter production from sixth place in 1921 to fourth place in 1924 which rank was maintained throughout the bi - ennium of 1925 and 1926. The production of creamery butter increased from 56,661,000 pounds in 1920 to 90,882,000 pounds at the close of the biennium, a gain of 60%. Cheese production got a fair start in 1925, and trebled in 1926. Prices of milk cows began to advance as a result of greater develop - ment and better returns from the industry. Sugar beet production advanced from fourth place among the states in 1925 to second place in 1926. A new factory wa3 built in 1926 making a total of six factories. The state produced 220,000,000 pounds of sugar in 1925 and 208,000,000 pounds in 1926. Beef cattle production had begun to decline in 1925. A total of 2,619,000 head were on hand in 1920. The forced </seg>
            <seg id="p013">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1925-1926 sales of cattle due to the deflation lowered this total to 2,41 3,000 head in 1921. Production increased steadily each year until it reached 2,774,000 head in 1924. The decline began in 1925 with 2,689,000 head and a further reduction to 2,566,000 head in 1926. Cattle constituted 35.2 % of the total income from the sales of livestock and its products in 1925 and 39.2% in 1926. On the other hand, milk cows increased from 535,000 head in 1 920. to 625,000 head in 1926. Milk cows had reached the lowest number in 1920 for years. High prices of meat animals and grain crops had diverted the farmers attention from dairy - ing. The slump in farm prices in 1920 did not fall as heavily on butterfat as oh other farm products, because production was at a low point. Naturally, farmers turned to dairying with the re - sult-that milk, cows increased from 535,000 head in 1920 to 625,000 head in 1926. - During the same period, the produc - tion of creamery butter increased 60 % placing Nebraska from sixth to fourth rank among the states. Hog production had reached a new high mark in 1924 with a total of 5,983,000 head on hand. This number declined to 4,818,000 head in 1925 and 4,700,000 head in 1926. Hogs sold during the year ending June 30, 1925 reached the high total of 6,035,336 head which averaged $22.06 per head and brought a total income of $133,190,568. For the year ending June 30, 1926, a total of 4,800,504 head were sold at the high average price of $28.20 per head, bringing the income to $1 35, - 418,659. The sale of hogs constituted 43.8 % of the total in - come from livestock and its products in 1925 and 41 % in 1926. It exceeds the total received from the sale of all crops by a large margin in both 1925 and 1926. The sheep business in Nebraska is largely a feeding proposi - tion. Its location and advantage as a feeding state are such that an unduly large proportion of the sheep are finished here on -the way from the range to eastern consuming and exporting stations. Records as of January 1 of each year show that Ne - braska has from 25% to 30% of the total number of sheep </seg>
            <seg id="p014">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The I'se of the Two-row Cultivator Is Common in Nebraska on feed in the eleven corn belt states. The total market receipts of sheep from Nebraska in 1925 were, 1,115,980 head and 1,245,395 head in 1926. Practically all of these are shipped into the state for feeding since the state does not usually produce more than 75,000 lambs each year. Horses have declined since the high mark of 1,049,000 head in 1919 to 840,000 in 1926! The low mark in value was reached in 1924, slight advances being recorded in 1925 and again in 1926. Mules, on the other hand increased from 109, - 000 head in 1919 to 120,000 head in 1926. Prices began to advance slightly in 1925. The marked increase in modern home conveniences and farm machinery since 1920 is nothing short of marvelous. Water systems increased from 5,718 plants to 16,422 plants; heating plants from 5,301 to 1 1,564; lighting systems from 5, - 648 to 13,731; automobiles from 88,613 to 112,878; trucks from 5,233 to 12,037; tractors from 8,888 to 19,489. Time saving machinery has increased production at lower cost. Added comforts to the home have stimulated farmers to greater activity and contentment which in turn more than compensates them for such investments. No doubt this has been a contribut - ing factor in the development of agriculture through what has perhaps been the greatest crisis in the history of Nebraska agriculture. </seg>

            <seg id="p023">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1925-1926 BUREAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY C. H. Hays, Chief GENERAL STATEMENT In reporting activities of the Nebraska Department of Agri - culture pertaining to the protection of the health of livestock, a brief reference to powers and duties, and the organization of the Department for such work, will make for a possible clearer understanding as to the limitations and scope applying in such departmental service. Nebraska ■ statutes vest in the Depart - ment of Agriculture the power, and charge it with the duties, of protecting the health of domestic animals; and to that end give to the Department authority to determine and employ the most efficient and practical means for the prevention, control, suppression and eradication of dangerous, infectious, contagious •or otherwise transmissible disease of domestic animals. The power of ■ quarantine vested in the Department provides authority to quarantine diseased animals, or animals exposed to the infec - tion of disease, and any county, or part of any county, or private premises, or private and public stockyards. The Department may cause any animal infected with a dangerous disease to be killed, and may regulate or prohibit the. arrival into, ot departure from, and movement within the state of livestock affected with any disease. The Supreme Court of Nebraska held the authority vested in the Department to cause the inspection, examination and test of domestic animals for determining the presence of disease and the destruction of diseased animals, together with, the promulgation of quarantine regulatory measures to apply in combating disease among livestock, to be fully constitutional, and within a proper exercise of the police authority vested in the Department. The Department in the administration of such duties has provided a division, designated the Bureau of Animal Industry, arid, to that bureau, as an integral part of the department, has been assigned a personnel for carrying out the orders, and in - structions ot the department, under directions of a veterinarian </seg>
            <seg id="p024">DEPARTAfENT OF AGRICULTURE in charge, termed the Chief of said bureau. The department, by authority and assent from the legislature, has given to ap - pointees of the United States Bureau of Animal Industry, assigned to duties in Nebraska, the same powers and authority as given to appointees in the state bureau, but to be effective only in work operative in cooperation through the State Bu - reau of Animal Industry. Such arrangement has proven most advantageous in handling cooperative work established by the Department with the United States Bureau of Animal Industry in combating animal diseases. Said arrangement ha3 in all re - spects been established in a fully legal manner, and has given to the organized work of the department a greater efficiency for assisting the livestock industry in problems of disease control and eradication, than it is believed would have otherwise obtained. Rules, Regulations, and Instructions. A full complement of rules and regulations as required under the various statutory provisions of Nebraska laws, for the pro - tection of the health of livestock, had not been promulgated, or were not in effect on January I, 1925. Immediately upon con - clusion of the work of the Legislature of 1925, which body re - enacted or revised certain laws relating to animal health, the Department promulgated necessary rules and regulations for governing the handling, traffic and disposal of diseased live - stock, and of livestock exposed to disease (Nebr. B. A. I. Order 6); also sanitary regulations governing the admission of live - stock moved into Nebraska (Nebr. B. A. I. Order 4). These orders were published by the department in bulletin form, Nebr. B. A. 1. Order 6 as Bulletin No. 100 and Nebr. B. A. I. Order 4 as Circular No. II. Other regulations were promulgated and issued by the Department to govern the handling of live poultry, and of equipment used in the assemblage and com - mercial feeding of poultry (Nebr. B. A. I. Orders I and 3). In the issuance of such regulations, to meet the needs of a proper administration of state laws in the exercise of the duties placed upon the department, due regard has been directed to simplicity and practicability, and yet have sufficient detail to avoid confusion and misunderstanding in their application. </seg>

B. A. I. Order 2) ; and instructions defining the methods for using, tuberculin on domestic animals, and the reports to be made to the department of such use. A list was included of the names of practicing veterinarians authorized to use tuber - culin. The instructions were made broader in scope than apply - ing specifically to the use of tuberculin, having for a purpose the development of a more efficient cooperation between practicing veterinarians and the department for combating animal diseases. . Forces Engaged It was necessary in carrying out the. orders of the Depart - ment, in service to the livestock industry, to employ under the Bureau of Animal Industry a number of qualified and trained veterinarians. Such personnel of the Bureau has been in addi - tion to an adequate clerical force for handling the administra - tive work and records at the Lincoln office. The force of veterinarians engaged by the Department in addition to the chief veterinarian, has consisted of three veterinarians assigned, more particularly to special investigations, directly from the Lincoln office, and a larger group of veterinarians engaged in field activities on organized project work. This has made the en - rollment, on full time employment, of eight to twelve veteri - narians each month. In addition to such group of regularly employed veterinarians, other veterinarians have been secured from time to time dependent upon the need of the work, by the employment temporarily of veterinarians on a monthly or a per diem basis. The veterinarians engaged on per diem were those in practice in the different districts in which their services were needed, but who were available for part time service only. This arrangement has proven very satisfactory, except in a few instances, and has been somewhat more economical, all things considered, than would have been obtained in keeping a suffi - ciently large enrollment of full time employees to meet the de - partment's needs. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The forces engaged by the state on animal disease work have been augmented throughout the entire period covered by this report through the assignment of a number of veterinarians by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry for services in Nebraska in cooperation with the Department. Such arrange - ment has been lawfully established, as previously stated, by assent through legislative act. The force of federal employees thus cooperatively engaged has comprised of from twelve to fifteen veterinarians constantly in service in the state. This force of veterinarians has been engaged on projects of organized work based on specific memorandum of understanding adopted in agreement between the state and federal departments, but members of such force, have in emergencies, been made available for special services upon request by the Department. The established cooperation with the United States Bureau has further aided in the eradication of animal disease by bringing to cattle owners compensation through federal funds for cattle caused to be slaughtered on account of tuberculosis. Though not a part in any direct official way with the De - partment in livestock disease control work, the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of the Experiment Station of the Nebraska Agricultural College has rendered exceptionally valuable assistance to the Department in its efforts to protect the health of livestock in the state. The laboratory facilities and the workers engaged in the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene have been available at all times to assist in the diagnosis of diseases and for other services by which the eradica - tion of disease could be more successfully accomplished. The extension department of the State Agricultural College has materially aided in extending the services of the Department to the livestock industry, more particularly in connection with the testing of cattle for tuberculosis. Cooperation from live - stock owners, fundamentally essential for any work to be suc - cessful in combating animal diseases, while not at all times what would have given the greatest results, has been extended in a very satisfactory way. It is hoped that this phase may be strengthened in order to make the future services of the De - partment more effective. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1925-1926 Service Policy The work of the Department in the protection of the health of livestock has functioned in so far as possible in keeping with certain fundamentals which should primarily govern in such a public service.' There are two main divisions in the efforts to control, suppress or eradicate disease; first, the attack on dis - ease existing among livestock, and, second, the prevention of disease from being introduced among livestock. In expending public services, the common welfare of the community must be given consideration over the primary interests of the in - dividual. This need not operate to effect neglect of the in - dividual or the sacrifice of his interests for the community except in acute emergencies, but the application of this principal has been' responsible for many disagreeable comments and much controversy over the activities of the Department. Much of the organized work of the Department in effecting disease con - trol and eradication has been in the form of individual service, and in addition the department has assisted individual livestock owners in the diagnosis of disease appearing in the animals of their flocks and herds, and in recommending ways and means for handling such disease problems. - Services to individual livestock owners have in the greater part been extended in co - operation with local practicing veterinarians where such veterin - ary service was available, otherwise department services have been direct to such owners. Field Activities The activities of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture in the field, for the eradication of animal diseases, during the biennium of 1925-26, which period has been extended to in - clude December 1924 not previously reported, have been grouped, in reporting, under the different projects of work, namely, tuberculosis and scabies eradication, swine diseases; the suppression of glanders, anthrax and the investigation of horse losses in northern Sioux County. The projects relating to tuberculosis, scabies and the investigation of horse losses were under a specific memorandum, and were handled by full </seg>

The other work was more or less operative as special investigations by temporary assignments. Grouping of the work, or the position given in the reporting, has not been attempted on a basis of relative economic value, but rather from a basis of the volume of work completed, measured by the number of persons engaged and money expended. ANIMAL TUBERCULOSIS ERADICATION General Statement The services of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture to the livestock industry in the eradication of animal tuberculosis were greatly extended, and otherwise increased, during the biennium 1925-26, through the activities of the Bureau of Animal Industry. Such work, because of statutory limitations, was directed, with certain exceptions, against tuberculosis among cattle. As the report will later show certain attentions were given to a consideration of avian tuberculosis, not alone be - cause of its effect upon the poultry industry but because of the spread of tuberculosis from poultry to swine. The work in Nebraska directed against animal tuberculosis, except fot a limited amount of attention from practicing veteri - narians as a private service, has been completed with the co - operative assistance of the United States Bureaus of Animal Industry. Such work thus became a part of the nation-wide campaign in progress to eradicate animal tuberculosis. Ne - braska first became engaged in the campaign in 1919, and the progress, which has been particularly rapid since January 1, 1925, has obtained because of the cooperative support from livestock owners, individually and collectively, through their various farm and livestock breeders associations; and fro^ civic and commercial clubs and associations; from educational and extension workers and others interested in public welfare, particularly as relates to the livestock industry. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1925rl92G At the . time the work of the Department was taken over in January 1925, the need of a more comprehensive plan to apply : in group or community testing of cattle for tuberculosis was evident. Requests from the livestock owners, and persons otherwise a part of such industry, for services and assistance were of such volume to necessitate an arrangement in plans that would make possible a more complete and economic service from the funds available. The legislature of 1925 met this situation by an act providing for the establishment by the De - partment of county areas to test for tuberculosis all herds of cattle located in such areas, and to otherwise effect such sanitary measures as were necessary for the successful eradication of the disease. For the first time in Nebraska, the examination and testing of cattle for' tuberculosis was made compulsory as a means for eradicating the disease. . '. The services of the department through the Bureau of Animal Industry, for tuberculin testing of cattle, has been effected under two plans, namely, the accredited herd and the county area plans. Both of these plans have been piovided under uniform methods and rules, lawfully adopted by the depart - ment by official order, which uniform methods and rules have been the same as approved between the several state and fed - eral departments engaged in the nation-wide tuberculosis eradica-. tion campaign, previously referred to. On December I, 1924, there were, in Nebraska, 142 herds of cattle fully accredited tuberculosis-free and so certified, the result of tuberculin testing the cattle in said herds for tuberculosis under the supervision of the state- and federal officials in charge of cooperative work. On January I, 1925, tuberculin testing under the area plan had been arranged for, or was in progress in ten ( 1 0) counties in the state, namely : Burt, Butler, Dakota, Dodge, Douglas, Gage, Polk, Sarpy, Saunders and Thayer. Effective April 20, 1925, the tuberculin testing of cattle in these ten counties was established in keeping with the provisions of the act of the Legislature of 1925. The number of county testing areas was increased to twenty-one (21) by January I,' 1926, through the addition of the following counties to those </seg>

The reactor cattle represented 1&gt; 1 per cent of the total number of cattle tested.

As the testing reported included retests of </seg>
            <seg id="p032">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE many of the herds, including many cattle tested on the initial test, the percentages given are not a correct index as to the incidence of tuberculosis among cattle, nor as to the herd morbidity, for that area of Nebraska involved. However, as will be later shown these figures are relatively correct. Whenever a herd was found to contain tuberculous cattle as disclosed by tuberculin test, under either the. accredited herd or county area plan, and to a limited extent under private test - ing, a retest of the cattle in such herd was required at ap - proximately sixty-day intervals until none of the cattle in the herd were found to be reactors. Upon completion of each test, all reactors were removed and not retested, but were destroyed. In herds where a high incidence of the disease was found, or where generalized cases of tuberculosis were located, two suc - cessive clean herd tests at sixty-day intervals were invariably applied. Further, where the incidence of tuberculosis among cattle of the herds in a county, being tested under the area plan, was determined, as a result of a general test of all herds, to be more than one per cent, the cattle of all herds were caused to be retested within approximately one year from date of the com - pletion of the last general test in such a county. This same requirement was placed on even smaller units, being applied to many precincts in which the incidence of the disease was found to be more than one per cent. Incidence and Herd Morbidity of Tuberculosis Among Cattle Because of these facts regarding the rules applying in the testing reported, the prevalence of tuberculosis among cattle, and the herd morbidity, for the district covered, cannot be cor - rectly obtained from the general summary hereinbefore recorded under Table I. HoweveT, under Table II has been listed a sum - mary of the results of the first general test for tuberculosis of the cattle of all herds in a number of different counties (25) of Ne - braska in which such testing has been completed during the period of this report, the biennium 1925-26, with one month from 1924 included. </seg>

These reports of testing are of initial tests, and contain no duplication by retest. In said county areas, the aver - age incidence of tuberculosis was found to be 1.27 per cent, while the herd morbidity rate was 8.81 per cent.

            <seg id="p034">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE one-half of one per cent or less at the time of the last general test. In certain county areas in which testing was conducted under a somewhat incomplete area plan in 19 2 I -22, retesting was completed during 1925-26, and a comparison of results from records available shows a marked reduction of the incidence of dbease among cattle, and likewise in the herd morbidity rate. Disposal of Reactor Cattle Cattle classified to be reactors were removed from the herds, of which they were then a part, immediately upon com - pletion of the determining test. This order applied with few exceptions, having the full cooperation of cattle owners. The reactor cattle were caused to be slaughtered under the super - vision of the meat inspection service of the United States Bu - reau of Animal Industry. In the slaughter of cattle reacting to tuberculin test every precaution was taken to have such inspec - tion disclose any lesions of the disease of sufficient size to be detected by the unaided eye macroscopic lesions). The final inspection determined the fitness of the carcasses, and parts thereof, of reactor cattle for use as food purposes. A total of 9,793 cattle reactors to tuberculin test from Nebraska were slaughtered during 1925 and 1926 under said inspection serv - ice. Of the carcasses of such group of cattle, 8,246 were passed for food direct, 75 others were passed for food after the flesh of such carcasses had been sterilized and the remaining 1,473 carcasses were condemned and destroyed against use for food purposes because of generalized or extensive tuberculosis. Reimbursement on Reactor Cattle In the disposal to slaughter of reactor cattle from Nebraska, such cattle were marketed through the usual channels for sale, except that at all times such cattle were under quarantine re - strictions to protect against the spread of the disease, and to insure that slaughter would be under federal supervision and inspection. The respective owners of such cattle received all returns from sale of their animals, which salvage returns amount - ed in total during 1925-26 to $272,960.72.

The expenditures have been tabulated and are herein edited as Table IV. The costs given are primarily the expenses incurred by field veterin - arians in testing, but include cost for all services incident to adop - tion of essential measures for eradication of the disease, such as supervision of disinfection of contaminated premises, disposal of reactor cattle and organization for tests. Equipment and sup - plies were not included, but these form a relatively small part of such expenditures and cannot be accurately divided to the dif - ferent testing areas. These costs have been variable from area to area because of handicaps some of which were natural and could not be prevented, as for instance, weather and road con - ditions, and topography of the county; while others were man - made and though limited to a relatively few persons had the effect of causing a considerable increase in expense of testing in the areas where the same occurred. The expenses listed also include in a large part the cost of testing applied by the state and federal departments. ;Under the accredited herd plan. </seg>

Of such cost the proportion to be refunded from county funds amounted to approximately six and one-half cents. These costs were not inclusive of retest expense following the completion of the general test, but, however, did include in all counties a portion of such retest expense and in several practi - cally all such expense. In submitting this report of tuberculosis eradication work, only the recorded activities of the Department have been re - ported upon. Many another attention has been given in further - ing the work, but such were of a more or less intangible nature, therefore non-reportable. Reference in the instance is to con - ferences and meetings had with livestock owners and others interested in the establishing of testing areas. The purpose in ■responding to such requests being to have a proper and correct understanding of the Department work appreciated, particularly as to methods and rules adopted in handling such work. It has been gratifying to note the rapid progress made under these methods. However, under the plan it has not been the policy, to go further in encouraging the work than that of having the plan correctly and fully understood. It is doubtful that the needs for the eradication of animal tuberculosis in Nebraska are as universally accepted as the situation warrants, due in a large part, it is believed to the low incidence of the disease. The widespread prevalence of the disease has been under, evaluated in considering the problem. ' Avian Tuberculosis Tuberculosis among poultry has occupied the attention of the Nebraska Bureau of Animal Industry, and the cooperating Federal Bureau, to a considerable extent during the biennium 1925-26.

During the period from February 1925 to December 1926, inclusive, 18,755 flocks came under such observations, of which 1,172 were found in - fected, limited clinical methods of determination being the only means for ouch determination. While such methods were in - sufficient, the information thus obtained from a rather extensive area indicated a wide spread prevalence of tuberculosis among poultry on the farms of Nebraska, and there was demonstrated a need of a more detailed and definite inquiry with particular reference to determining some practical measures for combat - ing avian tuberculosis. The economic relation of avian tuberculosis in the incidence of tuberculosis among swine was evidenced by findings upon slaughter and post-mortem inspection under the meat inspection service of the United States Bureau of Animal Industry. The relative part the infection of avian tuberculosis played in the in - fection of swine was first clearly demonstrated by the work of the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of the Ne - braska Experiment Station. Drs. Van Es and Martin of that station through their research findings showed that a larger per - centage of swine tuberculosis in Nebraska resulted from sources other than from the bovine. Such additional observations more certainly indicate the need of attention to the contTol, and eradi - cation of tuberculosis among poultry. Tentative plans have been completed for making a some - what comprehensive survey to secure more specific data as to the possible prevalence of the disease among poultry. Such plans will provide for the testing of all chicken flocks in a given restricted area in one or more counties in which the testing of the cattle has been completed, said district being certified a modified accredited area. In anticipation of such a service from the department, a petition was filed with the Bureau of Animal Industry, signed by more than 60 per cent of the flock owners located in Silver Creek Precinct in Burt County requesting that such testing of Bocks be applied in that area. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1925-1926 Scabies Scabjes (commonly referred to as scab, mange or itch) among domestic animals in Nebraska, has a wide distribution among livestock in the state, and has been a serious economic menace in the production of livestock in the state, more especi - ally in the production of cattle under range conditions. The distribution of the disease to many parts of the state has been effected through the traffic of animals into feed-lots for fatten - ing for market. The disease among swine has spread rapidly, and, during the past - few years, has become a breeding herd problem in every section of the state. The disease among horse stock has been confined, except for a few sporadic cases, to the eastern part of Thurston County and a limited part of contiguous' territory, being in the greater part confined to the ' Indian reservations. ' A report regarding scabies control and eradication can be more correctly appreciated where a knowledge, of certain facts as to the nature of the disease, is possessed and to such purpose, a brief statement has been added in that particular. Scabies is a parasitic infestation of the skin by small "spider like" parasites, of near microscopic size,- termed mites. The scabies mite infest - ing one species of domestic animal as host is peculiar in that other species of domestic animals are not susceptible as host. There are a number of different species of scab mites produc - tive of tissue disturbance on a single species or domestic animal as host. Certain species of mites cause only a disturbance and destruction of the outer layer of the skin (Psoroptic scab) ; other species of mites burrow in their attack into the deep layers of the skin (Sarcoptic scab) ; and other species of mites in their attack center along hair follicles (Demodectic scab). Scabies among cattle in Nebraska has, with limited exceptions, been found to be of the Psoroptic type (common mange). How - ever, a number of cases of Sarcoptic scab have been determined among cattle, usually cattle in herds trafficked, or otherwise associated with, show circuits and auction sales at the larger markets. Demodectic scab has been limited to two cases on cattle moved interstate into Nebraska from southern states. </seg>
            <seg id="p040">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Scabies among sheep has been only Psoroptic or common mange, and in horses and swine only Sarcoptic mange. The control, suppression or eradication of scabies is ob - viously dependent upon the destruction of the causative para - site. These parasites do not remain long infective off the host animal, and, therefore, the treatment of infested animals be - comes the basis for control or eradication. Treatment of affected animals necessitates the use of materials which will destroy the mites, but which will not do serious damage to the affected animal. Materials that will destroy the mites, and simultaneously the eggs deposited by the infective mites on the body of the host animal, have not been found practical. It has, therefore, been necessary to make repeated treatments of in - fected animals at certain definite intervals, dependent upon the life cycle and habits of the particular species of mites causing the disease. The Nebraska Department of Agriculture has been engaged, with cooperative assistance from the United States Bureau of Animal Industry, in a definite project for the eradication of scabies, given more to the suppression of the disease among cattle of range herds in the sand hill area of the state. Limited attention has been directed against the disease among sheep, less against horse mange, and no organized work has been instituted to combat scabies among swine. In combating scabies under the plans and methods adopted, each case of the disease, and to a certain degree any cases involving only exposure to the infection, has been, when determined, placed under quarantine, and the affected and exposed animals treated, under an official supervision. Such treatment has been required by regulation to be applied in a manner and with materials approved for such treatment by the Department. To some extent privilege has been extended that affected lots, flocks or herds could be marketed without treatment when the animals were intended for slaughter, and were in suitable marketing condition. A force consisting of three state and three federal veterin - arians has been constantly maintained in the field, except for a </seg>

Such force has been engaged in work of combating scabies among range cattle herds. Each feed lot exposure, whether applying to cattle or sheep, was promptly investigated by a state or federal veterinarian, and the disposal of the infection handled in keep - ing with the regulatory provisions of the department, having in mind in each instance the interests of the individual owner, as well as the interest of the industry at large.

INVESTIGATIONS OF HORSE LOSSES IN SIOUX COUNTY During 1925-1926 Losses of horses by death from a disease of an unknown, cause on farms and ranches in Sioux County, -more particularly in the northern part of the. county, were reported to the De - partment early in 1925 with an urgent request for assistance. History regarding such losses obtained from various sources, and later substantiated by more specific herd histories, indicated that losses among horses had been occurring from an apparently common cause in the district involved, with a more or less alarming frequency, since (916. Two or three limited in - quiries had been made prior to 1925, but no records were avail - able to show that any progress had been made in determining 'the cause. During the summer of 1925 a veterinarian was assigned by the Department to make a survey to determine the nature of the disease appearing among horses of northern Sioux county, or elsewhere in western Nebraska, and insofar as possible to determine the extent of the losses and area involved. Such field survey was made in association and cooperation with the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of the State Agricultural College, said department assigning a veterinarian to assist for a- time and later had a botanist assigned for special service. The findings of such survey demonstrated the necessity for further study of the disease, and in consequence a veterin - arian was detailed by the Department during the summer of 1926, who, assisted by a botanist assigned by the Experiment Station. of the State Agricultural College through the Depart - ment of Animal Pathology and Hygiene, continued the study of the disease and losses occurring during 1926. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTURE The plans for the investigation were definitely outlined, ami in addition to field investigations, incorporated feeding experi - ments of horses on certain plants under suspicion as possible cause of the losses. Laboratory research, studies oi tissue arm other materials collected from the carcasses of horses affected by the disease and inoculation experiments were also made. The feeding experiments were conducted at the North Platle Experiment Station, while the laboratory work was done in the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene laboratory- at Lincoln. Plants were also collected and shipped to the field station of the United States Bureau of Animal Industry at Salina, Utah, established for investigation of poisonous plants. The work of 1925-26 was not productive of any conclusive findings, but the fact that the disease was not infectious or con - tagious was determined and demonstrated. Further, the work . indicated that the losses were not caused by the then suspected Lupine plants. Further study was planned for 1927. A sum - mary has been compiled from the records on file in the office of the Bureau of Animal Industry of certain field activities in the work completed during 1925-26 and is herewith edited as Table X.

The two cases were related as to origin, the infection having been carried from one farm to another in the same neighborhood. The disease was determined, initially as result of mallein tests (the field test to determine glanders), applied by a practicing veterinarian, later confirmed by laboratory testa made upon re - quest from the Department in the office of the United States bureau of Animal industry at Washington, D. C. The affected animals, four horses and one mule, were caused to be slaughtered and the carcasses destroyed, under supervision of a veterinarian, assigned by the- Bureau of Animal Industry, who in cooperation •with the attending veterinarian made further examinations and tests of horse stock exposed, or suspected of being exposed, that the disease might b'e eradicated. The owners of the gland - ered horses destroyed by the State were reimbursed from the funds appropriated the Department, for such purposes, in the total of $320.00. In addition to the activities related in the preceding para - graph pertaining to glandeU disease, the records on file in tho office of the Bureau of Animal Industry show that during the year 1925, 186 different lots of horse stock, comprising 2501 animals, were mallein tested, and all such horse stock was found to be free of the disease except for the cases previously referred to. Similar tests, were applied during 1926 on 226 lots of horse stock, comprising 3,718 animals, and of this group none of the animals were determined to be affected. In the greater part, the testing of horse stock, j reported to the Department, was occasioned to meet the restrictions of livestock sanitary regula - tions in the shipment interstate of such class of livestock from Nebraska to certain states. i It is evident from the results of the tests reported that glanders does not exist to any alarming extent among horse stock in Nebraska. However, continued and prompt attention will prove necessary in protection against the disease.

The disease appeared primarily as a disease of cattle, but was spread to swine allowed to feed on the carcasses of cattle dead from the disease, thus resulting in certain losses by death in both cattle and swine. In each instance where the disease was determined a special quarantine was placed upon all livestock on such infected premises to prevent traffic and sale of the exposed animals. Such quarantines were usually placed by the practicing veterin - arian wno was called on the case, in certain instances quarantine being placed prior to a positive diagnosis being made. The De - partment of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of the State Agri - cultural College has cooperated in a most effective way by laboratory diagnosis from material collected from suspected cases. Special attention was particularly given in making a care - ful survey in the infected areas that hidden cases might be re - vealed and proper steps taken to limit the contamination of the area. Swine Diseases The Department was engaged only to a limited extent in specific work relating to project activities for the control and suppression of swine diseases. In cooperation between the De - partment and the United States Bureau of Animal Industry a service was maintained for assisting in the diagnosis of diseases occurring among swine, for giving special attention to outbreaks of hog cholera and such other services as might prove of value to prevent losses among swine from disease. The cooperation established with the Federal Bureau became extended in Nebraska to assisting the Extension Department of the Agricultural College in a series of meetings over a con - siderable part of the swine producing area of the state to encour - age and cause to be adopted a definite plan of swine sanitation.

A Poultry Disease Problem During the fall of 1 924, numerous car lot shipments of live poultry suffering with respiratory disease conditions, were re - ceived at the New York terminal poultry market from several midwestern states, including Nebraska. The fact, together with the alarm caused by the reports finding the European Fowl Plague, among flocks of certain eastern states, caused the placing of an embargo by New York and other eastern states against the importations of live poultry from Nebraska and several other mid-western states. The action caused serious losses to the poultry producers and those engaged in marketing poultry from Nebraska. With an intent of helping to protect against a repetition of such losses, and to secure information which might help to place the responsibility for the occurrence of shipping losses, the De - partment became engaged in a series, of investigations through the assignment of a veterinarian by the Bureau of Animal Indus - try during the fall shipping seasons of 1925 and 1926. In the course of such investigations, thirty-five car lot shippers of poultry were interviewed, and their poultry shipping operations observed. Their establishments, and the methods practiced, were examined, and recommendations made as to sanitary im - provements. A number of special investigations were made relative to certain specific shipments of poultry reported diseased upon arrival at the terminal market. The contact had by the Department proved very valuable, and from the study made it is a fair estimate to state that in the greater part responsibility for the excessive losses occurring in live poultry shipments rests with the shipper due to the methods of collection, assemblage and shipments. </seg>

In the course of compliance with such regulatory provisions there were reported to the office of the Nebraska Bureau of Animal Industry either through certifica - tion,of health, or by request for special permission to have the required inspection and examination at destination, the livestock as shown by summary under Table XI. These figures do not include all livestock moved interstate or from public stock - yards into the state, for reason that certain classes of livestock have not been -reauired to be certified, and neglect and viola - tions have occurred in not complying with the prescribed regula - tions.

Exports In the movement of livestock interstate from Nebraska into other states, the regulations of such other states require an endorsement and approval of the Department on official health charts and certificates covering such shipments. The records in file in the office of- the Nebraska Bureau of Animal Industry of export livestock shipments have been summarized and edited as Table XII. It should be appreciated that the privilege of such lots of livestock as were in many instances moved, depended on the fact of there being a service available in Nebraska to provide the required test, inspection and examination.

O'Connell, Chief Organization Under the present organization of the Bureau of Game and Fish the following subdivisions have been made: Division of Office and Licenses. Division of Inspection and Control. Division of Conservation and Distribution. Division of Recreation Grounds. Valentine Hatchery. Benkelman Hatchery. Gretna HatcheTy. Rock Creek Hatchery. Office and License Division The office and division of licenses is located at the State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. This is the central office under the supervision of a Chief where the different activities ate di - rected, and all the various licenses sold and fees collected. Licenses are sold through county clerks, banks, hardware dealers, etc., and at the end of the present biennium there are approxi - mately nine hundred accounts throughout the State. In order to inform the sportsmen and other citizens of Ne - braska, who are interested in the work of the Bureau, and to in - culcate greater appreciation of the wild life and natural beauty of Nebraska, a quarterly publication, known as "OUTDOOR NEBRASKA", was published during the last half of the biennium. -*■ Several editions of game laws have been published together with minor publications dealing with the work of the Bureau. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1925-1926 Inspection and Control The Division of Inspection and Control consists of the en - forcement of .the Game and Fish laws, inspection of licenses, the control of fish and game and the studying and surveying of all conditions affecting fish and game. A large number of game wardens have been employed and an ardent effort has been made to strictly enforce all the laws protecting and controlling fish and game. The wardens have been equipped with cars and the State divided into districts so that there would be no overlapping of territory and duplicate effort. During the winter months the force of wardens is reduced. A Field Superintendent is now employed. His duties are to supervise, the wardens, check over their work and instruct them in their duties. He works directly under the Chief of the Bureau and spends his time in the field. The following table gives the number and nature of the various violations and the' convictions secured during the biennium: VIOLATIONS Dec. 1,1924 Dec. 1,1925 Total to to for Dec. 1, 1925 Dec. 1, 1926 Biennium Hunting Illegally 29 46 75 Fishing Illegally 23 108 131 Trapping Illegally , 8 27 35 Hunting without License 28 41 ■ 69 Fishing without License 43 100 143 Trapping without License 5 4 9 Shooting after Sunset 9 11 20 Illegal possession of Fish and Game 29 25 54 Buying Purs without License 112 Impersonating Game Warden :... 1 1 Illegal Sale of Fish .... . ....

            <seg id="p056">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Conservation and Distribution The conservation of fish and game is one of the most im - portant activities of the Bureau. Each year many ponds, irriga - tion ditches and takes contain fish which would freeze out the following winter were they not transferred to other waters. Each year the Missouri River and other streams overflow filling nearby ponds and sloughs with water. Here is provided natural spawning beds where thousands of bullheads, catfish, crappies and perch spawn. Most summers these ponds and sloughs dry up and were it not for the seining crews of the Bureau many of these fish would be lost. During the summer of 1926 many ponds and swamps in northern Nebraska dried up owing to lack of normal water fall during the two preceding seasons. This caused considerable conservation work and a number of ponds and overflows were seined. Thousands of adult fish were saved in this way. Game Bird Distribution During the biennium 400 Hungarian Partridges were im - ported and distributed in favorable localities throughout the State. Early in 1926 the Bureau was faced with the situation of having too many Ring-Neck pheasants in Howard, Sherman, Greeley and Valley Counties, while in eastern and southern Ne - braska there was a great demand for these birds. The Bureau made arangements for trapping and transplanting these birds. Approximately 15,000 were thus redistributed. The average cost in getting birds in this manner was $1.40 per bird, whereas to have shipped them in from game farms or to have imported them they would have cost $3.00 or $4.00 per bird. The following Ring-Neck Phesants were trapped in several of the counties where they had thrived especially well and were Teshipped to the counties as noted: </seg>

Carter Lake furnished fish - ing (or thousands of Douglas County citizens, many of -whom seldom get away to seek recreation in other parts. A total of 302,389,500 gallons of water was pumped into the lake. The state paid one. half of the cost of this amount, which was $3, - 779.87. The lake is now near normal. In addition to this the lake was seined of coarse fish and restocked with game fish. Wells The Bureau has sunk wells on a number of lakes in northern Nebraska in order to save fish that had been stocked by the State at considerable expense. Owing to the extremely dry season many lakes were so low that wells were required to keep them from drying up in the summer and freezing out in the winter. ■', PERMITS Dec. 1, 1924 Dec. 1,1925 Total to to for Dec. 1,1925 Dec. 1, 1926 Biennlum .

Instead of putting fry into natural waters when they leave the hatchery they can be put in nursery ponds in suitable loca - tions throughout the State. They should be placed in such ponds in the spring and released in nearby waters in the fall. Where this method of fish culture is followed approximately fifty per cent of the fish planted reach maturity, whereas under the old system of putting fry into natural waters direct from the hatchery only about five to ten per cent reached maturity. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Sites in the following counties have been deeded to the State and nursery ponds constructed or in the process of con - struction thereon: Antelope, one; Holt, one; Brown, one; Sheridan, one; Dawes, one. Nurseries under the auspices of the local chapters of the Izaak Walton League have been established in Johnson, Dodge, Colfax, Dawson and Dundy Counties. Game and Bird Preserves With the population of Nebraska increasing, lowlands being drained, and open prairies being cultivated, the problem of con - serving wild game and birds grows more and more difficult. With this in mind the Bureau has encouraged the establish - ing of preserves throughout the State. There are several of these preserves established by the Legislature; namely, Bessey Division of the National Forest, comprising 94,670 acres; the Niobrara Division of the Nebraska National Forest, comprising 123,138 acres; the Fontenelle Forest Reserve, comprising 2,543 acres; the Garden County Preserve, comprising !0 rods on each side of the Platte River in Garden County, Nebraska. During the biennium the following additional preserves have been established through leasing, as provided by law: Preserve No. 2, near Nebraska City, comprising 3,500 acres. Preserve No. 3, near Bostwick, Nuckolls County, compris - ing 2,309 acres. Preserve \'o. 4, Lincoln County, comprising 15,000 acres. Preserve No. 5, Saunders County, comprising 1,040 acres. Recreation Grounds The 1923 session of the State Legislature appropriated from the license funds the sum of $50,000.00 to be used for the pur - chase of hunting and fishing lakes and grounds. </seg>
            <seg id="p061">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1925-1926 The Bureau has made a careful study of the matter and during the biennium has purchased four holdings which are being developed into recreation grounds. These holdings were purchased at various points throughout the state so as to be available to all citizens. Only lakes and grounds well suited to hunting and fishing were considered. The lakes and grounds purchased are as follows: Goose Lake, Holt County, comprising some 350 acres, most of which is water. The tract has been fenced, wells put down and camping facilities constucted. Walgreen Lake, Sheridan County, comprising some 1 30 acres, most of which is water. A ditch leading from Hay Springs Creek into the lake and a road has been constructed. Rat and Beaver Lakes, Cherry County, comprising 244.42 acres, of which most is water. This tract has not been developed, owing to the desire of the Bureau to make additional pur - chases here when more of the lakes become available for purchase. Fremont Sand Pits, Dodge County, comprising some 165 acres, most of which are sand pit lakes. This was but recently - purchased and no developing has as yet been done. . Valentine Hatchery During the last two years a great deal of improvement has been made at. this hatchery. A number of new ponds have been constructed and enlarged until the hatchery is today one of the largest pond hatcheries in the country. Still further im - provements, which include piping of colder water to the hatch - ing house, are now under construction. Fish now propagated at Valentine include rainbow trout, brook trout, black bass, perch, crappies, sunfish and bullfrogs. Considerable success has been had in propagating the blue-gill and pumpkinseed sunfish, both of which are proving popular with anglers. </seg>
            <seg id="p062">DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTURE Over a million and a half fish have been propagated at this hatchery during the past two years. Practically" all of the pond fish from this hatchery (all fish except trout) were fingerlings at the time they were distributed/ Besides these there were some fifty thousand held over for distribution during the spring of 1927. The hatchery production in 1925-26 is still far from its possible output, since many of the ponds were not developed in time to use them in 1925 and many of them were new and not fully vegetated for the 1926 spawning season. The Valentine hatchery produced during 1926 over 60,000 trout eggs. These were taken from stock placed on the Federal Game Reserve nearby.

This Department is charged with the enforcement of approxi - mately twenty-five different laws covering the fields of sanitation and the quality of food for both man and animals. The food and drug laws of the State of Nebraska are so enacted as to </seg>
            <seg id="p065">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1925-1926 •coordinate with' the Federal food and drug laws. In many instances they are more complete and more fully protect the consumer, as for example, in the slack-filled package law. This law states that the package must be filled with the food it pur - ports to contain. From this it is readily observed that the net contents marked on the package is not sufficient if the package is not completely filled. Some protest has been filed by firms wanting to place on the market, uniform packages of different foods and to retail for the same price. One package would necessarily be packed full, while a more expensive food would have, but a small amount in the bottom of the package. Our law takes the position that this is a deception, as so few pur - chasers are able to associate in their minds the relative com - parison of .weight and volume. They are guided almost entirely by what they see. Briefly, the function of the Bureau may be said to furnish protection to consumers of food and drugs against insanitary methods and conditions in the collection, preparation, manufacture and handling of the products, and also prevent misrepresentation, misbranding and adulteration. In view of the fact that the cost of loss and misrepresentation is ultimately passed on to the consumer, the law insists that all business be conducted by fair and honest methods. This policy is of great benefit to the honest merchants as it protects them from the unscrupulous and- deceitful methods of those who would defeat the purposes of the law. Honest merchants welcome the regulatory and legislative enactments. I ' In addition to law enforcement, the Bureau is a co-operative department; co-operative in that whiie we enforce the law, we endeavor to impress upon the producer and dealer the im - portance of higher quality, thereby not only insuring the con - sumer a' better and more valuable food, but affording better financial return to the producer. By persistent efforts, we can raise the price of certain farm, products by insisting on higher qualities. Prior to the j passage of the laws enforced by our Department, the producer only received the average or com - posite price for his products. An inferior grade mixed with the highest grade products, not only lowers the price, but it has a tendency to discourage the producer of high quality unless there </seg>
            <seg id="p066">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE is an advantage in the price received. When price is governed by quality, the tendency would be to improve the qaulity and with this tendency will naturally result better foods and better prices to the producer. Eggs, for illustration, will command a higher price if the consumer knows that every egg purchased is edible with the result that the price of insurance formerly paid for uncertainty, accrues to the producer. If we can further improve the quality of this one product so as to raise the price 2c per dozen, it would bring to the producers of this state an additional one and one-third million dollars. INSPECTION In carrying out the intentions ol the law, it is necessary that the Department employ inspectors whose duty it is to visit every business place in the state where food, drugs and oils enter into the business, and investigate the condition as to quality, sanita - tion, labeling, etc., and collect samples for analysis to verify the representation as to quality, quantity and purity. Each inspector is held responsible for the condition of his district and must necessarily make daily reports as well as a monthly summary of his activities. These inspection reports have been greatly improved over those used in former years. Instead of reporting the sanitary conditions in general terms as "good", "fair", or "poor", our re - ports go into detail, setting forth the particular condition of every part of the establishment and pointing out in specific de - tail such corrections as are needed. When these reports reach the office, a sanitary order is mailed to the owner of the estab - lishment and a copy sent to the inspector who has been in - structed to make a reinspection and observe if the orders have been complied with. Instead of dividing the state into districts for each class of inspection such as dairy, hotel, oil, groceries, etc., one inspector is responsible for all inspections in his district. This district system was innaugurated on account of the very nature of in - spection work. It is difficult to designate where one class of </seg>
            <seg id="p067">BIENNIAli REPORT — 1925-1926 inspection begins and the other leaves off, and by the above arrangement, duplication ) of inspection is eliminated. The itinerary of each inspector is reported to the office for every day. By this method the office is in contact with each inspector's work. In the regular course of inspection, the inspectors are required to collect samples of food, drugs and oil, and submit them to the laboratory for examination and analysis. The samples must be sealed officially and a report made, giving de - tailed information as to the representations made by the sales - men, and on the labels, where and from whom purchased, name of wholesaler or distributor, the quantity on hand, reason for collection and such other information, as will be of value to the office in determining the exact facts. If any irregularity is found, unless the violation is too flagrant, it has been the policy of this Department to issue a warning to the offenders, advising them wha,t steps must be taken to comply with the law. If our orders are not obeyed, we are compelled to prosecute in acordance with the statutes. Enforcement of the Pure Food and Sanitary laws has to do with the examination of all foodstuffs as to their quality and purity and the representations that are made concerning them. Foods are examined and analyzed for adulteration and for poisonous and deleterious conditions. If in package form, a clear correct statement must be made in a conspicuous place of the exact contents, and the package must be free from slack - filled space. In addition to the above, where a standard has been established for a food by legal authority such foods as are offered for sale must meet the requirements. AH foods must be handled in strict observance to the sanitary law. One of the duties of the Department is to enforce this act and also to see that food factories and establishments are pro - vided with the proper amount of ventilation, doors and windows screened, toilet rooms and lavatories provided, and properly equipped. No person is allowed to live or sleep in a place where . food is prepared, served or sold, nor isja person afflicted with any communicable disease allowed to work where foods ate handled. 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p068">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE All drug stores are inspected as to sanitation and prepara - tions are collected and analyzed. They must meet legal re - quirements, must be properly labeled and be free from adultera - tion. In drug stores, as well as in all places where help is employed or the public accommodated or served, the proper health and sanitary requirements must be observed. The Cider and Vinegar law is what the name implies, and relates to the standardization and regulation of these products as placed on the market. Numerous samples have been collected and the few violations that have been found were readily corrected. The Oleomargarine and Butterine law has given the De - partment something more to think about; not only from the fact that it is a competitor to our dairy products which we are endeavoring to improve, but now comes what might be called an imitation of the imitation. This preparation is marketed under various names and there should be legislative enactment to control its sale. The Cold Storage law regulates the registration and in - spection of cold storage warehouses and defines cold storage products as well as providing for the proper recording of such foods. Quarterly reports must be made to the Department of all foods in cold storage and the length of time they have been so kept. The law should be amended requiring the container of cold storage foods to be so marked. Some objection to this is voiced on account of the prejudice people hold against cold storage food, but by proper information reaching consumers this should be largely overcome because a good cold storage food is better than much of the food that is readily sold on the market as its preference. However, all purchasers are supposed to have due notice when cold storage foods are sold. The Paint and Linseed Oil law specifies the requirements for paint and linseed oil and requires that they be so labeled that the purchaser may know the quality of the merchandise. </seg>
            <seg id="p069">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1925-1926 The Commercial Feeding Stuffs law defines commercial feeding stuffs and specifies what information must be given on the label. Each feed must be registered with the Department and at least a pound sample of such food for analysis must ac - company the application. All feed that is sold must have attached thereto an inspection tax tag, and as often as deemed advisable by the Department, samples are collected from feeds for sale for analysis and verification with the registration. The Livestock Remedy law defines a livestock remedy. It sets forth what shall be stated on the label, provides for the registration of such remedies, and imposes a penalty for any violation of the act. The Commercial Fertilizer law, while of minor importance at this time, is destined to become more important as the nec - essity for greater production grows on account of the increase in price of farm lands and the increased density of population. The law requires proper labels setting forth certain facts and also, the preparation must be [registered with the Department who in turn must make the necessary inspection and analysis. The Commission Merchant law requires that all commission men procure the proper permit and such merchant shall give a bond for the faithful performance of his duty. The Hotel Law includes hotels, rooming houses, apartment houses, and restaurants, and defines each. The law provides for the registration of each of such places and prescribes certain equipment and conveniences. The law requires inspections to be made by the Department, reports to b : made of their findings with recommendations if. needed for improvement. The Filled-Evaporated and Condensed Milk law is prac - tically identical with the Federal law which regulates interstate shipments. On account of the absence of such factories in this state, the law receives less attention than most laws. The Turpentine law defines the standards for turpentine, sets forth the label requirements for turpentines as well as for </seg>
            <seg id="p070">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE substitutes and imitations and prohibits adulteration or mis - branding. The Serum and Virus law controls the manufacture and sale of such products for animals and provides for the bonding of dealers in these products, also for the proper labeling. The Soft Drink law was enacted principally upon request cf the manufacturers of carbonated beverages. It provides for the registration of such manufacturers, sanitary inspection of their manufacturing establishments and the quality and purity of the finished products. It is in reality an auxiliary to the pure food law. In the law entitled Legal Standard for different grades of cheese, it is what its name implies. It sets forth the standards lor different makes of cheese. ' The Egg Candling law is one of the recently enacted laws and is of great importance. It is probably ready for an amend - ment in order to make it more beneficial to the people. Gen - erally on account of skepticism toward a new departure, full benefits to an industry cannot be attained through a legislative body with the first law enactment. But after experience and the observation of the beneficial results, a better law can be ob - tained. The extreme difficulty encountered in enforcing this law is quite apparent to this Department, but notwithstanding HI difficulties, the Department has done much to insure the con - sumer a wholesome food and give the producer a larger financial return for his efforts. The Gasoline and Kerosene Inspection law provides for the inspection, sampling and analyzing of samples of certain petrol - eum products by this Department. It sets forth the legal standard for these products that may be sold in this state, and thereby protects purchasers against inferior products. This De - partment inspects and tests the various products as they are re - ceived by the dealer, and later collects samples of the products as sold to the purchaser as a safeguard against adulteration. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">..-■■. i - - ; -- BIENNIAL REPORT — 1925-1926 The Dairy law is intended to regulate all dairy products. It provides for the issuance of permits to' people who would engage in the business of buying and selling milk and cream on a butter fat basis; also, for the sanitary condition of their place of business. The law sets forth certain requirements for dairy products and provides for the proper inspection and investiga - tion to see that these requirements are met! From the foregoing brief synopsis of several of the laws whose enforcement is in charge of this j Department, the im - mensity of our duties and responsibilities are readily discernable. Our inspectors must be strong, enduring, hard working, and reliable men who must put in long hours and cover many miles of territory. . </seg>

Purpose of Law. All sums of money received under this Act shall be placed in a fund to be known as the gasoline high - way fund, to be used for building and maintaining state high - ways and meeting federal aid. Out of such fund there shall also be appropriated such sums as shall be necessary to administer and carry out the provisions of this Act. Operation of Law. The law provides that dealers and users of motor fuel shall be licensed and render monthly reports to the Department on all motor fuel sold and used during the preceding calendar month. During the biennium the depart - ment issued 71 I licenses, 150 of which were discontinued, leav - ing 561 in force December I, 1926.

            <seg id="p078">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURAL SEEDS Elva L. Norris, Seed Analyst Introduction The proper labeling or tagging of farm seeds is the duty of all who have agricultural seed for sale for seeding purposes. In order to provide this information a Seed Laboratory has been established and equipped with the necessary apparatus to prop - erly do the work. The tests are carried on according to the Rules and Regulations of Official Seed Analysts of North America. The Nebraska State Seed Laboratory holds mem - bership in this association, the object of which is to improve the methods and to secure more uniform results in seed laboratories. Seed Law Primarily a Labeling Law Every lot of seed upon the market in this State must be fully labeled, and certainly no farmer would accept agricultural seed until he had made a thorough study of the statements on the label or tag. If the statements are not given he should insist upon having such information and promptly report any such case to the Sec - retary of the Department of Agriculture. However, the law does not forbid any person from buying any kind of seed he chooses. If he wants to buy the cheapest and foulest seed upon the mar - ket or the dead and worthless seed, he can do so, nor does it protect him from his folly if he buys seed carelessly and without taking advantage of the protection which the law does afford. The matter of highest importance for the farmer's con - sideration is the grade of the seed which he contemplates buy - ing and he has every advantage given him to know what grade, he is purchasing. If a tag states that seed is 99 per cent pure, and if for any reason there is a doubt about it, he may send a sample to the Department and receieve a report which will prove the truth or falsity of such statement. However, when he buys seed which is labeled with a low percentage of purity, he may </seg>
            <seg id="p079">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1925-1926 be certain that he is buying dirt and inert matter at seed' prices, or an array of weed seeds which he could not afford to place on his land at any price due to the worK of eradication nec - essary in years to come. "Is cheap seed cheap?" has often been asked. N01 It is usually the most costly and its real cost cannot be figured, due to the expense of preparation of the soil, the loss in the crop, the extra labor to eradicate weeds, which in the case of noxious weeds may take several years, be - side the actual cost of the seed. There are few or no bargains on the seed market, seedsmen buying and selling among them - selves have for years been buying on the basis of grade or actual value in germination and purity. Competition has been so keen that the seed trade could have no other sound basis. Another reason why the farmer who wishes to be a seed grower must purchase good, clean seed is that he may raise such seed to sell, for he cannot expect the dealers to pay him as well for foul, trashy, dirty stuff, which would take time and money to clean, and could never be satisfactorily freed from weed seed and made ready for market, as for bright clean seed. The farmer should become aware of the fact that weed seed and inert matter purchased at the price of seed is highly expen - sive, and furthermore that buying "cheap seed" absolutely pre - vents his having any control of the weeds upon the soil. Also that it will pay every Nebraska farmer to purchase his seed from dealers in Nebraska, that is, the local dealer, retailer, or wholesaler, since they must sell their agricultural seeds under a label as required by the State Law. On the other hand, if a farmer sends outside the State for his seed, he buys it at his own risk, because the ou3tide dealer sends seed into the State under the freedom of interstate commerce and is immune to local prosecution. It is true, however, that } although State Laws do not regulate interstate commerce, the shipping and seizure sec - tions of our Seed Law make it necessary for the Department in its discretion to seize and hold all seed until it is labelled and in every way is made to comply with the law. Seed Control During the biennium beginning December I, 1924 and ending December I , .1927. the department inspectors collected </seg>
            <seg id="p080">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE samples from five hundred and sixty-eight (568) lots of field seeds. Of these five hundred and sixty-eight lots, forty-three (43) were condemned because of noxious weed seeds and ordered off the market. A number of samples were found not to be properly labeled. These were ordered to be properly labeled or withdrawn from sale. These samples which rep - resent all parts of the State were tested for germination and analyzed for purity. The analyses and tests disclosed a large percentage of violations. Some of these violations were due to ignorance of the law, but many were^due to carelessness and disregard of the law. The dealers in general have shown a very fine spirit of co-operation and in the majority of cases, appreciate the helpful assistance given by the department. Inspection, has revealed the fact that many dealers are giving little, if any con - sideration to tagging. In many cases the original tags are lost or destroyed.

            <seg id="p089">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1925-1926 DIVISION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES Purpose of the Law The Weights and Measures Law was enacted in order that all weighing and measuring devices in the state might.be in - spected and kept in proper weighing condition. The Depart - ment of Agriculture was vested with authority to promulgate rules and regulations necessary for enforcement of the provisions of the Act ; also to establish tolerances and specifications for weighing and measuring apparatus, and regulations regarding the kinds and varieties of devices or attachments on weights and measures and weighing and measuring appliances. Additional authority was given to establish any necessary standards which are not definitely defined by law. Duties of Inspectors The State is divided into five districts, each district being under the supervision of r an inspector. The inspectors are equipped with state standardized weights and measures. The weighing and measuring devices are tested as near as possible to capacity, and if found correct they are sealed and if in - correct and it is impossible to adjust them, they are "Condemned for Repairs". Field Work The inspection work during the past two years shows that there is a great increase in the number of heavy duty truck scales. The smaller scales, such as the so-called spring scales are not recommended for use, as they are very likely to be incorrect. They are usually marked "Not to be Used Commercially", or "For Family Use Only". In most cases the more expensive scale proves to be the cheaper one. Platform scales require much care, since they are so fre - quently used. A cream buyer, who uses an incorrect scale many times each day will either be cheating himself or his customers. * </seg>
            <seg id="p090">DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTURE Counter scales require much attention and good clean oil should be used in the dash pot. They should be kept free from dirt. The automatic scale which is used in grain dealers ware - houses have what is known as a dribble device. This should re - ceive careful attention, as the correctness of the load depends upon it. Hopper scales are commonly used for weighing grain. They range in capacity from a lew hundred pounds to a carload. These scales should be carefully installed. They should rest on their own foundation, rather than placed upon sills which are attached to a building. Condemned Devices All devices not sealed or adjusted are condemned for re - pairs. These condemned devices are either repaired and re - leased, or permanently tied up ot destroyed. Inspections The cities of Omaha and Lincoln are required to make a re - port of all inspections to this Department. The following tables give the number and kind of inspections made in these two cities during the past two years: OMAHA Dec. 1, 1924 Dec. 1, 1925 Total to to for Dec. 1,1925 Dec. 1, 1926 Biennium Scales Sealed 2,535 2,739 5,274 Scales Condemned 516 445 961 Pumps Sealed 418 506 924 Pumps Condemned 4 7 11 Measures Sealed 206 223 429 Measures Condemned 3 13 16 Weights Sealed 1,029 1,245 2,274 Weights Condemned 49 71 120 Total Inspections 4,760 5,249 10,009 Scales Released 516 445 961 Pumps Released 4 7 ' 11 </seg>

            <seg id="p098">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE of Agriculture in 1 9 1 8. In the reorganization of the state de - partments under the so-called administrative code law, the work in agricultural statistics was placed under the Bureau of Markets and Marketing of the new Nebraska Department of Agriculture. While the cooperative work was continued, much of it was more or less informal and during the biennium, 1923 and 1924 most of the cooperative work was discontinued. However, the annual reports of acreage through the assessors were gathered but not compiled until the present biennium when all of the back work was brought up-to-date, and all available historical records of Nebraska agriculture of which few remained and in some cases not even state office files, were gathered from other places and published in a report of agricultural statistics for 1923-24. Accordingly, an unbroken record of Nebraska's great industry was preserved and the reports made available to all requesting the same. Basic Sources of Information What sources of information does the State and Federal Division of Agricultural Statistics have at its command? Nearly every source of information is utilized and they are in part as follows: 1. Voluntary crop reporters. 2. Assessors annual farm census. 3. Annual livestock assessment. 4. Special acreage and livestock surveys. 5. Actual measurement of crop acreage by a crop meter. 6. Rural carrier acreage survey. 7. June rural carrier pig survey. 8. December rural carrier pig survey. 9. Stockyard receipts of livestock. 1 0. Railroad station records of forwardings and receipts of livestock. </seg>

Reports of production of dairy products from all creameries. ' With such a vast source of information at its command, the State and Federal Division of Statistics is capable of issuing esti - mates that are very reliable. Through these various sources and by the use of certain statistical computations, the facts on production can be determined. Number of Crop Reporters There are approximately 8,425 crop reporters on the various lists, classified as shown in the following. In addition to these there are several lists who report on minor crops. The Division also has the names and addresses of all farmers in the state, from the annual farm census reports. To maintain the num - erous inquiries, correspondence and mailing of our reports re - quires 200,000 envelopes each year. The various lists aTe classified as follows: 1. 800 Field Aids. 2. 900 Township reporters. 3. 3,500 Individual farm reporters. 4. 1,500 Mills and elevators. 5. 600 Cattle Feeders. 6. 200 Sheep Feeders. 7. 200 Range livestock reporters. 8. 300 Honeybee reporters. . 9. 125 Creameries and cheese factories. 10. 125 Bankers mid-month report list. 11. 175 Special Bankers list. </seg>

Object and Value of Crop Reports The object and main purpose of the work is to supply at all times the latest and most dependable information on crop and livestock production so as to give the farmer not only the best available information for the regulation of production 'but also the best information available that will help him to market his production to the greatest advantage. What does the Division of Agricultural Statistics do that will help farmers to adjust production to demand? At present there are three leading projects as follows: 1. January Agricultural Outlook Report. 2. Planting Intentions Report. 3. Pig Surveys. </seg>
            <seg id="p101">. BIENNIAL REPORT — 1925-1926 Outlook Report Gives Agriculture's Past, Present and Future The first one', the January Agricultural Outlook Report is. issued at Washington and published and distributed by the State and Federal Division of Agricultural Statistics and the State Extension Service. It is not only a review of the past, and pres - ent situation of agriculture in relation to other industries, but also a detailed review of every crop and kind of livestock with the prospects for the coming year. If a shortage or surplus of any farm commodity appears to be developing, this is pointed out so that farmers may make the desired adjustments. Not only is the domestic situation considered, but the world wide conditions as well so that the farmer is given an insight to the future -conditions that is not exceeded by that furnished to any other industry. Planting Intentions Report Is First Step in Adjusting Production The planting intentions survey is usually made in February or early in March. It furnishes the information as to the acreage farmers intend to plant not- only in this state but for all states and for the country as a whole in sufficient time for them to ■ adjust their acreage, if it appears that the intended acreage is greater or less than that necessary to meet the demand. A similar survey on winter wheat and rye planting intentions is made in August. While the production of any certain crop can - not be regulated by acreage alone due to the fluctuation in yield, it is nevertheless not only the first, but one of the important steps in regulating production, and is worthy of far greater con - sideration than has been given in the past. Pig Survey Reports Is First Step in Adjusting Pork Production The pig surveys are made in June and December. The June survey not only gives the size of the spring pig crop just produced but gives the farmers plans for breeding for the fall pig crop. In like manner, the December survey gives the size of the fall pig crop and the plans for breeding for the following spring pig crop. This information is furnished in sufficient time for farmers to adjust their plans in case the results indicate either too large 4 </seg>
            <seg id="p102">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE or too small production. Past records of hog production show an almost invariable record of ups and downs with accompaning low and high prices, with the result that the majority of the farmers have reduced numbers for sale when hogs are high and increased numbers to sell when hogs are low in value. A few farmers who have studied the hog production and price cycles have gone against the "tide" and now have large numbers to sell when prices are high and a smaller supply when prices are low. As soon as the majority of the farmers recognize the value of the pig survey work and are willing to cooperate and adjust their pig production accordingly, the hog production price cycles of the past will disappear to a marked extent and prices will be stabilized and the maximum income will be derived from this important source of farm income. Crop Reports Help to Get Maximum Farm Prices How do agricultural statistics help farmers to market their products to the best advantage? After the various crops are planted, the Division gathers information on the acreage and condition of each crop from month to month until harvest when estimates of yield are published. As a rule a large national or world crop means lowered price and a small crop a higher price. This information is gathered and made available to all at the same time so that the farmer has the same advantage as the dealer to determine the probable future trend in prices which is a great help in deciding when to sell or buy. Private concerns gather information on crop production so as to get the best possible insight to future price trends. With dependable in - formation as to future production on hand, they not only avoid losses which would otherwise have to be recovered, if they mis - judge future price trends, but they can buy on a smaller margin of profit when the facts on production are known because their handling risks are lowered and this means a higher price to the producer than could otherwise be obtained. Use of Crop Reports The use of Agricultural statistics is increasing rapidly. Near - ly all business is inter-dependent. That is, the prosperity and </seg>
            <seg id="p103">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1925-1926 development of one business depends greatly on the prosperity and development of all other business. Crop reports furnish/ an indispensible link between agriculture and other links of business. Agriculture prospers directly and indirectly through the information oh price trends that crop reports indicate and other business prospers directly and indirectly through the more economical manufacture and transportation of products which in turn increases the buying power of consumers for farm prod - ucts as well as' manufactured products: The following shows a few ways in which different agencies use agricultural statistics: TO FARMERS: Directly: ■' • . 1. Guide to changing acreage of particular crops. 2. Guide to marketing, best indication of future price. Indirectly.: • 1. Prevents ill effects of misleading crop 'reports. 2. Reduces speculation. Dependable information on supply stabilizes prices and reduces the speculation margin that is necessarily taken when uncertainty of supply exists. 3. Aids railroads to distribute the cars needed for farm products. 4. Enables economical distribution of farm equipment and - supplies. 5. Esential for crop programs of agricultural colleges, intelligent marketing programs of public marketing agencies, making farm loans by banks and insurance companies and the main - tenance of maximum farm prices in terminal markets in ac - cordance with supply and demand, all of which react to the farmer's advantage. COOPERATIVE FARMER'S ASSOCIATION: 1. Guide to intelligent marketing which results in maximum prices. DEALERS AND HANDLERS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS: . 1. Reflects price trends, reduces speculation which goes with un - certainty of supply and reduces the necessary handling margin and enables the payment of maximum farm prices. AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE WORKERS: 1. Best basis for crop production programs. STATK MARKETING BUREAUS: 1. First essential for all marketing programs. </seg>

            <seg id="p105">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1925-1926 Every Effort Made to Secure Accuracy Few, except those connected with the office, realize the large quantity of work required to gather, compile and publish the vast quantity of information on agriculture. Upon each of the leading crops, the Division has as many as 35 separate estimates of acreage and 22 separate estimates of yield to say nothing of the various condition reports that are made between plant - ing time and harvest time. Each estimate requires sending out a large number of inquiries, editing, tabulation and compilation. The largest single task is the state farm census from which information is collected upon 50 or more items from each of the 127,000 farmers in the state. While assessors do not begin to collect agricultural statistics until April 1 and a considerable portion of them are not returned until some time in June, all crop acreages are compiled in county form before July 1. Furthermore, a check up survey is made to determine if their has been any change in the actual planted acreage, reported by assessors. Another individual farm acreage survey is also made in June as another check. The greater part of the field measure - ments of crop acreage are made in June which is another very accurate check. The spring pig survey is also completed. Fifteen thousand cards are sent out to get a fair sample of hog business and every card is scrutinized for errors before being tabulated. In addition to the foregoing tasks, considerable other work has to be done such as the June 1 crop report, the June range report, June -mid-month report, correspondence, office calls, preparation of articles for the press, certain special tasks called for by either the state of federal departments and other minor tasks. While June is one of the heaviest months, all are busy months and there are other times when the work is nearly as heavy. The field for useful work in agricultural statistics is nearly unlimited and the cost of this service to the state is about 5 Yi cents per farm. Office Personnel The personnel of the office consists of the statistician in charge, assistant statistician, two state clerks and two federal clerks as follows: </seg>

            <seg id="p114">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN MEMORIAM During the Biennium the Department has lost one of its most trusted employees by death NIELS P. HANSEN Niels P. Hansen was born June 3, 1 864 in Slagislse, Den - mark. He attended an industrial school and graduated at the age of eighteen. In May 1 882 he came to America and settled tit Nysted, Nebraska. He resided here five years and in 1887 Ke entered the College of Pharmacy at the University of Illinois. From 1 895 to 1907 he was in business in Kearney. In 1909 lie became a member of the faculty of the School of Pharmacy at the Uni - versity of Nebraska, where he remained until 1920. Much of his time was spent during those years towards creating a College of Pharmacy at the University. Mr. Hansen always took much interest in politics. Under Governor Aldrich he was food commissioner. For six years he was a member of the Lincoln school board. When Samuel McKelvie was elected Governor in 191 8, he served as secretary of the State Central Committee and in 1925 was appointed Acting Chief of the Bureau of Foods, Drugs and Oil, under Governor McMullen. He passed ftom this life, October 15th, 1927, and we pause here a moment to pay our respects to a man who was so faith - ful and loyal to his duties, so kind and generous to his friends, and so lovable to and thoughtful of his family. He was al - ways cheerful and considerate and ever left his listeners in a happy mood. He was one of those men of whom it may be truthfully said: "The world is better for his having lived." </seg>
            <seg id="p115">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1327-1928 THE NEBRASKA AGRICULTURAL SITUATION, 1927-1928 The year 1927 was one of unusually large crops and a marked contrast to 1926 which was a year of unusually low production. The quantity of crops sold as well as the num - ber of livestock sold for the year ending June 30, 1927, slumped considerably below that of the previous year. This was most marked in the case of crops due to the very short production of 1926. The prices of livestock did hot average quite as high as for the year ending June 30, 1926. As a result, the total gross farm income dropped to $396,580,000 for the year end - ing June 30, 1927 as compared to $432,378,000 for the pre - vious year, a decrease of 8.3 r /i . Crops were hot so good in 1928 as in 1927. Small grain crops did exceptionally well, however, but corn and hay dropped considerably below the average. ■ The quantity of crops mar - keted, according to tentative figures, show a marked increase for the year ending June 30, 1 928. This was expected due to the heavy production in 1927. The sale of crops amounted to $158,034,000 which is the highest by far' since the year ending June 30, 1921. The sales of livestock brought $299,986,000 which has been exceeded slightly during' the past thtee years. This brings the total gross income for the year ending June 30, - 1928 to $458,020,000 which is the highest by a large margin since the price slump in 1920. The following table shows the prices and index numbers 6i leading Nebraska farm commodities for a three year period just before the war, the year prior to the slump in prices and for the years from that time until the present.

The index numbers shows the comparison between the. price for the year given and the average price for the three year period before the years, 1912 to 1914. inclusive. For example, the price of com for the year ending June 30, 1928 was 38% higher; ■wheat, 43'/' higher; oats, 18% higher; hay 22% lower; beef cattle, 63',&lt; higher; hogs, 18% higher. The index figures labeled, "Farmers Retail Purchases" is a comparison of the re - tail prices that farmers pay for commodities bought as com - pared to the prices paid before the war. For example, the index number 156 in 1928 means that the commodities that the farmers bought in 1928 cost 56% more than the same com - modities cost before the war.

Note that the year ending June 30, 1922 shows the lowest purchasing power since the price slump in 1920. The purchasing power of coin was 4 1 , which means that corn would only buy 4 1 % as much in 1922 as it did before the war. In other words, it took nearly 2'/2 bu. of corn in 1922 to buy the same quantity of commodi - ties that could be purchased for 1 bushel before the war. </seg>
            <seg id="p117">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1927-1928 For the year ending June 30, 1928, the farm purchasing power varied from 50 for hay to 104 for beef cattle. This means that it took two tons of hay to buy the same commodities that one ton bought before the war, and that beef cattle, despite the generally satisfactory prices, will only buy slightly more than they did before the war. ■ ■ Nebraska's six leading commodities, corn, wheat, oats, hay, beef cattle and hogs shown in the foregoing table brought 8 I % of the total farm income for the year ending June 30, 1928. The purchasing power ranges from 50 for hay to 104 for beef cattle. The purchasing power of the six commodities, weighted, is 91, which means these farm products will purchase 9 1 % as much as they did before the war. A similar unweighted figure for all farm products for the United States for the year ending June 30, 1928, is 90. Apparently, the Nebraska farmer is now somewhat better off than the average farmer in the United States; Until reecntly, or about the time that cattle prices ad - vanced, this was not the case. The purchasing power of the farmer's dollar from the six leading commodities is shown above. ' Note that it was down to 65 for the year ending June 30, 1922 and advanced to 93 in 1926, after which it dropped to 9 1 in 1927 and remained there throughout 1928. However, this does not tell all of the story. With this lowered purchasing power, the farmer has to meet a higher overhead due to increased capital investment in lands, higher freight rates and higher taxes. However, all the farmer expects is that his products be placed on a parity in price with those of the manufacturer. In this connection it is interesting to compare the return from manufacturing in Ne - braska with that of agriculture. Ordinarily one does not think of Nebraska as a manufacturing state. Yet, in 1923, the gross income from manufacturing in Nebraska was $415,057,000 as compared to $333,632,000 from agriculture and in 1925 $443, - 309,000 as compared to $424,147,000 from agriculture. From 75 7" to 80 % of the manufactured products in Nebraska are derived from raw farm products. Nearly half of the value of the manufactured products are derived from meat animals. </seg>
            <seg id="p118">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agriculture has no quarrel with manufacturing even though the latter has been making a better showing. However, agri - culture does have a right to expect that her prices be placed upon a par with those of the manufacturer. This would enable the farmer to increase his purchases which in turn would help the manufacturer. More manufacturing in Nebraska would help agriculture as the prosperity of both industries is essential for the greatest development of the state. Utilization of water power to promote manufacturing would help both industries in Nebraska. It would make a home market for the raw farm products, reduce the farmers freight bill, and bring more con - sumers of farm products. The outstanding features of the biennium are the two suc - cessive record wheat crops and the record corn crop in 1927. The 1927 wheat crop of 73,826,000 bu. was the largest on record and the 1928 crop of 69,919,000 bu. is the third largest on record. The corn crop of 1927 was the second highest on record, but from the standpoint of both size and quality, it was by far the largest and most valuable corn crop on record. Barley and beans both made new high records in 1928. Sweet clover continued to increase and the total area reached 458,000 acres. In 1920, the state had 30,000 acres. While this crop is used mainly for pasture, it is used also for hay, seed, and as a practical soil building crop, it has no equal. Alfalfa seems to be taking a downward swing. A few dry years and plant dis - ease seem to be responsible for the losses in alfalfa as both have promoted winter-kill. Sugar beets made new high records dur - ing the biennium and the state is second only to Colorado in the production of sugar beets. Extension of pump irrigation in the Platte valley would place Nebraska first in sugar beets. NEBRASKA GROSS FARM INCOME FROM SALES OF CROPS, LIVESTOCK AXD ITS PRODUCTS (Given in thousands, i. e., (000) omitted) (Year ending June 30) I 1923 | 1924 | 1925 I 1926 | 1927 | 1928 Crops $ 93.997 $ 92,096 $120,239 $102,723 $ 81,733 $158,034 Livestock and its Products 239.635 256,270 303,908 329,655 314,847 299,986 Crops and Livestock $333,632 $348,-365 $424,147 $432,378 $396,580 $458,020 </seg>
            <seg id="p119">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1927-1928 As shown in the foregoing table, livestock and its products continue to be the leading source of income for the Nebraska farmer. These figures are taken from absolute records of ship - ments and market receipts and are not only comparable but dependable. The figures for 1928 are in preliminary form since not all of the vast number of records from which they are derived are in complete final form. However, they are conservative and the final figures are more likely to be higher than lower. The marked increase from the sale of crops in 1928 is due to the heavy production in 1927. These data are on a crop and livestock year basis beginning July 1 and ending June 30 of the year shown. In general, beef cattle production has declined since 1920, although increases in the number shipped into the state for feeding have increased the number on hand on January 1 of cer - tain years. Despite this fact, there seems to have been a rather marked tendency to lowered production since 1924, the num - ber dropping from 2,774,000 on that year to 2,262,000 in 1928. The severe shortage of pasture, hay and forage in 1926 forced the sale of breeding stock and is one factor in decreased production. Another thing is the fact that farmers had waited so long for improvement in cattle prices that some had already cut down on production before the prices began to advance. At the present time, there is a general tendency to expand, but in a conservative way. Past experience has taught the lesson that more profits will be derived by keeping the supply slightly under the demand than to exceed the demand for beef. In - ' creased slaughter of calves and finishing beef at younger ages than in the' past has proven to be a- profitable and practical way for the farmer to master the supply situation. Hog prices had reached their peak in 1926 and as a result of increased production had begun to decline early in 1927. Prices remained very unsatisfactory throughout 1928 except for the early fall months. Apparently the supply was some - what larger than anticipated and the infallible law of supply and demand simply forced prices downward. The past records of hog prices presents more concrete evidence that producers can- </seg>
            <seg id="p120">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE not beat the inevitable working of the law of supply and de - mand affecting price, unless it would be in the case of potatoes which perhaps more vivid evidence is presented. Market re - ceipts of hogs for the hog crops year ending October 31, is showing about a 1 0 ' i increase while the pig surveys indicated 5 or 6't increase. The discrepancy may be accounted for by either failure of farmers having the larger increases to report or to increased sale of breeding stock. Regardless of the real reason for the discrepancy, the facts are that prices ultimately respond to supply and demand. Farmers are taking lower prices for hogs than would have been the case had the facts on produc - tion and marketing been known. Had the supply been known, the price line would have been more gradual without the severe ups and downs. The pig surveys enable farmers to adjust their production so as to give a more even supply which results in a more stable price. While the great majority of the producers are willing to lay their cards on the table right side up and. co - operate in crop and livestock reports, there are still enough who refuse, thereby making it difficult to get positive facts. Until producers as a body realize that it is absolutely impossible to get better prices than warranted by supply and demand and that error on the part of grain buyers and packers in offering higher prices for a limited time than the demand warrants will later compel them to offer lower prices to make up the losses as was the case in hogs this fall, and the sooner they learn that when grain dealers and packers lack the facts on production that they take larger risks in purchase and attempt to cover these added risks by taking a larger margin which means reduced price to the producer, the sooner will the producer get the maximum price that the demand will pay. Those who doubt this may buy up a large supply of farm products without regard to supply and demand and nine times out of ten they will be convinced. Organization of producers in an endeavor to get maximum prices will help materially, but even then prices cannot exceed what the demand will pay. If they did, the inevitable result would be that all consumers would be compelled to move to the farm for living and we would soon find ourselves going back to colonial days when the farm was not only the source of food, but also </seg>
            <seg id="p121">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1927-1928 the factory as well. For the majority of consumers, it would mean this or starvation. Sheep decreased in 1927 due to the shortage of feed supplies but increased to new high records in 1928 when a record num - ber was placed on ' feed. Nebraska has a monopoly on the sheep feeding industry since it is the first cornbelt state that is located- on the way from the range to eastern markets that has such a large surplus of hay, forage and corn that cannot be marketed as profitably as cash crops due to the disadvantages of a longer freight haul than other cornbelt states. Horses show a further decrease in 1928. They have de - creased every year since 1919 from 1,049,000 head at that time to 782,000 head in 1928. So far the reduction has not been missed for prices have responded but very little to the re - duced numbers. The marked increase in mechanical power farming is apparently more than offsetting the decreased horse power. Mules have increased somewhat but the tendency seems to be downward at the present time. The remarkable increase in modern home conveniences and modern power machinery for the past decade is being main - tained. ■ The more recent addition to the home life that makes life worth while is the radio. Aside from the entertainment feature, the farmer gets crop reports and market reports that are of great value to him. The educational and news features are good. While the latest figures on radios are not available, it is consevative to say that at least 50% of the farmers have radio receiving sets. Another development of the past two years is the combine. The greater part of the wheat in the pan - handle of Nebraska is now being harvested with the combine. The recent windrow machine promises to do away with a lot of the objections to the combine. While the combine is moving eastward, they are still rather scarce in the eastern half of the state. They seem to be practical in southwestern Nebraska and are especially desirable in harvesting barley. In conclusion, it may be said that the progress of agriculture has exceeded expectations under the severe handicap that has </seg>
            <seg id="p122">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE been placed upon it since 1920. However, until prices of agri - cultural products are placed upon a parity vrith the prices of other industries, the fullest development cannot be expected. The progress made under the existing conditions is rather le - markable and much credit is due farmers for the untiring efforts and confidence shown in their great basic industry of the state. The interests and well being of the farmer are essential to the best interests of all industries in the state and every legitimate effort made to improve agriculture in Nebraska • will not only benefit all personally but will develop a greater Nebraska for this industry is basic to all industries in the state. </seg>

Accordingly, all products consumed on the farm are omitted from this calculation. On the fiscal year hasis crop sales are from the crop produced in the calendar year preceding the fiscal year date. Grain and crop values are based on actual railway shipments or percentage of crop shipped out of the county; the amount of grain sold direct to mills by the farmers is unknown and not included; the value of crops sold locally, for feeding purposes, is purposely omitted from these estimates because accounted for in livestock sales. Livestock values are based on actual mar - ket receipts and monthly prices. Dairy products values are derived from butterfat prices applied to figures of total manufacture as reported by dairy manufactories in the state, and take no account ot home consumption, either family used whole milk or skim milk used lor stock feeding, or whole milk sold in towns and cities. Poultry values are based on conservative estimates, and the mid-month prices to the farmer. tEstimates for the year ending June 30, 1928 are tentative.

            <seg id="p132">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE BUREAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY C. H. Hays, Chief General Statement The activities of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture in the exercise of its powers and duties for the protection of the health of livestock in the state was operative, during the biennial period, January I, 1927 to November 30, 1928, under the same general policies and arrangements as applied during the preceding biennium (1925-1926). However, the Nebraska Bureau of Animal Industry in addition to the certain project work, which had the cooperative assistance of the United States Bureau of Animal Industry, made certain special investigations of somewhat considerable proportion, as hereinafter reported. Closer relations in several particulars have been established with the livestock industry, and it is believed a greater confidence has thereby been placed in the department's efforts directed against animal disease by persons engaged in the production and in the traffic of livestock. While certain court actions have been entered into by the Department against livestock owners, to make possible the enforcement of its duties for the eradication of dangerous livestock diseases, in each instance action was by equity rather than by a criminal procedure. The powers vested in the Department to examine and test domestic animals to de - termine disease, to destroy diseased animals and to exercise quarantine powers for the suppression of disease were more definitely affirmed by the Supreme Court, as within a proper exercise of the police authority of the Department. Rules, Regulations and Instructions A revision of all Tules and regulations previously promulgated by the Department governing the handling of livestock, diseased or exposed, became necessary as a result of a recodification of the laws of the state relating to the protection of the health of livestock. The Legislature of 1927 by re-enactment, with cer - tain modification, changes arid additions, assembled under a single title all laws relating to animal health (Chapter 1 2, Ses- </seg>
            <seg id="p133">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1927-1928 sion Laws of Nebraska for 1927), and repealed all other acts of previous legislation relating to the same subject. In con - sequence the Department revoked previous orders, and pro - mulgated regulations prescribing measures essential for the pre - vention and eradication of diseases affecting livestock, or for otherwise protecting the health of livestock (Nebr. B. A. I. Order 9). Regulations were also prescribed governing the admission of livestock moved interstate into Nebraska (Nebr. B. A. I. Order 10). Said regulations were published in bulletin foTm by the Department, Nebr. B. A. 1. Order 9 as Bulletin No. 4 1 , which also contained a reprint of state laws relating to the protection of animal health, and Nebr. B. A. I. Order 1 0 as Bulletin No. 40. Instructions to authorized veterinarians were re-edited and revised, and published as Bulletin No. 43, super - seding a previous issue, of similar -instructions contained in Bulletin 123 and was thereby revoked. Forces Engaged The number of persons engaged under the direction of the Bureau of Animal Industry remained practically constant with that of the preceding biennium, there being certain periods, how - ever, when field forces were augmented considerably by tempor - ary employees. The personnel of full time veterinarians has changed from time to time as result of resignations, it having become very difficult to interest properly qualified persons with veterinary training to engage in state service at the salary rates paid to such workers, when other places open for such train - ing offer greater inducements. The forces assigned by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry have been in propor - tion to the preceding biennium, with the position of the federal bureau strengthened by reason of increased compensation rates to its personnel by congressional action. The Department through the cooperative relations estab - lished with the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of the Experiment Station of the State Agricultural College has continued to receive much . valuable support in advice and ma - terial assistance from that source. The Extension Department </seg>
            <seg id="p134">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE of the Agricultural College ha3 also given many aids, and other - wise assisted through its various divisions dealing directly with livestock interests. A more comprehensive relation has been effected with the large field of practicing veterinarians. And, through ihese various cooperations, and through direct relations with the livestock producing public, the work of the depart - ment, for protecting the health of domestic animals, has be - come more effectual. However, many things remain to be ob - tained for the greater service needed to meet problems pre - sented by animal diseases. The activities of the Department in the field have been con - tinued through the biennial period (192.7-28) with the several projects occupying the same relative position as obtained dur - ing the preceding biennium. The eradication of animal tuber - culosis continued of major importance as measured by the amount of time and money expended in fighting the disease among cattle.

The work ex - pended on these different projects, and other miscellaneous problems have been hereinafter reported under the several dif - ferent divisions thus permissible. ANIMAL TUBERCULOSIS ERADICATION General Statement The eradication of animal tuberculosis was continued through the biennium (1927-28) governed by the same fundamental rules and methods as applied during the preceding biennium, 1925-26. Certain modifications in plans became necessary to meet the requirements of laws enacted by the Legislature of 1927, or as otherwise would give greater efficiency to the work for the prevention and eradication of the disease. One arrange - ment, adopted through regulatory provision, may be pointed to with much satisfaction. Cattle being moved interstate into </seg>
            <seg id="p135">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1927-1928 Nebraska for dairy or breeding purposes have, for a number of years past, been required to be retested for tuberculosis, but with only limited success obtained in securing such retest. A plan was effected which, though not operative to the 100 per cent, has made possible retesting of such imported cattle, and yet has given certain commercial advantages to those engaged in such traffic not before lawfully obtainable. Methods and Plans Testing of cattle was pursued under the three plans — ac - credited herd, county area and private testing. The revision of the statutes by the Legislature of 1927 placed the establishing of county area testing in every particular on a constitutional basis. It became permissible to officially establish each county as a testing area, in which the area plan had been adopted, or in which a certain number of cattle had been tested by the De - partment and the United States .Bureau of Animal Industry co - operating, the same being necessary in order that testing or retesting as had been provided could be continued. Test - ing of cattle under the accredited herd plan was not increased but tended to decrease because of the extension of the county area work to include many herds which might otherwise have been continued or have been placed under state and federal supervision for establishing and maintaining as accredited tuber - culosis-free herds. Testing by practicing veterinarians as a private service has been 'less, also because of the extension of county area testing. Under the county area plan a large por - tion of the testing has been applied by practicing veterinarians temporarily engaged by the Department. County Testing Areas As recorded in the biennial report for 1925-26, on January 1, 1927 there were twenty-nine (29) Nebraska counties established testing areas, of which number twelve (12) had been certified modified accredited areas by state and federal official acts. The number of such county testing areas had been increased to include a total of thirty-nine (39) counties, on January 1, 1928, by the addition of the following named </seg>

Twenty - five (25) of which county testing areas had, on or prior to January I, 1928, been certified modified accredited areas. The group of testing areas was further increased to forty-three by December I, 1928, of which thirty-one (31) had been certified modified accredited areas. The number of established testing county units on that date represented 46'/, of the total num - ber of counties in the state.

However, the fact will be noted that the periods were different in extent by two months, the biennial report for 1925-26 carrying records of testing com-' pleted during December, 1924, and the report of 1927-28 carry - ing but 23 months. During said period of 23 months, 65,323 herd tests, of cattle, were applied comprising 763,856 in - dividual animal tests. These tests resulted in 7,582 of the cattle tested being classified reactors, and certified tuberculous. The number of cattle tested represented nine-tenths of one per cent (.9 % ) of the total cattle tested, and the number of herds in which reactors were determined (4,400 herds) represented 6.7% of the total herd tests applied. However, - as more fully explained and accounted (or in the report for the biennium 1925-26, these percentages do not represent correctly the- incidence of the disease among cattle in the areas tested, nor of herds infected, the morbidity rate. </seg>
            <seg id="p138">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Incidence and Herd Morbidity of Tuberculosis Among Cattle A table was presented, included as a part of the biennial re - port for 1925-26 (Table 11) showing results of the first general tuberculin test of cattle in a certain twenty-five (25) counties established testing areas. The data of said table has been further amplified in this report for 1927-28 (Table II) to in - clude the results of the initial tuberculin testing of cattle in a certain thirteen additional counties. In certain counties testing completed showed the incidence of tuberculosis to be sufficiently low to privilege certification of such counties as modified ac - redited areas, the incidence of tuberculosis among cattle being less than one-half of one per cent. Testing for re-accrediting in four of the accredited county areas, namely Thayer, Polk, Butler and Gage, was completed and resulted in three of said areas being again certified accredited areas. In Thayer County, the second county to have been so accredited in Nebraska, and among the first counties to have been established testing areas, the result of the second general test (the retest for reaccredita - tion) showed the incidence of tuberculosis to be 1.38 per cent. Another general test of all herds will be commenced at an early date.

A summary of reports, from the federal bureau Hied with the office of the Nebraska Bureau of Animal Industry, regarding the postmortem findings and disposition of the carcasses of re - actor cattle slaughtered under such inspection during 1927-28, shows that of 6,882 reactor cattle from Nebraska the carcasses of 6,322 head were passed for food, 95 were passed for food after the flesh of the same was sterilized under supervision, and 465 were condemned and destroyed as unfit for food purposes on account of generalized or extensive tuberculosis. The re - imbursement to owners as indemnity on reactor cattle, caused thus to be destroyed, paid from state and federal funds, be - tween January 1, 1927 and November 30, 1928 amounted to a total of $204,481.98.

The livestock interests in such accredited areas, in addi - tion to the eradication of tuberculosis from their cattle to a very low degree, and the privilege of movement of cattle interstate from their herds without further test, have received a premium on swine . marketed from such areas for slaughter purposes. The payment of such premium has in no way been of an official nature but has been paid only on swine certified as having been bred and fed in an accredited area. Payment has been at 1 0c per hundred pound weight, and by certain packers only. Reports submitted to, and on file in, the office of the Nebraska Bureau of Animal Industry, though incomplete, show that there has been paid to Nebraska swine owners, on such a premium basis, a sum of $341,922.62. The reports cover payments from. Omaha and Nebraska City, St. Joseph, Kansas City and Sioux City markets, partially complete to October, 1928. Avian Tuberculosis The Department became engaged during 1927 under a project to determine the extent and prevalence of tuberculosis among poultry in certain definite, but limited, areas of the state. Briefly stated, the plans for the project included the tuberculin testing of at least sixty per cent of all flocks of chickens in sel- </seg>

Assisted by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry, the plan was adopted in four precincts, namely in Silver Creek and Craig precincts in Burt County; in Cameron precinct of Hall County and in Lincoln precinct of Johnson County. In each of the areas named, more than seventy per cent of the flocks were tested, with the exception of Craig .precinct of Burt County, in which area the testing was confined to the northern one-half of the precinct, but in which portion more than seventy per cent of the flocks were tested. From the records on file in the office of the Bureau of Animal Industry, summaries were completed showing the results of testing of chickens applied in these several different areas and edited hereunder as Table V.

One or more reacting chickens were located in each of 216 different flocks, or in 74.3 per cent of the total flocks under test. Put in other words, three out of every four flocks tested were proved to be infected with tuberculosis. These results presented, give a very startling picture of conditions confionting those engaged in poultry production, at least of that part of Nebraska immediate to the areas under observation.

There is an urgent need for the adoption of such sanitary measures as may be demon* strated to be practical and effective for the suppression and eradication of the infection among poultry. Ln view of such conclusions, the department became engaged, to the extent possible with funds available, in an effort to di - rect the attention of the poultry industry to the problem without undue alarm and excitement. With a possible flock morbidity rate as high as that indicated, it did not appear particularly advantageous to institute a program at the time similar to that adopted for the eradication of tuberculosis among cattle, engaging the testing of poultry flocks as a primary measure of eradication. Rather, it has been considered more practical, yet an effective plan to have certain sanitary flock management measures adopted, based upon the yearly disposal of the flock, or even the same territory treated by cleaning and disinfection and replacement taken care of by day old chickens placed upon clean territory, or even the same territory if treated by cleaning and disinfection of houses and runs. In order to introduce this suggested plan to the poultry industry, and the reasons for such recommendations, a circular setting foTth the outline of such economic plan was published and in cooperation with the extension department of the State Agricultural College, the poultry producers' associations and others interested in this industry, approximately 35,000 copies of said circular were distributed. Further attention should be given to the problem, and because of the findings herein recorded, it can be said that, such attentions are urgent. Para-Tuberculosis In so far as can be determined from available information or records, para-tuberculosis (Johne's Disease) was first definite - ly diagnosed as a disease among livestock in Nebraska during 1927.

The case was immediately reported to the office of the Nebraska Bureau of Animal Industry, and a veterinarian was assigned to make an investigation, and to examine and subject to test the other cattle of the herd. The first examination and test of said herd was made during September, 1927, which was. the first time such test had been applied in Nebraska. Since the first case was reported and investigated in 1927, para-tuberculosis has been diagnosed, by aid of laboratory find - ings and .field tests applied by veterinarians assigned by the department, in four other herds; one of which was located in Burt County, one in Pawnee County, one in Dundy County and one in Pierce County. In two of five cases coming under ob - servation,' the attention of the department was directed to the case through the cooperation established between the Bureau of Animal Industry and the practicing veterinarians of Nebras - ka. Tests for para-tuberculosis were applied on all of the cattle of the herds in which the infection was suspected or known to exist, except of one herd remaining for test, the testing of which has the approval of the owner and will be applied in due course of time. . • : A total of 1 30 individual animal tests were applied, during the period from September 1927 to November 1928, inclusive, to determine para-tuberculosis, and as result of such tests, 35 cattle were classified to be reactors. Twenty-nine of these re - acting cattle were slaughtered under supervision of the meat in - spection service of the United States Bureau of Animal Industry and of a veterinarian assigned by the Department.

A total of forty-five cattle have therefore been slaughtered in order to suppress the infection in affected herds. How widespread and prevalent para-tuberculosis may be in Nebraska remains unknown except for the data recorded by the Bureau of Animal Industry in its work herein reported. Prompt attention has been, and should continue to be, directed to make investigation of any reported cases which may indicate the possible presence of the disease. Wherever the disease is determined, steps should be taken to promptly eradicate the infection which will necessitate slaughter of affected animals. It can therefore be recommended that the disease be put on the same legal basis as applies in the instance of bovine tuber - culosis. Scabies Eradication Departmental work for the eradication of scabies was con - tinued during the biennial period of 1927-28 by the Nebraska Bureau of Animal Industry, assisted cooperatively by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry. The organized, cooperative activities in such regard were applied under the same general policies and plans as governed similar work during the preceding biennium (1925-26). Eradication of scabies affecting cattle was of major importance, from the standpoint of expenditures incurred, over that given to combating the disease in other species of livestock — in sheep and in horse stock. Limited special attention was directed by the department against horse scabies occurring in eastern Thurslon County. The personnel of workers assigned for full time service on scabies eradication remained constant. Six veterinarians were so engaged, three state and three federal, except for a limited period during which one of the state field veterinarians was necessarily transferred to other work on account of lack of funds. The force engaged was augmented during spring and fall intensive dipping periods, by addition of trained employees furnished by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry. </seg>

            <seg id="p154">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Horse Scabies Eradication The activities of the Department for the eradication of scabies among horses has been limited during the biennial period of 192 7-26. The records of previous official work in Nebraska show that dming the period 1921-22, the Nebraska and United States Bureaus of Animal Industry were engaged, together with local interests, under a very definite project, having for an object the eradication of scabies, at the time rather prevalent, affecting horses on the Indian reservation areas of eastern Thurston County. The success of such work was very marked, resulting in the suppression of the disease to a degree that only a few sporadic cases have since developed. However, from time to time, reports, more rumor than report, have come to the attention of those engaged in animal disease work in Ne - braska, indicating the possibility of a limited infection with scabies of horse-stock in the area previously involved. The Department early in 1927 arranged, in cooperation with the United States Bureau of Animal Industry, to have a careful survey made in the area previously involved. A veter - inarian who had taken a very active part in the previous work was assigned by the federal bureau and made such survey. As a result of the inspections, the disease was found among horses on ten different premises, and the horse-stock on eight other premises was classified as exposed. A total of 2 I I horses were carefully inspected, while many others came under ob - servation Of the total horses classed as infected, 71 animals were caused to be properly treated to eradicate the disease. Investigation of Horse Losses in Sioux County, 1927-1928 The investigation commenced during the preceding biennium to determine the cause of losses of horse stock in northern Sioux County were continued through the biennium 1927-28 by the Department in cooperation with the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of the Experiment Station of the Ne - braska Agricultural College.

Feeding experiments were conducted during the summer and early fall periods of both 1927 and 1928 at the North Platte Experiment Station. In addition to plants collected for such experimental feeding at North Platte, a supply of plants was collected and forwarded to the poisonous plant investigation station of the/ United States Bureau of Animal Industry established at Salina, Utah. The final conclusions on the work completed have not been reported herein, because of certain incompleted laboratory studies. It can be stated, however, that the cause of losses of horses in the region under observation, and frequently reported-, undoubtedly resulted from the effect of feeding on a certain plant, the Senecio. In at least two different areas of western Nebraska, other than northern Sioux County, losses of horses has been occasioned apparently from the same cause. A more specific and detailed report regarding the project will be com - pleted and published in bulletin form (from the Experiment Station of the State Agriculture College). The problem may be further studied as to ways and means for prevention of losses, the same being possible with the cause determined.

The presence of the disease, ' among horses in the sev - eral different districts involved, was in each instance called to the attention of the department through cooperation established officially with practicing veterinarians. The records on file in the office of the Bureau of Animal Industry show that there were mallein tested (field test for glanders) and reported to the department during 1927, 197 different lots of horse stock comprising 3,200 animals, of ■which number nine animals were found to be affected with the disease. Such diseased animals were located one or more on each of five different premises. During 1928 to November 30, inclusive, similar testing reported shows that 114 different lots of horse stock, comprising 1,376 animals, were tested of which ten head were found to be dis - eased, involving four different premises. All horse stock affected with glanders were disposed of by - slaughter and the carcasses destroyed, under supervision of a veterinarian assigned by the Bureau of Animal Industry. In each instance of slaughter of a glandered animal, the diagnosis had been confirmed by laboratory tests applied by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry at Washington. Special investiga - tions by representatives of the department were made on 35 premises, with visits to a number of other premises in the . eradication of the infection of glanders. The positive diagnosis of the disease involved premises in four different counties, namely — Burt, Cedar, Dixon and Merrick, and twice at the Remount Depot at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The disease diagnosed at Fort Robinson and in Cedar County was directly traceable to the movement interstate into Nebraska of untested horse stock, in one instance of uninspected animals in violation of department regulations. </seg>
            <seg id="p157">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1927-1928 The destruction of glanders horse stock consisting of (6 horses and 3 mules, .or a total of 19 head caused to be slaughtered, caused the payment to owners as indemnity a total amount of $1,393.33. In addition to such reimburse - ment expense, the cost of special investigations and other nec - essary attentions by veterinarians assigned amounted to a con - siderable sum. These expenditures were fully justified, not alone because of the protection to health of domestic animals, but that -of man. The disease in horse stock is incurable, and an infected animal may become exceedingly dangerous. The co - operation of every owner of horse stock, as well as practicing veterinarians, should be given to protect against the hazards occasioned by glanders. Anthrax Anthrax as reported to the Department was diagnosed as affecting livestock located on 15 different premises during 1927 and on 12 during 1928 to November 30, inclusive. The dis - ease primarily occurred in each instance as a disease of cattle, but losses in both cattle and swine were occasioned by the dis - ease. During 1927 the fourteen premises involved were lo - ■ cated in four different counties, namely Boyd (9), Holt (1), Knox (4), and Thurston (1), and during- 1928 the twelve premises involved were located in six different counties namely, Boyd (6), Knox (2), Madison (1), Douglas (1), Dixon (1). The numbers in parenthesis indicate the number of premises involved in each of the respective counties. Special quarantines were placed through practicing veterinarian or direct by the Department to effect a proper control over the handling and disposition of animals during a certain period which was extended until it was considered safe to allow unrestricted move - ment of livestock from the premises involved. In order to pro - tect against an increased amount of anthrax, attention will need be' given to those areas and premises heretofore containing in - fected animals, particularly to cause destruction of any animals dead of the disease. It would be unwise to neglect in any . measure necessary policing attention to the outbreaks which may occur. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTURE Rabies Rabies among livestock in Nebraska has been repotted, or otherwise brought to the attention of the Department with in - creased frequency particularly during 1928. During the bi - ennium of 1925-26 the disease was reported as occuring in but two different sections of the state, while during 1928 the dis - ease was positively diagnosed as a disease affecting animals in twenty-two different counties. Reports from the office of the Department of Public Welfare of the State of Nebraska and of the Department of Animal Pathology and Hygiene of the Ex - periment Station of the Nebraska Agricultural College sum - marized for the period of the biennium 1927-28 show that rabies was definitely diagnosed by laboratory findings in cases occurr - ing in 25 different counties, namely: Buffalo, Cherry, Custer, Cuming, Douglas, Franklin, Gage, Hall, Hayes, Jefferson, Knox, Kearney, Keith, Lancaster, Lincoln, Mer - rick, Nuckolls, Otoe, Perkins, Platte, Richardson, Saline, Saunders, Thayer, Thomas. A further positive case of the disease appeared, confirmed by a report from the experiment station of the University of Wyoming, in a dog killed in the western part of Scotts Bluff County. There have been, in addition to the more positive cases, unconfirmed reports of the disease from other sources. The disease has in each instance appeared as a primary in - fection of dogs, and from such primary source the infection has been spread in a number of instances to livestock (horses, cattle and swine). Other pet animals have become infected, usually cats, but the list of known infected pet animals during the period under report included a coon, a fox and a monkey. Two fatalities were caused in the human, one at West Point and one at Omaha, and many persons immediately exposed to the in - fection were caused to take treatment to prevent the disease.

Such quarantines were usually effected through the attention of cooperating practicing veterinarians, and the period of quarantine was extended to cover such time as was deemed advisable. Contact for observa - tion was thus more specifically established that further possible developments might be given prompt attention. The depart - ment has in cooperation with the Department of Public Welfare established other contacts in the districts involved particularly with regard to having county and municipal ordinances adopted to control the dog situation. However, effectively the various cases of rabies occurring in Nebraska have been handled, there is an urgent need for the adoption of proper sanitary measures to control the ownerless and stray dog population. The effect should be general to the entire state by annual registration and prompt destruction of unregistered dogs. Further a control for effective quarantine regulations general to the disease should- be provided. Swine Diseases During th'e biennial period 1927-28, to November, 1928, the Department maintained, cooperatively assisted by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry, a service for extending aid in the diagnosis of swine diseases, and for giving special atten - tion to outbreaks of hog cholera. The methods pursued under this arrangement have been a continuation of the plan followed during the preceding biennium, the plan having been consider - ably extended through a practical utilization of the veterinarians engaged under the Department in the field primarily on other project work. A series of meetings was arranged and held during the early months of 1927, fifty-six meetings being planned, one in each of the different county seats of such number of different counties. The counties selected were those of greatest swine production. The purpose of such meetings was to lend a concerted encourage - ment to the producers of swine to have their herds immunized </seg>
            <seg id="p160">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE against cholera. The department has continued thus, and through every other available means, to encourage immunization against cholera and sanitation under a systematic plan as a part of every program for the production of swine. RENDERING ESTABLISHMENTS There were, on November 30, 1928, a total of ten different establishments in Nebraska holding permits from the Nebraska Department of Agriculture to operate plants for rendering the carcasses of domestic animals not intended for human consump - tion. These plants were located at or near the following named cities or towns — Omaha (4), La Platte (1), Fremont (1), Nor - folk (I), Lincoln (2), Grand Island (1), the number in paren - thesis indicating the number of plants at the certain locations. All except two of said establishments were operative prior to the commencement of the 1927-28 biennial period, and all ex - cept one were engaged in rendering operations, constantly or intermittently on, or immediately prior to, November 30, 1928. During the biennium, from time to time as was deemed necessary, inspections were made of said plants by a veterin - arian assigned by the Nebraska bureau, and through such con - tacts many improvements were effected as to equipment, methods of operation and other sanitary measures essential to a proper operation of such plants. Certain dangerous and illegal practices were thereby corrected, and under such supervising attention there was an apparent development which may bring these and similar plants into an even more useful service to the state in their respective communities as a means for a safe and proper economic disposal of dead animals and other animal waste. There has developed in many communities a dangerous, and fundamentally uneconomic practice of feeding carcasses of dead animals, as such, to swine. The practice as operative in the greater part is probably not unlawful, at least as pertains to the protection of the health of livestock, but the influence of such operations does in many cases, it is believed, lead to unlawful practices, such as the traffic of the carcasses of animals dead of </seg>
            <seg id="p161">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1927-1928 disease from place to place, and non burial or other illegal and unsafe disposal of such carcasses. It has been found prac - tically impossible to establish contacts or otherwise to apprehend such violations. A number of cases of losses among swine occasioned by such feeding practices have come to the atten - tion of the bureau. It should not be necessary for the depart - ment to establish a police' force or give more than limited attention to this phase of animal disease prevention, but there needs be a very definite contact to bring the operated render - ing plants into their greatest possible usefulness. PERTAINING TO TRAFFIC OF LIVESTOCK Imports The importation of cattle into Nebraska, moved interstate from other states or public stockyards, were handled under the same general provisions as have applied' during the preceding biennium. The testing of cattle required to be retested upon arrival into Nebraska has been more effectively handled than was heretofore obtained, and yet the restrictive effect upon those engaged has not operated so severely.

O'Connell, Chief Organization The Bureau of Game and Fish is made up of the following divisions: Division of Office and Permits. Division of Inspection and Control. Division of Conservation and Distribution. Division of Recreation Grounds. Valentine Hatchery. Gretna Hatchery. Dundy County Hatcheries. Office and Permit Division The Division of Office and Permits located at the State House is the central office under the supervision of a chief, where the different activities are directed, permits sold and fees collected. Permits are sold through county clerks, hardware dealers, etc., as heretofore. At the end of the present biennium there was approximately nine hundred and sixty accounts throughout the State. Eight quarterly issues of "Outdoor Nebraska" were published during the biennium. This publication was enlarged and con - tained many helpful articles to sportsmen and conservationists. Forty thousand copies of this publication were distributed dur - ing the biennium. Several editions of the game laws together with abstracts of the game laws and private fish hatchery laws were published during the biennium. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1927-1928 Inspection and Control The Division of Inspection and Control consisting of the enforcement of the game and fish laws, inspection of permits, etc., was considerably enlarged during the biennium. From twelve to twenty game wardens were employed. The State was divided into eight districts with a district warden in charge of each subdivision. All complaints regarding violation of the laws were placed in the' hands of the district wardens and immediately investigated. The wardens have been adequately equipped with cars furnished by the Bureau, tentage for camping in the field, etc. A considerable saving in transportation cost was made by the purchase of State cars rather than the paying of mileage. Wardens were compelled to spend the greater part of the year camping in the field where they were better able to observe con - ditions and enforce the laws concerning game and fish.

The greater number of these fish were fingerling and large enough in size to take care of themselves when planted in natural waters. The policy of the Bureau has been to use the hatcheries and nurseries for the fry and hold them until they are partially grown before releasing them in the natural waters. This policy is al - ready bearing fruit, and will continue to do so as it has been demonstrated beyond doubt that this method of fish propagation is far better than placing the young fry directly into the natural waters. The State Fish Car, "Waltonian", was remodeled during the biennium. The observation room was torn out and four more fish tanks added thus increasing the capacity of the car ap - proximately twenty per cent. It was necessary to place new air pumps, wheels and roofing on the car. A specially built fish truck with a capacity of eight large tanks equipped with air pump was built and put into service. This was of great assistance in the economical distribution of fish and made it possible to distribute a larger number of fish than ever before. Several smaller trucks were also used in dis - tribution work. The important work of conserving fish was carried out on a larger scale than heretofore. Two crews were kept busy most </seg>

The policy of placing fry in nurseries until they are large enough to take care of them - selves in .natural water has been found to be a forward step in fish culture. By this method at least fifty per cent of the fish planted, reach maturity; whereas, under the old system of put - ting fry into natural waters approximately ten per cent reached maturity. Additional nurseries have been established in Dawes, Sheri - dan, Holt, Scotts Bluff, Custer, Douglas, Cherry and Dodge Counties. All of the -nurseries now in operation together with' a considerable number of Izaak Walton League nurseries are annually stocked by the Bureau. - Recreation Grounds Development work on the recreation grounds, purchased in 1925 and 1926, has been carried. out during this biennium. . Trees have been planted and the water stocked with fish at the Goose Lake Recreation Grounds in Holt County. </seg>
            <seg id="p172">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE A road has been constructed, trees planted and fencing done at Walgreen Lake Recreation Grounds in Sheridan County. Twenty-five acres of pines have been planted at the Rat and Beaver Lakes Recreation Grounds in Cherry County. Trees have been planted, grading done, water stocked with fish and general development on an extensive scale has been done at the Fremont Sand Pit Recreation Grounds in Dodge County. This recreation grounds is now approximately one - half developed and in several years more it will be possible to make it one of the finest recreation grounds in the middle west. Game Farming Owing to the high price of raw fur and the scarcity of the same, game farming is being taken up by many citizens of Ne - braska. This new industry has been encouraged by the Bureau and new regulations have been formulated to govern the same. Quarterly reports are required from all game farmers, as well as a report on all sales made, so as to protect the natural game and fur -bearing animals, and at the same time to make it possible for the game farmers to do business during closed seasons as provided by law. Meandered Lakes Attention has been given during the past two yeaTS to some twelve meandered lakes in the State of Nebraska, which hereto - for have never been deevloped in any way. These meandered lakes have all been stocked with game fish and protection is being given them by the Bureau. These lakes belong to the public and have great possibilities in the future for recreation grounds. A spillway was constructed at Red Deer Lake, which is a meandered lake, in order to keep the water to a sufficient level to be attractive to waterfowl, and to keep large numbers of fish therein from freezing out during winter. </seg>
            <seg id="p173">\ BIENNIAL REPORT— 1927-1928 Open Season on Pheasants "For the first time in the history of Nebraska, sportsmen of the State have had an opportunity to .hunt the ring-neck pheas - ant, which the Bureau has been stocking during the past fifteen ' years. The fall of 1927 a three-day season was opened in Sherman and Wheeler Counties with the result that approximately five thousand birds were bagged. In the fall of 1928 a ten-day season was opened in Gar - field, Wheeler, Valley, Greeley, Sherman, Howard, Buffalo, Hall and Merrick Counties. Over thirty-five thousand birds were bagged during the ten days, and the hunting attracted sportsmen from all over the State. These open seasons decided beyond a question of doubt that the ring-neck pheasant is an excellent game gird and its meat fine eating. They are hardy enough to protect themselves, and with a reasonable open season the stock can be protected in - definitely. Tree Planting The Bureau has joined with other branches of the Federal and State Government as well as organizations in the various tree planting campaigns. Encouragement has been given to this work and the Bureau itself has undertaken a programme of tree planting on recreation grounds and lakes controlled by it. Twenty-five thousand pine trees were planted at Rat and Beaver Lakes as well as thousands of cottonwpods, poplars, elms etc., at the Fremont Sand Pit Recreation Grounds, Goose Lake Recreation Grounds, and Walgreen Lake Recreation Grounds. New Non-Resident Permits In compliance with the State law as amended by the 1925 Session of the State Legislature, a new form of hunting and fish - ing permit for non-residents was provided. This permit sells for </seg>
            <seg id="p174">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE $25.00 instead of $ 10.00 as prior to the amendment of the law, and contains a coupon for the reporting of game taken from the State. This new permit has made it possible to regulate the taking of game from the State, and has had a very wholesome effect on the conservation of our game birds. Private Fish Hatcheries A new law was passed by the 1925 Session of the State Leg - islature which authorized the establishing of private fish hatch - eries in Nebraska. Pamphlets setting forth this law and regula - tions governing same were published, and encouragement has been given to those citizens desirous of establishing private fish hatcheries.

Cold Storage plant operators were made responsible under the new law for game stored in their warehouses, and they are required to report to the Bureau on tags provided them showing all game stored in their warehouses. Tags also have been provided and distributed through per - mit selling agencies, Which provide for the shipping of game from one point to another throughout the State.

Valentine Hatchery During the summer of 1928 a disastrous flood partially de - stroyed the Valentine Fish Hatchery. . Considerable damage was done to the ponds and it was ascertained that approximately two hundred and fifty thousand fish consisting of Black Bass, 'Rock Bass, Croppies and Sunfish were lost. However, immediate rebuilding of the hatchery was under - taken. Competent engineering advice was obtained and a new series of ponds will be practically completed by the end of the biennium. The most of the new ponds will be on higher ground and not subject to flood danger. A new water. supply for the hatching house was also pro - vided in the laying of a main and the tapping of springs in Min - nechadusa Creek nearby.

            <seg id="p178">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE DIVISION OF FOOD, DRUGS AND OIL O. V. McCracken, Chief In presenting a report of the second biennium, it is probably of some value to list the laws that come within the jurisdiction of this Department. They are as follows: Gasoline and Kerosene Inspection Law. Dairy Law (Revised). Pure Food Law. Sanitary Food Law Cider and Vinegar Law Oleomargarine and Butterine Law Cold Storage Law. Paint and Linseed Oil Law. Commercial Feeding Stuffs Law. Live Stock Remedy Law. Commercial Fertilizer Law. Commission Merchant Law. Hotel Law. Potatoes— Grading of C'arlot Shipments. Filled. Evaporated and Condesed Milk Law. Turpentine Law. Serum and Virus Law. Soft Drink Law. Legal Standard for Different Grades of Cheese. Farm Warehouse Law. Egg Candling Law. Imitation Butter and Dairy Products Law. The report covering the several laws has been given in the subject matter of the first Biennial Report herewith. There are, however, some important changes that should be noted that were made by legislative enactments of 1927. Chief among those is the revision of the Dairy law, establishing more rigid regulations for cream stations. Nebraska occupies a prominent position in the ranks of the dairy industry, being fourth on the list. When any state makes the rapid progress in any industry that Nebraska has made in dairying the last few years, the difficulty in maintaining the quality in proportion to growth is obvious. As we improve this quality, which is already a high standard, we occupy a command - ing position on the big markets. </seg>
            <seg id="p179">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1927-1928 ■ ' ■ . ■ ' . • . ■ ' I ■ This Department, with the advantages of legislative action and the cooperation of the dairymen and dairy manufacturing establishments, has been untiring in its efforts to improve dairy conditions. Formerly the Department employed seven dairy inspectors whose duty it was to give all of their time to inspection and regulation of dairy and allied establishments. Upon in - vestigation this administration found a duplication of expense that could be eliminated by dividing the state into smaller dis - tricts and employing inspectors qualified to make all classes of inspections. This was done and has proven very satisfactory In July, 1927, the new Dairy Law became effective- which provided for a more thorough supervision over dairy products, dairy establishments and the operators. Notwithstanding the greatly added duties and responsibilities this placed on the de - partment, this work has been satisfactorily handled by the addi - tion of only two special men whose activities are directed from the office. These men are required to go anywhere, anytime and, like the regular inspectors, look after all classes of work connected with the Department. As a result of our work the consumer is assured of a pure healthful product, which naturally commands a greater mar - ket value reflecting greater financial benefit to the industry. This is noticeable from the fact that if the quality can be im - proved just enough to raise the price of butter one centj per pound, it would bring to the industry of this state approximately an additional one million dollars a year. Each location used for a cream station must be inspected and approved as to the sanitary conditions and also the equip - ment. The Department then issues a permit to the applicant entitling him to operate the station but this permit is revocable - by the Department for cause. In order to operate a cream station, the operator must ap - pear before the authorized agent of the Department and pass a satisfactory examination, demonstrating his ability to test, cream. This operator then is issued a permit which the Department may revoke for cause. For convenience, examinations are held at </seg>

            <seg id="p181"/>
            <seg id="p182">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE several places over the state. Each year (adding together the work of all inspectors) a total of 396 days are devoted to these examinations; besides, the office of the Department is open for examinations every working day in the year. With the issuance of the permits, the labors of the Department are just started. It is our work to see that the intentions of the law are observed and that honesty and fair dealing prevails. With but few ex - ceptions, everyone connected with the industry realizes the benefits that will accrue to all concerned, and on account- of this, the Department can boast of great accomplishments. Naturally, experience with the recently enacted dairy law has afforded the Department an opportunity to discover a few weak spots and for the benefit of the producer, dealer and consumer alike, we confidently hope and believe the coming legislature will provide such remedies as are deemed necessary. Further than the regulation of the raw dairy products, the Department is interested in knowing that all cows that produce milk for human consumption are free from tuberculosis or other dangerous disease, that they have clean food and water and that the milk is carefully handled and cared for until it reaches the market channels. Then the Department is interested in the preparation, care and preservation of the product until it reaches the ultimate consumer. It is the opinion of the officers of the Department that trie dairy industry in the state of Nebraska is yet in its infancy. Located as it is just in the center of the "Breadbasket of America", with all of the natural resources, climatic conditions, marketing facilities, and the character and thrift of its people, Nebraska should not only be at the top of the list, but far ahead of every other state in the valuation rank of dairy products. Another important change made by the legislature of 1927 was the strengthening of the Commercial Feeding Stuffs law. It required a more definite registration as to contents and a plainer declaration of the composition of the feeding stuff on the label. As such products become more popular and enjoy a greater sale on our markets, we find restrictive legislation and regulation imperative. For illustration, the word "tankage" is </seg>
            <seg id="p183">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1927-1928 a term that has been greatly abused, and the Department found many varieties of commercial feeds sold . as tankage. A ruling has been promulgated restricting the word "tankage" to apply only to the residue from animal tissues, exclusive of hoof and horn, especially prepared for feeding purposes by tanking under live steam, drying under high heat, suitably ground, and con - taining not less than 10% phosphoric acid (P205). There is probably only one other activity of the Department (the oil business) that requires as much time and expense as the Dairy Department. This is attributable to the rapid in - crease in the number of places for inspection and the steady growth of the industry itself. . The Laboratory is the safety valve between the producer and the consumer. It is often on account of the knowledge and ability of the chemist that harmful foods and drugs are identified and eliminated from, the possibility of being consumed by inno - cent and unsuspecting consumers. .The inspectors collect samples of all commodities for sale to the consumer that they find in the performance of their regular- duties, or such products con - cerning which there is suspicion or complaint. Besides this, many samples are submitted by citizens of the state for analysis and inspection. A report is made on all work performed and if any irregularities are found, a warning notice is sent to the proper person. It is sufficient here, to say that they have a great responsi - bility and their services are indispensable in the operation of a department such as the Department of Agriculture of the State of Nebraska. </seg>

            <seg id="p188">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE DIVISION OF GASOLINE TAX COLLECTION Dr. T. W. Bass, Chief Changes in the Law After the law had been in operation for one year and nine months, the legislature of 1927 deemed it wise to make a few changes, especially in the section dealing with refunds, also the method of collecting the tax. That part of the law providing for a refund of tax paid on motor fuel used in the operation of farm tractors was repealed. Regardless of what motor fuel may be used for, there are no refunds to be had under the present law. The law was changed so that the tax is now levied upon motor fuel imported into the state and unloaded in storage tanks. The tax is based upon capacity of container, less two per cent, which is allowed for shrinkage and loss in handling. There were 561 licenses in effect December I, 1926; 326 were issued during the biennium and 161 were discontinued, leaving in force 726 December 1, 1928.

            <seg id="p190">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE DIVISION OF AGRICULTURAL SEEDS Elva L. Norris, Seed Analyst Principal Features of the Nebraska State Seed Law Of the necessary purchases for farm operations, weight for weight, agricultural seeds are the most expensive, and there - fore it is the Tight of the purchaser to know what kind of seed he is purchasing, the percentage of pure seed, the name and number of the noxious weed seed present, the percentage of the seed that will grow and the date when the test was made. The date of the test is important due to the fact that there is variation with the kind of seed, age and storage conditions. Such information must be placed on a label or tag and attached to seed sold after July 28, 1921. The law is designed to protect the purchaser of seeds by giving him full information regarding the quality of the seeds. It will also protect the honest seed dealer against the practices of unscruplous and irresponsible ones. The law requires the labeling of all agricultural seeds which are sold, offered or exposed for sale within the state for seeding purposes within the State, either in bulk, packages, bags or other containers of ten pounds or more, excepting in case of special mixtures such as lawn or golf course mixtures in which instances containers of four ounces or more must be labeled. Labeling The law requires each lot of seed to bear a statement, tag or label giving the following information: 1 . The Commonly Accepted Name of Such Agricultural Seeds: The kind of seed must be indicated and the name given must be the one commonly accepted by the public and the Seed Trade. For example: Canada blue grass and Kentucky blue </seg>
            <seg id="p191">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1927-1928 grass must be so named, as these aie the commonly accepted names, instead of simply "Blue Grass." 2. The Purity of the Seed, Expressed as a Percentage of the Total Weight: For example: Out of 100 pounds of timothy seed marked 98 r /&lt; pure, 98 pounds would be pure timothy and the other two pounds would be chaff, dirt, weed seeds or seeds of some other crop. 3. The Quantity of Weed Seeds, Expressed as a Percent - age of the Weight: This includes the seeds of all plants that are not strictly farm crops. Some are harmless but others are decidedly harmful. 4. Noxious Weeds in Nebraska are as follows: (1) Small flowered morning glory (Convolvulus arvensis), (2) Wild Mus - tard or Charlock (Brassica arvensis), (3) Quack Grass (Ag - ropyron repens), (4) Wild Oats (Avena fatua), (5) All species of dodder (Cuscuta Spp.), (6) Canada Thistle (Cirsium arvense. ) If there is more than one seed of the noxious weeds in one-sixth (1-6) of an ounce of the agricultural seed, its pres - ence must be indicated on the label. If the seeds contain any of the seed of Canada Thistle, the presence of such seeds must be indicated on the label. 5. The Germination or Vitality of the Seed: This is ex - pressed as a per cent: 92% for example, meaning that 92 out of 1 00 pure seeds in the sample tested were alive and capable of sprouting. 6. The Date on Which the Germination Test Was Made. 7. The Name and Address of the Seller. 8. Origin of Seed: The origin of the following imported seeds must be given: Turkestan and Italian grown alfalfa, Chilean and Italian grown red clover. Such. seed is not acclimated to. localities in this country and farmers should guard against buying this seed. The recent </seg>
            <seg id="p192">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE amendment to the Federal Seed Act, requiring the staining of imported seeds oi red clover and alfalfa will be of value in establishing the origin of these seeds. Exemptions Agricultural seeds or mixtures of same shall be exempt from the provisions of this Act: (a) When possessed, exposed for sale, or sold for food purposes only. (b) when sold to merchants to be recleaned before being sold or exposed for sale for seeding purposes. (c) When in store for the purpose of recleaning or not possessed, sold or offered for sale for seeding purposes within the state. (d) The seeds of field corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye, spelts, buckwheat, flax, kaffir, milo, cane, sudan, millets, Canada field peas, cowpeas, soy beans, vetches, rape and all the varieties of sorghum and cereals not named in this Section grown and sold by the gTower thereof on his own premises, provided, how - eveT, that said grower shall be responsible under this Act for any representation he shall make in the sale of such agricultural seeds; and further provided, that if such agricultural seeds shall be advertised for sale then the grower as a seller shall be deemed to be a vendor and said seed and seller shall be subject to all the requirements of this Act. Provided, nothing in this sub - section shall be interpreted as exempting any such grower from the full provisions of this Act in the case of the sale of Canadian blue grass, Kentucky blue grass, brome grasses, fescues, tall meadow oat grass, orchard grass, red top, rye grasses, timothy, alfalfa, alsike clover, crimson clover, red clover, sweet clover, white clover or any other grasses and legumes not named in this Section. </seg>
            <seg id="p193">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1 927-1 928 Need of Enforcing the Law The quality of seed found on the market the past seasons and the general tendency of the dealers to overlook the label requirements shows very plainly the need of enforcing the State. Seed Law. Better seed laws and rigid enforcement by neighbor - ing states will make Nebraska the natural outlet for undesirable seed not salable elsewhere. These same lots of seed may still enter the state, but must bear a label that will easily show the purchaser that they are not what he cares to plant. Naturally there will not be much demand for seed of known inferior quality. Inspection The seed inspectors appointed by the Department of Agri - culture are instructed to visit all places of business where seeds are to be found offered for sale and to inspect and take samples of all the various kinds of field seeds that he finds. Samples are taken in duplicate and sealed with an official seal. The samples are taken to the State Seed Laboratory for further in - spection and analysis. Violations Three different kinds of violations are to be found through inspection work: . j ' 1 . Seed containing more noxious weeds than is permissible. .2. Not placing the required information on the tag or label. 3. Seed that is below the' guarantee as claimed on the tag. Of the eight hundred sixty-three (863) lots of seed inspected during tne biennium, one hundred sixty-six ( 1 66) lots were direct violations of the seed law. By far the most common form of violation is in not placing the required information on the tag. Violations of this nature are noticed by the inspector while taking the sample and acted </seg>
            <seg id="p194">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE upon at once. Lots of seed below the guarantee aa claimed and lots containing noxious weeds are discovered when the samples are analyzed in the laboratory. Unfortunately some of these violations are uncovered too late to prevent the sale of the seed, but the information gained has a great deal of future value to the Department and to the dealer who has sold the seed. Stop Sale Notice The inspector takes notice and calls the attention of the dealer to any violations in labeling, and makes such suggestions as the case may require. When important items as the PURITY, GERMINATION are omitted from the tag the inspector issues one of the Department STOP SALE NOTICES, which forbids the sale of the seed until the labels carrying all the required in - formation are procured. The selling of seeds after the STOP SALE NOTICE has been issued constitutes an offense punish - able by fine. Release Whenever the STOP SALE NOTICE has been issued and the dealer has secured the proper tags, he may submit them along with his notice to the State Department of Agriculture at Lincoln for examination. If upon examination the tags are found to comply with the law, his notice receives the approval of the Department and is returned with the tags to the dealer and he is permitted to continue the sale of his seed. Analysis of Samples Samples collected in the field are given a definite number as a means of identification when received in the laboratory and the analysis of each sample follows. The analysis is made ac - cording to the recognized rules for seed testing. Samples found to be below what is claimed on the tag or to contain noxious weeds are retested and checked until any doubt is removed as to the accuracy of the work or test. </seg>
            <seg id="p195">BIENNIAL REPORT-^1927-1928 - Mailing Out Reports The dealers are mailed the results of the analysis as soon as possible for two reasons: First, that they may make cor - rections on the tags where necessary. Second, that they may present any reasons they may have for not having their seed in - cluded in our published report of illegal or improperly branded seeds. The State Seed Law provides that the Department of Agri - culture may publish the results of examination and analysis of samples of seed collected. Publications will be made each year in bulletin form so that all may know as to the quality of seed to be found on the market, thus enabling dealers in the matter of subsequent purchases to go to a source of supply where good seed- may be obtained, carrying with it a. truthful label. It is hoped that all interested parties will study the analyses as the same appear in the Department bulletin, particularly are dealers and distributors interested in these analyses. Their co-operation . is necessary for the successful enforcement of the State's Seed Law. Publications In May 1927 Bulletin Number 101/ entitled "Nebraska Weeds" was published. This bulletin illustrates, describes and gives methods of eradication for seventy of the commonest weeds of Nebraska. Normal schools, high schools, rural schools, county agents, bankers, women's clubs, etc. have sent in re - quests for this bulletin and as a result approximately six thou - sand copies have been distributed. At the present time, the -"Regulatory Announcements" are being revised and will soon be available for distribution. It is the policy of this department to co-operate fully with the College of Agriculture, County Agents and the editors of agricultural publications. During the last biennium consider - able publicity was given to a fraudulent enterprise which was going on within the state. Common Rye Grass seed which can </seg>
            <seg id="p196">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ordinarily be bought for twenty cents a pound was being sold at the rate of $1.50 per pound, under the name "Herbae Mira". At another time, quantities of wild oats, one of Nebraska's nox - ious weeds, were shipped into the state in carload lots for feed purposes. This department used all possible means to aid against its distribution in the state. During the last biennium eight thousand (8000) copies of an article describing four seed projects were placed in the hands of rural teachers. The projects were as follows: "State Seed Law Vitalized", "Weed Seed Collections", "Testing Seeds in the Rural School", and "Making Plant Collections". The Seed Analyst, through the Boys and Girls 4H Clubs of the state has personally come in contact with approximately 2500 boys and girls and acquainted them with the importance of planting good seed and the harmfulness of noxious weeds. The State Fair Board as well as many County Fail Boards have assisted in this important work by offering premiums and medals for weed and weed seed collections. The importance of good, adaptable agricultural seed is re - ceiving more recognition than ever before. The United States Department of Agriculture with its recent staining amendment for imported alfalfa and red clover seed and its provision for verified alfalfa seed, is giving valuable assistance. A recent organization "The Farm Seed Council of America" is helping to solve the problems of those interested in seeds. It is very important that each state should lend its assistance by enforcing its respective seed laws. The following table gives the number of analyses and in - spections made during the biennium.

            <seg id="p202">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE DIVISION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES The Division of Weights and Measures has been unusually busy, due to the fact that the common wagon scale is being re - placed by the heavy duty truck scale. The grain buyer must be equipped to weigh loads which are brought in or he will loose business. There has been a large increase in the number of gasoline pumps during the last two years. It is necessary to inspect these pumps in order that their accuracy be determined. Automatic Scales In the inspection of automatic scales, the inspector is not only instructed to inspect and test the scales, but to find out if the operator understands their care and method of operation. Automatic scales should be cleaned, balanced and tried out before loading each car of grain, if one is to obtain accurate re - sults. A scale which is out of balance one-half of a pound, will mean an error of l87'/2 lbs. on an average of 375 weighings. Hopper Scales If the Hopper scale is properly installed on its own solid foundation, and is kept clean and free from friction, it will cause very little trouble. These scales are tested to as near capacity as possible. Condemned Devices There were fewer condemned devices during this biennium than during the preceeding one. This is no doubt due to the fact that the inspectors have made adjustments and given instructions in the care of weighing devices instead of at once "condemning" them. Advice in the installing of new weighing devices also accounts for the lack of condemned devices. We feel that at the present time that the condition of weighing devices is un - usually good. There is also an excellent feeling existing among the buying and selling public. </seg>

Anderson, Agricultural Statistician The most significant development in the Division of Agri - cultural Statistics during the biennium was the large quantity of additional work assigned to the office due. to the policy adopted by the Washington office of transferring nearly all of the work of gathering agricultural statistics formerly done by that office to the field offices and making the statistician in charge re- . sponsible for all of it. Under the present arrangement all pre - liminary acreage material is reviewed in June and the final acre - age estimates in November in the field offices by Washington representatives of the Bureau. This was started in 1927 and has proven highly satisfactory. Under the present system the Washington representatives now have access to all of the acreage material in the field offices where all is evaluated, analyzed and discussed personally instead of depending almost entirely upon written reports in the past. The conclusions regarding acre - ages are then forwarded to Washington together with all tab - ulations and computations and a final review is made by the Crop Reporting Board prior to the date of release that is fixed in advance. Present Scope of the Work An endeavor will be made to enumerate all of the different reports made in the order in which they occur.

            <seg id="p211">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1927-1928 ■ State Farm Census This is one of the largest tasks of the year. The assessors report on 50 or 60 inquiries, mostly acreage of crops, of every farmer in the state. This work begins April 1 and by July 1 , the Division of Agricultural Statistics has all of the acreages compiled by counties, and for the state for use in the preliminary crop estimates during the summer and autumn. The balance of the report is compiled after July 1 , and all of this information fur - nishes the basis for the county estimates of acreage, and various other county farm statistics. No state has any better farm census than Nebraska, and few if any states have the material compiled early enough to be used in the current preliminary estimates of acreage. The 1928 report contained nearly three quarters of a million of separate farm items that had to be compiled. Ad - justments are made tor incompleteness and errors and changes in plantings. The Jatter is accomplished by surveys made in both June and in September. .-■;..: " Special Reports Over and above the regular inquiries enumerated above which now require a quarter of a million envelopes annually, there are a number of special inquiries from time to time which arise from special or unusual conditions that develop in crops or livestock. For example, such special reports are made on areas of unusual winter wheat abandonment, serious injury to any crop from disease or drought, injury from early frost, hog cholera or other serious epidemics among swine, special information de - sired by the state or federal departments of agriculture or by farm organizations. Miscellaneous Work In addition to preparing each of the foregoing reports which require maintaining of mailings lists, sending out inquiries and follow-up inquiries, editing, tabulating-, compilation, writing up the report, preparation and mailing the same to cooperators, and special write-ups for the press for each and every report, there are numerous other duties. There is considerable correspond- </seg>
            <seg id="p212">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ence, preparation of statistical tables for a large number of in - dependent requests, preparing estimates for the railroad ship - pers advisory board, supplying statistical information to callers and over the telephone, preparation of some 150 stories for the press each year, preparation of the annual report of Nebraska Agricultural Statistics of 200 to 228 pages, from four to six weeks of travel in field investigation of crops and measuring crop acreage, educational work to increase the use of agri - cultural statistics as well as numerous other minor detailed tasks that come in the course of each year. Special Records There are a number of records collected maintained that Te - quire considerable correspondence and a large quantity of cleri - cal work. They are as follows: 1. Station railroad forwardings and receipts of livestock. 2. Stockyard receipts of livestock. 3. Stocker and feeder shipments of livestock to the country. 4. Assessed records of livestock by classes and divisions. 5. Records of carlot shipments of farm products. 6. Miscellaneous records. Station railroad records of forwardings and receipts of cattle, hogs and sheep have been maintained since 1920. These are furnished by head freight offices of all railroads. Since this office furnishes the records for other states of all Union Pacific and all Burlington stations west of the Missouri river it requires the equivalent of 50 single space typewritten pages each month to enter all of the stations. In this office, the records are main - tained by stations, counties and railroads by months. Various summaries are made and these are used in determining the num - ber of cattle and sheep on feed, the movement from range sec - tions and various other uses in the livestock estimating work. Stockyard receipts oi livestock are maintained by months </seg>
            <seg id="p213">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1927-1928 from every public stockyard receiving livestock from Nebraska as well as every packing plant receiving livestock direct from the state. This enables us to measure livestock production and is useful in many ways in the livstock estimating work. Stacker and feeder shipments of livestock are obtained from the federal Bureau of Animal Industry. These are valuable in estimating the number of livestock on feed. They give the movement from all markets to the states.' The difference in number between this and the total station railroad reecipts gives the direct movement from the range to the feeder. Assessed records of livestock by ages and classes are valu - able in making estimates of livestock. This coupled with the railroad- movements, and stock yard receipts enables one to make estimates of. absolute numbers that are very reliable. Records of carlot shipments of grain crops and other farm commodities are useful as a check upon the estimates and for calculating gross farm income. This gives the quantity marketed each month which times the average price for the month gives very accurate figures of total farm revenue from both crops and livestock. Miscellaneous records consist of factory records of sugar beets acreage, production, price, etc., similar records on pop - corn, railroad movements of apples and potatoes furnished by. the Washington office and other records useful in making crop and livestock estimates. Other Developments in the Service There has been considerable development in statistical methods used, particularly in the way of sampling and the analysis of sample information to eliminate bias. In much the same way that the grade of a car of wheat is determined by ob - taining a small sample of the whole, estimates of acreage, con - dition or yield of a crop are obtained by getting a small sample of the whole. The greatest difficulty in the past has been to get </seg>
            <seg id="p214">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE a representative sample, particularly of acreage, and to recognize it when it is obtained. Methods have now been evolved where - by a number of these difficulties have been largely eliminated. Fortunately for Nebraska, the acreage problems are quite well taken care of in the annual assessors report of acreage. This fact makes it desirable to try out all new methods as a check on their reliability. Aside from careful analysis and comparison with past records to correct errors and allow for incompleteness and for changes in acreage planted and acreage abandoned after planting which is done through certain surveys or sample acreage data collected, the assessors returns are accepted as a rule as being very close to the facts. The problems involved in determining condition or yield of a crop are much simpler than those of acreage. The percentage system Not many years ago, the federal department relied upon a "percentage system" to determine acreage. The federal census was taken as a base and for the intercensual years, crop le - porters were asked to estimate the change in acreage over the preceding year in per cent. This was pretty much of an impossi - ble task besides subject to a large quantity of bias. Comparison With Usual The next step was the "comparison with the usual" whereby crop reporters were asked to compare the acreage of a crop with the usual acreage. For example, if the comparison of the usual of coin acreage was 90 ' ,■ last yeaT and 95 % this yeai, then 95 divided by 90 gave 105.5'i or an indication of 5.5% increase in acreage. Acres Per Hundred Method It was soon discovered that the foregoing method had cer - tain weaknesses and it was replaced by a method asking the crop reporter to give for his locality the number of acres grown to each crop out of every hundred acres of crops grown. This </seg>
            <seg id="p215">■ BIENNIAL. REPORT— 1927-1928 method provided a direct comparison of crop to crop each year. The weakness from this method was the inability of the re - porter to give an accurate estimate of per cent of the total, cropped land devoted to each crop. Individual Farm Comparison In order to get away from the judgment or opinion estimates which could not be relied upon a new plan was conceived where - by crop reporters were asked to report their absolute acres in crops this year and for the past year. ; For example, if this sample information showed 50,000 acres of corn this year and 55,000 acres last year, then 50,000 divided by 55,000 gives an ■ indication of about 90% as much corn as the previous year, which if applied to the absolute acres last year, would give the absolute acreage this year. Of course a certain amount of re - finement was made in the way of weighing and editing question - able and other returns which on account of their marked varia - tion from the average might upset the sample. Theoretically, this should have eliminated errors in judgment or opinion to which other methods were subject, and while it marked a con - siderable advance in methods, it was subject to memory bias and to some intentional manipulation of acreages. Ratio Relative Method This was a further development of the individual farm method. The questionnaires simply called for the acreage of each crop for one year only and of course the total acres in the farm. After editing and tabulating, the ratio of each crop to the total crop acreage was determined, and also the lation of each crop to the total acres in the farms' included in the sample. Similar compilations are made each year. Then for, example, if the ratio of winter wheat to all crops was 20.5 this year and 18.5 last year then 20.5 divided by 18.5 gives 1.11 or an in - dication of 1 1 % increase in acreage. This method has the advantages of previous methods in that it eliminates errors arising from judgment or opinion, errors </seg>
            <seg id="p216">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE from memory or intentional bias on part of the reporter to ex - aggerate one way or the otheT. The chief difficulty seems to be in getting a representative sample. It has been found that if the samples are not comparable each year from the standpoint of size of farm that the ratios are likely to be upset, thereby giv - ing misleading indications. An endeavor is being made to elim - inate this difficulty by more careful editing and selection of re - ports and by weighting by size of farm groups in addition to the other weighting and refinement used. Comparison of Identical Farms Method This is one of the latest methods tried. The same sample material that is used in the ratio relative method is utilized, but instead of taking all returns, only such are taken that are for identical farms for both years. This method seems to retain the advantages of all of the preceding methods as well as giv - ing a more representative sample and one that is not so subject to bias in fluctuation of sample as the method immediately pre - ceding this one. The chief diffculty seems to be in getting a sufficient quantity of reports of identical farms for both years for comparison. Crop Measurement Method About five or six years ago one of the statisticians invented a devise for measuring field frontage along the highway. It is simply an adaptation of the ordinary speedometer except that it registers for each hundred feet as well as the mileage also. It contains twelve or more keys, one for each crop measured. When passing a corn field, for example, the corn key is pressed down and remains engaged until relieved by pressing another crop key, or the master release key. Field crop frontage is measured along 3500 miles of the same roads each year on both sides and the readings compared one year with another. For example, if the frontage of alfalfa is 1 10,000 feet this year and 100,000 feet last year, the indicated change in acreage would be 110,000 divided by 100,000 or I.I or 110%, an increase of 10^1 . For major crops this machine is very accurate. It is </seg>
            <seg id="p217">BIENNIAL REPORT— 1927-1928 subject to no bias whatever, and a sufficiently large sample to de - termine the state acreage for the major can be measured in a comparatively short period of time. It is not very practical for minor crops unless they are grown in concentrated areas. General Statement concerning the Last Two Biennial Reports Most of the biennial report of this Division has been given over to naming and discussing the numerous reports issued each year and a short explanation of the methods used. This is quite a contrast to the last biennial report which took up the coopera - tive agreement, the state law on the gathering of agricultural statistics and a more or less brief discussion of a few phases of the work. Where there has been no material changes in the sub - jects discussed in the last report, no effort will be made to re - new the discussion in this report. There has been several changes in the personnel, and after a short statement of the present per- ■ sonnel, and some discussion of the value and use of crop re - ports, there is nothing much further of consequence to be said as to the progress of the work of this Division. Office Personnel While the work of the Division has increased greatly during this biennium it has been accomplished without additional per - manent help. Some temporary clerical help was employed. The assistant statistician, Mr. F. K. Reed resigned before the close of the first year of the biennium to accept a position as assistant livestock statistician with the U. S. Department of Agri - culture at Washington, D. C. Mrs. P. N. Kelly who had been a federal clerk in the Division since 1918 resigned about the close of the last biennium and this vacancy was filled through the appointment of Mrs. Laura (Sack) Brewer. One of the state clerks, Miss Bonnie Gopenhaver resigned and the vacancy was filled by Miss Florence Schnieder. State Department W. Howard Forsyth, Assistant Statistician. Mrs. L. G.

Educational Work in Agricultural Statistics Needed The need of educational work in agricultural statistics to encourage their use has been recognized for some time. Lack of time and funds for this work have checked progress along this line. A few addresses were made and a number of ar - ticles were written for the press and some distribution made directly. Considerable progress has been made to encourage the use of the annual report of Nebraska agricultural statistics in the schools and as a result about one fifth of the rural schools are using them in the study of agriculture and agricultural geography. The colleges and high schools have been using them for supplemental study in agriculture for some time. Crop and Livestock Reports Serve a Real Purpose Crop and livestock reports are not only a direct benefit to farmers who use them as a guide to production and marketing but they deliver an indirect value to all farmers whether they use them directly or not. This arises from the fact that crop reports, by eliminating the ill effects of misleading reports, help to maintain maximum farm prices. Dependable Information Reduces Dealers' Margin of Profit Dependable information on the supply and demand reduces the dealer's risk of ownership which enables him to do busi - ness on a smaller margin of profit. With the uncertainty of supply removed by crop reports and the resulting increased stimulus of competitive buyers, he pays the producer a higher price than would be possible if uncertainty of supply existed. When dealers are uncertain as to the supply, they naturally take </seg>
            <seg id="p219">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1927-1928 larger margins which are reflected in reduced prices to farmers. Farm price decreases when the facts on supply are unknown and increase when the facts on supply are known because the latter removes uncertainty and speculation and stimulates buying. Supply and Demand Establishes Farm Price Supply and demand ultimately establishes prices of farm products. The greater the frequency and accuracy of agricul - tural forecasts and the greater the knowledge of demand, the sooner will price respond to supply and demand. Violent fluc - tuation in price arises largely from uncertainty of supply and demand, monopoly, or both. Monopoly can only be temporary, and can be eliminated entirely by frequent and wide publicity of the facts on production. Injurious speculation exists only when the facts concerning supply and demand are known to a few. Publication of the facts is the only practical way of eliminating the ill effects of excessive " speculation. Moderate speculation, if not carried to extreme or monopolized by com - bination, but based upon facts of supply and demand, will aid in maintaining maximum prices at all times, and is an essential to the marketing machinery. Many private concerns maintain crop reporting systems, and to the extent they obtain and re - lease dependable information, to that extent, they render a valuable service to the public as well as the direct benefit ob - tained for themselves. The greatest value of crop reports to the farmers is that received indirectly through not only the elimination of the ill effects of misleading reports but also through the maintenance of maximum price by the indicated price trend of crop reports. The farmer who studies crop reports will re - ceive a direct benefit in that it gives him. the same basis for fore - casting price trends that the dealer possesses and this is the best guide for marketing his products to the best advantage. Supply and Demand Must Balance to Obtain Maximum Price In order to get the maximum return from agriculture, it is necessary to produce a quantity that will just about equal, but not exceed the demand. While it is realized that due to factors </seg>
            <seg id="p220">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE upon which the farmer has no control, it is very difficult to get even an approximate balance of supply and demand, there is much that can be done through the use and study of agricultural statistics. A study of past relationships of price and production are illuminating. A study of the planting intention surveys, pig surveys, livestock on feed reports will be of material assistance in balancing supply and demand. Organized effort through farmers organizations might help materially in getting the great - est practical value from such reports. Past Records Show Unbalanced Supply and Demand Disastrous io Prices The past records of excess production and under production of pork with the accompanying fluctuation of prices is an illus - tration of the results that are bound to come unless production is stabilized. The excessive planting of potatoes in 1928 is an - other of the more recent examples of unwise planting. Early in the spring of 1928, the Division's planting intention showed that farmers had planned to increase the potato acreage in the \J. S. almost 12' i . Not enough farmers paid . attention, to this and an increase of 9.2 'i in acreage was planted and this together with good yields produced a crop which brought ruinously low prices. Nebraska farmers even increased their potato acreage beyond their earlier intentions. Solution Lies in the Cooperation and Use of Agricultural Statistics If farmers will lay their crop and livestock production cards on the table right side up, cooperate in a service which is prim - arily for their benefit and use every effort to be guided by the results, they will help themselves more than they can be helped through any other source. After all is said and done, the high - est farm price that it is possible to obtain is after all the maximum price that demand will pay. If every effort is made to adjust production to meet future demand then price, will Temain at its maximum point and agriculture will receive all that any agency can secure for it and at the same time, endure permanently. Why not cooperate and utilize service that offers about the maximum relief that is obtainable? </seg>

Gates, Inspector Historical The work of this division was started about June 15, 1927 following the enactment of the Nursery Inspection Law (H. R. No. 538) which was passed with an emergency clause April 18, 1927 by the 44th session of the Nebraska Legislature. Prior to the enactment of this law, the nurseries of the state were in - spected annually by the State Entomologist, who is an officer of the State University appointed by the Regents of that Institu - tion (See par. 6755 Revised Statutes of Nebraska 1922). These inspections were unofficial at first but were given legal standing under an act of the Legislature approved April 16, 1 9 I 3. (Sec - tions 62-69, Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1913) and amended April 14, 1917. (Chapter I, Session Laws 1917). Law of 1913 Invalid "A decision of the Supreme Court of the United States early in 1926 indicated that all legislation dealing with the matter of interstate shipments of plants, enacted between August 20, 1912 and April 13, 1926 was invalid. This necessitated the re-enact - ment of the basic Nebraska law relative to nursery inspection and certification, a move further made desirable by the inade - quacy and inconsistency in many places of the law of 1913, as had been demonstrated in its practical enforcement; and while the revision of the law was being made it was regarded as a step in the Tight direction to transfer, this regulatory work from the University, which is an educational and not a regulatory' institution, to the State Department of Agriculture which was organized for the handling of regulatory work for the state."* Other Activities In addition to the Nursery Inspection Law, two other meas - ures designed to prevent the introduction and spread of danger - •Letter .to the Nurserymen of Nebraska, M.

In addition to the activities in connection with the laws mentioned above, a service has been rendered the flour-milling interests of the State, by making mill inspections and granting certificates of cleanliness and freedom from insect pests. The expenses of this ■work have been paid by the mill owners so that the service has been self-supporting. Nursery Inspection Law Purpose and Requirements of the Law The object of the Nursery Inspection Law is to prevent the transportation of diseased nursery stock, into or within the state. Therefore, it requires that all nursery stock within the state must be inspected annually by an authorized inspector, and that every shipment or package of nursery stock must be accompanied by a valid certificate of inspection before it may be legally transported into or within the state. Every grower of nursery stock must apply for inspection by July first of each year; every dealer in nursery stock, who is not a grower, must secure a dealer's certi - ficate, first signing an affidavit that he will buy and sell only nursery stock that has been secured by him under a valid certi - ficate of inspection; every agent or salesman of nursery stock must secure and carry an agent's permit; and every non-resi - dent nurseryman or dealer who wishes to ship nursery stock into Nebraska must secure a permit to ship into the state, by filing with the Department of Agriculture a copy of the certificate issued by the state in which he resides.

            <seg id="p242">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE THE INSECT PEST AND PLANT DISEASE QUARANTINE LAW Under this law an alfalfa weevil quarantine was issued Feb - ruary 25 1927, effective March I, 1927, prohibiting movement into Nebraska of hay and other products liable to carry alfalfa weevil, from infested areas in other states. Due to the spread of the weevil, new areas have been added to those listed in the original quarantine. This was done under Amendment No 1 issued August 5, 192 7, whereby Douglas County, Nevada was included m the quarantine, and Amendment No. 2, issued De - cember I, 1928. whereby Garfield and Mesa Counties in Colo - rado were included in the quarantine. During the past summer a single specimen of the alfalfa weev.1 was found in Nebraska just east of the Wyoming-Nebras - ka state hne and near the Scotts Bluff-Sioux County line. Be - cause of this record it may be necessary in the near future to quarantine parts of these two Nebraska counties. European Corn Borer Law This measure was passed in order that Nebraska might be prepared to fight the European Corn Borer or other highly dangerous pest should they be found in the state. Fortunately it has not been necessary to make use of this law, nor any of the $Z5,UUU appropriation provided with it. However, the corn borer is getting closer to Nebraska every year and it is important that we be prepared to take action when it shall become necessary. Bee Husbandry Law An effort has been made during the last biennium to give the beekeepers of the state some assistance under this law, al - though there has been no provision for financing the work Early ,n 1927 Missouri passed a law prohibiting shipments of honey ,nto the state, unless they were accompanied by certi- </seg>
            <seg id="p243">BIENNIAL REPORT — 1927-1928 ficates of inspection showing that the apiaries in which the honey was produced had been inspected by a duly authorized inspector and found to be free from bee diseases. A number of our bee - keepers had been shipping large quantities of honey into Miss - ouri, and they immediately requested that the Secretary of Agri - culture provide inspection for them in order that they might comply with the Missouri regulations. This was done with the understanding that the beekeepers were to pay the cost of the inspections. • Under this agreement eight- inspections were made during 1927 and seven certificates were issued at a cost of $28.88 to the beekeepers. In 1928 four inspections were made and three certificates were issued at a cost of $4.00 to the beekeepers. In addition to these inspections a number of others were' made in an effort to determine the seriousness of the bee dis - ease situation in Nebraska and to give some assistance to the beekeepers in stamping out American Foul Brood where it was doing the greatest harm. A summary of this work is given below. Apiaries Colonies Apiaries Infected Colonies Infected Colonies Colonies County Inspected A. F. B. Inspected A. F.' B. Treated Destroyed Douglas 16 15 144 64 59 13 Saline 3 3 52 23 Total 19 18 196 87 59 13 These inspections, and reports of disease that have come from various parts of the state, indicate that American Foul Brood, the most serious disease of bees, is wide-spread within the state. Only prompt and efficient use of the most approved control measures can relieve this situation. Nebraska is one of the six states in the nation that are doing very little or nothing to control bee diseases. All the other states are making definite progress toward eradication. Every state bordering on Ne - braska is active in this work and unless we obtain a workable law, this state is liable to become a dumping ground for diseased bees and bee equipment from these states. With adequate pro - tection Nebraska should become one of the leading honey pro - ducing states of .the Union. </seg>
            <seg id="p244">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Pest Eradication Law This is another of our laws having no appropriation or other provision for financing enforcement. However, preliminary steps have been taken to provide control of rodent pests under this law, in co-operation with the Extension Service of the Col - lege of Agriculture and the Bureau of Biological Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture. Much good could be accomplished by such co-operation, in helping to reduce the losses now suffered in the state, from the destructive work of gophers, prairie dogs and other rodent pests.
