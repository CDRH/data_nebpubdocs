            <seg id="p006">6 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT INTRODUCTION This report contains in as concise form as possible the work of the fate Department of Education. This work has to do with the solution educational problems. A careful reading of the report will give one fair idea of what has been accomplished in education in the state. In shaping policies and decisions the department has kept in mind changing conditions, improved methods, and new school interests. Education is not a matter of chance but is the outgrowth of definite planning and consistent effort. The superintendent has had in mind certain goals in rural school betterment, teacher training, and busi - ness efficiency. Every opportunity for furthering these goals has been improved. Nothing yields larger returns for the money and effort expended than the work of the school. The management of the school is the function of the community. Because of this, the community is chiefly responsible for its efficiency. The people get largely the kind of school they want. Interest and intelligence in management must begin with the people. The report sets forth the important contacts between the community and the state. It is hoped the publication of this report will stimulate interest in education. Those charged with the administration of education must always keep in mind that the school exists for the child. The organizing prin - ciple of education is found in what a child needs to know. The develop - ment and training of the child is the end sought. All other factors — teachers, equipment, books, buildings, curricula, supervision — are means to the end. With this aim in view the superintendent has labored to improve physical conditions, to secure more adequate financial sup - port, to make more specific and practical courses of study, and to raise professional standards. The most significant thing in the educational history of the state is the high place held in the literacy of the people. Since 1920 Ne - braska has held continuously among the states the second place in the least per cent of illiteracy, the eradication of which is largely the work of the school. Of such a standing the state can be justly proud. The fine showing is a credit to the school system of the state; and to the administrators, supervisors, and teachers such credit is due. The state superintendent wishes to take this opportunity of expressing his ap - preciation of the splendid cooperative service of all who have contri - buted to the success of education in Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 7 RURAL EDUCATION ELEMENTARY COURSES OF STUDY History of the New Courses "Section 6324. General management. — The district school boards shall have the general care of the schools and shall have the power to cause pupils to be taught in such branches and classified in such grades or departments as may seem best adapted to a course of study which the school board of any county shall establish with the consent and advice of the state superintendent. •••••• "Section 6385. • • • course of study — * * * The course of study for the first eight grades in common schools shall be composed of the following subjects: Agriculture, Bookkeeping, Civics, Drawing, Arithmetic, English Composition, Geography, Grammar, History, Mental Arithmetic, Orthography, Penmanship, Physiology, Reading. The State Superintendent with these subjects for a foundation shall lay out a feasible course of study adapted to rural school conditions keep - ing in view the good of the thorough education for the child in these branches rather than to the completion of the course in a given number of years. * * •" From the above legislative enactments it is plain to see what part the state superintendent has in forming courses of study for the elementary grades. For a long while Nebraska has had a published elementary school curriculum. It is impossible to formulate a curri - culum and expect it to function year after year without certain changes so as to adapt it to needs and conditions. For some years previous to the formulation of the present courses of study a demand for a new elementary curriculum was insistent. A letter was sent out to county superintendents, containing a synopsis of the old courses and asking for opinions upon the classification of the material contained in them. It was felt that the county superintendents who were especially close to the rural school situation would be the most ready to respond and could perhaps do so with greater intelligence than those with a more remote contact. The response was almost unanimous and, as a result, the state superintendent set to work to have new courses organized. It was shown that there was real need for reclassification and re - evaluation of courses and a complete organization on a new basis. The courses were prepared upon the assumption that emphasis should still be placed upon the essentials — reading, language, arithmetic, spelling, and writing. Too many other things have been added to the rural school curriculum by legislative enactment. This was at a time when I. X. Clark, Director </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT many rural teachers were recruited from among those finishing the eighth grade. The subjects added as a part of the elementary courses have no doubt detracted from the more efficient teaching of the es - sentials. It is easily understood, however, that the reorganization was not to be made upon the basis of subject matter alone but was upon the method of procedure, focusing attention upon the child and his activi - ties. The elementary courses are intended as tools for securing an education and will need to differ only in their application to local con - ditions. The letters from the county superintendents brought out a strong endorsement for the use of school and community activities as a basis for instruction. An activity is something the child is set to do which grows out of his needs, the essential of which is purpose or motive. It must be both useful and interesting. It was found that teachers are almost unanimous in - their support of the correlation of subjects as a means of economizing time in education. Very few of the county superintendents questioned the desirability of reducing the number of classes in the country schools. The demand for a good com - bination and alternation plan was urgent. The plan offered is based upon the assumption that a child can read reasonably well and that he can add, subtract, multiply, and divide reasonably well. The objectors to the plan soon assume that certain things other than reading and the fundamental operations in arithmetic are prerequisites in learning. Where these fundamentals are lacking, not only the alternation plan will fail but progress will be impossible under any plan. The new courses of study have been especially prepared with sever' al objects in view: 1. To place emphasis upon the essentials — reading, language, arithmetic, writing, spelling. 2. To provide an organization adapted to rural communities — fewer daily recitations, longer recitation periods, larger classes, and the use of community and school activities as a basis of instruction. 3. To bring about more effective work — through directed study periods, individual instruction, interest and competition, and the intro - duction of socializing factors. 4. To help the teacher — by the use of more up-to-date methods, definite and specific directions, suggested activities, and more time for thorough preparation. The subject matter of the new courses is the same as that of the old except that it is adapted to newer books and newer methods and is pedagogically correct. </seg>

            <seg id="p014">14 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT SOME MISAPPREHENSIONS Some people believe that the state superintendent or the county uperintendent has full authority to put into effect such courses of tudy as may be devised. This is true only insofar that each may use is influence in that direction but neither one has the authority. In Nebraska the local community is largely responsible for the operation and success of the public school system. Rarely, however, does the ommunity realize its responsibility in this matter. This is so general - y true that the teacher is always the chief factor in the success of any rural school. Some people do not understand how to put into effect courses of tudy unless they follow the alternation plan also. This can be very easily arranged, however, by always offering the odd year's work to he odd year class; that is, if it is deemed not feasible to combine fifth and sixth grades under the alternation plan, the odd year's work can be given to the fifth grade and the even year's work to the sixth ;rade. In the same way, seventh and eighth year classes should take he work offered in group IV. It is believed by some that if a school is small it should not follow the alternation plan. While there is no necessity for them to follow the plan, small schools should follow it even if all grades are not represented. Uniformity will work convenience in the county and work no inconvenience upon the small schools. Some object because the course of study is a mere outline and does not go into detail fully enough. Of course, the main idea of any course of study is to set out the limits of the work with suggestions n methods and activities. No course of study should attempt to give the many facts of history, geography, arithmetic, etc. These things must be obtained by reading books, by observing and doing things. Failure has come more often from a lack of understanding of plan of work. No plan will put itself into operation. Where consistent preparatory work has been done, excellent results have generally fol - owed. When alternation is not feasible, it is very easy to teach the grades separately in the subjects where difficulty is encountered. The attempt to alternate should be made, however, wherever possible. Some claim that there is no provision for repetition of a grade be - cause the same phase of the work will not be offered the next year. mmediate repetition is not necessary. A pupil in the fifth grade who has taken the odd year's work and failed may take the even year's work in the same group the next year and the following year take the odd year's work in which he failed. In this way there will be no more loss to the pupil than there would under the old plan. A </seg>
            <seg id="p015">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 15 pupil in group III who has failed in the even year's work but who has finished the odd year's work of his group can repeat it the next year by making an additional class in those subjects in which he has failed. This will not work any greater hardship to him than if he failed under the old plan. Immediate repetition of a grade or sub - jects is not essential. We are not teaching subjects or grades but children. Development, power, and character are the things sought. These do not reside in subjects or grades but in a principle for self - activity, cooperation, and expression. It is claimed that slow pupils need special attention. This is true. The new plan provides for more time for such cases by giving time for directed study and individual instruction. The fact that children are not up to grade is no fault of the al - ternation plan. Some fail in the spirit of the courses of study when they try to follow them without paying attention to the activities suggested upon which to base the instruction. Self-activity in learning is a fundamental principle in education. This principle strongly in - fluences all teaching methods today. Education comes from doing things, from associating with others and cooperating in the affairs of school and home life. The school and home provide sufficient and suitable activities upon which to base the instruction of children. The new elementary courses of study emphasize this important principle in teaching. EIGHTH GRADE EXAMINATIONS Free High School Education "Sec. 6385. High school grade defined— coarse of study — rales of admission. Provision is hereby made for four years of free public high school education for all the youth of this state whose parents or guardians live in public school districts which maintain less than a four-year high school course of study, on the following conditions, to-wit: First — For the purposes of this article all grades above the eighth grade in any public school district of this state shall be deemed high school grades.

Every pupil after taking this course of study may by applying to the County Super - intendent take examination in these subjects, such examination to be held at a time and place designated by the County Superintendent and held by him or his assistant, and at no time shall be held by a teacher any of whose pupils are taking the examination. The ques - tions used in such examination shall be furnished by the State Super - intendent and be the same in all counties each year. The County Super - intendent at the close of such examination shall after ascertaining that the name of the pupil is not written on any examination paper, record each set of papers by name and also by number, after which such papers shall be turned over to the Examining Board who shall consider the papers by number only. Said Board to be appointed by the County Superintendent and shall consist of at least five competent examiners with qualifications at least equal to those required for a second grade county certificate. Each member of said Examining Board shall give careful consideration to the grading of each paper, expense of such grading to be paid out of the general fund of the county, and if such pupils shall have passed with an average of seventy-five per cent in the subjects named in this chapter, no subject less than sixty per cent, the County Superintendent shall issue a certifi - cate stating the pupil is entitled to free high school tuition, providing the ninth grade is not being taught in the district where pupil's par - ents or guardians reside. The course of study for the high school grades shall be the Nebraska High School Manual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction." In compliance with the law, the state superintendent has laid out easible courses of study with the above subjects as a foundation. The purpose of final examinations is to determine the eligibility of pupils to receive free high school instruction in approved high schools. he questions for these examinations are prepared in the office of the tate superintendent and are based upon the elementary courses of tudy. Every attempt has been made to make them reasonable and within the understanding of children who are ready to complete he examinations. As a matter of comparison, below is given a list of the counties of the state with the number of children who passed the eighth grade examinations in 1924, the last examinations which were based upon the old courses of study, and the number who passed the eighth grade examinations in 1926, the examinations following the first full com - pletion of the new elementary courses of study. Lists of the number of pupils in each county who were receiving free high school tuition are also given for both of the years. </seg>

It will be noted that a few more pupils passed the eighth grade examinations in 1926 than in 1924 and that the number of free high school tuition students in 1926 was considerably more than the number in 1924. It is usually perilous to draw conclusions from statistics. It is probably safe, however, to conclude that the new elementary courses of study have not caused a slump in the number of pupils able to pass the final examinations and that after passing they have not been less able to maintain their position in the high school. From reports of county superintendents, the questions for the eighth grade examinations have been more satisfactory during the last two years than in previous examinations. This may be accounted for in three ways: first, the new courses of study are more definite and specific and more easily followed; second, because a greater effort has been made to make the questions conform to the work that the pupils have been doing; and third, on account of the definite outlines it is possible to make reviews more effective. THE RURAL SCHOOL LIBRARY Less than ten cents per pupil is being spent for library books in Nebraska rural schools. The library law does not function here. Four counties spent nothing for library books during the past year. One county spent $9.65 for such books. Cherry County leads with an expenditure of $1,540.25. Every rural school should have a sufficient number of desk dictionaries, one for every three or four pupils who are able to use them, reference and supplementary reading, and a small encyclo - pedia. They should also have books for general reading. These should be suitable for the children of all grades. Until a school has one hundred such books, it cannot be considered adequately sup - plied. </seg>

            <seg id="p021">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 21 STANDARDIZATION OF RURAL SCHOOLS The state superintendent has adopted "standardization" as the most feasible means of rural school betterment. To this end definite standards have been set up outlining the essential phases of construction, care, and equipment of the rural school- The bulletin published in 1923 contained minimum requirements for standardization, the official score card, a general explanation of Nebraska school standards, and a number of floor plans suitable for one and two room country schools. These plans have special refer - ence to size, heating, lighting, seating, blackboard space, basement, and additional rooms for coats, books, and supplies. By this means the number of standard schools has been Increased. Minimum Requirements of Standardization 1. The school term must be at least nine months in length. 2. The teacher must hare at least one year of teaching expert ence. 3. The school grounds must be adequate, well drained, and kept clean. 4. The school building and outbuildings must be adequate, com - ply with the law, and kept in good repair, clean and sanitary. 5. The school must have a good well on the grounds or the us? of one nearby and provide sanitary methods for the use of water. 6. The school must provide single desks of suitable size ad - justed to the needs of the children, and the room must contain at least fifteen square feet of floor space to each child. 7. The schoolroom must be lighted from the left or the left and rear with the window area equivalent to one-fifth of the floor space 8. The heating must be of some approved type and the room must contain 200 cubic feet of air space for each child. 9. The school must be equipped with teacher's desk and chair, globe, maps, blackboards and up-to-date textbooks. 10. Sanitary methods of cleaning must be employed The material from which a school building is made is of littls consequence. The important thing is to secure the proper condi - tions for school work.

            <seg id="p035">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 35 majority of essential items in schoolhouse construction. Nebraska is listed among those that have no laws. At different times attempts have been made to get some of the essential phases of a building code enacted into law, but without success. What advance - ment has been made in Nebraska is the result largely of professional school men and school architects. More attention is being paid to public education and educational practice is gradually reaching a higher plane. This has an improving effect upon the development of school architecture. We, in Nebraska are suffering more from neglect than through any other cause. What we need is to crystallize the best thought on school - house construction into a code or set of laws whereby greater care and intelligence in planning, constructing and equipping school build - ings will be brought about. Your committee is of the opinion that a general statute should be enacted covering the essential points in a building code. This law should be specific enough so as to make unnecessary any rules which might have the effect of law. The law should provide for its adminis - tration through the State Superintendent. This administration should include authority for the approval of all building plans and the ma - terial and the construction of all buildings. The State Superintendent should have authority to appoint a competent architect to pass upon structural plans and construction of buildings and he should also have the authority to appoint a competent educator to approve the plans and buildings as to their availability for school purposes. Your committee believes that the lack of proper housing facilities is most acute in the rural sections of the state. We believe most thoroughly in the consolidation of rural schools .wherever feasible, but at present there is no move in that direction even in communities where consolidation could be effected to advantage. If the present generation of school children is to be benefited something must be done now. For this reason and because urban and rural needs are dissimilar this report is divided into three sections. The first dealing with a code for rural schools, the second with a code for consolidated schools and town schools with not more than ten teachers, and the third with the schools with more than ten teachers. We have the honor to submit our report as follows: A Building Code for Rural Schools. Maud Berry James L. McCrory Isaac N. Clark, Chairman. </seg>

The county superintendent of each county where a county high school is not maintained shall within thirty (30) days after the annual meeting certify to the county board of supervisors or commissioners the number of qualified pupils as provided in Section 6385, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, whose parents or guardians have applied to the county superintendent for free high school tuition privileges, the amount necessary to pay the high school tuition of said pupils for the ensuing school year at the rate of Three Dollars ($3.00) per week or fraction thereof, and a list of school dis - tricts which have been approved by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction as schools qualified to grant free public high school educa - tion to non-resident pupils under the provisions of this Act. Upon re - ceipt of said certificate, the said county board shall levy on all taxable property in the said county a sufficient tax to pay said high school tuition as certified by the county superintendent: Provided said board shall exclude from said levy all the actual valuation on all of the tax - able property of any district in which is maintained an approved four - year high school, shall exclude from said levy three-fourths of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved three-year high school, shall exclude from said levy one-half of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved two-year high school and shall exclude from said levy one-fourth of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved one-year high school </seg>
            <seg id="p039">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 39 The provisions of the free high school education law make it neces - sary that a school offering high school education to non-resident pupils be approved by the state superintendent as a school qualified to grant such education. For the purposes of approval public high schools are divided into two classes: , (1) Accredited High Schools — All four year high schools ac - credited to the University of Nebraska are approved by the state superintendent and are authorized to collect free high school tuition for non-resident pupils. (2) Non-Accredited High Schools — In addition to those ac - credited to the University there are a number of smaller schools offering one, two, three, or four years of high school work. In order to carry out the provisions of the free high school law it is necessary for all non-accredited high schools to make application to the state superintendent for approval. The schools that meet the standards required by the state superintendent are approved as one year, two year, three year, or four year high schools, depend - ing upon the number of high school grades taught, and are eligible to collect free high school tuition for non-resident pupils. The general conditions which the non-accredited high schools must meet are outlined in the bulletin "Nebraska Rural and Village High Schools" and relate especially to courses of study and daily programs, certification and number of teachers, library and reference facilities, laboratory equipment and supplies, sufficient class and recitation rooms, and general sanitary conditions. General Plan Non-accredited high schools in making their application for ap - proval must receive the endorsement of the county superintendent. Correspondence relative to the applications, with suggestions relating to the above requirements, will be given to the director of each school making application for approval. Copies of this- correspondence will be sent to the county superintendent. The applications are immediate - ly checked over and the county superintendent notified as to whether or not the school has been approved. It is the duty of the county super - intendent to file with the county clerk a complete list of all approved schools of the county before the tax levies are made so that the ap - proved schools may be exempted from all or a portion of the high school tax, depending upon the number of years of high school work which they offer. </seg>
            <seg id="p040">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 40 Suggested Changes in Requirements for Approval I Heretofore approval has been made upon the basis of the applica - in from the school and endorsement by the county superintendent, this way the school was approved for both exemption from the high tiool tax and for eligibility to collect free high school tuition money fore, school began in the fall. In some cases this made it difficult secure compliance with the requirements for approval. We believe at it will be better if the approval of high schools consists of two parate parts. Before school begins each school that makes proper plication and whose application has been endorsed by the county perintendent shall be exempted from the high school tax in pro - rtion to the number of high school grades offered. A school's eligi - ity to collect free high school tuition money for non-resident students all be determined after it has been shown that the school has met luirements. The free high school tuition money is not collected until e end of the year. Therefore, the plan as suggested is entirely isible. Schools, therefore, could be approved for exemption by July t and approved for collecting free high school tuition money after e close of the school year. We believe that this is a fairer way of ndling the problem and we strongly urge that such change be made the requirements.

            <seg id="p057">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 57 NEEDED RURAL SCHOOL LEGISLATION Some people say we have too many laws on the statute books now. That may be true and still there may be need for more. We believe that some laws are needed to bring the rural schools from under the handicaps with which they are now confronted. 1. Nebraska needs a law providing for nine months of school for every rural child. Such is the law for the city child, and surely the child in the country deserves as much. Every child in the state should be assured of a nine months' term of schooling. 2. Nebraska needs a law providing for full time attendance in country schools the same as in city schools. Only in this way can the country child have an equal chance with the city child. 3. The present law providing for aid to weak districts should be so amended that every child regardless of his location shall have equal opportunity for an education. 4. A law should be enacted distributing the railroad taxes to all school districts on the basis of the school census. A railroad's earn - ings are derived from all parts of the state and the present taxation law discriminates against districts in which there is no railroad property. 5. Nebraska should have a law providing for competent office assistance for the county superintendent. At the present time espec - ially in the larger counties too much of a superintendent's time is taken up with routine office work which could be done by a competent assistant. The very large counties should have two or more; very small counties might get along with one for half time. All the others need the full time of one assistant. 6. A law providing for competent rural school supervision is a crying need of the country school today. Giving the county superin - tendent office help will give more time for supervision but not nearly sufficient for the most effective work. These supervisors should be chosen on account of their fitness and in proportion to the number of schools in the county. If this law cannot be made compulsory it should be made permissive at least. That will give a county an op - portunity to try it out and prove its value. 7. Nebraska needs a state-wide standardization law regarding rural school buildings. The present standardization requirements are good but to make them effective they need the force of law. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 8. The state library law should be amended. At the present time the law permits ten cents per pupil to be expended for library books. It ought to be made compulsory and the amount increased until an adequate number of books have been purchased. 9. The institute law should be changed as to the time of holding the institute. The institute for rural teachers should be held before school begins. It should be from one to two days in length. Teachers should be allowed full pay for such attendance. In addition teachers should be allowed full pay for time spent in atttendance at the state convention. The above recommendations are made for the purpose of removing discrimination against rural children in the matter of educational opportunity and for a fairer distribution of educational costs. </seg>
            <seg id="p059">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 59 SECONDARY EDUCATION Archer L. Burnham, Director INTRODUCTION "The modern conception of the high school is based upon the idea that the human being during his secondary period of existence is virtually being born again mentally, morally, and to a certain degree physically. The adolescent being is very unstable in his reactions, and presents the greatest possibilities for education through systematic training. The function of the secondary or high school is to provide for every aspect of human development in order to mature the pupil who is passing through the most critical period of his life." 1 The foregoing statement implies certain general guiding principles and assumptions which may be stated in substance as follows: "In the first place, reflective thinking, experimentally tested whenever pos - sible, is essential to progress wherever educational concepts and con - ditions are changing rapidly; in the second place, a knowledge of the secondary school as a social institution in its entirety — the possession of a so-called institutional sense — is necessary in order to give mean - ing to the differentiated aspects and specialized phases involved in a modern school; in the third place, since the secondary school and other phases of environment are reciprocally related, the twofold func - tion of the school is to direct and reflect the interests, activities and ideals already existing, as well as to create new interests, desires, activities and ideals in various community centers; in the fourth place, constant study of principles and revision of practices is necessary on the part of all secondary school people, with the cooperation of as many intelligent lay-members as possible, in order to adapt secondary school work to the rapidly changing needs and demands of our in - dustrial and social environment, as well as to outline educational policies that shall serve as guides to secondary school practice." 2 "If we could clearly foresee what the social, political, economic conditions of the next half century would be or should be, the tasks of the secondary school, while still very complicated, would be definite. But education is only one of many influences that control the out - come of our experiment in democracy. The secondary school cur- 1 Nutt — Principles of Teaching High School Pupils, page 75. 2 Clement — Principles and Practices of Secondary Education, pages 21-22. </seg>

To go on with the experiment of universal secondary education presents problems that are all but overwhelming, and it is easy to doubt its feasibility. But it is obvious to all thinking men that there can be no turning back. Democratic social and political life can scarcely survive, it certainly cannot make desired progress, without universal purposeful education of all the adolescents of the com - munity."* These three quotations state tersely the type of thing that should &gt;e included in a report on Secondary Education, but these statements are so inclusive as to make it impossible to include all that they mply.

Drs. Strayer and Haig2 found this formula to correlate highly with actual division of elementary and secondary school costs as kept by boards. In Nebraska the elementary and secondary school costs, ac - cording to the division by the Salary-Ratio formula correlates highly with the division actually kept by a few of the boards on their records. - ; According to the division of elementary and secondary school costs given in Table No. 19, the secondary school costs are far in excess of the elementary school costs. It is to be noted too that the differ - ence between these costs is greater in the case of the larger schools than the smaller. There are a number of reasons why the hisch school costs are so much larger than the elementary school costs. •From a Master's Thesis— "Financing Education in Nebraska"— University of Nebraska, by 1.

Naturally, the standards urged upon boards by accrediting agencies or accepted because of a desire to be on a certain list are much higher than the more voluntary standards for the grades have been. The stimulus to higher standards which has played such a large part in advancing standards in high schools has not been felt to any great extent in the grades. Grade school teachers' certificates, especially those earned outside institutions, have had very little relation to the professional preparation of the teacher. The cost per pupil in the high school has been increased too by the small classes. The tendency of pupils to drop out of school be - fore the high school is reached results in smaller classes and a con - sequent higher cost per pupil. Equipment costs are higher in the high school. Boards of Education and patrons have a tendency to regard ad - vanced work as more difficult to teach than that of the grades. The attitude that most anyone can teach the little ones is not uncommon amongst boards. Naturally, feeling that the work of the upper grades and the high school is more difficult, they are willing to pay more for it. They are not only willing to pay more for a better trained teacher but are also willing to provide more equipment for such teaching. There is more of a community pride in having a good high school than a good grade school. This pride in the high school is in part due to the advertising of the high school through its activities and also to the tendency to bid for students outside the district. In taking such pride, boards often add courses which the demand from students would not justify. Another factor in the excessive cost of high school over that of grade education is to be found in the fact that the traditional high school course has taken many of its standards from the college class - room. Equipment and the time given to subjects are so patterned. The grade schools have been more nearly like the rural schools. This factor has especially affected the equipment of the classrooms. </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF NEBRASKA SUPERINTENDENTS* The office, superintendent of schools, is a relatively new profession. Beginning in Massachusetts with control by the "town meeting", school administration and supervision has passed through various stages. The "school committee", or "school board", or "board of education" has gradually changed from a combined administrative, supervisory, and legislative body to one primarily legislative, while the actual executing of its policies has become quite generally delegated to the superintendent of schools. Dr. William W. Theiseni draws the following conclusions from his study: 1. That a board of education's function is first of all, (a) To choose a professionally trained chief executive, centralize authority and responsibility for results in him, and expect him to initiate all policies, (b) To debate such proposed policies with him in the light of definite objective evidence and to provide the legislation necessary to secure efficient results. 2. That a board of education need wait for no precedent to adopt a form of administrative organization in which the profes - sional superintendent is made the administrative leader and chief executive of the system, and in which the board itself serves in an advisory and legislative capacity and acts only through its chief executive. The development of the superintendency as a profession is further summarized by Dr. John Cayce Morrison2 as follows: (a) Responsibility for local administration of schools was first vested in municipal or civil officers who had been chosen primarily for the performance ot other duties. (b) Gradually, as schools developed, responsibility for direc - tion and supervision of instructional activities was vested in of - ficials whose sole public responsibility was limited to the schools. (c) These lay boards were given power to delegate their responsibility to small committees or a committee of one. (d) This one individual developed into the professionally trained executive known in every state as the city school super - intendent. (e) As society adds more and more responsibility to the public school system a need of a better trained and more respon - sible administrative leadership of schools is recognized. (f) This responsible leadership should extend to all phases of school activity. All dual responsibility should be eliminated. •From A Master'* Thesis, University of Nebraska, by Evan L.

            <seg id="p065">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 65 (g) The laws governing school administration should be formulated to build up this responsible leadership and to safe - guard the public interest. Dr. George D. Strayer3 gives the most modern accepted relationship of the superintendent to the board of education and their respective obligations thus: The right relationship between boards of education and super - intendents of schools will come to exist when boards of education cease to think of their function as having anything to do with the execution of the policies that they adopt; when they scru - tinize carefully each proposal brought before them by the super - intendent of schools, and having passed upon it stand fast; when men who sit upon boards of education seek as earnestly to dis - cover the best man available for the job of superintendent of schools as they would were they searching for a president of a corporation in which they are interested. Cubberly-t advocates that the minimum professional preparation, if any great future success is to be expected, be as follows: an A. B. degree and a year of graduate work, making an advanced study of educational problems. Preliminary preparation should be broad and should open up permanent interests in the field of music and art, literature, history, science and human welfare. These are needed for breadth and understanding. Future success as the head of a school system will, to a rather large degree, depend upon an intelligent understanding of the scientific and industrial world, broad human sympathies, and ability to meet people of culture and refinement on their own plane. Five or six years as a teacher or principal with a small superintendency at thirty, and a large and important position at forty is about what a young man should be content to expects. It is the purpese of this study to determine to what extent Nebraska superintendents approach standards that have been set up by different authorities as desirable in regard to professional training, educational experience, cultural and technical training, and other factors that may contribute to their success. It is hoped to establish the status of the Nebraska superintendent in the various phases that constitute his total preparation. An attempt will be made to show some trends in prepar - ation, experience and tenure. Selection and Classification of Data. In this study the superintendents in the accredited high schools 3.

            <seg id="p071">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 71 Summary. Rural teaching has been a significant item in the educational ex - perience of Nebraska Superintendents. Men in the larger systems have had much more elementary school experience than the younger men in the smaller schools. It is probable that the administrative principles learned by such experience are now being taught to the younger men in our normal schools and teacher's colleges. Experience as a high school teacher or principal has been an im - portant factor in the superintendent's educational experience. More men are going directly into a superintendency from college than was formerly the case. There is a gradual and consistent rise in the number of years taught and in the age of superintendents from the small to the large systems. Using the success and advancement of the superintendents in the large systems as criteria it seems desirable that the prospective super - intendent should have experience as a class room teacher for the pur - pose of becoming familiar with educational problems. </seg>

The median superintendent has taught four years before obtaining his degree. The median superintendent who is anxious to secure promotion will increase his chances of doing so by increasing his training. The academic training of Nebraska superintendents has been broad and comprehensive with especial emphasis on English and Languages.

            <seg id="p074">74 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT THE DUTIES OF HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPALS IN THE STATE OF NEBRASKA* The Purpose of the Study Charles C. Tlllinghasti, Principal of the Horace Mann School for Boys, Teachers College, Columbia University, says: I wish that I had known, before I became a principal, just what are the duties of the principal as contrasted with or supple - menting those of the superintendent or school board. I know that my work would have been more efficient as a beginning principal if there had been in my mind a clearer con - ception of not only what my superintendent and board did expect of me, but also that which, in the nature of the situation, they had a right to expect. Albert B. Meredith, in his article on "Why High School Principals Succeed and Why They Pail", says: A second reason for a principal's failure is to be found in his lack of keen sense of relative values regarding his duties, and the time at his disposal as an administrator, inspector or ap - praiser, and as a supervisor. The main purpose of this study is to find out how much time the Nebraska high school principals devote to their various duties. Method of Procedure The method of attack in this study is, in a certain degree, quite different from the methods used by investigators in similar studies. Most of the studies examined on principalships revealed the tact that questionnaires were used, but they were of the type which measured subjectively. Questionnaires were used which influenced the individual's answer, in fact, the answers to be given were many times suggested. Considering these facts, the work-sheet type of questionnaire was used in this study, thereby avoiding the above criticism. By using this type of questionnaire the element of suggestion was reduced to a minimum. No attempt was made to classify the duties until all the data were collected, because it was felt that since the rapid expansion of the high school in the number of pupils and in the scope of its ac- •From A Master's Thesis, University of Nebraska, by Carl Theodore Feelhaver, int. 1.

Selection and Classification of Schools Holland R. John 1 , in his study "The Principal's Load", says: One of the most serious criticism which can be made against recent articles on the duties of the high school principal is that they have failed to recognize the fact that the principal of the small high school is in a distinct class by himself. This is very serious when one stops to consider that three-fourths of the high schools in the United States have an enrollment of less than one hundred pupils and that the median high school in the United States has an enrollment of fifty pupils. When the principal of the large high school alone is considered, the major part of the problem of the high school principal is neglected. In order to make the results more applicable to the different size high schools and for 'Convenience in handling the data, the schools were classified on the basis of their enrollment for 1925-26 Nebraska Educational Directory. A five fold Classification of schools was adopted, as follows: (1) Schools with enrollment of less than 100. (2) Schools with enrollment of 100 to 199. (3) Schools with enrollment of 200 to 299. (4) Schools with enrollment of 300 to 499. (5) Schools with enrollment of 500 or more. 1.

            <seg id="p079">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 79 CURRICULUM TENDENCIES* As Shown by Graduation Credits High School Graduates in the State That interest in the high schools of Nebraska has increased greatly within the past two decades is well shown by a comparison of the num - ber of graduates of accredited schools in the periods studied. In the groups of larger schools, the 11 schools with enrollments of over 150 pupils in 1903-04 had a total of 273 graduates. The 12 schools with enrollments of over 200, 1913-14, totaled 587 graduates, while in 1923-24, the 23 schools with enrollments of over 250 pupils had a total of 1764 graduates. Among the schools of medium size, the group of 22 in 1903-04 with enrollments of 90 to 150 pupils had a total of 336 graduates. The 39 schools included in the group in 1913-14, with enrollments of 100 to 200, totaled 998 graduates, and the 109 schools, 1923-24, enrolling 100 to 250 pupils had a total of 3208 graduates. The following totals existed among the relative groups of smaller schools: 1903-04, 32 schools with enrollments of under 90 pupils totaled 241 graduates; 1913-14, 130 schools with enrollments of less than 100 pupils totaled 1295 graduates; 1923-24, 275 schools enrolling less than 100 pupils had a total of 2891 graduates. Regarding the total number of graduates, in 1903-04, 850 pupils graduated from the 65 schools of the study (Fig. 1.). In 1913-14, a total of 2S80 graduated from 181 accredited high schools, and in 1923-24, 7763 were graduated from 407 accredited schools, an actual increase of 813 per cent over 1903-04. A comparison of the number of graduates from the three groups of schools in the different periods is also of interest. In the larger school groups, an actual increase was made in 1913-14 (Fig. 2.) of 115 per cent, while in 1923-24, an actual increase of 509 per cent was made over the total in 1903-04. The medium groups show the follow - ing results: 1913-14, an actual increase of 197 per cent; 1923-24, an increase over the total of 1903-04 of 854 per cent. The results from the groups of smaller schools are: 1913-14, an actual increase of 395 per cent; 1923-24, an actual increase of 1099 per cent. •From A Matter's Thesis, University of Nebraska, by S.

            <seg id="p080">80 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT tAs will be shown in the tabulation which follows, while the number high school graduates has increased throughout the United States, proportional increase has been much larger in Nebraska. Table 1. Graduates of High Schools A part of this increase is due to the operation of the free attendance aw in the state. Another large factor is, probably, the great change hat has been taking place in the program of studies. Subjects are being offered that are practical, and which actually appeal to the child of today. Thus he is privileged to include in his curriculum of tudies those which are of particular interest to him. Developments in the Program of Studies The changes which have taken place in the subjects offered in the programs of studies in American secondary schools during the past century have been both numerous and pronounced. As the possibility of broadened curricula is increasing, that in - dividual needs may be met, we find that the relative prominence of the subjects of study that are offered in the secondary school programs has changed greatly, with a growing tendency toward courses which may be of practical value through their appeal to interest, and courses with definite aims. English in the Curricula English is without doubt the most generally studied subject in the high school program of studies in Nebraska. Starting early In the nineteenth century as a contribution through the academy to the public high school, Inglis states that its study has constantly Increased in the American secondary school until at the present time it is most prominent in the program.! 1 All references marked 1 are made to "Principles of Secondary Education", by Year 1900 1904 1910 1914 1920 1924 No. of Graduates in Nebraska .. 8,816 877 1,165 2,212 2,942 6,040 % of Increase..

            <seg id="p081">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 81 The language is, of course, a constantly needed "tool" or medium of expression with the world about for everyone and, as Clement sug - gests, it is "naturally supposed to be in all high school programs of study."- It is a regular university requirement and credits in it have been earned by each high school graduate included in the investigation. In the first period, of which the graduates of the school year 1903-04 were studied, four semesters of English were required for entrance by the University of Nebraska. This provision remained virtually constant until the number was changed to six semesters, in 1922. A year of normal training English, as grammar and reading, may now be included in the six points. English has, in recent years, shown a gain in the number of credits earned by Nebraska high school graduates. This has probably been due, in part, to the increase in the University entrance require - ment. This gain has been made among schools of all sizes. More students are choosing English as an elective subject. Nebraska schools are apparently functioning well in imparting to their pupils a proper knowledge of the mother tongue, that they may be worthy members of society. Foreign Languages Throughout the history of secondary education, Inglis remarks, the study of ancient languages and literature has been unbroken. i The fact that "Latin occupied without interruption a more prominent place than any other high school subject in the curriculum during the nine - teenth century" is also asserted by Clement.? The popularity of Greek, although never great, has tended to decline since about 1900. 3 The study of modern languages, however, was of no considerable extent until after the middle of tbe nineteenth century, French being first introduced. Spanish soon followed and was studied in addition to French. Following by a quarter of a century, the study of German was soon given an impetus which caused its popularity to exceed that of French.* In Nebraska, foreign language has for many years been listed among the subjects required for entrance to the University. Previous to 1916, six points were specified; since that time, an alternative arrangement has been allowed, whereby six points of foreign language and four points of mathematics are acceptable, or four points or foreign language and six points of mathematics. 2 Clement, I. A., Curriculum Making in Secondary Schools, p. 2. 2 Clement, J. A., Toe. cit., p. 383. 3 Inglis, A., ibid., p. 447. 4 Dement, J. A., ibid pp. 397-98. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">82 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT It seems highly probable that Greek has practically ceased to exist as a high school subject and German may have the same status. Public sentiment will probably prevent it from again attaining much prom - inence. Latin still retains its place as the most prominent language in the curricula of high school pupils in Nebraska. In the larger schools it has decreased somewhat in the percentage of graduates. In the medium and smaller schools, it has not decreased in prominence. The great increase in the study of French and Spanish is probably due to the elimination of the study of German. French, Latin and Spanish are the prominent languages included in the curricula of high school pupils. Bohemian and Swedish were probably included in the school program as a matter of local sentiment, based on the descent of many of the inhabitants. Mathematics The study of mathematics has been in prominence next to that of he classical languages throughout the history of secondary school education in the United States, i Haying been introduced into the Latin grammar schools and the academies during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, by the last quarter of the century both algebra and geometry were generally included in college entrance require - ments.- Inglis states that every college, in 1912, which had any requirement other than English specified algebra and geometry.* However, within the last decade or two there has been a tendency to reduce materially the comparative amount of time given to mathe - matics, due to recognition of the fact that many high school pupils who do not intend to go on to college and university training have other needs. 4 The programs of study of Nebraska high schools have included five subjects in the mathematics group, — Algebra, arithmetic, plane geometry, solid geometry, and trigonometry. In 1913-14 and 1923 - 24, practically all schools combined the credits given in plane and solid geometry. Only a very small number did so in 1903-04. Al - though a small number of omissions of credits were found in the source data, undoubtedly all graduates in 1903-04 and 1913-14 and practically all in 1923-24 had earned credits in algebra, and also in geometry. 2 Clement, J. A., loc. cit., p. 356. 3 Inglis, ibid. p. 482. 4 Clement, ibid., p. 357. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 83 Algebra is apparently declining somewhat in its importance as an item in the Curricula of Nebraska high school pupils. The tend - ency during the past two decades has been to decrease the percent - age of pupils studying three semesters of algebra. A tendency is developing to offer four semesters of algebra in a number of Nebras - ka high schools. The percentage of pupils studying geometry has had no material change. Although still maintained in the program of studies, trigonom - etry has never attained a place of importance in the curricula ot pupils. Algebra and geometry are the prominent mathematics subjects included in the curricula of Nebraska high school pupils. Natural Sciences Throughout the past century, natural sciences have been prom - inent in secondary school programs of studies. Their inclusion, according to Inglis, was "in answer to the interest in and the devel - opment of the natural sciences during the first half of the nineteenth century."i The first regular recognition of a natural science for college entrance occurred in 1870, when physical geography was included by both Michigan and Harvard. The Committee of Ten, in 1892-1893, attempted to standardize the secondary school work in the natural sciences. 2 This effort was successful to a great extent, but the report supported the study of several such subjects which have since been discarded as separate studies, including astronomy and geology, i During the past two decades, natural sciences have occupied an important place in the curricula of Nebraska high school pupils. This is probably due both to public interest and to the requirement of botany and physics for the certification of teachers, and college en - trance requirements. The study of botany has shown a decrease in the past decade which may be accounted for by the change in normal training rec - ommendations, as well as those concerning vocational agriculture. The study of chemistry has shown a gradual decrease. 1 Inglis, ibid., p. 507. 2 Report, Committee of Ten. loc. cit., pp. 46-47. </seg>
            <seg id="p084">8 4 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT During the last two periods studied, 1913-14 and 1923-24, phys - iology has maintained approximately the same status. General Science, which first appeared in the study in 1923-24, has shown extreme popularity for a new subject. Physics still con - tinues as a natural science subject of much importance. During the past decade, agriculture has exhibited practically no change, regardless of favorable legislation on the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917. Social Sciences History and geography were included in the earliest high school programs of studies. Geography was soon relagated in most part to the elementary school, but various forms of history were given a permanent place in the secondary school program. i As to the status of the social science subjects in Nebraska high school curricula, among the groups of larger schools in both 1903-04 and 1913-14, history, economics and civics were the only members of this group of subjects in which credits were presented by graduates. American history and European history were studied by most pupils in both periods, civics by practically all in 1903-04 and by 65.41 per cent in 1913-14. Economics, too, experienced a decline, apparently, between these periods, 28.57 per cent of the graduates in 1903-04 having earned credits in that subject, and only 9.88 per cent in 1913-14. Both American and European history maintained their status in 1923-24, and economics had risen to a percentage of 25.96. Sociology having been Introduced in the meantime, 17.91 per cent of the graduates in 1923-24 had earned one semester of credit in that subject. In the number of graduates having credits in American and European history, the groups of medium and smaller schools showed a similarity to the larger school groups in all three of the periods investigated. In 1923-24, 6.72 per cent of the graduates from the medium group had earned credits in sociology and 6.49 per cent, from the smaller group. A trace of English history as a study separate from European history was shown only in that group, a percentage of only .75. In the medium school group, 1903-04, economics had a per - centage of 12.79. This declined to 2.10 in 1913-14, but rose to 10.19 in 1923-24. Of the graduates from the smaller school groups, 5.80 per cent had earned economics credits in 1903-04, 5.55 in 1913-14, and 19.92 in 1923-24. </seg>
            <seg id="p085">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 85 Among the individual schools studied, similar tendencies, as well as similar subjects, were presented. Economics was not presented for credit by graduates in Central High School, 1923-24, but social science was Included as a subject of study by 34.50 per cent. Similar omissions were made by both South Omaha and Lincoln at this time, but the subject matter was probably included in other social subjects. Table I* garding tendencies in the curricula of pupils will be mentioned: The study of civics has tended to increase during the past decade. European history has maintained practically the same status during the past two decades in the percentage of credits earned by graduates. In 1923-24, more emphasis was apparent on two semesters of the subject and relatively less on three and four semesters. Economics has shown a considerable increase in the past decade. American history has increased somewhat in importance during the past two decades. "From chart published in the Nebraska Educational Journal, November, 1936. Studied Am.

            <seg id="p086">86 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Recently instituted subjects, as modern problems, problems of democracy, and citizenship, seem to have gained little favor. The subject matter of such courses has probably been generally incorpo - rated in other well established courses. Practical Arts and Vocational Subjects Although the public high school was early characterized by attempts to provide suitable secondary education for those who were not to receive a college education, they received little support. Survey - ing and navigation were taught in 1821, bookkeeping by 1823, "com - merce" before 1838, stenography by 1849 and sewing in 1840. The courses offered, however, were extremely formal in nature and de - tached from practical or vocation application. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, increased, although still very limited, attention was paid to commercial arts and to manual arts. About the beginning of the twentieth century, the need of an enriched and broadened program of studies was felt, to meet the demands of modern scope of practical and vocational arts in the secondary school have been greatly extended. Of all the Nebraska high schools included in our investigation, only one, Omaha High School, had graduates in 1903-04 presenting credits in this group of subjects, 22.97 per cent, in manual training. In the succeeding periods, five general divisions may be made in the lists of subjects, (1) commercial, (2) normal training, (3) home economics, (4) manual arts, and (5) agricultural. The last division is very limited, as only those subjects which could be identified as apparently vocational have been included. Others have been studies in the preceding chapter on natural sciences. Among schools of all sizes in Nebraska, commercial subjects have attained a prominence exceeded by no others in the practical and vocational arts group. Although showing some decrease in the last decade, normal train - ing must still be recognized as an important subject. Both manual training and home economics have shown an Increase in the number of credits earned by graduates in the last decade. The percentage of graduates having earned credits in many of the subjects listed, especially in 1923-24, is extremely limited. The interest so rapidly developed in practical and vocational arts subjects is indicative of the public's demand for such work. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 87 Aesthetic Arts Throughout the nineteenth century, instruction in the aesthetic arts was never effective in the secondary school. Even in the twentieth century, it must be recognized that the American secondary school minimizes the aesthetic training of pupils. 1 Investigation of the status of this group of subjects in Nebraska high schools, as shown by credits earned by graduates, shows that they have been included in the program of studies within the past two decades. None were listed in 1903-04. In regard to curriculum tendencies in aesthetic arts, the following facts are presented: Aesthetic arts are slowly attaining a place of prominence in sec - ondary school education in Nebraska. Arts has been included in the program of studies of each school group within the past decade. Music is maintaining its place as the most prominent subject in this group. Physical Education Physical training appeared in American secondary education early in the nineteenth century. After the United States Military Academy had been established at West Point in 1802, military training was introduced to some extent in a few public schools. About 1825, German gymnastics were introduced for a short period into some secondary schools. The Civil War caused a revival of interest in military training but it was again supplanted by gymnastics of a formal nature. i In the high schools of Nebraska, physical education has never received wide recognition as a basis for earning credits toward graduation. From the study of the status of physical education subjects in the curricula of Nebraska high school graduates, the following facts are evident : Physical education is increasing to a limited extent in Nebraska high schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p088">88 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT Physical training holds the most prominent position among the subjects of this group. Military drill has not been included to an appreciable extent in the curricula of Nebraska high school graduates. The addition of other physical education subjects warrants the continued development of interest in that division of the program of studies. Summary The relative prominence of subjects of study that have been in - cluded in the curricula of graduates of secondary schools of Nebraska has been shown in the preceding chapters. Throughout the study, the increase in the number of such subjects has been particularly noticeable. The groups of subjects included as practical and voca - tional arts, aesthetic arts, and physical education subjects have de - veloped almost entirely within the two decades investigated. The number of pupils who have retained English and mathe - matics subjects in their curricula has, during that term of years, remained quite constant. This has probably been due to college en - trance requirements and to the interest which is developing in the value of a proper study of our language. b Social science has experienced somewhat of a revival within the t decade. Public opinion following the World War may account this condition. The great increase in the interest shown in practical and vocational arts would indicate that public sentiment is responding to the efforts made by secondary school education to develop such courses in line with our social changes. It seems probable that their future status will include further development. In general, the smaller schools have responded in only a limited degree to the incorporation of the newer subjects in their programs of studies, which has resulted in lessened variety in the curricula of their pupils. This has probably been due both to the limited number of teachers and the failure of these schools to work out a means of remedying the situation, that equal opportunities may be provided for their pupils that are enjoyed by those of larger schools. Alterna - tion and, perhaps, correlation of various subjects are suggested as possible solutions of the difficulty. Finally, if the main objectives of education! are to be achieved by the secondary schools, and health, worthy home membership and </seg>

It is hoped that this deficiency will be overcome by school authorities and the high school pupils given a full opportunity to realize the broadened objectives demanded by modern civilization. </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT RELATION BETWEEN TEACHER'S PREPARATION AND SUBJECTS TAUGHT* Canicular Demands Upon the Teacher Consideration of the demands upon the teacher made by the aver - age curriculum includes first, the range of subject matter — the differ - ent subjects one teacher is expected to present. The question then arises whether this range is universal, whether the needs of the large and the small school are similar in this respect. If the range is shown to vary with the size of school, will the majority of teachers meet conditions of the larger or smaller schools, and is it necessary for all teachers to meet the more exacting demands in their preparation? Finally, are their constant and frequently recurring combinations of subjects desired which will aid the teacher in planning her preparation? 1. What Is the Range of Subjects? By range of subjects is meant the number of subjects that an in - structor is required to teach. This does not mean the number of classes, but the number of different types of work. The daily programs were used in determining this. Tabulation is according to the two classifications based on the differing interpretation of the term •subject."

In tabulating the data, the reports were divided into four groups on a teacher basis, as follows: Group I, including reports from all schools employing fewer than five teachers. Group II, schools employing five or more than five, but fewer than ten, teachers. Group III, schools employing ten or more than ten, but fewer than twenty, teachers. Group IV, schools employing twenty or more teachers. '"Subjects" are classified as follows: English: composition, rhetoric, American and English literature, dramatic read - ing, debating, public speaking, journalism. Foreign Language: French, German, Latin, Spanish, Bohemian. Science: general science, chemistry, physics, zoology, biology, physiography. physiology, hygiene. Mathematics: algebra, geometry, trigonometry. History: ancient, mediaeval, and modern history, political science, economics, all types of civics. Commercial Subjects: bookkeeping, typewriting, shorthand, spelling, penman - ship, commercial geography, commercial law, commercial arithmetic, salesman - ship. Industrial Subjects: manual training, mechanical drawing, auto mechanics, radio, telegraphy, agriculture, home economics, domestic art, cooking, sewing. Music: chorus work, music appreciation, harmony, singing, instrumental music. Normal Training: methods, all grade reviews, professional training. Physical Education: all types of athletics and gymnasium work. From Table I, based on the broad interpretation of the term "subject," it is shown that the majority of teachers are teaching two or more subjects. It must be borne in mind that this classification includes all courses similar in nature under one heading. 2 Does the Size of the School Determine the Range of Subjects? Comparison of the figures listed under the groups shows a steady decrease in the range of subjects allotted to each teacher from Group I to Group IV. As the size of the school increases, the number of subjects per teacher decreases. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">92 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT If the programs for the entire year had been used in this study, the findings of the tables would have been accentuated, especially in Group I. In many courses, for instance in science, one subject, say general science, is taught the first semester and a different one is taught the second semester. Thus the burden of the teacher In a small school is even greater than is apparent from the tables. 8. Are the Majority of Teachers in the Large or in the Small High School? Table I shows 694 teachers in Group I and 845 in Group II, 287 in Group III, and 372 in Group IV. There are more teachers in schools employing from five to ten teachers than in any other group. There are 1539 teachers in schools with a faculty of less than ten, whereas there are only 659 in schools with a faculty of more than ten. More than 70 percent of the total number of Nebraska's high school teachers are in the smaller schools. This fact must be taken into account by those planning to enter the teaching profession in the state of Nebraska. 4. Should Prospective Teachers Prepare for the Small High School? It has been pointed out that more than seven-tenths of all high school teachers are in the smaller high schools. Therefore, only a small percentage of the prospective teachers may expect to secure positions in larger schools. This fact is accentuated when we take into account the length of tenure of office in the larger school systems. It is a safe assumption that every teacher must, for a time at least, teach in a small high school since experience is usually a prerequisite for securing a position in a larger school. Whether the small high school is the ultimate goal of the young teacher, or merely a stepping stone to the larger school, should make very little difference in her preparation. In the first case, she will wish the best equipment possible and in the second, her best recom - mendation for the desired position is a record of satisfactory work In the small high school. In either case, she must prepare in a number of subjects. The difficulty arises, however, in correlating or making a logical grouping of the subjects so as to make preparation more efficient and less complex. Conditions existing in Nebraska high schools offer no guarantee that such correlated preparation will meet the demands. 5. Is There Any Standardization of Subject Combination? Three subjects, history, mathematics, and English, were used as </seg>
            <seg id="p093">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 93 constants in determining whether or not there is any standardization of subject combination. In using history as a constant, 205 different combinations were found. Where teachers were teaching two subjects 21 combinations were found; where they were teaching three subjects, 85 combinations were found; and where they were teaching four or more subjects, almost as many different combinations as there were teachers. Below is a list of the combinations with history as the constant, which were found to occur five or more times: History and English. History and Mathematics. History and Latin. History and Normal Training. History and Home Economics. History and Agriculture. History and Physics. History and Manual Training. History and Commercial Subjects. History and General Science. History and Music. Among those who were teaching three subjects, the following combinations were found: History, English and Latin. History, English and Normal Training. History, Mathematics and Normal Training. History, Mathematics and Latin. History, Mathematics and General Science. History, Mathematics and Physics. History, Latin and Normal Training. History, General Science and Physics. History, Mathematics and English. History, English and Home Economics. History, English and Music. History, English and General Science. History, Normal Training and Home Economics. History, General Science and Home Economics. Using Mathematics as the constant, 177 different combinations were found, which further emphasizes the utter lack of standardization in combinations of subjects. When English was used as the constant, 155 different combina - tions were found. This is conclusive evidence that bo far there has been no attempt to standardize combinations of subjects. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">94 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Teacher training institutions should attempt to standardize some logical combinations of subjects. Superintendents should know these combinations and should strive to assign teachers only such combina - tions. Standardization of subject combination should probably be based upon the comparative demand for the different subjects. What is the Comparative Demand for the Different Subjects? TABLE III The number of Schools in Which the Various Subjects Are Taught: It is evident, from the facts shown in Table III, that English, Mathematics, and History are taught in all high schools. Latin is taught in most of them, being found in 385 out of the 402 schools studied. Modern languages are taught comparatively little. Of the sciences, physics was the most in demand, while general science followed closely. The so-called vocational subjects are increasing in importance but, as yet, are not offered in the majority of schools. Clearly, then, every high school teacher should prepare to present at least two of the subjects that are demanded. It is evident from the facts shown in Table III that it would be unwise to specialize in modern languages for the purpose of teaching in the high schools of Nebraska. Perhaps the preparation of a high school teacher should include survey courses in history, English, and mathmetics and a choice of preparation in physics, general science, normal training and vocational subjects. Although the present tendency is to replace Latin by modern languages, a knowledge of the fundamentals of Latin would seem highly desirable since the chart shows that 385 out of 402 schools studied, offered it. Such survey courses will give the pros - pective teacher a minimum equipment to meet the demands. At the present time, the majority of our teachers have little or no special training for fully half of the work expected of them.

            <seg id="p095">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 95 THE TEACHER'S PREPARATION 1. What Is Preparation? The word "preparation" as here used, means knowledge of subject matter, and the necessary skills relative to the subject. Richness of knowledge in one's particular field is an indispensable factor of successful teaching. The technique of using this knowledge so as to bring about desirable reactions on the part of the child is equally, if not more, important than the informational side of the teacher's preparation. The responsibility of training our youth is often placed in the hands of teachers not well informed in the subjects they are handling and not well trained in the philosophy and psychology of bringing about desirable reactions in the children. The work of the teacher is fundamental in the maintenance of our civilization, still the facts show that this trust is often put in the hands of those not well trained for it through lack of proper preparation. 2. What Should Be Considered as Adequate Preparation? In Nebraska blanket certificates are issued to college graduates who have met certain pedagogical requirments, permitting them to teach any high school subject. Such laws tend to make superintend - ents careless of the type of preparation of their teaching staffs and allow them to impose unreasonable tasks upon teachers for which they are not adequately prepared. It is reasonable to expect that no teacher should be permitted to teach a subject unless she has had some advanced work in the particular field in which she is to teach. A minimum requirement of at least six semester hours in all subjects taught, should (and this surely is not unreasonable) be required. S. Do Nebraska High School Teachers Have Adequate Preparation?

            <seg id="p097">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 97 IV, which includes the largest school systems of Nebraska, there are 218 classes with inadequately prepared instructors. Examination of the total number of class periods taught in that group calls attention to the fact that 2372 periods of instruction, which constitutes one-fourth of all the instruction in the high schools, are conducted by teachers who have had little or no preparation for that particular work. If the high schools of Nebraska are to realize the objectives of education, developing all the desirable potentialities of the child, they must have teachers who are prepared to discharge this responsi - bility. Recommendations The following remedial suggestions based upon the foregoing data are offered: (1) There should be an attempt to standardize some logical combin - ation of subjects. (2) Teacher training institutions should present a curriculum that offers survey courses in English, mathematics and history. (3) Students should be so guided that specialization in one or more subjects will be accompanied by general survey courses in one or more other subjects. (4) Superintendents should not require teachers to teach subjects for which they have had little or no preparation. (5) The certification system, should require at least six hours of preparation for the teaching of a subject, plus a number of hours on a graduated scale depending on the length of time that the subject is taught and on the difficulty of the subject, up to a minimum of 12 hours. </seg>
            <seg id="p098">98 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUPIL LOAD IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS* In order to determine the present practices relative to the pupil load in Nebraska Secondary Schools, a special study was made of ninety (90) of the leading high schools in Nebraska. These schools all belong to the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and, it may safely be assumed, are representative of the best and most progressive school practices in Nebraska. kData were collected from special detailed reports from these ools and by a questionnaire covering the present school year. These vided a body of fact on which the study was based. The investigation of these schools, which include a total enrollment of 27,344 pupils and a teaching force of 1200, was facilitated by a grouping according to the size of the schools. This grouping which added to the convenience of tabulation and the effectiveness of study was as follows: Group I. Schools having four to ten teachers. Group II. Schools having ten to twenty teachers. Group III. Schools having twenty or more teachers. t Throughout the study the normal load will be considered the &gt;rmal amount of work to be carried for credit for the average . or edium student. This amounts to four unit courses or the equivalent. A unit course is to be considered as a course covering an academic year that shall include in the aggregate not less than the equivalent of one hundred twenty sixty-minute hours of class room work. Two hours of shop or laboratary work are considered equivalent to one hour of class room work. How Does the Pupil I&lt;oad Affect the Quality of Work Done in Nebraska High Schools as Indicated by the Grades? Dr. Dicksoni states that an investigation in an Oakland school showed that pupils with five, and in some cases six, subjects make better records than the average pupil who is carrying only four sub - jects, in that investigation of 427 pupils (out of a total enrollment of 2100) registered for extra work, it was found that 31 per cent of all the marks received by the five-subject students at the end of the term were "Excellent", while only 14.7 per cent of the grades given to the other students were of this grade. The four-subject students •From A Master's Thesis, University of Nebraska, by Richmond V. Qarrett, OS. 1 Mental Tests and the Class Room Teacher, p. 166. </seg>
            <seg id="p099">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 99 failed in 8 per cent of the work while the extra subject students failed in only 4.3 per cent of their subjects. Our study reveals the fact that a larger per cent of Nebraska high school students (save those in the group of smallest schools) carrying more than the normal load of four units had passing grades in all subjects than did those who carry less than the normal load. Since the number represented in the smallest group is approxi - mately only one third of the number in the largest groups, the figures tend to convince us that the conditions in Oakland, cited by Dr. Dickson, also exist in Nebraska high schools.

(y) The average per cent of pupil's carrying less than the normal load who failed to receive passing grades in all subjects last semester. The average per cent of all pupils carrying less than the normal load who failed to receive passing grades in all subjects last semester was 22.7, while the per cent of those carrying more than the normal load who failed to receive, passing grades in all subjects was 20.9. The question may arise, "Do quantity and quality of school work have a direct re - lation, or, does more work always mean better work?" Several studies similar to the one made in Oakland have shown the same conditions existing in other schools, i. e. that the pupils mentally capable of carrying more than the normal load can, and do, do so without lowering their general record in all subjects carried by them. This study of Nebraska high schools corroborates these findings. When the pupil is obliged to use his mental powers to the maxi - mum of his ability and is given the opportunity to do so, the evidence is that he, spurred to strongest effort, will improve his school record In every subject. While the solution of the problem of the student with superior ability may not be fully accomplished by requiring more work indiscriminately without a close study of his real needs the admittedly best schools give an increasingly extended range of oppor - tunity by providing a wider choice of suitable electives. This range of subjects in the best of schools is as wide and varied as the admin - istrative situation will permit.

It is safe to conclude that then would follow a wiser and more sympathetic counseling with the pupil as to his proper load. To What Extent Is Equality Of Opportunity Offered In Nebraska High Schools as Evidenced By The Limit Of The Load Imposed? In Groups I and II a limit is placed by all schools upon the maximum number of units a pupil is permitted to carry at one time, while nearly one third (30 per cent) of the schools in the group of largest schools remove all restrictions and report there is "no limit". Where a limit is placed the range is from four to six units. The per cent of schools in each group having different limits are shown in Table in Maximum Limit Of Units A Pupil Is Permitted To Garry At One Time In Nebraska High Schools 4 I 4% I 5 I 5tt 6 No limit i Total Units Group I ! 10% 0%|71% 2% 17% 0% 100% Group II 5% 2% "62%: 11% 20% 0% 100% Group III 0% 0% 50%! 0% 20% 30% 100% Read the table thus: 10 percent of the schools in Group I. have a maximum limit of four (4) units a pupil is permitted to carry at one time, no schools have a limit of AVi units. 71 per cent have a limit of 5 units, 2 per cent have a limit of S'A units, etc. Read the second line thus: 5 per cent of the schools in Group II. have a maximum limit of 4 units, 2 per cent have a limit of 4J4 units, etc. It will be seen that an average of more than 60 per cent of the ninety best secondary schools in Nebraska consider five units the proper maximum limit for the students to carry at one time. This most common practice, then, would seem to indicate five units to be the proper maximum limit for the average pupil load. 30 per cent of. the group of largest schools remove all numerical limit. No reason is advanced for this nor is any reason given for any fixed limit by the schools reporting. If the best interests of all of Nebraska's youth are to be con - sidered, the question at once arises whether or not there may be in many if not in all our high schools some pupils of superior ability whose opportunities are being checked seriously by even a five-unit </seg>
            <seg id="p102">102 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT Eiit. Does the school's responsibility lie in fixing a hard and fast litation of the load or is it rather in discovering the individual pil's needs and in adapting the load accordingly? "Let the pupil be given full opportunity to cope with the tasks for which he is by nature fitted."* Leading authorities seem to agree in general that the pupil's best interests are conserved by the school's following this procedure: First, discover the pupil's capacity. Second, fix the pupil's load accordingly. Third, check and record the pupil's work carefully and regularly. These steps of procedure will be discussed later in this thesis. Needed Research — A more extended study of the problem should show, after careful tests which would necessarily cover a longer period of time, the relative benefits to all pupils of a maximum limit of four, five or six units of no limitations save only those of the student's ability. What Proportion of the Work Offered In Nebraska High Schools Most Be Mastered (As Indicated By the Required Grades for Passing) Before the Student is Permitted to Advance to Another Grade? A fairly close agreement seems to exist among the schools under study, relative to this problem. This is shown by the standards set for marking the average passing grade in the different schools. Table IV Range and Median of Passing Grades Read the table thus: In Group I, the range of passing grades is from 60 to 70, and the median of passing grades is 71.5%; in Group II, the range is from 70 to 80 and the median 71.1% etc. 2 Dickson, Dr. V.

            <seg id="p103">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 103 The importance of a near uniform standard for passing grades is made apparent when the student moves from one school to an - other. Obviously, his progress may be hindered by an uneven program of requirements in the different schools and the very purpose of the school, i. e. to provide equal opportunity for every individual pupil may, in a measure, be defeated. A great degree of irregularity in systems of crediting and marking may add to the pupil "load" by causing him to suffer a loss of time and opportunity when he moves from one school to another. While the per cent of pupils thus transferring may be relatively small in Nebraska schools, still this per cent are entitled to consideration. The absence of a very wide range of standards in this element of the pupil load indicates a condition favorable to the pupils in Nebraska high schools. Trabue 3 says: "Pupils should be placed in a given class because of their readiness to do the work of that class." The reasonableness of this assertion cannot be denied. The data collected in this study, however, do not indicate any agreement among the Nebraska high schools as to how the "readiness" of the pupils is determined, notwithstanding the median passing grade is so nearly the same in each group of schools. Readiness to pass into a higher grade must include, completion of previous work, and mental ability to take up the work following. The more scientific and democratic our school work becomes, the more generally will the pupils' achievement be determined by stand - ardized educational tests and the pupils' ability to proceed be de - termined by intelligence tests. Then the range of passing grades among all the schools will probably tend to be narrowed even more. "The fact that education is a matter of changes and improve - ments makes it certain that objective measurements will continue to be used in schools with ever increasing accuracy and effective - ness. Specialists in educational practice will learn to interpret more confidently the relations found between the results obtained from various measurements and to make on these bases more adequate adjustments to the interests and abilities of the pupils. The measuring instruments themselves will no doubt become more and more accurate and will probably measure more limited portions of the fields to which they apply."* 3 Trabue — Measuring Results in Education, p. 438. 4 Trabue — Measuring Results in Education, p. 485. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">104 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT How Does the Pupil Load Seem to Be Influenced By the Number of Credits Required for Graduation? The fact that the pupils' excess load is greater in all the schools requiring thirty-two credits for graduation gives light on the ques - tion why the students choose to carry more than the normal load. This question in itself would make an interesting and perhaps valu - able study. What factors most influence the high school student in attempting to do more than he is actually required to do remains an open question, but the facts show that in Nebraska high schools the amount of the load varies directly with the number of credits re - quired for graduation. Table V Difference in the Pupil load in SO Credit Schools and 32 30 credits have 2 per cent of the pupils carrying less than 4 units, etc. •One-half unit. A unit course is to be considered as a course covering an academic year that shall include in the aggregate not less than the equivalent of one hundred twenty sixty-minutes hours of class room work. Two hours of shop or laboratory work are considered equivalent to one hour of class room work. General Statements The facts presented in this chapter justify the following statements: 1. The adjustment of the pupil load in Nebraska high schools shows a significant variation. The per cent of pupils carrying more than the normal load is greater than the per cent carrying less. 2. The range of the maximum load pupils are permitted to carry is wide, extending from four units to infinity. Group "30 Credit*" "32 Credit*" Schools Schools I.

Schools in the largest group (Group III) require the highest grades for passing. 5. The per cent of pupils carrying all work successfully last semester is inversely proportional to the size of the group. 6. In general there is a high correlation between the number of pupils carrying an extra load and their passing grades. The lighter the load, the less is the per cent of students receiving passing grades. 7. The observance of the normal distribution curve in classifying the students is entirely disregarded by 64 per cent of the schools, while the remaining 36 per cent apply the principle of the probability curve of distribution with a varied interpretation. 8. It would seem that personal opinion and individual standards characterize the rating of the pupils' work in Nebraska high schools and that the values given the various symbols for recording the rat - ings vary with the personal opinions of the scorers. 9. The evidence goes to show that while the standards may be well established within a single school system, there is a striking lack of uniformity and a wide variation of opinion among the schools generally regarding the distribution and the recording of the pupil load. What Nebraska High Schools Consider Fundamental Requirements For Carrying Additional Work Read the table thus: In Group I. 45.4 per cent of the schools require grades of 90 to 100 before a pupil' may carry additional work, 38.6 per cent of the schools require a grade of 80 to 90, etc. Table VII Per Cent of Schools Requiring 'erent Grades Group 90 to 100 80 to 90 Below 80 No Rule allowed i. n. 45.4% 47. % 20. % 38.6% 47. % 50. % 4.5% 6. % 10. % 11.5% 0. % 20. % in.

The group of schools without this restriction is divided as to the criteria which govern them in this situation. Only 32 per cent of the schools are governed in their action by the generally accepted true, basic prin - ciple, — the ability of the individual pupil. "If the pupil is a senior" is the condition that settles the question with 30 per cent of the schools. "By taking the subject over" is the rule with 12 per cent, "if failure was unavoidable," with 8 per cent, while the remaining IS per cent name other- conditions which guide their action. In too large per cent of the schools is the urge to graduate allowed o affect the requirements. The weight of responsibility for failure of the pupil to graduate bears heavily and seems to Influence teachers n making a discrimination in the load of adjustments. This seems o be indicated by the answers which are typical: "If a student is a senior and graduation depends upon his carrying more than four units", "Seniors to graduate", "Seniors only", "Unless needed for graduation", "Only in senior year", etc. It may be argued that the consideration of individual differences is a matter concerned more with methods of teaching than with the amount of work carried by the pupil. It can hardly be denied that both these factors should be recog - nized in considering individual differences among pupils. But a dis - cussion of methods and instructional values is not within the province of this study and hence our attention must be confined to the one phase of the subject dealing directly with the pupil load. From this point of view the evidence goes to show that the greatest regard for individual differences is manifested in the group of largest schools. Group Range Median I.

            <seg id="p107">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 107 To What Extent is Individual Student Ability Recognized in Nebraska Higli Schools and How is This Ability Determined? In the first place it will be noted that the pupil's chance for re - ceiving permission to carry extra work depends wholly upon the teachers' marks in 38 per cent of the high schools included in this study. Answers to the question, "What means other than the teachers' marks do you use as a basis for granting permission to carry ex - tra work?" were given by 62 per cent of the schools. An analysis of the answers proved it to be no easy matter to tabulate the data thus collected. However, the answers were grouped under three head - ings and classified as well as their meaning was understood. All the answers were not entirely clear and consequently there is a chance for error. All the answers, however, find some place under the general headings: Quality of the Student. b. Intelligence Tests. c. Individual Opinion. These means constitute the bases upon which more than half the schools permit the student to carry extra work. It is a matter of concern that only 32 per cent of the schools reporting seem to have come to realize the wisdom of ascertaining the IQ of each pupil so as to direct to the best use this native asset of the pupil. Ones, foremost in authority on the subject of intelligence test - ing says: "There is reason to doubt whether the difference between the very poorest and the very best teachers is one-half or even one - fourth as effective in determining the accomplishment of the pupils as are the differences in endowment disclosed by mental tests." The evidence is that in too few schools in Nebraska the vital necessity of making use of mental tests is used as one of the funda - mental criteria by which the pupils may be classified and provided with work most advantageous for their best development. Surely the time is coming "and now is" when the program of mental testing should have its place in every school as one of the fundamental factors in the classification of pupils. Trend of opinion indicates 5 Terman, Dr. Lewi*— Journal of Educational Research, Dec. 1924. </seg>
            <seg id="p108">108 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT that the time will be when the teacher will be held accountable for a pupil's failure, — not responsible for the child's lack of native men - tality certainly, but responsible for her failure in not knowing and not using and directing for his best advantage, the pupil's endow - ment of brightness whether it be great or small. Then the prepared teacher will be able, if required, to give without fear of embarrass - ment the true scientific reasons for the failure of any pupil. The index of brightness, determined by individual or group tests devised by specialists and carefully applied by principals or teachers, the quality of the pupil as estimated by the observing teachers or supervisors, the previous achievement as shown by achievement tests, and the personal recommendation of the teacher together form the guiding factor in classifying the pupil. What Is the Controlling Authority in the Regulation of Each Pupil's Load? In deciding the pupils ability to carry an extra load, the teacher's estimate based upon the pupils' reactions to academic tests and ex - aminations is given full credit in fifteen high schools out of sixty three reporting. In thirty-five other schools the weight of the teacher's estimate is indefinitely reported in such answers as "some", "very much", "considerable", "depends upon the situation", "what it deserves", "not much", etc. It seems plain that if the pupil is to have the most favorable opportunity there should be an equitable sharing of responsibility among the teachers, superintendent, registrar and faculty in general as to the matter of load adjustment. Only a start has been made iri this particular, however, for barely 7 per cent of the schools now divide the responsibility of load regulation among "the faculty", "the registrar, under rules", and "a committee". The opinion of several in this as in other situations in life is often of more value than that of only one and the consensus of judgment is best for the child's interests.

A series of correlation studies to determine the wisdom of elimination by probability curve grouping. c.

(4) Is there a difference between the list of magazines read and the list of magazines favored? (5) Where is the periodical material read by Nebraska High School students obtained? (6) What, in the magazine, appeals to high school students? Table I gives a classification of the high school pupils surveyed, the total number of cases being 1652, 929 girls and 723 boys. An examination of Table II will show that the magazine read most widely by the pupils is the Literary Digest. It is, perhaps, the one most generally subscribed for either in or through the schools. Out of 1652 pupils, 1174 read the Literary Digest. 'From Master's Thesis, University of Nebraska, by Arvilla M. Johnson, TO*. tDiscussion of these aims not included in this extract. </seg>

The Literary Digest ranks first for both girls and boys. 674 out of a total of 929 girls and 500 out of a total of 723 boys read this magazine. In the contest for rank two, "Ladies' Home Journal" is highest for girls and "Pop - ular Mechanics" for boys. Neither of these magazines appear in the list of twenty-five for the opposite sex. It is not uncommon to find boys reading woman's arts magazines. In fact, "McCall's" is found to rank twenty-third in the list of twenty-five magazines read most by boys. We also find five other woman's arts magazines, ranking high in the list for girls, that do not appear in the group for boys. Not a single magazine concerned with science is found to be widely read by girls. In addition to "Popular Mechanics", very frequently "Popular Science Monthly" and "Radio Digest" are chosen by the boys. "Whiz Bang", "Judge", "Life" and "Physical Culture" appear in the popular group for boys only. Based on the total number of each surveyed, "College Humor" is read by twice as many boys as girls. In the case of musical magazines, only one, "Etude", seems to appeal greatly to the interests of high school readers. It is read by 240 out of 929 girls and by 5? out of 723 boys. ♦Tables VI, VII, VIII and IX list the magazines most widely read by the girls in each of the high school classes.

            <seg id="p117">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 117 Table XIV, which takes into account the class differences, shows a striking similarity between class and sex. Perhaps the greatest difference comes in the ninth grade. The reading of freshman girls tends to indicate an interest in fiction and light reading. "Love Story", "Smart Set", and "Good Stories" appear only on the freshman list of the twenty-five most widely read magazines. Similarly the first year high school boys show a great predilection for adventure and mysteries. The magazine, "True Detective Mysteries" appears only in their list. "Atlantic Monthly" and "Harper's" reach their height of popularity with senior girls. There is a difference in the picking up and reading a magazine occasionally and reading a magazine regularly. Both are included in this discussion, (but a table D, which gives a complete survey of the magazines read regularly by the 1652 Nebraska high school boys and girls, is placed in the Appendix of the Thesis but is not in - cluded in this extract). Judging from the extensive field of magazines read by these high school pupils, it appears that they will read most anything to which they are exposed. Table XV ranks the first twenty-five favorite magazines of Ne - braska's high school pupils. The "American" magazine ranks first, whereas the "Literary Digest" ranked first in the list of magazines read most widely. When these 1652 Nebraska high school pupils were asked to choose their favorite magazine, "Literary Digest" was sur - passed by ten other magazines. These magazines vary in content and interests. Other differences found in comparing the rank which magazines hold in reading circulation with rank in favorites, may be noted in Table XVI. "Current Events" was read by 526 of the 1652 Nebraska high school pupils, and it ranks sixteenth on the list of twenty-five magazines read most widely. It does not appear on the list of twenty - five highest magazines chosen as favorites. "Whiz Bang", read by 498 pupils; "Country Gentleman", read by 470 pupils; "Collier's", read by 469 pupils; and "Photoplay" read by 393 pupils do not rank among the twenty-five magazines most favored by the same 1652 Nebraska high school pupils. Five magazines are found on the list of twenty-five magazines favored by the pupils but do not appear on the list of those widely read. These magazines are as follows: "Western Stories Magazine", favorite of fifty pupils and ranks seventh; "Etude", favorite of thirty-five pupils and ranks fifteenth; "Physical Culture", favorite </seg>

The 1652 Nebraska high school pupils declare their favor within a range of 125 magazines. These 125 magazines were mentioned by only one or two pupils. The greatest interest is centered around the few included in the list of the highest twenty-five. (A complete table of the favorite magazines will be found in Appendix E of the Thesis.)

            <seg id="p123">•*- OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 123 Only an extensive examination of content can explain the situation evident in Table XVII. "The American", a magazine of fiction, is the favorite of two hundred twenty-two girls. "True Story" and "McCall's", woman's arts magazines, ranking second in popularity, were selected by thirty-nine girls. Thus one hundred sixty-three more girls prefer the "American" to any other magazine. No unusual situation obtains in regard to the boys. Table XVIII. "American Boy" (adventure), "Popular Mechanics", (science), and "American" (fiction) are preferred by seventy-nine, seventy-eight and seventy-one boys respectively. Both girls and boys display a large interest in magazines of fiction. This interest in the case of girls ranks second to no other. Woman's arts magazines might appear to furnish grounds on which to contest such evidence; but, due to their content being a large part fiction, it only tends to make the statement more conclusive. The most popular magazines of this class with girls are: "American", two hundred two; "Saturday Evening Post", twenty-eight; "Cosmo - politan", thirty; "Pathfinder", twenty-five; "Red Book", nine; and "American Girl", nine. The six most favored magazines for boys are: "American", seventy-one; "Saturday Evening Post", nineteen; "True Story", fifteen; "Cosmopolitan", nine; "Liberty", eight; "Pathfinder", seven*. Girls exhibit more than a passive interest in adventure when seventy-four will choose as their favorites such magazines as "Youth's Companion", thirty-one; "American Boy", thirty; and "Western Stories Magazine", eight*. It is in this sphere that boys revel, even more than in science. The following magazines of adventure are most popular with boys: "American Boy", seventy-nine; "Western Stories Magazine", forty-two; "Boy's Life", twenty-six; "Youth's Companion", seventeen; "Detective Story Magazine", seven; and "War Cry", six*. Boys and girls show a substantial interest in one nature magazine, "The National Geographic". This was the favorite of twenty-four girls and twenty-two boys but the only one of its class to attain distinction. Nebraska is made up in the main by farming communities, and one is not surprised that the "Nebraska Farmer" is the favorite of eighteen girls and twenty-two boys. Boys evince a little greater interest in this periodical than do girls. In addition, eight girls fav - ored "Capper's Weekly" and six boys chose the "Country Gentleman". Contrary to our usual sex predictions, boys are not wholly void of interest in woman's arts. The "Ladies' Home Journal" is most 1 These numbers refer to pupils choosing the magazines as their favorite. </seg>

            <seg id="p127">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 127 The number of times magazines of a scientific nature are chosen by boys is far in excess of those chosen by girls. In fact, boys rank this group on practically the same scale as fiction, second only to adventure. "Popular Mechanics" is selected by seventy-eight boys, almost twice as many as the forty selecting "Popular Science Monthly", Much the reverse is true in the case of girls. "Popular Science Monthly" is the only magazine of this class listed in their highest twenty-five favorite magazines, and it was chosen by only twelve girls. The "Literary Digest" alone redeems the current events group in popularity, especially with girls. "Collier's" is favored by ten boys, but there are twenty-six girls and eighteen boys most interested in the "Literary Digest". Perhaps it is logical to conclude that this preference is a result of class reference or study. Magazines made up largely of pictures seen to evince striking sex difference. Presumably, girls like the display of fashions or favorite movie stars. Four boys liked best some magazine of this type.. The most popular magazine of this class with girls is "Pictorial Review", favored by twenty-eight girls. A surprisingly small interest is shown in any one magazine of humor. There are a considerable number of this type mentioned, but particular favoritism is scarcely shown to any special one save "Col - lege Humor". There are twenty-four boys and nine girls who chose this publication. "Whiz Bang" is generally considered to be very popular, but it is chosen by only five boys as a favorite magazine. Musical taste leans to "Etude" and seems to be most evident on the part of the thirty-two girls preferring this magazine to all others. Two magazines are placed under the caption of miscellaneous as found in Table XIX. They are as follows: "Physical Culture", chosen by ten girls and five boys, and "Arts", preferred by only seven boys. Although a pupil occasionally chose magazines generally recog - nized as excellent reading — such as "Atlantic Monthly", "Harper's", or "Review of Reviews" — their lack of popularity is quite noticeable. The question naturally arises: Where do the boys and girls find all this reading material? The question was asked of these students, and the results are indicated in Table XX. Each pupil generally secured reading matter from more than one source. The home sup - plies 1354 pupils with some or all of the magazines they read. 887 pupils purchase such periodicals from news stands. </seg>

            <seg id="p130">A generous use is being made of the magazine racks in city and high school libraries. In the city library, 586 pupils obtain access to magazines, and 518 pupils go to the high school library or mag - azine rack. In Table XXI an attempt is made to list individual differences in tastes. They will explain the choice of a certain magazine as a favorite. The reasons differed somewhat with almost every individual, bat one general trend "true or useful in life" is typical. That which E plies to the world in which they live or can identify themselves rnished the basis of interest. It was not uncommon to find a student liking "True Story", 'because it was so true to life". One young man of a seemingly wild nature preferred "Western Stories Magazine" because of the cowboy stories. In a little note at the side he added, "I wish I lived out where the cowboys carry guns". Another of the same sex, but in a gentler mood, liked "College Humor" because "it is full of real college life at its best". Other pupils added interesting statements of a similar nature.

The "Literary Digest" ranks first, being read by 1174 pupils. (2) A slight class difference was found to exist. Freshman girls read more fiction. Such magazines as "Atlantic Monthly" and "Harper's" appear more frequently on the list of magazines read by senior girls. (3) The pupils' reading tastes show some distinct sex differ - ences. Girls rank fiction first; woman's arts, second; adventure, third; while boys rank adventure, first; fiction, second; and science, third. Boys make little difference between fiction and science, but girls have a clear-cut interval between each group. (4) The "American" magazine is the favorite of 273 pupils. It is liked best by 164 more pupils than any other magazine. "Amer - ican Boy" is ranked second and preferred by 109 pupils. (5) A distinct difference is found between the list of magazines read widely and the list of magazines preferred. High school pupils read widely magazines which are not classed as their favorites. (6) High school pupils obtain more magazines from the home and magazine stands than from all other sources combined. (7) Magazines appeal to the boy or girl because the material therein falls within the range of the individual's experience. An ap - peal is made in the magazine to human instincts or interests. </seg>

Reed, University Examiner University of Nebraska NORTH CENTBAIi ASSOCIATION OP COLLEGES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS Aims of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools "The object of the Association shall be to establish closer relations between the secondary schools and the institutions of higher education within the North Central States and such territory as the Associ - ation may recognize." — Constitution, Article II. The aim of the North Central Association of Colleges and Sec - ondary Schools is, therefore, first to bring about a better acquaint - ance, a keener sympathy and a heartier co-operation between the colleges and secondary schools of this territory; second, to consider common educational problems and to devise the best ways and means of solving them; third, to promote the physical, intellectual and moral well being of students by urging proper sanitary condi - tions of school buildings, adequate library and laboratory facilities, and higher standards of scholarship. I. Fundamental Policies of the Commission on Secondary Schools 1. No school that has been continuously accredited for five years is dropped without a year's warning. Schools not continuously ac - credited for five years may be dropped without warning. (Minutes of 1920). 2. Any school warned shall be dropped the following year if the school persists in violating the same standard. (Minutes of 1920). 3. Where schools are organized on some other basis than the traditional four-year school, the Commission will take account only of the work done in the last three years, i. e., 10th, 11th and 12th grades. (Minutes of 1924). 4. Standards 7a and 7b apply to all superintendents of accredited schools. (Minutes of 1926). 5. Credits gained by extension courses, correspondence courses, or by state examinations will not be considered by the Commission unless such credits are accepted by some standard college as leading toward a degree. (Minutes of 1924). </seg>
            <seg id="p133">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 133 6. The interim authority for interpreting standards is the Com - mittee on Standards. (Minutes of 1924). II. Regulations 1. No school shall be considered unless the regular annual blank furnished for the purpose shall have been properly and completely filled out and placed on file with the inspector. Schools in good standing will make a complete report on teachers once in five years; but full data relative to changes must be presented annually. (A full report required in 1925 and every five years thereafter.) 2. New schools, seeking accrediting, shall submit evidence (e. g., a resolution) showing an approval of the standards of the Association and of the application for membership by the local board of educa - tion or school trustees. 3. The time for which schools are accredited shall be limited to one year, dating from the time of the adoption of the list by the Association. Schools that have been continuously accredited for five or more years may not be dropped for any violation of standing of standards. Such schools are to be warned. But if violation of the same standard or regulation is persisted in for a second year they shall be dropped. 4. The Association will decline to consider any school unless such school is in the highest class of schools as officially listed by the properly constituted educational authorities of the State. 5. In all emergency appointments during the school year in which teachers do not fully meet standards 6A and 6B the Commission will insist that these be temporary and for the remainder of the current year only. Such cases must be duly certified by the super - intendent or principal, including a statement concerning the training, experience, salaries and efficiency of such teachers. 6. The Agent of communication between the accredited schools and the secretary of the Commission for the purpose of distributing, collecting, and filing the annual reports of such schools, and for such other purposes as the Association may direct, is as follows: (a) In states having such an official, the inspector of schools appointed by the state university. (b) In other states the inspector of schools appointed by State authority, or, if there be no such official, such person or persons as the secretary of the Commission may elect. </seg>
            <seg id="p134">134 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 7. If any State fails for two successive years to send one or more official representatives to the annual meeting of the Commission on Secondary Schools, the schools of the State may, by vote of the Association be dropped from the accredited list. The Association is conservative, believing that such policy will ventually work to the highest Interests of all. It aims to accredit only those schools which possess organization, teaching force, stand - ards of scholarship, equipment and esprit de corps, of such char - acter as will unhesitatingly commend them to any educator, college or university in the North Central territory. 8. No new school will be accredited when more than 20 per cent of the teachers of academic subjects fail to meet the requirements of Standard 7, or when any teacher of academic subjects, who has been in the school less than two years, fails to meet the requirements of Standard 7. III. Standards Standard 1. The location and construction of the buildings, the lighting, heating, and ventilation of the rooms, the nature of the lavatories, corridors, closets, water supply, school furniture, appar - atus, and methods of cleaning shall be such as to insure hygienic conditions for both pupils and teachers. Standard 2. The library and laboratory facilities must be adequate to meet the needs of instruction in all courses offered. The library should be classified and catalogued, and an annual inventory should be made and kept of laboratory and shop equipment. Standard 3. Accurate and complete records of attendance and scholarship must be kept in such form as to be conveniently used and safely preserved. Standard 4. No four-year high school that does not require fifteen units or more for graduation and no three-year high school that does not require eleven units or more for graduation shall be accredited. The school year shall consist of a minimum of thirty-six weeks. The minimum length of a recitation period shall be forty minutes ex - clusive of all time used in changing of classes or teachers. A unit course of study in a secondary school is defined as a course covering an academic year that shall include in the aggregate not less than the equivalent of one hundred twenty sixty-minute hours of classroom work, — two hours of shop or laboratory work be - ing equivalent to one hour of prepared classroom work. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 135 Standard 5. The efficiency of instruction, the acquired habits of thought and study, the general intellectual, and moral tone of a school and the co-operative attitude of the community are paramount factors, and therefore only schools that rank well in these particu - lars, -as evidenced by rigid, thorough-going, sympathetic inspection, shall be considered eligible for the list. Standard 6. No school shall hereafter be accredited whose salary schedule is not sufficient to command and retain teachers whose quali - fications are such as required by this Association. The interpretation of this requirement shall be a matter of special responsibility for the state committee. Standard 7. All schools accredited by the Association shall main - tain the following standards respecting teachers: (a) The minimum attainments of a teacher of any academic sub - ject, and of the supervisors of teachers of such subjects, shall be equivalent to graduation from a college belonging to the North Cen - tral Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Such require - ments shall not be construed as retroactive. It is recommended that as far as possible, teachers be assigned according to their major subjects in collegiate preparation. (b) The minimum professional training of a teacher of any academic subject, and the supervisors of teachers of such subjects, shall be eleven semester hours in education. After September 1, 1925, this requirement shall be fifteen semester hours in education. This additional requirement shall not be construed as retroactive. The Association recommends the following types of courses as meeting the spirit of this standard: Educational psychology, prin - ciples of secondary education, theory of teaching, special methods in subjects taught, observation and practice of teaching, history of edu - cation, educational sociology, and school administration and super - vision. Standard 8. The Teachers Load. Some factors conditioning the efficiency of instruction are: 1. The pupil-teacher ratio as shown by the average daily at - tendance. 2. The number of classes taught by the teachers. 3. The number of student hours per teacher. The Association recommends the following as Norms: </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 1. Pupil-teacher ratio — 25 to 1. 2. The number of classes taught by the teacher — 5 daily. 3. The total number of pupil-periods per day — 150 per teacher. An average enrollment in the school in excess of thirty pupils per teacher shall be considered as a violation of the standard. For interpreting this Standard the principal, vice-principals, study hall teachers, vocational advisers, librarians, and other supervisory officers may be counted as teachers for such portion of their time as they Eote to the management of the high school. In addition, such clerks aid in the administration of the high school may be counted on basis of two full-time clerks for qne full-time teacher. Standard 9. Four unit courses, or the equivalent in fractional unit courses as denned in Standard 4, shall be considered the normal amount of work carried for credit by the average or medium student. It is advised that only such students as rank in ability in the upper 25 per cent of the student body may be allowed to take more than four units for credit toward graduation. A different practice in the school must be explained to the State Committee. Standard 10. The Association recommends that three units in English, two units in Social Science, one unit in Biological Science or one unit in General Science, and one unit in physical education or eealth, (with or without), be required for graduation for all students the four-year high school. It further recommends the introduction of vocational subjects such as agriculture, manual training, household economics, and com - mercial subjects into schools where local conditions render such in - troduction feasible. The Association will hold that a sufficient number of qualified teachers must be provided to care adequately for all in - struction offered. No new school will be accredited with less than five full-time teachers of academic subjects, each of whom will teach in the field of his or her major or minor specialization in collegiate preparation. List of schools accredited to the Association will be found indi - cated in list of schools accredited to the University of Nebraska. HIGH SCHOOLS ACCREDITED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA — 1925-2O The University of Nebraska maintains a list of accredited schools, the graduates of which are admitted to the University (and to nearly all of the colleges and universities of the United States) without entrance examinations in subjects that are properly certified as com- </seg>
            <seg id="p137">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 137 pleted within these schools. Unless a graduate of an accredited school, a candidate for admission must be prepared to take examination in those subjects in which entrance credits are desired; provided that graduates of non-accredited four-year high schools may be excused from taking the academic examination by passing an intelligence test with a standing that shows ability to do the work of a college freshman. "Accredited" schools are such as are found to meet the "Standards of Accredited Schools" to a degree that meets the approval of the University Committee on Accredited Schools. Standards of Accredited Schools 1. Not less than twelve units required for graduation from a senior high school (tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades), or not less than fifteen units for graduation from a four-year high school. 2. At least three teachers including the superintendent, giving full time to instruction in the high school; provided that in schools having junior-senior organization, at least two teachers, including the superintendent, shall give full time to instruction in the senior high school, grades 10-12 inclusive. 3. The minimum academic and professional preparation of at least fifty per cent of the high-school teachers equivalent to four years beyond a four-year high-school course. In determining this equiva - lence, two years of successful teaching experience closely related to the subjects to be taught in the high school will be considered equiva - lent to one year of higher academic preparation. In schools having junior-senior organization, at least fifty per cent of the teachers in the senior high school, in no case fewer than two, shall meet the academic and professional provisions of the standard. All who in - struct in grades 9 to 12 inclusive shall be legally qualified to teach in high schools. 4. Laboratory and library facilities adequate to the needs of in - struction in the subjects taught. 5.

Efficiency of instruction, acquired habits of thought and study, the general intellectual and moral tone of the school such as to justify confidence in the work of the school. There is now but one list of schools fully accredited to the Uni - versity of Nebraska. For the convenience of the smaller communities, he University establishes a list of "Minor Accredited Schools," the graduates of which may receive from the senior high school 11 units on credentials, giving them conditional admission to college. Addi - ional credit can be secured by examination or by completing satis - actorily 30 hours of college work. Variations from the standards will be permitted to meet local conditions, as may seem proper to the Committee. All standards will be considered, and must be met to a reasonable degree. There must be at least two instructors giving full ime to the high school, at least one meeting Standard 3. The University of Nebraska does not maintain an inspector of accredited schools. By arrangement with the State Department of Public Instruction the University Committee on Accredited Schools accepts reports of inspection made by officials of that Department in lieu of reports by University inspectors. Requests for inspection should be made to State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Lincoln, Ne - braska. Application for accreditment should be made to University Examiner, Station A, Lincoln, Nebr. •Schools accredited to North Central Association.

            <seg id="p142">142 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Ambitious principals and school boards naturally desire that their graduates receive the highest possible number of credits. Tho com - mendable in itself, this has produced unfortunate results. It is not nusual to find a district attempting to carry too many years of high school work. The limit should be the number of years that can be andled well by the high school instructors that a district can afford to mploy after providing properly for the lower grades. No high school an be permanently strong unless supported by efficient work in the rades. Not only should the number of years be limited, but the umber of courses should not be increased merely to secure more redit points. Optional courses increase the number of recitations, un - ecessarily reduce the size of classes, diminish the time the teacher an give to each class, and prevent the most thoro and efficient work. Variety of courses may be desirable but thoro and skillful teaching a far more important. Where students' tastes and talents require t, one study may occasionally be substituted for another even in mall schools. As a rule, however, until classes are of such size as o require a division for efficiency in instruction, the board should adopt a single, carefully selected curriculum and let the undivided energy of teachers and students be given to the pursuit of it. Es - pecially is this true in the earlier years of the high school. Later there may be a differentiation, but there should be a requirement that classes be of economical size. Uniting Classes It is often immaterial which of two subjects comes first in order f sequence. Where classes are small, it is possible to make combin - tions that serve the ends of economy as well as improve the char - cter of the instruction. Thus, physics and chemistry can be made to alternate, only one of them being taught in any year. Much time a required for preparing experiments in these sciences and for roperly arranging the work for any class taught with enthusiasm nd success. The plan here suggested enables the teacher to con - centrate efforts upon a small number of subjects. It has been thoroly ested in a number of high schools and found to work admirably. The union of classes may render proper other useful variations from the program outlined in this manual. laymond led Willow Con. leynolds Mverdale tokeby Itrang Surprise Unadilla Tamora Vesta Tekamah: Wellfleet Rura Riverside Rural Whitman Thurston Winnetoon Trumbull Con.

            <seg id="p143">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 143 Junior High Schools Full co-operation will be extended to schools adopting any of the various plans for reorganization of secondary school work in - volving the junior high school idea, with a view to protecting credits during the formative period. Principles will be established as soon as there is sufficient experience to justify safe conclusions. Supervising Study Attention is called to the importance of directing students of secondary schools in the principles of effective study. Many schools have found it helpful to introduce a brief course based on a text, such as "How to Study and What to Study," by Sandwick. Others follow one of the types of supervised study. Full co-operation will be given in carrying out plans carefully made, to the end that credits may be protected during the experimental stage. Credit for Excellence of Work It is recommended that schools desiring to give credit for excel - lence of work use the "credit per cent" plan. This has been used successfully for several years in a number of Nebraska high schools. The conditions for graduation take into account the quality as well as the quantity of the work done in meeting the graduation re - quirement. For graduation the pupil presents 2,560 credit per cents. This is found by adding together the semester grades of all the subjects taken. Allowance is made for fractional credits if there be such, but no semester grade is counted in this total if it falls below 60 or 70 per cent, as may be adopted for minimum grade. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 REPORT OP STATE SUPERINTENDENT ATTENDANCE IN ACCREDITED SCHOOLS A. A. Reed, University Examiner The University of Nebraska established its system of accredited schools in 1884, as the result of the efforts of State Superintendent W. W. W. Jones and Chancellor Irving J. Manatt. These two leaders isited many schools in Michigan and Iowa, where accredited relations existed, and were so favorably impressed with the system that they ecommended to the State Teachers' Association the appointment of a joint committee to work out a plan of operation for Nebraska. This recommendation was approved and a committee was appointed n accordance with the recommendation. Professors Grove E. Barber, George E. Howard and H. H. Nicholson represented the University of Nebraska. Superintendents H. M. James, of Omaha, E. T. Hartley, of Lincoln, N. E. Leach, of Oakland, O. C. Hubbell, of Hastings, and R. E. Call, of David City, represented the Association of Super - ntendents and Principals of Schools. Superintendent Jones and Chancellor Manatt served as ex offlcio members. The report of the committee provided for major and minor accredited schools, the ormer admitting to freshman standing, the latter to the second year of the University Latin School. By 1890 there were 18 schools in the major group, enrolling 1890 pupils in the high school department and 31,940 in the grades. In 1925-26 there were 456 public accredited high schools with courses admitting their graduates to freshman standing, enrolling 55,234 pupils in the high school department, an increase of 2,822%. The grades below the high school in these same schools enrolled 121,327 pupils, an increase of 279%. In this period of '36 years the enumera - tion of children in Nebraska between 5 and 21 years increased but 25%.

In 1926, 31% of the pupils in the ninth grade, 26% in the tenth, 22% in the eleventh, 21% in the twelfth. The graduating class was 19.5% of the high school. This shows a remarkably high holding power for Nebraska high schools. Table 4 shows a striking change in the proportion of pupils in the higher grades in the later years presented. If all pupils remained in BChool for the entire course and advanced uniformly year by year, one - bird of the total enrollment would be in the high school. As a matter f fact, the later years always show an ever increasing lower ratio, due o deaths, retardation in the earlier grades, and the elimination of hose who cannot or will not continue the course beyond the elementary tages. In 1889-90, out of a total enrollment of 33,830 pupils in the 18 ccredited schools, only 5 % % were in the high school. There is no rec - rd of the distribution by grades of the department. In 1899-00, 12% f the enrollment was in the high school department, with 5 % in grade , 3% in grade 10, 2.4% in grade 11, and 1.6% in grade 12. The graduating class was .7% of the entire enrollment. In 1925-26, in the 56 accredited schools, 31.3% of the entire enrollment was in the high chool, with 9.8% in grade 9, 8.1% in grade 10, 6.8% in grade 11, and .6% in grade 12. The graduates equalled 6.1% of the entire enroll - ment. The records from 1919 on permit a distribution of the upper six grades. In 1919-20, 39.1% of all pupils were found in the upper half of the course. Allowance must be made for the fact that one-fourth of he high school consisted of non-resident pupils. 8.2% were in grade 7, 7.4% in grade 8, 9.4% in grade 9, 5.7% in grade 10, 4.6% in grade 11, and 3.8% in grade 12. The graduates numbered 4% of the entire enrollment. A study of the seven last years reveals some interesting facts. The elative number in the first half of the course, including grade 6, has ecreased every year, going from 60.9% to 54.1%. This is probably as low as it will go. The enrollment in the high school seemed to each its highest ratio in 1924-25, with 31.6%, in spite of a relative arge non-resident attendance. In 1920-21 there was a very large ighth grade. The group has held its own each year since, with the largest relative enrollment of any grade, 8.4, 7.4, 0.4, 8.3, 7.3 and 6.6% and has resulted in the large graduating lass of 1925-26, 6.1% of enrollment. It is probable that this </seg>
            <seg id="p147">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 147 large group was influenced by the re-adjustment of post-war con - ditions, and that the graduating class has reached its maximum ratio. Any increase now will be due to population increase, and will be in proportion to the other grades. Deducting the non-resident enrollment for 1925-26, the resident enrollment would consist of 59.9% below grade 7, 8.2% in grade 7, 7.6% in grade 8, and 24.6% in the high school. This shows a most remarkable holding power of our city and village schools. Young people are taking advantage of high school privileges as never before, and are remaining for more years of preparation. </seg>

The first three figures show conditions in 1899-1903. There were 49 accredited schools with complete records for the entire period. 2307 pupils entered the ninth grades of these schools in 1899-1900. Of these, 65% entered the second year, 45% the third year, and 32% the fourth year. School A was the large school with the poorest record, and school B had the best record. In order to reduce varying conditions to the lowest basis, the second comparison in point of time took the average of the record of a group of 322 schools having complete records, over a period of three years for each entering class. This carried the study from 1919-20 to 1924-25. The average of the entering class was 10,982. 84% of this number through a period of three years entered grade 10, 76% en - tered grade 11, and 68% entered grade 12. In this same period, the best showing made by any one large school was 95%, 85%, and 76%, while the poorest was 50%, 44%, and 38% for grades 10, 11, and 12 respectively. By using the averages in Table 5 as a norm, schools can determine pretty accurately their relative success in retaining their students, and can locate the place at which a disproportionate number are eliminated.

Testing Program In accordance with purposes stated in Section II above "Purposes of Tests in Normal Training Reviews" the following extract from Normal Training Circular No. 2, August 26, 1926 is typical of in - structions issued from time to time by the Department. 1. A scientific plan for teaching the normal training subjects would begin with an exact inventory of the knowledge, skill and ability which the students already possessed. Unfortunately there is no method whereby we can obtain an "exact inventory". But we 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 2 3 4 can come much nearer by the use of standardized tests than by any other known method. Formerly the normal training teacher was obliged to spend much time in exploratory operations at - tempting to determine the status of her students. Standardized tests now enable her to do this exploring in a fraction of the time it formerly took. This, then, is the purpose of the testing program in normal training high schools: To determine the ability, the knowledge and the skill that the normal training students already possess in the subjects they expect to take in review. In order that results of the tests may be valid, it is essential that identical procedure be used for all schools in giving, scoring and reporting the results of the tests. Examiners must be very careful to follow all directions "IMPLICITLY". There should be no attempt to change the technique of giving, scoring, or recording the results of the tests. In order that results may be uniform procedure must be uniform. Examiners should be exact as to time limits of tests. A stop watch is highly desirable but if one cannot be secured then a watch with a second hand may be used. It is always wise to have a second person aid in giving the tests whose only duty is to keep exact time. Submit four test papers as samples (preferably one of low grade, one of high grade, and two of near the middle) for checking by the department to see that there has been no violation of the general principles of scoring. We assume that all normal train - ing teachers desire that the results of these tests shall be as nearly valid as possible. This is our reason for using care in checking results. Any gross errors will be noted and reports returned for correction. Unless tests are given when the class begins the study of a given review or very early in the course the results are valueless as an inventor}'. The following tests should be given not later than the third week of school and the results reported to this office on Form E not later than October 1, 1926: Otis S-A Test of Mental Ability: Form A Compass Diagnostic Tests in Arithmetic, Test XVI, Form A Otis Reasoning Test in Arithmetic, Form A Haggerty Reading Examination, Sigma 3, Form A. Give these tests at time Indicated regardless of when the subjects (arithmetic and reading reviews) are given during the school year. </seg>

The Cross English Test, Form A, will be given during the second week of the second semester and the results reported to this department on Form E not later than February 1, 1927. If the grammar review is given during the first semester, give this test (Cross English Test) and submit results of the test with those listed in paragraph 6. The Cross English Test takes the place of three tests formerly used, grammar, spelling, and punctuation, and adds a test in pronunciation which we have never had. 8. If any students taking the tests have previously completed the normal training review course in which they are being tested, so indicate. For illustration, John Jones, Mary Smith, etc., completed the normal training reading course last year and are this year taking the reading test. Indicate in the following manner on Form E: Under each of the columns, Test I, Test II, Test III, Total, mark an asterisk (*) before the score given the student. Thus if John Jones (who has had the reading re - view) secures a score of 43 in Test I, put a *43 opposite John Jones' name in the Column headed '-'Test I" under reading. If he secures a score of 35 in Test II, put a »35 in the column headed "Test II" under reading, etc. 9. The battery of tests for carrying out the program may be secured from the Bureau of Educational Research, Station A, Lincoln, Nebraska.

We trust that all normal training teachers and superintendents of normal training high schools are desirous of improving the normal training curriculum and that they will promptly, willingly, and with as great accuracy as possible cooperate with the department In carrying out the testing program. We cannot close this circular more fittingly than to repeat that the purpose of the testing program is to enable the normal training teacher to take an inventory of the abilities and achievements of the members of her class, and be thereby the better enabled to adapt her instruction to individual differences. Aside from purposes stated above the Department instituted a testing program for the purpose indicated in the following extract from Circular No. 3, August 1925. The department is preparing to revise the Normal Training Courses of Study for publication by September 1, 1926. It has been determined by a four years' trial that the already marked success of these courses can be enhanced by revision. In preparing this revision we are con - fronted with three fundamental problems. 1. The capacities and abilities of normal training students. 2. The nature of the subject matter of the courses of study. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 3. The adjustment of the subject matter to the capacities and abilities of the pupils. Preliminary to this revision an attempt will be made to solve the first problem — a determination of the mental capacities and abilities in subject matter of pupils — by a thorough survey of normal training classes. We trust that all normal training teachers and superintendents of normal training high schools are desirous of improving the normal training curriculum and that they will promptly, willingly, and with as great accuracy as possible, cooperate with the department in making this survey, and subsequently in aiding in the revision of the courses of study. IX. Results of Testing Program, The first requisite to scientific procedures is a knowledge of the intellectual status of those taught. The results of the two groups tested as shown in Table I indicates the IQ's of Normal Training students as measured by the Otis S-A Test of Mental Ability. S. D 9.65 9.1 The Table is read: 2 pupils in Group I and no pupils in Group II have an IQ of from 130 to 134 incl., 9 pupils of Group I and 7 pupils of Group II have an IQ of 125 to 129, etc. A second requisite to good teaching is an inventory of the knowledge, skill and ability which students possess in the given subject to be taught. Students will profit in accordance with intellectual and achievement capital they have to invest.

In determining the costs to the State Department of Public Instruction each school was charged its proportionate share of in - spection costs and the average amount of state aid paid to schools in the group. These Tables show that the smaller the school the higher the costs and the larger the school the less the costs. The per capita cost of normal training students who teach the year succeeding graduation has increased each year for the 4 teacher high schools and for the group of schools having 7-10 high school teachers.

            <seg id="p200">200 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT TEACHERS' EXAMINATIONS In the matter of the state teachers' examinations, three things have been kept constantly in mind: (1) the personnel ot the force making out the examination questions and doing the grading; (2) tandardization of the grading process and of the nature and value f questions; and (3) simplifying the use of examination numbers nd of the system of recording and transmitting grades. An amplifi - cation of these points follows: In choosing the grader of the papers and the maker of the ques - tions for any subject, the fitness of the individual for that particular subject has been given first consideration. Those of the present list ot readers of examination papers have had years of satisfactory teach - ing experience and qualifications, either in training or experience, for the subjects with which they work. An effort has been made to produce questions of approximately the same degree of difficulty and covering, as far as possible, the entire field of the subject. Also we have endeavored to develop standards for the different graders as well as standards for each grader so that the papers in the different examination subjects and the different papers in any one subject will receive approximately the same degree of care and attention. A study of tables* showing the number and per cent of failures in each subject indicated such a wide variation between subjects as to make some standardization and equalization desirable and necessary. Because of the shifting 1 of population and the transfer of teachers from place to place, it became necessary to provide a means whereby holders of examination numbers held in one county could make use of those numbers in any county without making the process too cumber - some and complicated. This has been done very satisfactorily so that now those desiring to take examinations outside their home counties may do so without penalty. All grades earned are recorded on individual record cards and duplicate copies made of the grades earned in each county. One of these copies is retained in the office and the other sent to the county superintendent of the county where the examinations were taken. Where grades are earned in one county by applicants whose examin - ation records are in another county, copies of grades so earned are sent to the county superintendent of both counties. With an average for the last three years of nearly seventy thou - sand examination papers each year, some idea may be gained as to </seg>
            <seg id="p201">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 201 the size of the problem. These papers have been assembled, sorted and graded, the grades recorded, duplicate copies by counties made, these checked and rechecked for errors, and the grades sent to the county superintendents in each case in less than the time permitted — thirty days from the date of the examination. The State Depart - ment is justly proud of its record in this respect. •The following three summaries are the ones to which reference is made. </seg>

            <seg id="p205">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 205 INTRODUCTION House Roll 353, the teachers' certification law, complete text of which is contained in this bulletin, became effective July 2, 1925. This, we believe, is one of the best pieces ot school legislation enacted in Nebraska in recent years. It is fundamental, constructive, definite, simple, progressive, and will mean much to the schools of the state. It reduces very materially the number of certificates, eliminates duplication, and provides that all certificates, excepting institutional certificates, shall be issued by the state superintendent and therefore gives the teacher a state-wide certificate that is valid in any county in the state upon registration without fee in the office of the county superintendent of the county where the holder contracts for a posi - tion. This does away with the transfer of grades from one county to another with resultant confusion, errors and delay, and lessens clerical work in the office of the county superintendent. This law provides a definite, fair and gradual gradation in going from one class of certificate to the next higher and also provides recognition and reward for professional growth and preparation on the part of the teacher. In the enactment of a teachers' certification law it is hardly possible to embody in the law provisions covering every question that will arise in changing from the old to the new law, hence it is necessary for the state superintendent to make rulings covering all such questions. In the rulings we have made which are given in this bulletin we have endeavored to be fair with all concerned, the welfare of the children of Nebraska being also kept in mind. It is, of course, our purpose to administer this law so that it will not be retroactive on teachers holding certificates under the old law. Teachers alone are responsible for securing the required certifica - tion and keeping their certificates in force. If this bulletin does not furnish the information desired, they are urged to consult their county superintendent or the state superintendent. When a person is per - mitted to teach who is not legally certified for the work she is doing, the teacher, board, school and district become involved in several complications. First, the district renders itself ineligible to share in the state apportionment funds for the ensuing school year; second, the school board may be held personally liable for public school funds paid to a teacher who is not legally certified; third, neither the school nor pupils can be given credit for the time taught by such teacher; and fourth, if the school is an accredited high school or offering normal training in the high school, the employment of a teacher anywhere in the system who is not qualified in accordance with the law and the regulations governing accreditment and normal training will jeopardize its accreditment to the university and approval by this department for normal training aid and credit. </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Another important school measure passed by the last legislature is Senate File 265, complete text of which is included in this booklet. This law became effective July 2, 1925. It requires teachers to register their state certificates in the office of the county superintendent, if this has not been done, before they are eligible to enter into a formal contract for a school in any county. This law offers protection to qualified teachers and will work no hardship on them. It protects taxpayers in guaranteeing the payment of salaries from the public school funds to legally qualified teachers only and insures the children of Nebraska instruction by legally certified teachers. Reports to this office last year showed that at one time one hundred six persons were teaching who did not hold legal Nebraska certificates. The provisions of this law will make a repetition of this impossible in the future. In addition to the complete text of the two laws referred to, this bulletin contains rulings of the state superintendent on the adminis - tration of the certificate law, general notes, regulations based on legal provisions governing teachers' examinations, classification of high schools — standards, articles of organization of the various school districts of the state, directory of the county superintendents, and state and denominational schools. The continued cooperation of the teaching and administrative forces of the state is earnestly solicited in the administration of the new certification law and related matters. JOHN M.

The "college hours" required for the renewal of second and first grade county certificates under the old law could be of either college or of secondary rank. In order to prevent the new certifi - cation law from being retroactive, the term "college hours" as used in this article (Article VII of these regulations) shall be defined to include work of both secondary rank and college rank.

This ruling shall not apply to other articles of these regulations. 4. The old law placed no limitation on the amount of work that might be taken in absentia for the renewal of county certificates. In order to prevent the new law from being retroactive, no limit is placed on the amount of work that may be taken in absentia for the renewal of first and second grade county certificates under this article (Article VII of these regulations).

The Nebraska Permanent Elementary School Certificate lapses after three consecutive years of non-use and the Nebraska Permanent High School Certificate lapses after six years of non-use. Either certificate may be kept in force by twelve weeks teaching during such period, or may be renewed by earning twelve semester hours of col - lege credit including three hours in education since the issuance of such certificate. 2. Life certificates issued by the state superintendent or by ap - proved Nebraska teacher training institutions lapse after three con - secutive years of non-use. Either type of certificate may be kept in force by twelve weeks teaching during such period, or may be renewed by earning twelve semester hours of college credit including three hours in education since the issuance of such certificate.

The ruling made in June, 1924, that an applicant shall have attained his eighteenth birthday to be eligible to a certificate shall not be retroactive on normal training students. This ruling was made after normal training students who would complete the curriculum during the school year 1924-25 had entered upon their course. There - fore, any normal training student in an approved Nebraska normal training high school who completes the normal training curriculum on or before September 1, 1925, shall have attained his seventeenth birthday in order to be eligible to certification.

County superintendents will be held responsible for the proper conduct of the examinations at all points in their respective counties. County superintendents should furnish definite directions to conductors of examinations and see that they are followed. A sufficient supply of printed questions will be sent to the county superintendent for all points- in his county. The county superin - tendent will mail questions for each half day in separate sealed envelopes to the conductors who are to have charge of the examina - tions. Instructions should be given not to open envelopes until the beginning of the half day during which the questions are to be given and then in the presence of applicants who are to write. Uniform examination paper, 8%xl4, must be used, the blank space for regis - tration number to be in upper right hand corner. This is to be furnished by the county superintendent. County superintendents and conductors of examinations are for - bidden to read applicants' papers for the purpose of determining for applicants whether papers should be sent to the state superintendent. Applicants are required to determine this for themselves. All practices of this kind are prohibited. At the close of the examinations all manuscripts submitted at all points in the county must be sent immediately to the county super - intendent. After the county superintendent has carefully checked all papers with his examination records for the purpose of rejecting any papers submitted on numbers on which applicants have exhausted their examination rights or used the wrong numbers, he will forward papers to the state superintendent by express for marking, filing and recording. The papers shall be accompanied by legible, com - plete, accurate reports, typewritten if possible, made on blanks furnished by the state superintendent.

The issuance of a third grade ele - mentary school certificate to an applicant who has taken out a regis - ration number beginning with the August, 1925, examination does ot invalidate her right to use said number in writing once on each f the second grade high school certificate subjects. Applicants who were assigned county numbers prior to the August, 192 5, examination, and on which county certificates were issued, cannot use said numbers in taking further examinations, for the reason that the issuance of ounty certificates invalidated further examination rights on the same. Then a "withheld" grade is released on a number this cancels the ight of the applicant to take this subject on this number. When igh school grades are accepted in certain subjects for graduates of le normal training course of approved normal training high schools nd reported to county superintendents, this cancels the right of pplicant to use the number on which these grades are reported in taking the examinations in these subjects. An applicant may use umbers assigned in other counties if she has not exhausted her ex - mination rights on subjects she wishes to take. She must indicate with the number the name of the county in which her number was ssigned, for example: 5674 Adams. Failure to give name of county will mean rejection of paper. This must be written on the blank line where number is to be given on every paper submitted. An applicant failing in one or more subjects may retain the grades which are satisfactory and take over only those in which she desires to raise her grades by paying the regular fee of one dollar and fifty cents. A new number will be assigned her which she will use when retaking subjects. Applicant should write all examinations on the last number assigned her. This does not invalidate the right to use a former number which may be used later if she fails to secure a passing grade, provided, of course, the right to use the former number in the subject or subjects she wishes to take has not been exhausted. t Grades and numbers on which examination rights are not ex - usted may be transferred without fee and the applicant allowed complete examinations in the county to which transferred. The number of trials to which an applicant is entitled on the ex - amination in any subject shall be limited to two until the applicant has made considerable additional preparation by self culture or at - tendance at school.

Grades in second grade high school certificate subjects will not be reported to county superintendents until grades in the third grade elementary school certificate subjects have been reported for all counties to the county superintendents. In the issuance of new numbers to applicants writing at the August, 1925, examination, county superintendents will begin with No. 1. Applicants who are assigned county numbers under the new law, that is, those who have received numbers since beginning with No. 1 at the August, 1925, examination, may use said numbers in writing on both third grade elementary and second grade high school certificate subjects. Applicants, however, who have paid a life regis - tration fee under the old law will be permitted to use such registration rights in taking second grade high school certificate examinations in subjects they have not previously taken under said rights. This also includes the right to take the new subjects required for the second grade high school certificate. That the new law may not be retroactive with reference to ex - amination fees upon applicants who are meeting the requirements of the old law for the first issuance or renewal of a first grade county certificate, in order to secure a third grade elementary school certificate under the new law, such applicants will be permitted to use county numbers assigned them under the old law before the August, 1925, examination in taking the second grade high school certificate examinations in algebra, geometry and botany, provided they hold county numbers on which they have not exhausted their registration rights in these three subjects, namely, algebra, geometry and botany. No applicant shall be permitted to use old county num - bers issued prior to the August, 1925, examination when writing on any of the ten remaining second grade high school certificate subjects. Applicants who have been assigned county numbers under the old law may use the same in taking third grade elementary school certificate subjects under the new law until they have exhausted their examination rights on the same; that is, they may use said numbers in taking subjects they have not previously taken on the same under the old law, provided they have not had normal training high school grades recorded on said numbers, and provided, further, county certificates have not been issued on said numbers.

No applicant is permitted to ask the conductor for. any explanation of questions or the meaning of words. If any mistake has been made in the printing of questions proper allowance will be made for such In the grading. If through an oversight a paper in any subject is sent to the state superintendent with a part of it missing, and the grade is reported to the county superintendent "part missing", the writer will be permitted to use the same number again when writing on this subject. Applicants should not be permitted to leave the room or com - municate with anyone during the examination without permission from the county superintendent or conductor in charge. Each appli - cant should be as far removed as practicable from other applicants. Books, notes, or papers must not be brought to the room nor should applicant receive aid of any kind during the examination. If any person offers to give or receive aid during the examination it shall be the duty of the county superintendent or conductor in charge to compel such person to retire from the examination room, returning to her marked "cancelled" all papers submitted at that examination and she should be barred from further examination privileges at that examination. Said applicant's entire examination record at this office will be subject to cancellation upon recommendation of the county superintendent. If our reading of papers discloses marked similarity by reason of copying, the grades on such papers will be cancelled and such applicants will be subject to a cancellation of all their grades on our records. When grades are cancelled on the state superin - tendent's records because of collusion on the part of applicants this cancels their right to take such subjects again on the same number. In addition to suffering the loss of all their grades, persons found guilty of collusion may be prohibited from taking another examina - tion for at least a year and the action may be considered sufficient to 'cause a revocation of any certificate which applicant may hold, and to make her ineligible to take further examinations. Each ap - plicant must protect the integrity of her own manuscript and will be held responsible for doing so. Manuscripts cannot be returned to applicants after the examin - ation. Please do not request it. They are retained at the office of the state superintendent for a period of ninety days after which time they are destroyed. These papers are graded by a competent, im - partial board of examiners who are professional teachers of wide experience and high scholastic attainment, and each paper is awarded as high a marking as can be given on the contents.

County superintendents should thor - oughly satisfy themselves that a review of a paper is justified before requesting (on formal blank) the state superintendent to look over a paper the second time. Where, however, the county superintendent is satisfied by an oral examination of the applicant's knowledge of the subject in question that she is entitled to a higher grade or where he finds upon careful investigation that reasonable grounds appear to exist for a review and the case seems to justify a second reading of the paper, the state superintendent will, upon his recommendation, reread the ap - plicant's paper upon receipt, direct from the county superintendent, of a written request and fee of fifty cents to cover the expense in - cident to such appeal in the form of draft, express or postoffice money order for each paper to be reread. Stamps, silver or personal checks are not accepted and will be returned. No appeal will be considered unless received within ninety days after the examination was given. Upon receipt of such requests they will be placed on file for attention only after the work of grading the papers and making reports of the results of the examinations in all counties has been completed. Therefore reports on review requests should not be expected sooner than forty days after the examination. If the review on appeal discloses the paper merited a higher grade the applicant will be credited with the higher grade. However, should the review disclose that the paper was graded too high the higher grade will be cancelled and the applicant credited with the lower grade. Formal written review requests on blanks furnished by this department and fee in proper form must come direct from the county superintendent with his recommendation and will not be accepted from the applicant. Applicants should use every care in the use of the right registra - tion number which should be plainly written on each page submitted. If an applicant uses the wrong number or uses a number on which she has exhausted her examination rights in the subjects on which she submits papers, such papers should be returned to the applicant by the county superintendent. Should they be sent to this offlce they will be returned to the proper county superintendent marked "re - jected". They will not be accepted after they have been once returned to the county superintendent even though it is possible to identify them later. The responsibility for properly numbering papers rests entirely with the applicant and she is the one who will be penalized if she fails to do so.

Such papers should not be sent to this office. Where applicants use numbers from other counties this check cannot be made; however, such applicants should not be permitted to use numbers from other counties if they are not sure of their numbers. They should be required to take out new numbers in the county where writing..

Applicants who have been assigned new numbers beginning with the August, 1925, examination, indicating number in the first column and also name of county if taken out in another county. The new certification law states that each applicant shall pay for each number assigned her one dollar and fifty cents, which entitles her to write once on each of the third grade elementary school cer - tificate subjects and once on each of the second grade high school certificate subjects. (This does not apply to county numbers assigned prior to the August, 1925, examination, except as provided in this bulletin). Therefore, it will be noted that an applicant writing on the second grade high school certificate subjects, who purchases a new number, is reported twice: 1. In the list of new registrations reported on Form "B", and 2. In the list of second grade high school certificate regis- trations on Form "D".

CLASSIFICATION OF HIGH SCHOOLS— STANDARDS Schools are classified as: approved high schools, minor accredited high schools, accredited high schools and North Central Association accredited high schools. Approved High Schools For requirements to be met by rural and village high schools to be approved under the provisions of the free high school law, see blue bulletin issued by this office September 1, 1924, entitled "Ne - braska Rural and Village High Schools". Copies of this bulletin may be procured from any county superintendent. Minor Accredited High Schools (Uni. Extension News, Vol. 5, No. 7) 1. Minimum of twenty-eight points required for graduation. 2. Minimum of two teachers giving full time to high school in struction, at least one being the equivalent of a college graduate. 3. Other high school teachers must hold the second grade high school certificate or equivalent. Accredited High Schools 1. Minimum of thirty points required for graduation. 2. Minimum of three teachers including superintendent giving full time to instruction in the high school. Provided, that in schools hav - ing Junior-Senior organization at least two teachers including super - intendent shall give full time to instruction in the senior high school. (Grades 10, 11, 12.) (Uni. Extension News, Vol. 5, No. 7) </seg>
            <seg id="p235">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 235 3. Minimum academic and professional preparation of at least fifty par cent of the high school teachers equivalent to four year col - lege course. In determining the equivalence two years of successful teaching experience closely related to the subjects to be taught in the high school will be considered equivalent to one year of higher academic preparation. In schools having Junior-Senior organization at least fifty per cent of the teachers in the senior high school, in no case fewer than two, shall meet the provisions of this standard. All high school teachers, including junior high school teachers, must hold the second grade high school certificate or equivalent. North Central Association of Accredited High Schools 1. Thirty points required for graduation. 2. Minimum of three teachers full teaching time in academic subjects. (a) The minimum attainments of a teacher of any academic subject, and of the supervisors of teachers of such sub - jects, shall be equivalent to graduation from a college belonging to the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Such requirements shall not be construed as retroactive. (b) The minimum professional training of a teacher of any academic subject, and the supervisors of teachers of such subjects, shall be fifteen semester hours in education. The increase in this requirement shall not be construed as retroactive. Factors conditioning the efficiency of instruction are: (1) The pupil-teacher ratio, as shown by the average daily attendance. (2) The number of student hours per teacher. (3) The number of stu - dents in a class. The Association recommends the following as norms: (1) Pupil-teacher ratio, 25 per teacher. (2) The number of classes taught by the teacher, 5 daily. (3) The number of students in a class, 25. An average attendance in excess of 30 pupils per teacher, or more than one hundred sixty pupil-hours per teacher per day, or more than six periods per day for any teacher shall be considered as a violation of this standard. For interpreting this standard in connection with laboratory work in science, and in connection with study room supervision, a double period may be counted as the equivalent of one class room exercise for teachers of academic subjects, provided that no combination of such work amounting to more than thirty-five periods a week be required of any teacher. </seg>

The legislature of 1921 made it the duty of the State Super- intendent of Public Instruction to require the several county super- intendents and city superintendents to make an inspection of each private, parochial, or denominational school at least twice each year. In conformity with this act this department has sent out blanks for report of such inspections twice each year. One inspection each semester has been required for each of such schools. The inspections have included certification of teachers, courses of study, patriotic instruction, housing, heating, ventilation, lighting. seating, text books, library books, supplies and general equipment. The inspection authorities have generally reported those in charge of such schools to be willing and even anxious to comply with all legal requirements.
