Experiment I. 

ALFALFA VS. SORGHUM FOR WINTERING CALVES. 

E. A. BURNETT. 

g October, 1900, 18 steer calves were purchased from the 
on Breeding Farm Company, Madison, Nebr., for ex-, 
lental feeding. Two heifers were also included, which 
! in the summer feeding tests of 1901. Twelve of the 
i and the two heifers were grade Shorthorn. These 20 
were selected from a bunch of about 250 head and represented 
fairly uniform size and quality, being from purebred 
sires and out of cows having at least one cross of the 
same blood, making these calves at least three-quarters Hereford 
or Shorthorn as the case might be. 

Especial breed test was made with these steers, but in 
experiment carried on, except the first, the Shorthorns 
Herefords were generally equally divided, placing an 
number of Shorthorns and Herefords in each lot. In 
rst experiment an opportunity is given to compare six 
thorns with six Herefords on the same feed. 

The calves were received at the university farm October 1, 
1900. They were placed on a clover and mixed grass pasture. 
On October 15 they were given a small ration of grain consisting 
of one half corn, one fourth bran and one fourth oats, 
which was increased gradually until on November 1 they 
were eating 2^ pounds each per day. On October 19 these 
calves weighed 6780 pounds, or 339 pounds each. During the 
month of November they received alfalfa hay with an increasing 
grain ration until, November 30, they were eating five 
pounds each per day and weighed 7425 pounds. 

On December 1, 1900, the steers were divided into three 
lots of six steers each.

El, six Shorthorn steers, weighed 2515 pounds, 
2, six Hereford steers, weighed 2485 pounds. 
3, six Hereford steers, weighed 2425 pounds. 

Lots 1 and 2 received alfalfa hay and a grain ration. 

Lot 3 received sorghum hay and the same grain ration, 
which consisted of one half corn, one fourth oats and one 
fourth bran. Beginning with a grain ration of five pounds 
each per day and a hay ration of six pounds each per day, 
the grain ration was gradually increased to eight pounds 
each per day and continued at that rate until April 20, 1901, 
when the experiment was terminated on account of dehorning, 
which caused a considerable shrinkage in weights that 
was not recovered until after they were turned on grass May

Experiment II. 

GRAIN VS. NO GRAIN FOR STEERS ON PASTURE. 

E. A. BURNETT. 

RMay 4, these lots were redivided, one half of the sorted 
steers and one half of the alfalfa-fed steers being 
I on pasture only, while the other half were fed grain 
with pasture throughout the summer. This placed nine steers 
in each lot, but the grain-fed lot was added to by two Aberdeen-Angus 
steers which were purchased in April. 

STEERS ON PASTURE. 

On May 4, 1901, nine steers weighing 5545 pounds, or an 
average of 616 pounds each, were placed in a 16-acre pasture 
containing broine grass, mixed grasses, and three acres 
of alfalfa. Two acres of this field was newly seeded and furnished 
very little pasture during the summer. On account 
of the extreme drought of 1901, the feed became very short 
during the latter part of August, but with the rains of early 
Enber the pasture improved, especially the alfalfa, and 
was fair pasture in the field at the time they were re, 
November 1, 1901. 

STEERS ON GRAIN. 

The nine steers on grain, which were to be compared with 
the nine on pasture, weighed 5485 pounds, or an average of 
609 pounds each. To the nine steers were added two Angus 
steers weighing an average of 600 pounds each, making 
eleven head. These 11 steers were placed on grain and pasture 
May 4 and had the run of about thirteen acres of low 
bottom land until August 15, when they were given another 
pasture for 45 days and returned to their original pasture 
about October 1, after it had been improved by autumn 

Er the sake of comparison, the records of weights were so 
as to determine the gains of different steers. It will be 
that while the gain of the steers wintered on sorghum 
vas less during the winter than those wintered on al- </seg>

E, the summer gains of these sorghum-fed steers was 
gh greater to overcome their smaller gains of the pre&gt; 
winter and to place them on even weights with the al-fed 
steers by the end of the pasture season. 

The grain ration from May 4 to August 17 consisted of 
corn meal. On this date the ration was changed to 75 per 
cent corn and 25 per cent bran, which was continued until 
November 1 without change. During the entire period each

The prices on these two lots of steers were estimated by 
Mr. Albert Noe, with Clay, Robinson &amp; Company, South 
Omaha, on November 1 at $4.00 per hundred pounds for the 
grass steers and f5.75. per hundred for the grain-fed steers 
in Omaha on that date. These values were varied by charging 
the cost of delivering the grain-fed steers in Omaha at 35 
cents per hundred, making them worth $5.40 at the farm, 
and by adding the cost of freight to the grass or feeding 
cattle, which would have made them cost about $4.20 per 
hundred delivered at the farm. 

CONCLUSIONS. 

1. This experiment shows that when steers are to be marketed 
in the fall or early winter there is more profit in summer 
feeding with grain on pasture. Where steers are to be 
winter fed on grain for a spring market, there is more profit 
to feed no grain on pasture. See Experiment III. 

I The failure of the corn crop of 1901 made the market for 
ag steers very bad and destroyed the profit that would 
tarily have been produced on a bunch of cattle making 
K&gt;unds gain in six months on pasture only, but the sub;nt 
winter feeding was very profitable and warranted 
ng a higher value on these steers as feeders. 

BThe high price of fat cattle permitted us to sell the 
i-fed cattle at a profit even after having fed them on corn 
1 forty cents per bushel during the summer.

Experiment III. 

?HEAT VS. CORN IN A RATION FOR FATTENING STEERS. 

E. A. BURNETT. H. R. SMITH. 

R November 1, 1901, the 20 steers that had been on the 
vs. No Grain experiment during the summer were 
to the yards to prepare for an experiment on the relative 
feeding value of wheat and corn in a grain ration. 
B;en of these steers were grade Hereford and Shorthorn 
vo were grade Angus. Eleven had been grain fed dure 
summer and were divided into Lots 1 and 2. Nine 
lad been on pasture only and were divided into Lots 

Lot 1 contained six steers for Period I and four steers for 
Period II. 

Lot 2 contained five steers for Period I and four steers for 
Period II. 

Lot 3 contained five steers for both Period I and Period II. 
Lot 4 contained four steers for both Period I and Period II. 

These steers were given a four-weeks preliminary feeding 
period before the experiment proper commenced. During 
this time the steers in Lots 1 and 2 gained 36 pounds each 
and those in Lots 3 and 4 gained 72 pounds each, which 
should be taken into account in a six-months feeding period 
or in a financial statement. 

The experiment proper is divided into two periods, Period 
I of 11 weeks and Period II of 12 weeks. 

The ration for Period I was as follows : 

Lots 1 and 3 received a grain ration 80 per cent wheat 
and 20 per cent bran. 

Lots 2 and 4 received a grain ration 80 per cent corn 
and 20 per cent bran. 

glots received alfalfa hay for roughness. On February 
2, two of the best steers were withdrawn from Lot 1 and 
rom Lot 2 to use for class-room instruction, leaving 
with four steers in each lot, and the first experimental 
I was closed. 

The ration for Period II was as follows:</seg> 


            <seg id="p011">
11 

Lots 1 and 3 received a grain ration of 70 per cent wheat, 
15 per cent corn and 15 per cent oil meal. 

P2 and 4 received a grain ration 70 per cent corn, 15 
it wheat and 15 per cent oil meal. All lots received 
&gt;ne half their roughness in alfalfa hay, one fourth in 
hay and one fourth in wheat straw. Each steer conabout 
half as much roughness as grain. 

These steers were followed by twenty pigs weighing 1370 
pounds when the experiment commenced, one pig with each 
steer. The pigs were fed an additional grain ration of 2878 
pounds of shorts for the entire 23 weeks and made a gain of 
1340 pounds. Valuing the pigs at |4.50 per hundred pounds 
at the beginning of the experiment and at their market value 
of $6.00 per hundred pounds at the close of the experiment, 
they made a net profit of f72.17, which is credited to the 
steers. The price fG.OO is fixed as the market value because 
these pigs were still too small to market. They were fed on 
experiment to July 21, and sold at |7.00 per hundred as reported 
in Experiment VIII, "Corn vs. wheat for pigs on alfalfa 
pasture." 

During the period when alfalfa only was fed as roughness, 
the steers were often in too laxative a condition to produce 
the best results, and the addition of prairie hay and wheat 
straw in the ration overcame this trouble in the second period 
of the experiment. 

The steers which had been summer fed on grain should 
more properly have been sold for beef in early winter, but as 
they were only 18 months old and weighed only 1050 pounds 
when the experiment commenced, November 30, 1901, we desi 
red to feed them through the winter. The main object in 
this feeding was to get a comparison between the cost of 
vr;&gt; i us on long-fed steers and short-fed steers of the same age. 
We also wished to determine how much difference there 
would be in the weight and killing value of yearling steers 
that had been fed continuously for 18 months, compared 
with those that had been on pasture only during the summer 
and were fed for a six-months winter period. 

K worthy of note that these steers consumed a relatively 
amount of grain when compared with ordinary steers 
feed lot. At no time did they consume more than 17 </seg>

            <seg id="p012">
12 


pounds average grain per day, whereas mature steers on full 
feed often consume 24 to 30 pounds of shelled corn and from 
20 to 25 pounds of ground corn per day. See Table III. 

These steers were sold in South Omaha May 8, 1902, by 
ay, Robinson &amp; Company. 

Lots 1 and 2 weighed 1320 pounds average in Omaha and 
sold for $7.10. Lots 3 and 4 weighed 1298 pounds average 
and sold for f 6.90. Deducting the cost of freight, commission, 
shrinkage, etc., which amounted to 23 cents per hundred 
pounds, gave us a net price at the farm of f 6.87 per 100 
pounds on the long-fed and $ 6.67 per 100 pounds on the shortfed 
cattle, which is the price figured in the financial statement. 
These steers were just about 24 months average age 
and were classed as long yearlings. 

PI and 2 had been fed grain continuously from weanle, 
consuming in all 5790 pouuds. Lots 3 and 4 were 
lin during the first winter and again from November 
., to the time of selling. They consumed in all 3685 
i of grain from weaning time to the time they were 

These steers were sold to Cudahy &amp; Company and were 
slaughtered for export. After cooling, Lots 1 and 2, which 
feigned 1320 average alive, dressed 64.48 per cent of their 
ve weight

hundred, or $4.14 for 1976 pounds of grain, which was largely 
corn meal fed during the summer. Had these long-fed cattle 
been disposed of November 1, when they came off grass, they 
would have paid a larger profit than the steers on pasture, 
but the subsequent feeding showed some profit on account of 
the high price per pound at which they were sold, as will be 
seen from the financial statement

CONCLUSIONS. 

1. The gains of Lot 1 on a wheat ration exceeded those of 
Lot 2 on a corn ration by 16 pounds per head in 23 weeks. 

gThe gains of Lot 3 on a wheat ration exceeded those of 
I on a corn ration by 22 pounds per head. This one exlent 
is not conclusive evidence that wheat exceeds corn 
;ding value but indicates that the feeding value of wheat 
)er cent greater than corn for cattle. 

Bhis experiment indicates that a 6-nionths feeding pei 
this case is more profitable than a 12-months feeding 

I This experiment shows a profit of $10.14 per heatl on 
ler-fed yearling cattle compared with $19.63 on cattle 
2 same quality which were on grass only during the sum- 
Taking the statement for the year, the cattle fed 12 
hs show a profit of f 15.49 against a profit of $21.64 on 
attle fed grain during the winter only. 

5. This experiment shows that hogs will make good gains 
following steers fed on Ground feed. </seg>

Experiment IV. 

COMPARISON OF SHELTER AND RATIONS IN FEEDING STEERS. 

E. A. BURNETT. 

In December, 1899, 18 steers were purchased in South 
Omaha for the Experiment Station to test the value of 
rations and of shelter for winter feeding. The three conditions 
imposed were as follows: Six steers were confined in 
open sheds 8 x 14 feet with a yard attached of the same size, 
making a stall and yard 8x'28 feet, in which a single steer 
was confined. This shed opened on the east and was 
protected from southwest winds and partially protected from 
northeast winds. 

Six steers were also confined in box stalls 8 x 12 feet, opening 
to the south. They had no exercise except when driven to 
the scales, and the privilege of a small yard while the stall 
was being cleaned daily. One steer was confined in each 

Six steers were also fed in an open yard 100 x 200 feet in 
dimensions, having an open shed 16 x 24 feet facing south, 
under which they could run at pleasure. They were also protected 
from the north by a shed 85 feet long and 10 feet 
high, a tight board fence 6 feet high along the remainder of 
the north side of the yard. These different yards and pens 
had been built the previous year with a view of determining 
the effect of exposure upon the gains of animals in the feed 
lot, and, though the number subjected to the experiment was 
too small to give definite results, the data secured is 
published. 

It was not thought wise to complicate the experiment by 
too many different rations, and we therefore determined to 
use alfalfa hay for roughness and to use three different grain 
rations, viz., corn meal, corn meal and one fourth oats, and 
corn meal and one fourth bran, as the grain rations to test 
their relative values when fed with alfalfa hay. The results 
of the experiment indicate that more definite information 
on the value of shelter might hare been secured had only one 
grain ration been used. </seg>

            <seg id="p020">

Eie lot of 18 weighed 14,870 pounds at the stock yards in 
ha, December 4, 1899, or an average of 826 pounds. They 
probably yearling steers with possibly one exception. 

These steers were fed alfalfa hay in an open yard until 
December 23, when they were separated into thirteen lots 
and put for one week upon a preliminary period of feeding, 
after which, on December 30, 1899, the experiment period began. 
During the period of 17 days in the open yard the 
steers consumed 3068 pounds of alfalfa hay and 756 pounds 
of corn meal, and at the end of the preliminary period, the 
12 steers in the stalls and pens — Lots 1 to 12 inclusive — 
received daily eight pounds each of grain and from 12 to 16 
pounds each of alfalfa hay. Lot 13 in the open yard received 
daily per head only six pounds of corn meal and sixteen 
pounds of alfalfa hay. As the grain ration increased, the 
hay ration decreased, until — during the latter part of the 
feeding period — the various lots of steers received daily from 
tto 18 and, in one instance, 20 pounds of grain and from 
I 10 pounds of alfalfa hay. 

E correct average weight of the steers was difficult to 
ine, but an attempt was made to secure this weight by 
_ an average of three weights taken on three different 
days as the nearest estimate to the correct weight. This 
method was also followed in securing the last weights used 
in this experiment. The 18 steers were separated as follows :

CONCLUSIONS. 

In these feeding operations, as in all feeding, the large 

gains proved to be the cheapest gains, and these were not 

made by any one ration. All the extremely large gains were 

made by steers in the box stalls in the shed. Four of the six 

steers in the shed made an average gain of 444 pounds each, 

whereas the average gain of the 18 steers was only 350 

pounds. It was also true that the poorest gain made by any 

one of the 18 steers was made in a box stall in this shed by 

No. 9, but it is probable that this was due to the peculiarities 

of the steer rather than to the surroundings. He was never 

a good feeder as he consumed from 100 to 400 pounds less 

grain than the other steers, and was one of the heaviest steers 

outside of No. 5 when they were put into the experiment. At 

this time he weighed 915 pounds, while the six in this shed 

averaged only 860 pounds. </seg>

The average gains of the lots of six steers according to the 
shelter was as follows: 

Six open-shed-and-pen steers made 330 pounds average 

Six box-stall steers made 400 pounds average gain. 

Six open-shed-and yard steers made 315 pounds average 

The average gain by lots oh the same kind of feed and 
under the same condition is given in Table IV, but if we 
average all lots on one kind of feed but under different conditions 
we find the following results : 

Ten steers on corn meal and alfalfa hay made 344 pounds 
average gain. 

Cour steers on corn meal and oats and alfalfa hay made 
pounds average gain. 

Four steers on corn meal and bran and alfalfa hay made 
381 pounds average gain. 

Ei experiment corn meal and alfalfa in the box stall 
largest gain. Corn meal, bran and alfalfa in the box 
e the second largest gain. Corn meal, bran and 
l the open shed and pen gave the third largest gain. </seg>

Experiment V. 

rlSING CALVES FOR BEEF PRODUCTION-SKIM MILK VS. 
SUCKING DAM. 

B. A. BURNETT. 

In the spring of 1899 the Department of Dairy Husbandry 
at the Station undertook an experiment to determine the 
relative profit of milking beef-bred cows and feeding the 
calves from these cows on separator skim-milk and a grain 
ration, compared with allowing the calf to run with it» 
mother until weaning time. Six calves were used in that experiment, 
the results of which are reported in Bulletin No. 
68. All these calves were well-bred grade Herefords except 
Lot 2, which steer was one half Jersey with considerable 
Shorthorn blood, but was a good blocky steer of moderate 
quality. 

The calves that sucked the cows in this experiment were 
weaned December 1, 1899, and on December 9 they were 
transferred to the Department of Animal Husbandry to be 
fed for the purpose of determining what effect their previous 
treatment would have on their value for beef production. 

On December 9, 1899, these calves were divided as follows : 
The skim-milk calves were numbered Lots 1, 2, 3. The calves 
that had run with their dams were numbered Lots 4, 5, 6. 
They weighed as follows : 

El, 435 pounds ; Lot 2, 415 pounds ; Lot 3, 380 pounds : 
je of the three lots fed, 410 pounds; average age, 190 

Lot 4, 390 pounds ; Lot 5, 360 pounds ; Lot 6, 380 pounds : 
average of the three lots sucking cows, 377 pounds ; average 
age, 191 days. 

These calves were carried forward for the next 16 months 
in three periods, as follows : 

Eiriod I, from December 9, 1899, to May 5, 1900, 147 days, 
ng which time they were fed alfalfa hay and a grain 
&gt;n three fourths corn and one fourth bran. 

Period II, from May 5, 1900, to November 3, 1900, 182 
days, during which they were on pasture and received a </seg>

            <seg id="p025">
Feeding Experiments with Cattle and Pigs. 

25 

grain ration of eight pounds each per day, consisting of one 
half corn, one quarter oats and one quarter bran. 

Period III, from November 3, 1900, to April 27, 1901, 147 
days, during which time five animals only were fed, the 
ration consisting of one half corn, one quarter oats and one 
quarter bran, with alfalfa hay and roots. 

Lot 6, a heifer, was withdrawn from the experiment after 
the second period. As she made average gains during the 
first two periods, there is no reason to think from this experiment 
that the calves running with their dams are better 
for beef production than calves fed under the best known 
methods on sweet separator milk and a grain ration to replace 
the fat and solids which are taken from the milk in 
skimming. It will be noted from the first weights that the 
calves that had been fed were heavier for their age at weaning 
time than those that ran with the cows and had pasture 
with no grain. Some difference in quality was visible, even 
at the end of the first winter, in favor of the calves that had 
Ecked their dams, but this could not be detected after they 
d been on grass, and was not apparent at selling time.

1 of seven months, closing the records on November 23, 
when these steers were sent to the International Live 
Exposition at Chicago where they were entered in the 
of Grades and Crossbreds over two years. 

Ethe last feeding period, John, which was the coarser 
growthier steer, made the larger gain and also a some; 
cheaper gain than Curly, owing to the fact that he was 
ipe and thoroughly matured.

Gazette said : "He was a grand good steer, thicker and riper 
than Garcia (the steer which won first prize), not quite so 
well filled in his quarters, but a steer that indicated more 
quality in his flesh." Curly was given second place against 
forty competitors. 

Eirly also took second prize in the class for Grades and 
ises in the Agricultural College Competition with eleven 
petitors, winning over Garcia by whom he was beaten the 
before, but losing to St. Hubert which stood fourth in the

a grade Hereford cow purchased on the range in cen-

idea of his being shown in competition. He came into 
lepartment when he was about six months old and was

he was turned on pasture, where he remained until Novenibe 
2. Again on April 28, 1901, he was placed on pasture, 
where he remained until about August 1. Beginning on May 
4, 1900, the grain ration of this steer was made up of one 
half corn, one quarter oats and one quarter bran. The character 
of this grain ration was not changed from that time 
until about August 1, 1901, a period of about fifteen months. 
After August 1, 1901, he received a small ration of oil meal, 
and during the months of October and November, 1901, he 
received a ration of 50 per cent corn, 20 per cent oats, 15 per 
cent bran and 15 per cent oil meal. During the winter of 
1900-1901 he received alfalfa hay for roughness and about 
ten pounds of mangels per day for a period of nearly five 
months. This steer was never limited in hia supply of roughness, 
and during the last six months of his feeding it was 
necessary to guard against over-ripeness, as will be indicated 
by the rather small consumption of grain between 
April 28 and November 23, 1901. He was fed twice uaily 
until about the first of October, after which time he received 
both grain and hay three times a day. 

It is interesting to note that this steer, during the last two 
years of his life, required 6.6 pounds of grain to produce one 
pound of gain and less than ten pounds of total food to produce 
a pound of gain, not counting the food secured during 
358 days on pasture. This record would tend to show that 
finished cattle can be economically produced if they are so 
fed that they continue to make good gains up to the time 
when they are finished. The killing records show that this 
steer dressed 67.3 per cent, giving a dressed weight of 1,107 
pounds from a live weight of 1,645 pounds, with only 8.21 
per cent tallow and 6.08 per cent hide. The rather heavy 
hide was due to an excejedingly heavy coat of hair and not to 
extreme thickness of the skin. 

E steer is a conspicuous example of the effect of good 
in improving the common cattle of the country. He 
low-down, blocky, thick-fleshed type, which are noted 
ig good feeders, and was a worthy scion of his illustrious 
grandsire, Earl of Shadeland 22d. He demonstrated the 
*that steers of the right type are rent payers, and that 
t lies in continuous growth. </seg>

Experiment VI. 

WINTERING CALVES ON ROUGHNESS. 

E. A. BURNETT. H. R. SMITH. 

K January, 1902, a lot of twelve Aberdeen- Angus calves 
urchased for the purpose of determining how such stock 
be most cheaply wintered and still be brought to grass 
)d condition to go on and make summer gains. These 
i were divided into two lots of six each. 

Lots 1 and 2 were placed under test on January 18, 1902, 
after two weeks of preliminary feeding. 

Bl, six steers, weighed 2950 pounds. They received a 
of alfalfa hay and prairie hay with no grain. 

K2, six calves, weighed 2885 pounds. They received the 
roughness as Lot 1, but in addition received a ration 
r pounds of grain per day. 

The experiment continued until April 20, ¦ period of thirteen 
weeks, when these steers were turned together upon 

Ering hay at |8 per ton, the gains on Lot 1 cost $6 per 
d, while the gains on Lot 2 cost only f4.66 per 

The experiment shows that it is ordinarily more economical 
to feed a small grain ration even when good gains can 

ure in 

i the sa

Feeding Experiments with Cattle and Pigs. 

The character of the roughness should be noted, as the 
too prevalent habit of wintering calves without grain generally 
results in their coming through the winter in bad 
condition and without having gained in weight. From the 
facts at hand, this does not seem necessary when good alfalfa 
and prairie hay are available. A mixture of alfalfa and 
prairie hay was thought to be preferable to alfalfa alone, as 
it prevented scouring, which often resulted when prairie 
hay was not fed regularly. The proportion in which this hay 
was fed, namely, 80 per cent alfalfa and 20 per cent prairie 
hay, seemed to prevent nearly all scouring and to represent 
about the proportion desired by the animals of the quality of 
hay being fed. 

Pber 30, 1902, these steers were weighed again, to dee 
the summer gains. Those in Lot 1 weighed 880 
i each and those in Lot 2, 900 pounds each. Those that 
i grain during the winter had therefore gained 288 
i since April 20, or a period of 192 days, while those 
2 had gained only 234 pounds in that time. 

Although the steers in Lot 1 were only 20 pounds lighter 
October 30, there was yet a noticeable difference in quality. 
Mr. Noe, with Clay, Robinson &amp; Co., South Omaha, estimated 
Lot 1 at |4.75 per hundred and Lot 2 at $5. At these 
figures the steers in Lot 1 are worth (41.80 and those in Lot 
2, $45 each. With pasture at $3 per acre, charging each the 
same rate, we find that the steers in Lot 1 make a net profit 
of $4.74 and those in Lot 2 $5.73 each from April 20 to October 
30, 1902. The steers of both lots will be fed through the 
winter, so the final results will be known a few months

Experiment VII. 

WHEAT COMPARED WITH OTHER GRAINS FOR PIGS. 

H. R. SMITH. 

Forty-eight pigs were divided into eight lots, each lot consisting 
of four of the so-called bacon pigs, Tamworth and 
Yorkshire, and two of the block type, Duroc- Jersey and 
Berkshire. While the pigs were not prime feeders, they were 
divided in such a way as to make the lots fairly even in quality 
and weight. The experiment was carried on in a closed 
shed where each lot had the run of a small pen 8 x 12 feet 
and small yard adjacent 8x16 feet. All pens had cement 
floors, which proved unsatisfactory during the severely cold 
weather. The only way by which the pigs could be kept at 
all comfortable was by keeping them heavily bedded with 
straw so they would not come in close contact with the 
cold cement. 

k Previous to the experiment, all lots had the same ration, 
nsisting" of corn, shorts and wheat. Each lot was put on 
3 experimental ration nine days previous to the first weighing 
so that all should become accustomed to the new rations. 
The experiment was begun October 1, 1901, and closed January 
20, 1902. Table XI shows the feed record, gains and 
profits by lots, and Table XII the average for each pig by lot. </seg>

after weighings were made. 

The wheat for Lot 2 was weighed, then placed in pails of 
water, where it soaked from 18 to 24 hours before being led. 

The whole wheat for Lot 1 was placed in a flat trough. The 
pigs were rather slow in consuming the dry wheat because 
of difficulty in mastication. Many kernels passed through 
undigested. 

One pig in Lot 5 on wheat and rye was off feed for several 
days, which put that lot at a disadvantage. 

All were occasionally fed charcoal and lime, which was 
greedily consumed and seemed to whet the appetite. 

In reckoning the profits of Lots 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, eight 
cents per hundred pounds was charged for grinding wheat 
and rye, and six cents per hundred for corn. These are the 
rates charged in this locality. 

The pigs were sold on the farm at $5.52} per hundred.

Eit, and two of the block type, in this case Duroc-Jereey, 
fattened on corn and the other on wheat, were slaughl 
on the farm. 

Eittle difference was observed between carcasses of wheatand 
carcasses of corn-fed hogs except that perhaps a litnore 
lean meat was noticeable on the wheat hogs. 

¦e larger proportion of lean meat on the bacon hogs was 
apparent. 

The tables show — 

(1) The most economical gains were made by Lot 2, on 
soaked wheat. 

EThe largest gains per pounds of food consumed were 
by Lot 3, on ground wheat, but the gain of this lot over 
is more than offset by cost of grinding. 

The smallest profit was made by Lot 7, on corn alone. ( See 
Table XI.) This is partly due to the fact that corn at this 
time was the highest-priced feed used in the experiment. 
However, the column in Table 2 showing food consumed per 
pound of gain puts ground corn at a feeding value 9 per cent 
below wheat, pound for pound. 

Bund rye is shown to be 2 per cent below corn for feedirposes 
but the cost per bushel in this case, 50 cts. for 
d 55 cts. for corn, puts the rye ahead in the net profits. 

ea drawing general conclusions from this experiment, at:ion 
should be given to the amount of food required to 
luce one pound of gain as well as the column showing 
profits, since the relative prices on these grains vary mately 
from time to time. 

CONCLUSIONS. 

Two important conclusions can be drawn from this experiment, 


E.) Wheat can be profitably substituted for corn in feedpigs 
so long as the price of wheat is not more than nine 
?ent higher than corn. 

R!) In feeding wheat to hogs it should first be soaked or 
md. Of the two, soaking is more economical unless the 
ding can be done for about two cents per hundred 
pounds. </seg>

Experiment VIII. 

CORN VS. VHEAT FOR PIGS ON ALFALFA PASTURE. 

E. A. BURNETT. H. R. SMITH. 

Say 8, 1902, 18 pigs were placed in three quarter-acre lots 
Ifalfa. The pigs were divided so that each lot contained 
pigs approximately even in quality and weight. These 
were a mixed lot of Tamworth and Duroc crossbreds 
had previously run behind experimental steers where 
subsisted on ground wheat and corn droppings, one pig 
ach steer, with one pound of shorts additional. 

Rt 1 was given a ration of ground corn; Lot 2, 95 per

it will be seen that the cost of 100 pounds gain on corn and 
alfalfa was slightly below corn and dried blood, and thirteen 
cents per hundred below wheat.

Bl the wheat been purchased at f 1.06 per 100 and the 
blood at |2.26 per 100, the cost of 100 pounds of gain 
by Lots 2 and 3 would have been the same as in Lot 1 
n at fl.00 per 100. 

While the cost of 100 pounds gain on corn and alfalfa was 
lowest it will be noted that the net profits on both Lot II and 
!.&lt;&gt;t III were greater than Lot I on corn. This seeming inconsistency 
is explained by the fact that the gains on wheat 
and also on dried blood and corn were much greater than 
on corn. This extra gain with an advance in price of f 1.00 
per 100 lbs. accounts for the greater profits on Lots II and 

The addition of five per cent dried blood to corn makes a 
ration containing the same amount of digestible protein and 
the same nutritive ratio as the ration of wheat. It is significant 
that the gains on these two lots were the same. </seg>
