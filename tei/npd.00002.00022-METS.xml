ivalrv of the National Guard, and at the same time 

ikf a alight, though inadequate, provision for the reserve 
animals, which is so much needed in our service. In this 

tion. although possibly not germane to a report such 
is. I would invite attention, iu view of the possible 

necessities of the regular service and of the militia. 

e desirability of some action looking to the obtaining 
• isc statistics, or the taking of a horse census, and to 

tion. if such be possible, to prevent the country from 

lepleted of the animals which will be urgently needed 

¦vent of war. At present there is nothing to prevent 

gents of foreign governments buying all the available 
Ha and shipping them out of the country, and undoubt- 

differeut times large numbers have been so shipj&gt;ed. 
rtainly within the knowledge of many officers, myself 

ncloded, thai the difficulty of obtaining suitable animals for 
he military service has increased in an alarming ratio in the 
¦H-t fifteen years, and when the possibilities of a war in this 

.untrv are regarded, and it is considered what tremendous 
.. &gt;itifs of troops would be required to conduct the opera- 

thereof. and what enormous numbers of aniinnls for 

cavalry, artillery, and the supply departments would be 
needed, the establishment of a horse reserve and of Government 
breeding establishments would seem to be matters of 
the first importance for the military service. The tir.st cost 
of such establishments would undoubtedly be great, but the 
opportunity which is thus offered for utilizing reserve 
horses in training National Guard cavalry is one not to l&gt;e 
neglected. In addition to reserve horses, all those coming
