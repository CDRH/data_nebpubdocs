Experiments with irrigated crops have been carried on at the Scottsbluff Experiment Farm since 1910. The results thus far obtained have furnished some information of value to the farmers of western Nebraska. The suggestions made in this bulletin are based largely on these results. The agriculture of the country is still so new that the greater portion of its problems are yet to be solved, but some facts have been ascertained which will be helpful to the farmers of the region. Guided by these, it is the purpose of this bulletin to suggest methods of produc - ing the more important irrigated field crops of western Ne- IRRIGATION PRACTICE. SOIL RELATIONSHIPS. I In order to irrigate economically, the operator should have c knowledge of the soil in question and a greater knowledge he subsoil. The soil on the irrigated area in Nebraska varies u a very sandy soil to heavy clay. These are underlaid with er sand or clay, and very often both of these materials are id. I A large portion of Nebraska's irrigated area is a sandy loam lerlaid with a very line sand. In some sections this sand is arated from the topsoil by a sheet or layer of Brule clay or I The Scottsbluff Experiment Farm is located on the North Platta imation Project, six miles east of Mitchell and eight miles northwest cottsbluff, Nebr. The tract consists of 160 acres of land, Irrigated the Government canal. About thirty acres are devoted to experl - s in dry land agriculture, and the remainder is irrigated, a wide ity of experiments being conducted with irrigated crops. The work le farm Is maintained cooperatively by the University of Nebraska the U. S. Department of Agriculture, and is under the direction of a rintendent detailed by the Office of Western Irrigation Agriculture, Department of Agriculture. BULL 141 A&lt;;-? KXP STATION OK NEBR VOL.

            <seg id="p006">6 Irrigated Field Crops in Western Nebraska a similar deposit. This varies in thickness from less than one inch to several feet. In other sections there is a soil that is almost pure sand. This is usually underlaid at a greater or lesser depth with gravel. Then there are the heavier clay soils that are most commonly found in the bottom lands. The sandy loam soils with a sand subsoil and those under - laid with a layer of Brule clay are easy to irrigate. The nature •of the topsoil is such that it takes up water very rapidly. Watch - fulness is one of the main considerations, for when the topsoil is saturated further application of water is a waste, as it will be lost by underground seepage. In planting rowed crops on these lighter soils, if the fall given the rows can be regulated, as on a hillside, it may be as much as six inches to the one hundred feet. In fact, all that is necessary is to prevent the soil from washing in the rows. Where alfalfa, grain, or any other solid seeded crop is grown, the same general principle should be followed. The laterals should be placed in such a manner that the fall between the ditches is from six to ten inches for every one hundred foet. t^lay soils do not take up water so rapidly as the sandy i. On these, less slope must be given the rows. If possible, rows should be run almost on the contour. A slope of about or three inches to the hundred feet is enough. I Some of the lands are rolling, others are comparatively sL As the soil, the topography, and the crop vary so much, giition practice necessarily varies to suit particular condi - 18 and crops. CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF THE FARM IRRIGATION SYSTEM. I There are several methods of irrigation, and each method uires its own system. Every irrigated district sooner or ?r adopts that particular method which is best suited to its ds and most efficient for the crops that are being grown. ? method practiced by Nebraska farmers is known as "flood - ." This applies to all drilled or broadcasted crops. Rowed I truck crops are row irrigated. FIELD LATERAL8. Where the land is comparatively level the field ditches mnit be closer together than on a slope. It may take twice as long for water to get from one lateral to another on level land as on a hillside where the ditches are three times as far apart. No rule may be given as to how far apart laterals should be made in </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Irrigated Field Crops in Western Nebraska 7 order to secure the best results. A knowledge of the land, ob - servation, and experience alone can be the guide. On a sandy loam where the general slope of the land is about four inches to the hundred feet, the distance between laterals should be ap - proximately two hundred feet. On clay soil with the same fall. a distance of three hundred feet may be allowed. This is for solid seeding, such as grain and alfalfa. For rowed crops, on land with a similar slope, the distance between laterals may be one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet greater. Under nearly all conditions it is best to have the field ditches a little too close together than too far apart. After the water has moved from one field ditch across a piece of land toward a second field ditch, the waste water can be "picked up" by the second ditch and distributed on the next land. Many irrigators object to close ditches. The only disad - vantage with these is the loss of the use of the land. Compared to this is the advantage of being able to get over the land faster with a light irrigation if need be; a small head of water can be used to better advantage and a large head can be handled with less waste of water. Soil is capable of holding only so much water. When it is saturated the surplus will either run off or pass thru the soil and go downward. This downward movement of the water is especially true where there is a sandy or gravelly subsoil. In order to prevent the abnormal loss of water thru leaching, the ditches must be placed closer together. To describe this condi - tion better: On a comparatively level piece of sod under obser - vation by the Reclamation Service on the North Platte Project, about one and one-half feet of water was applied. The first twelve hours the water had spread about one hundred and seventy feet at the greatest distance from the outlet. The next twelve hours this distance was increased to a scant one hundred and eighty feet. In other words, the water covered one hundred and seventy feet the first twelve hours and only ten feet additional during the next twelve hours. The water was lost thru seepage in the sandv subsoil. tOne of the most objectionable features of allowing water to from one turn-out too long is that the land near the ditch I be soaked unnecessarily deep, while that portion farthest m the ditch may be moistened to but a shallow depth. Field laterals should be well constructed and made large enough to carry approximately twice the volume of water re - /ini"rf&gt;H \ h si 1*11 1p fiplfl 1 1 tpi*i Is t i*f irifld&amp; i list Ihfpp pnoii^h \c\ </seg>

A ditch carrying water at its full capacity is much more difficult To keep in repair than a larger ditch carrying the same volume of water. TURN-OUTS AND CHECKS. From tin* main ditches the water is usually diverted into the laterals by means of either concrete checks or canvas dams.

            <seg id="p010">10 nature and applies to all the field crops commonly grown in western Nebraska. More detailed and specific suggestions are made in connection with the discussion of the different crops. HANDLING VIRGIN SOIL. In beginning operations on virgin soil which is to be irri - gated, it is well to have in mind some fairly definite ideas as to what methods to follow. By a proper handling of this land it is possible to avoid many difficulties in future years. The best season for breaking the virgin sod is in the late spring when the vegetation is in a good growing condition. At this stage the sod will decay very rapidly when turned under. The depth of turning this sod under is usually from two to three inches. The turning is best and most economically done with a "rod breaker." The crop to grow upon virgin soil varies with the local conditions and the general farming scheme. Where alfalfa is the chief crop desired, it is best to work down the new breaking as soon as possible. Keep the land free of weeds until about July, and then prepare the land for seeding. Too much cannot be exercised in preparing the land in order to get it level. Large knolls or depressions will cause much trouble when irrigation begins and also result in some loss of crop. Tf the land is too rough, a scraper or "Fresno" may be - required to cut down high knolls; otherwise a float or level may be used for this purpose. A level is made of two by eight-inch plank. The sides may be twelve or fourteen feet long. One foot from the front end a crosspiece of two by eight-inch material is put in, sloping backward at an angle of about 40 degrees. In the center of the level another crosspiece is put in. This stands at right angles to the sides. Two feet from the rear end a third board is placed in the same position as the first one. For draft bars, rods made with rings at one end and threads at the other end are used. To fasten these rods, a hole is bored in the front board eighteen inches from each end and carried diagonally into the sides. When draft is brought to bear, the tendency will be to draw the sides in and prevent them from spreading, especially on the turn. Two braces are run from the center of the center - board to the corner of the rear board and the sides. A half - inch bolt most be put in just back of the rear board to hold the outside boards from spreading apart. If there is abundant moisture in the soil after it is properly prepared, the alfalfa may be seeded. Should the soil be dry, the land should be irrigated before seeding. The alfalfa is best put </seg>

If the drill has press wheels, so much the better, as this will insure better moistnre for the I Another good method of subduing the virgin soil sod is to w winter wheat on the breaking, or to irrigate the breaking late in the fall as possible and backset it when dry enough jr the irrigation. El mistake often made on new land is that settlers are ous to grow a number of grain crops in succession upon same land, feeling that grain produces the greatest income that a money crop must be grown. Grain does well for two s on virgin soil, but after that the land should be seeded to I Corn is a good crop to grow on new breaking, especially on d where wheat-grass and blackroot are abundant and where s necessary to eradicate these before alfalfa and other crops be grown to advantage. In many ways corn is one of the irable crops to grow on sod land. It is not so essential to the land level for flooding. The cultivation of corn will aid to arge extent toward leveling. The ditching of the corn for gation will carry- the water, tho the land is not very well Bandy soils should be retained in alfalfa as much as possible in order to prevent unnecessary blowing and drifting. Where alfalfa is seeded on new breaking of sandy soil, about three pecks of rye an acre should be seeded with the alfalfa. The rye will afford protection against blowing sand. In extremely sandy sections where the native grass consists of grama and buffalo grass with a slight sprinkling of wheat-grass and sand grass, a good stand of alfalfa may often be secured by seeding directly into this grass with a good disk drill. POSSIBLE ROTATIONS. I The rotation should be such that the labor is well distributed uout the season and that the irrigation water may be used to best advantage. Otherwise, it may be that where a very re area is devoted to one crop all of it may require water at ut the same time. For this reason it is perhaps more essen - under irrigation farming than in the humid section to es - lish a permanent cropping system. As the application of the ter is a comparatively slow task, a portion of the crop may 'er before water is available and applied. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 Irrigated Field Crops in Western Nebraska IL rotation should be planned that calls for a uniform dis - ltion of the water as well as of labor. In formulating a tion several essentials must be kept in mind. For instance, i not well to follow alfalfa with sugar beets, as alfalfa ble interferes with the working of the crop. The volunteer rth also demands a great deal of extra expensive labor that Id not be necessary if beets followed another crop. If grain rown instead of potatoes and beets it may then be possible row corn after alfalfa and let the small grain follow corn, in this manner eliminate to some extent the possibilities of ed grain. Tho alfalfa may be grown on the same land for an indefinite number of years, in good farm practice three or four years of alfalfa on the field is long enough. When the crop is at this age, the land may be plowed to the best advantage. The roots are not so hard and woody but that they will decay rapidly. By Turning under the alfalfa sod the yields of succeeding crops are increased to such an extent that it will more than pay for the seeding of a new field. I Beets should not follow beets more than two years in sueees - 1. The soil may be fertile enough to produce good crops for a nber of years, hut beet diseases and insects will become estab - ed and lessen the yield, and may be difficult to eradicate in are years. This is true also of potatoes. Under no condition t advisable to grow this crop for more than one year on the ie soil. At least one crop should intervene before the field is in used for potatoes. Scab, rot, and other potato diseases tain in the soil for several years and contaminate the crop very I Not more than two crops of small grain should be grown hout a cultivated crop coming in between the second and •d years. Four years of cropping with grains, potatoes, and ts may follow three or four years of alfalfa. ALFALFA. LAND PREPARATION. Previous to seeding alfalfa, the land should be put into the best of shape, with special reference to smoothness of the field. Points that cannot be reached with water will be a total loss for the terms of years that the land is in alfalfa. Too deep plow ing and tillage of the soil preparatory to seeding alfalfa is rather a detriment than a benefit to the crop. If the land has oeen wen piowea previuusiv, a uepiu 01 mite ur nun muirs </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Irrigated Field Crops in Western Nebraska 13 will be sufficient. A good solid seed bed will usually insure a good stand. Iilfalfa should not be seeded unless there is plenty of moisture le soil. It is not good policy to "irrigate up" a seeding of Ifa. This method may be practiced on sand, but sandy loam lay will pack to such an extent that very little of the crop come thru. One of the most important points, therefore, reparing land for alfalfa is to have an abundance of mois - in the soil before the seed is planted. SEED. I^he seed used can usually be secured locally. If not, it is to avoid purchasing that of unknown origin. Seed secured 1 regions north of or from some higher altitude than where to be used is always more satisfactory. Much is written nst using seed from alfalfa that has been irrigated. There i&gt; danger in this respect, for alfalfa that has been irrigated ily does not produce seed, and if it did make seed there Id be no more danger in using this than seed from any other ts under irrigation. I Little definite information has been secured as yet regarding various strains or varieties of alfalfa. There seems to be little difference in yield, altho there is some difference in diness. Some strains of the Turkestan are hardy, but these 1 not make seed in western Nebraska. Several foreign va - ries, especially those of the Peruvian types, were tried at the periment Farm, but none of these was able to resist the iter. Grimm alfalfa was tried, but this did not produce any re hay than alfalfa from locally grown seed. As regards iterkiiling, Grimm alfalfa has not been any hardier than the al variety. Altho some winterkilling of ordinary alfalfa has en place, a total freezing out has not occurred. SEEDING. I There is a great difference of opinion as to the time and thod of seeding alfalfa. There does not seem to be any at" way. Tf the soil conditions are right and the farmer tches the growing crop, a stand of alfalfa can nearly always secured, except when some abnormal condition occurs. The inces of obtaining a good stand of alfalfa are a little in favor seeding without a nurse crop. Either method may result in lure some years. Hum Crop Seeding. — As a nurse crop, all later maturing </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 varieties of grain should be avoided, and the rate of seeding should not be more than one-half to two-thirds the usual rate of seeding the grain alone. About three pecks an acre of wheat, from five to six pecks of Kherson or Sixty Day oats, and about one bushel of barley are maximum rates of seeding nurse crops. I 'here are two methods that may be used in seeding alfalfa the grain. One method is to seed the grain in the usual ner and soon after the grain comes thru the soil cross-drill le alfalfa seed, allowing the seed to go thru the shoe and ing it much shallower than the grain. The objection to ing the alfalfa with the grain thru the shoe is that the L'rain alfalfa will then be crowded into the same drill row. The r method is to seed the grain thru the shoe, but allow the fa seed to scatter on the ground just in front of the disks oes of the drill. The first mentioned method is to be pre - &gt;d. as it puts the seed into the soil without taking any ices of covering the seed too deep. Pie mistake often made with nurse crops is that the grain ded too heavily, thus shading and choking the alfalfa. If crop seeding is to be successful, the alfalfa must be well ed and kept reasonably free from weeds thruout the sea- I Seeding Without a Nuuse Crop.— When alfalfa is to be ed without a nurse crop, the land should be well prepared s to obtain a solid seed bed. In the spring the weeds should illowed to come up and the land thoroly disked before it is ed. Where the land is very weedy, seeding should be delayed 1 a second crop of weeds has sprouted and been killed by ivatiou. The seed may be put in any time from May until middle of August. The later seeding is preferred, as then high winds are not so likely to blow out or cut off the young tiTUBBLE Seeding.— Another method of seeding alfalfa that given excellent satisfaction is "stubble" seeding. After the n is cut. the alfalfa is seeded directly into the stubble. The ble prevents blowing and drifting and also has a tendency old the snow during the winter. The method of preparing stubble for seeding depends upon the condition of the land the type of soil. On the lighter soils seeding may be done directly into the stubble without any previous working. Where the grain is cut high it is necessary to seed into the stubble without disking; f\+ Vipi*t^ jnp t"hp 1 ooho n of\ s tii hi") If* won \(^ R^rionftl v i ntpi*f pi*p wi th </seg>

The chief advantages uch seeding are that a full crop of grain may be secured from land, and that the alfalfa started in the fall has fewer weeds Dntend with in the fall. It also has a good start of the weeds he spring. Rate op Seeding. — The amount of seed used per acre is from twelve to fifteen pounds. If the season is favorable, five to eight pounds of seed per acre will make a good stand. Bather than take the chances of securing a poor stand, however, the heavier seeding is recommended. IRRIGATION. I Young Alfalfa. — Very often alfalfa is seeded on soil that ries only a little more moisture than is necessary to ger - late the seed. The plants may have attained a growth of &gt;ut four or five leaves when they begin to dry up. The general a has prevailed that it is dangerous practice to irrigate these ing plants, as they will be "scalded" when water is applied. s belief is not well founded. There is very slight Iobb due to aiding," unless the water is allowed to remain standing on field for four or five hours at a time while the sun is shining, ten the crop begins to suffer, water should be applied. I The frequency of irrigation depends upon the season. It is t to watch the crop closely and occasionally dig into the soil see how much moisture it contains. Nothing is gained by gating too heavily— in fact it is a loss of both labor and ter. All that is necessary is to keep the young growth in a &gt;d growing condition. I Old Alfalfa. — Old alfalfa should be irrigated as early as sible in the spring after danger of freezing the irrigation :er has been passed, unless the soil is already well supplied h water. Subsequent irrigations should be made after the mval of each crop, unless the weather is so dry as to demand re frequent irrigation. In such cases the water should be •lied at least two weeks before cutting is contemplated. Some were irrigate the alfalfa just before cutting, the contention ng that it will start off the new growth better and that the wns will suffer less from the hot sun. Observations at the jeriment Farm have not shown any ill effects on the crowns in the sun. On the other hand, the moist soil retards the ing of the hay. and, should adverse haying weather set in. </seg>

It is generally be - red that when the plants come well into flower they contain maximum amount of food value, also that they produce the ximum yield. If the new growth is used as a guide to de - mine the time of cutting, the theory is that the crop should cut before the cutter bar cuts off any of the new growth. 1 ti fl i^fl ft i n ct 1 1 1 T *i 4- 1iot*i * id nwii'ill\" fi 1*1 i*£fa fitflQ l Yi \ ii (* t "l osr </seg>

The use of stack covers may prove a profitable tment. especially where the hay is intended for shipment. DISPOSING OF THE CROP. The marketing of alfalfa hay in the western portion of Nebraska is one of the farmer's greatest problems. There are three methods of disposal — shipping baled hay, selling it to local feeders, or feeding it to live stock. It is not always profitable to ship baled hay. When the waste hay from the stacks is con sidered. together with the cost of baling and the high freight rate, the grower is left but a small profit. Unless the hay is in first-class shape it cannot be disposed of on the baled hay mar - ket, except where there is a decided scarcity of feed. I The feeding of hay is the most profitable method of disposing it ; not only because more actual income can be realized per of ha\ . luit ;i!so l&gt;eoanse much of the fertilizing value remains the farm and is returned to the soil as manure. A portion of the growing alfalfa may be disposed of as hog pasture. Hogs running on alfalfa and receiving a small amount of grain in connection pay good returns for the crop. SEEP PRODUCTION. I The growing of alfalfa seed on irrigated land has not re - ed as much attention as it should. This is no doubt due to fact that there is a prevalent idea that seed cannot be grown ler irrigation and if it should grow it is not of high grade. A method of growing alfalfa seed under irrigation is to plant it in rows from 24 to 30 inches apart, seeding as thin as it is possible to get it in the row. This alfalfa is cultivated the same as corn or any rowed crop, care being taken that the soil is not left in big ridges after the cultivation or that much dirt is thrown up against the plants. At the last cultivation, when the alfalfa has attained a height of about eighteen inches, it is well to use rather small ditchers and ditch the rows. Small ditchers are preferred, as these will leave the ground in better shape for the mower. If the crop is in good growing condition up to the time that the flowers set, it is well to defer irrigation until that Time. After this, the crop will need close watching. When seed is setting, a great deal of moisture is taken from the soil. The soil should not be kept too moist, nor should the plants be allowed to suffer for lack of water. By close observation one can soon determine the right amount of water to apply. </seg>

If possible, the cutting le seed should be done in the morning when a dew is on the ts. This will prevent a great deal of shattering of the seed. SUGAR BEETS PLACE IX ROTATION iV8 previously stated, sugar beets should follow some other &gt; than alfalfa. Alfalfa is not directly a detriment to the crop, but a large amount of extra work is required, and the lfa stubble interferes with the beet cultivating machinery, account of the alfalfa stubble, it costs much more to put an lfa field into shape for beet planting than for any other crop. LAND PREPARATION. If alfalfa land is to be used for sugar beets, the alfalfa Id be crowned (plowed shallow, from two to two and a half es) in the fall. If the soil is not too sandy and the danger lowing and drifting not too great, this land should be har - »d in the fall in order to tear out and expose as many of the 'tis as possible. In the spring, just previous to planting the s, the land should be backset — plowed about eight to nine es deep— -and then worked down to a good solid seed bed. I If manure is applied, long, loose, strawy, manure should be ided — not that it will directly injure the crop in any way, rather that the straw interferes with the cultivation. If, rever, manure is to be used, it should be applied in the fall I plowed under. This will give it a chance to decay to some »nt. Inhere grain stubble land is to be planted to beets, if fall ing is not advisable (as, for instance, on soil that has a ?ncy to blow), the land should be plowed as shortly as ble before planting. If the soil is moist at the time of ing, it should be worked down as fast as it is plowed, in r to prevent undue drying out. The land should be put in &gt;od shape as possible with special care to prevent low places dges over the field, as these cause very uneven seeding. As ;t drill seeds four rows at a time, it will readily be seen that neven surface must make a poor seeding, which in turn will t in a poor stand. SEEDING. Beets should be planted as soon after April 15 as the weather </seg>

It has been found at the Seotts - [ Experiment Farm that a 65 per cent stand of beets from planted April 17 produced 5.2 tons more beets an acre than s replanted May 24 that carried 98 per cent stand. If, at the of planting, the soil is too dry, it is best either to irrigate land or to wait until a rain wets the soil thoroly. It is not sable to "irrigate up" beet seed. I There are two methods of planting the rows. The usual tance is rows 20 inches apart. In the other system the dis - ces between the rows are alternately 16 and 24 inches. This PS 24-inch rows for the horses to walk in while working the ts. In ditching for irrigation, only the 24-inch rows are Ei setting the drill for the 16- and 24-inch row planting, the center drill hoes should be close together and the outside the greater distance apart. If this is reversed there will ouble when the cultivator is started thru the rows. I The amount of seed used per acre is from 17 to 20 pounds. ■ larger amount is preferred, as it insures a better stand, ny young plants always die from a kind of damping-off For 9e reasons a heavier seeding is more desirable. Some of the newest models of beet planters have attachments for small ditchers. Where there is no provision for these ditch - ers they may be easily provided for. The ditchers should precede the shoe if possible. This will prevent the covering up of the newly seeded rows. The benefit of the ditching is that in case of heavy rains before the beets are up, these ditches will help to carry off the water. They will help to prevent the soil from blowing. Perhaps the greatest advantage is that at the first cnl - tivation the horses will follow the furrow practically without any attention from the driver. The driver can thus watch the machine more closely and do better work in the cultivation. CULTIVATION. »The first cultivation is usually the most difficult. The plants small, and as a rule the first cultivation precedes the work thinning. Most beet labor demands that the "plant ridge" not more than two inches wide. I Thinning. — In order to facilitate the work of thinning, the t cultivation of the beets should be made with the disk at - aments on the cultivator. Thinning of beets is done in two rs to suit the convenience of the worker. One system is for </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 t person to chop out with a hoe all surplus plants, leaving 1 tufts of plants the desired distance apart, usually from t to ten inches. This process is called "blocking." A ad person follows the one with the hoe and pulls all plants one from the blocks. In the other system, one person does blocking and thinning. For this method a short-handled is used, the handle being not more than one foot long. In case the hoe work is done with the right hand and the thin - with the left. As soon as possible after thinning, the beets should be cul - tivated. The blocking or cutting out of the beets leaves the re - maining plants rather exposed. For this second cultivation, the "knives" are usually made use of on the front bar of the culti - vator and the "duck feet" on the rear bar. it is difficult to say just what attachments should be used on cultivator thruout the season, as this depends entirely upon soil conditions, trash on the ground, and weed growth. It always be found cheaper to secure extra help to keep weeds of beets than to let them get above the crop and then try to them out. If weeds get too numerous or too large before r are cut, it will be necessary to haul them off the field be - the beets can be cultivated. Deep cultivation is not desir - . A thoro medium cultivation, from one and a half to two les deep, gives, as a rule, the best results. I*V&gt;r irrigation the beets should not be ditched too deep. From to two and a half inches is deep enough for most lands. i, however, depends upon the fall of the land. The greater slope, the shallower the ditching should be. Should the soil iard at the time of ditching and the ditchers do poor work, i desirable to place a "bull tongue" or "deer tongue" on the ivator bar directlv in front of the ditcher. When the soil is dry enough after irrigation, it is desirable to cultivate the beets and thereby break the crust made by ir - rigation. When the beets have attained such a size that culti - vation tears off a great many leaves, they should be ditched and left in that condition. In other words, ditching should he the last cultivation given. It may be necessary to irrigate the beets again after the last cultivation. IRRIGATION. From experiments that have been conducted at the Experi ment Farm the best results have been obtained when beets were </seg>

To bring this condition about, the irrigation should i moderate amounts, and the soil should never be so dry as use the plants to suffer from lack of moisture. HARVESTING. At harvest the beets are pulled with a puller and thrown in piles. Six rows are usually put together in bunching. This makes slow and hard work for toppers, as some beets often have to be pulled from beneath others. I A more rapid system of piling for topping is to throw all of beets of six rows into a continuous row, the beets pointing way. and another series of six rows with the beets pointing he other direction. This will leave a space of four-row width *vopn the two rows of beets. A V-shaped float, having about a r-foot spread, run thru this space between the rows of pulled ts will level the soil and clear it so that the topped beets may Most sugar factories require that a portion of the crop be "siloed'" and held at the farmer's risk until called for by the factory. These silos should be long rather than round piles, and should run to a peak. The wider and higher these piles are, the less is the evaporation. The best location for such silos is where the length may be extended any distance desired. When unloading from the wagon it is best to drive along the end of the pile, rather than alongside of it. This will make unloading much easier. About three or four inches of soil should be thrown on the sides of these piles, leaving exposed the ridge or peak along the pile for the purpose of ventilation. Before the soil freezes, the shady side of the silo should be covered with beet tops or straw : otherwise, much of the soil will freeze to the beets, increasing the tare and the difficulty of handling the crop. WHEAT. LAND PREPARATION. Wheat usually follows some cultivated crop, or it may be put on alfalfa breaking. Too much attention cannot be given to the leveling and preparation of the field. Under all condi - tions the seed bed should be good and firm, but not so fine as to cause undue packing after rain, or to encourage blowing in case nf hi&lt;rh winds </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 VARIETIES. ("he spring wheat varieties yielding best in western Ne - ka are Defiance and Ghirka. Hard wheats cannot be n under irrigation, except with extreme care. A hard it receiving too much water will become soft in one year, durum or macaroni wheats should not be seeded on irrigated . The value of these wheats lies in their milling qualities relative high yield when grown on dry land. Irrigation has idency to make these wheats soft and unfit for milling. IAs a winter wheat the Turkey, Kharkov, and Crimean are best. These three are bearded varieties. The winter wheats not fit in very well as a grain crop on irrigated land and for t reason only a small amount is grown. SEEDING. Winter wheat is usually seeded at the rate of four pecks an acre. The time of seeding varies. The best time for seeding is the first week in September, as it allows wheat to make enough growth before winter to cover the ground and thus eliminate much of the soil blowing and drifting in the spring. In case it is impossible to seed the wheat in the fall, the seeding may be deferred until spring. If spring seeding of fall grain is practiced it should be seeded in February. If winter wheat is seeded as late as April it is likely not to produce any grain that season, but merely make a heavy growth of foliage. I Spring wheat should be seeded as early as possible in the ing. If the season is open at the end of March, seeding should done at that time. The crop will not be injured by an inary frost at this time of year. The rate of seeding is ally six pecks to an acre, if used as a grain crop alone, and pecks if used as a nurse crop for alfalfa. I In seeding with a drill it is a great help to seed the grain level land in the same direction as the water will run. The in rows will aid in carrying the water. On hillsides seeding nld be at right angles to the direction of flow, so that the II rows will tend to check the water. CULTIVATION. Should heavy rains or snowfalls form a crust when the wheat is up. it is well to harrow the land crosswise to the way it was seeded. This will check evaporation of the moisture and will delay the need for irrigation for some time. Wheat may be harrowed until it is four to five inches high. Should it be neees- </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Irrigated Field Crops in Western Nebraska 23 sary to irrigate before the crop has exceeded a growth of four inches, it will be found beneficial to harrow the land as soon after irrigation as the soil is dry enough to permit such work. IRRIGATION. EVheat, like other field crops, should be kept in a growing lition thruout the season. Water should not be used to te an abnormal growth, as this will have a tendency to force h straw and perhaps cause lodging of the grain. IVheat should not be irrigated until the condition of the or that of the plants shows a need for water. The former ■st ascertained by digging holes about a foot deep in various ions of the field. If the soil feels moist to the hand, irriga - is unnecessary. Should the crop reach the stage of heading out irrigation, it is then well to watch closely, for at this a great deal of moisture is taken up by the plant. When crop conies into the soft "dough," even tho the soil carries ? moisture, it is best to irrigate and thus avoid any risk of njr poorly filled heads and shriveled grain. As a rule, if n begins to suffer for water when it is in a hard dough e, irrigation will not enable the plant to recover, but will ■ a tendency to start a new growth from the base. HARVESTING AND USE. I Before harvesting, all of the field laterals should be worked en. This may be done with one horse and one section of arrow run back and forth along the ditches. Sometimes a ill drag may have to be used to fill in the ditches. On heavier the ditch banks are gone over with a one-horse fine-tooth tivator. This is followed by a V-shaped device, the wings of ich are wide enough apart to take in both ditch banks. A ce of about a foot is left open at the point of the V. The ee is hitched at the spread end. A set of handles to steady device will be found useful. Ordinarily, two by twelve-inch ferial is used for the construction of this scraper. t Wheat is usually cut before it is fully mature. If allowed jet too ripe, there is considerable loss due to shattering of the in. If the wheat cut in the hard dough stage is well shocked rill ripen in the shock. As soon as the straw is dry and the in has hardened it should be stacked. Wheat that has been eked usually has a much better color than shock-threshed in. The sweat that the stack goes thru brightens the grain. By stacking the grain the chances of loss due to hail and </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 other adverse conditions are avoided to a large extent. After stacking, the grain may be threshed within a week. If not threshed then it should be allowed to stand in the stack at least one month. After the first week it will begin to heat and start sweating. This condition will prevail until about the third week, when it will begin to dry again and be ready for threshing. I As the market for wheat is limited in western Nebraska and prices rather low, much of the crop is used for feeding pur - es. As such, it is more valuable than corn. OATS. I!"he methods of growing oats under irrigation are about the ■ .is those given for wheat. Winter oats will not survive winters of western Nebraska. Oats cannot stand as much in the spring as wheat and should be seeded later. They safely be seeded after about April 10 and may produce ir yield if seeded as late as May 15, whereas wheat or barley ed at such a late date is very likely to be a failure. This n is usually seeded at the rate of two and a half bushels acre. The varieties best adapted are Kherson for early ma - ty, and Swedish Select and New Market for later maturity. Ecase of rush work it will be found that oats can be slighted way of irrigation more than any other crop. Upon irriga - it will recover from the effects of drouth better than any small grain crop. A full crop cannot, however, be ex- I after the growth has been retarded. BARLEY. I Barley is perhaps the most difficult grain crop to grow under gation. It should never follow a small grain crop, altho er grains may follow barley without any apparent ill effects. I Care should be taken in choosing a variety. Many find the is or beards of barley objectionable and wish to grow a rdless or hooded variety. As a rule, the beardless varieties d from 10 to 15 per cent less than the bearded types. I The best varieties of the bearded barley under irrigation in item Nebraska are Scotch and California. The latter variety less desirable than Scotch, as it has more hull and this is lined to be coarse. Furthermore, it does not thresh out a in grain. The Oderbrucker is a good yielding barley, but it y be rather difficult to obtain the seed for any large planting. For some feeding purposes, such as hog feeding, a hull-less </seg>
            <seg id="p025">25 hriyated Field Crops in Western Nebraska Iety may be better, pound for pound, than a hulled barley; thus far the yields obtained with the hull-less varieties do justify their culture. IFhe lund should be prepared for barley the same as for wheat oats, but in order to give the crop a good start the soil aid carry a large amount of moisture when it is seeded. At time should the soil become so dry that the crop suffers, e barley (suffers from drouth, it will not recover. As soon the soil once becomes dry, the crop will begin to head out it may not be more than six inches high. E'he last irrigation is given when the barley is in a soft jh, as a later irrigation will cause a strong second growth, lting in mouldy bundles after the grain is cut. IA8 barley shatters very easily, it should be cut before it is ly mature. This is usually when the grains begin to harden, the straw is long enough, the shocks should be capped to tect them from hail. On account of the spreading beards, n a light hailstorm will damage this grain considerably when the shock. I Barley makes an excellent feed for all live stock, and in tern Nebraska replaces corn to a greater or lesser extent. • feeding cattle, this grain should be ground, if possible. For s. it may be soaked and fed to better advantage than the dry in. When fed to sheep the barley need not be ground, and nay be fed dry. POTATOES. PLACE IX ROTATION All present indications are that potatoes produce th&lt;&gt; best yields when they follow alfalfa. The growth of potatoes is :\lso good to subdue the alfalfa and put the land in shape for future cropping. LAND PREPARATION'. The land may be either crowned in the fall and backset in the spring, or crowned in the spring about two weeks before planting. As soon as the crowns begin to make a new growtb it is well to harrow the land, and backset, and plant as soon as possible thereafter. If too long a time elapses between plowing and planting, the new growth of alfalfa may interfere seriously with the crop before it conies up. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 MANURING. f'here is no serious objection to manuring a potato field, ex - that very often manure harbors insect pests that may be rious to the crop, and as very often the manure pile is used a refuse heap, scab and rot may be carried out to the field contaminate the crop.

Eor mid-seasou varieties the Eureka and Irish Cobbler are g the best satisfaction. In fact, there is practically no ■ence between these two varieties except in name. I For late potatoes there are none that will excel the "Pearl." ho there are many Rural New Yorkers grown in Nebraska, v mature too late. If harvested before they ripen, the skin SEED. For seed stock, a medium-sized tuber should be selected. This is usually a potato weighing about six to eight ounces. The seed is cut so as to have from two to three eyes to the piece. Altho some growers use the seed cutters, a "knife-bench" is pre - ferred. This "knife-bench" is a knife or blade fastened into the end of a board. The workman straddles the board, and cuts the potatoes by shoving them against the blade. The advantage of hand cutting is that a diseased tuber may be more easily ob - served and rejected. The cut tubers are put in sacks, and treated with formalin. The formalin solution is made by mix - ing one pint of formalin with thirty gallons of water. The potatoes in the sacks are immersed and allowed to remain in (he solution for two hours. After the sacks are removed and allowed to drain, it is well to spread the cut tubers on a floor or a clean surface and scatter on these either sulphur or air - slaked lime. This will cover the cut portion and prevent disease organisms from attacking the seed piece in the soil. i Large tubers are preferred to culls as seed stock. Culled ers may lie used if absolutely necessary, but in no case is idvisable to use them several years in succession, as this con - ned use has a tendency to cause the stock to deteriorate. ! use of immature seed is yet in the experimental stage and enough data are at hand to draw any conclusions from the •k.

In many localities the dropper style of ter is preferred, for, as a rule, even planting is obtained and danger of carrying scab or other disease by means of the ers from one piece to another is reduced. I he distance apart of the rows is varied by the growers, mon distances are thirty-six inches for early varieties and r and forty-two inches for late varieties. It has been fonnd convenient at the Experiment Farm to plant both early late potatoes forty inches apart. This distance gives enough i for cultivation and ditching. The thirty-six-inch rows d the ditchers and disturb the tuber bed and the roots, which &gt;t conducive to the best results. The distance apart in the rows depends largely upon the fertility of the soil. As a rule, the hills should be fifteen inches apart. If it is found at harvest that the tubers are too large and overgrown they should be planted closer together in the future. A large tuber is, as a rule, coarse and undesirable for the market. ■For the main crop, potatoes are planted from May 5 until le 1. Tt is not well to plant late varieties as late as June 1. ?arly frosts may cut the crop short. CULTIVATION AND IRRIGATION. I Cultivation should begin a few days after planting, using a shovel cultivator and running this as deep as possible. The els are set so that a decided ridge will be thrown over the The more thoro the first cultivation, the easier will be the eeding cultivations and the ditching. When the cultivation ompleted, it is well to harrow the field to prevent undue ng out of the ridges. After heavy rains, it is desirable to ow the potatoes to break the crust. When the plants have ined a growth of about six inches, regular cultivation should n. It is unnecessary to cultivate as deep on the lighter soils n the heavy soil. In the cultivation it is well always to try lirow some soil on the ridge and thereby lessen the work of tiing. On heavy soil it has always been the custom to ditch the potatoes as deep as possible in order to get the irrigation water below the tuber bed. On such soils the water has a tendency to go laterally and upward to a large extent and thereby moisten the entire ridge. The lighter soils of this state do not carry the water so well, and a shallower ditching is required. The lighter the soil the shallower should be the ditching. No prescribed </seg>

The tubers are located near the top of the soil. The feeder roots are beneath these tubers. The furrows should be deep enough so that the running water will be about an inch or two below the tubers. As a rule this depth will be somewhere be - tween seven and ten inches below the top of the ridge. inhere are a number of theories as to when potatoes should rrigated. One custom often followed is not to irrigate until plants come into bloom ; another is to delay irrigation until tubers set. Altho it is not well to irrigate too heavily be - the tubers set. the vines should not be allowed to suffer for t of water. As a rule, if the soil carries considerable niois - to a good depth at planting time, irrigation may be delayed I the flowering or setting period. On the other hand, should vines show signs of suffering, water should be applied re - lless of the stage of development the plant is in at that time. I After potatoes have been irrigated, cultivation should follow noon as the surface soil is dry enough to permit such work. 8 may be done with a one-horse cultivator, as it is only to !\k the crust and check evaporation. Close observation is nired from now on. The soil should never be allowed to be - ip very dry. or the tubers will be checked in their growth, •uld their growth be checked and rains or irrigation water rt new growth, a rough, knotty tuber is the result. HARVESTING. I The crop should not be harvested until the tubers are mature, tnrity cannot always be judged by the vines. It is safest to mine the tubers. Tf the skin is "tight" the crop may be vested. It is desirable to allow the potatoes to remain on the und about a half day after digging. This allows the skin to better and reduces the danger of peeling. K Potatoes are sorted according to market demands. Aa a rule ly varieties are run over a one and a half-inch screen, and ■r varieties over a one and three-fourths- or a two-inch screen, ending upon the demand of the market. CORN. LAND PREPARATION. Eand for corn should be prepared about the same as for toes or beets, except that it need not be so level as for the crop. Corn does well after iilfalfa. and if this crop fits into </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 the general farming scheme on a general farm where neither heets nor potatoes are grown, corn might well follow the alfalfa crop. This will to a certain extent put the soil in good shape for the following year and lessen the danger of lodged grain. If manure is to be applied, it may be put on as a top-dressing any time from the time of planting until the plants get four n&gt; five inches high. It the field is top-dressed after the corn is up t5. — A plat of calico corn in the irrigated rotation experiments. Corn has yielded an average of 62 bushels per acre during the past two years.

I Should the soil be too dry, it is best to irrigate before plant - : It is a great mistake to plant into dry soil and take chances rains to bring up the crop. To irrigate it up is a much greater </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Irrigated Field Crops in Western Nebraska 31 expense than a previous irrigation. Furthermore, a poor stand usually results from such an operation. SEED AND SEEDING. tocal varieties should be used for seed. Seed secured from a ince or from an unknown source should be planted with ion. Rome of the local varieties of calico or of white or &gt;w dent may be used with good results. All seed corn should ?sted for germination before planting, and nothing but the seed should be used. It is much better to plant heavily and out than to plant thin and have a poor stand. The distance of ting depends to a large extent upon the fertility of the soil. I rule the rows are forty inches apart with plants eighteen es apart in the row. CULTIVATION AND IRRIGATION. I After planting, the field should be harrowed. This is valuable ?ultivation and as a means of obliterating the planter marks prevent ground squirrels from digging up the seed. When corn is up it may be harrowed instead of inter-tilled until 8 about six inches high. Cultivation and the cutting of weeds uld not be neglected. If possible, the crop should be carried u without irrigation until it begins to silk and tassel. At i time it should receive a good irrigation, unless rains have mdantl.v supplied the soil with moisture. At no time should a growth be forced by irrigation. This would bring about an abundance of leaf and stalk growth and retard the setting of ears. The least possible amount of water to keep the plant in a growing condition will produce the beet corn and the largest quantity of sound ears. USES. The largest profits from corn may be realized by feeding it to live stock, specially hogs. Where it is not possible to hog down the corn and it has to be harvested, care should be taken to see that it is thoroly dry before it it shucked. As but a few farmers have corn bins, wire bins should be made for storing in preference to piling the corn on the ground. The wire bins cost little and are made by setting posts in a circle about four feet apart. Tt is well to secure a close mesh wire and bring it around the outside of the posts. Tf long posts are used and the bin is more than five feet lii &lt;r h the onnosite i&gt;osts should be held with </seg>

Larger bins may cause heating. tf a field is so that all of it. or a portion of it, may be fenced the crop hogged off, the cost of harvesting may be saved, larger returns secured. Tests at the Scottsbluff Experiment n have given a total of thirteen pounds of pork for every iel of corn hogged off. A yield of forty bushels may be red nearly every year unless hail or other storms ruin the . At this rate of gain, ."20 pounds of pork may be produced i one acre of corn. Wherever the railroad facilities are such that it costs a large share of the crop in order to bring the product to market, the crop, if fed to live stock, can be disposed of to much better ad - vantage. The lamli and sheep feeding industry is assuming large proportions, as is also the cattle feeding work. All of the grains grown may be fed to these animals at a better profit than may be secured if shipped or sold to local dealers. </seg>
