            <seg id="p002">SUMMARY The experiments of 1922 with poisoned baits for grasshoppers, based almost entirely upon the reactions of the two-striped grasshopper (Melano - plut bivittatusi. may be summarized in the following more or less tentative conclusions: Beet pulp, used as a base, tho 50 per cent cheaper than wheat bran, is only about 66 per cent as attractive, and fresh horse manure has about the same degree of attractiveness as beet pulp. Wheat bran is, therefore, recommended for use as the base. Fresh leaves, tho 22 per cent more attractive than bran, are impracticable to use as a base. Baits containing white arsenic are distinctly (8-10 per cent) more attractive than baits containing Paris green, and are very much (25-35 per cent) more attractive than baits containing crude arsenic. Calcium arsenate is very distinctly (18 per cent) more attractive than Paris green. Paris green is, for use on a large scale, too expensive, costing over three times as much as white arsenic, while only 5 per cent or 6 per cent more efficient; and calcium arsenate, which about equals white arsenic in effi - ciency, has its somewhat greater attractiveness offset by its one-third greater cost as compared with white arsenic. Crude arsenic is slightly more efficient than Paris green and distinctly more efficient than white arsenic or calcium arsenate. and is even slightly cheaper than white arsenic, but it has a deterrent effect when used in a grasshopper bait that makes its use less preferable, on the whole, than the use of white arsenic. Crude arsenic kills the poisoned grasshopper very quickly. Paris green much less quickly, white arsenic a little more slowly than Paris green, and sodium arsenite and calcium arsenate considerably more slowly than white arsenic. A fine light grade of white arsenic is. on the whole, to be recommended for use as the poison in grasshopper baits when a dry poison is used. Arsenite of soda, made by boiling white arsenic and sal soda, forms a very efficient poison in grasshopper baits, more efficient in our test than any of the dry poisons, and is to be recommended f( Bran mash without a special attractant added is attractive, but a good special attractant increases the attractiveness of the bait Molasses not only does not increase the attractiveness of the bait but apparently reduces it somewhat, and adds materially to its cost. Soap also adds nothing to the attractiveness of the bait, but rather reduces it. Salt seems to be a detriment to the attractiveness of the bait when used against young grasshoppers, but when used against old grasshoppers it makes the bait slightly more attractive. Anise oil not only does not attract the grass - hoppers but seems to repel them. Citrus fruits form a very good attract - ant, oranges being slightly (5 per cent) more attractive than lemons but greatly (30 per cent to 50 per cent) more expensive. A very large amount of orange pulp in the bait, as when some of the ready-prepared baits are used, forms a bait of maximum attractiveness. Banana oil is slightly more attractive to young grasshoppers than lemons and is only about one - fourth as expensive, used on the basis of 3 ounces as the equivalent of 6 lemons; used against adult grasshoppers banana oil is slightly less at - tractive than lemons, but is so much cheaper that its consistent use is ordinarily to be recommended. The baits should always be scattered as early in the morning as pos - sible. The grasshoppers do not feed freely in cool, cloudy weather, so bait should not be spread under such conditions. Young grasshoppers are more susceptible to odors and are more easily attracted to odorous baits than mature grasshoppers. They are, however, more resistant to ar - senicals than are adult grasshoppers, gradually dying on the third to fifth day, while the adults die very rapidly on the third and fourth days, after eating the poisoned baits. </seg>

WEHR' Altho more or less injury to field crops, particularly to al - falfa, small grains and corn, by nonmigratory grasshoppers takes place in Nebraska every year, this injury is greatly augmented • luring very favorable seasons, and is likely to be very persistent in certain localities where especially favorable conditions prevail. Thus, following the general grasshopper outbreak in the years 1910 and 1 1* 1 1 , involving most of the State, injury by these pests matly subsided in most localities and has on the whole remained I.-- intense up to the present time, tho showing decided tendencies to a recrudescence in the years 1915, 1918 and 1919. In fact, during the past three years (1920 to 1922, inclusive) extensive and serious injury by grasshoppers has been largely confined to the irrigated districts of the North Platte valley, in Sioux, Scotts lilutf and Morrill counties, tho there have been numerous com - paratively mild local outbreaks in various other parts of the State during these vears. The grasshopper situation in this irrigated district of the North Platte valley has been very serious and persistent for sev - eral seasons past. The large amount of compact, well-drained, often weed-covered, uncultivable soil in the ditch banks forms an ideal place in which the grasshoppers may lay their eggs, and ;iIm&gt; for the eggs laid there to winter successfully, while the ad - jacent heavily cropped fields of alfalfa and small grains provide an abundance of preferred food for the grasshoppers, from the time of their hatching until their maturity. By 1918 the grass - hoppers had Income so destructive in this part of Nebraska that the North Platte Valley Water Users' Association secured the services of a special agricultural agent to devote his entire time to the problems surrounding the control of grasshoppers and other pests in Sioux, Scotts Bluff and Morrill Counties. In 1919 a Pest District Law was passed by the thirty-seventh session of the Nebraska Legislature (S. F. No. 151), and that law, together with a new law passed by the fortieth session of the Nebraska legislature (H. R. No. 368), which supplanted it in 1921, has provided for compulsory pest control in this district for the past four vears. 'These experiments were planned and the results prepared for publication by the vnior author, while their actual execution was the work of the junior author during the period from June 13 to August 17, 1922. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 183 The special agent of the North Platte Valley Water Users' Association in 1J&gt;1» adopted a formula for preparing a poisoned bait for grasshoppers.

It was realized that some of these questions had l&gt;een an - swered more or less definitely in connection with certain species of grasshoppers in other localities, but the evidence at hand seem - ing to indicate that grasshoppers are very capricious in their food habits, so much so that results obtained in one locality would not MGMMrily be true of another, and that a considerable variation in this respect according to local climatic conditions and the species and age of the grasshoppers concerned is to l*&gt; exacted {?&gt;Y. these preliminary experiments were deemed necessary in order to learn the facts concerning the behavior toward poisoned l&gt;ait~ of the two-striped grasshopper (MelanopluK bivittatus), the dominant species of that locality during 1922 in the North Platte vallev of Nebraska.

(New Scotts Bluff County mash.) The method employed to determine the relative attractiveness of the baits prepared according to the twenty-two formulae just given was, in general, a modification of the methods used by Mor - rill (2) and by Parker and Seamans (7). A level place was selected in an alfalfa or grain field well infested with the domi - nant species, the two-striped grasshopper (Mrlanoplus bivittatug). Small hatches of the baits were made up in' accurate proportions, l&gt;v the careful weighing of all ingredients. They were all ready to place in the field before 8 :00 a. m. Two pounds, by weight, of each one of the baits to be tested were, placed in a round tin pan 10 inches in diameter and 1 inch deep. These pans were arranged in a wide circle at a place where the grasshoppers were numerous in an open area, as along the edge of a ditch bank, or else at a place from which the vegetation had been cleared away, in order that they could be seen from a distance. The observer then re - tired to a sufficient distance (20 to 30 feet) so that the grasshop - pers would not be interfered with from naturally approaching the pans. Beginning at 8:05 a. m. and continuing thru the day at in - tervals of 5 minutes, the number of grasshoppers on each pan, or within a distance of 6 inches of it. was recorded. A 6-power binocular field glass was used in making these counts, to insure accuracy. The relative position of the pans was changed every 2 hours, that is, at 10 .00 a. m., 12 :00 m.. 2 :00 p. m. and 4 :00 p. m., the record for the day closing at fi :00 p. m. The total number included in these counts during the 10-hour period was then totalled, and this was taken as an index of the attractiveness of </seg>

These tests were divided into - 2 series, one including formulae 1 to 10 inclusive, and the other including formulae 1 and 11 to m 2l inclusive. By repeating formula 1 in each series, a standard of comparison between the two series was established. All of these tests were carried out at the Scotts Bluff Experiment Substation, except those of August 9. 11. 15 and 17. which were carried out on the homestead place of Mr. J. A. Holden. Super- intendent of the Scotts HlurT Experiment Substation. This method adopted is. of course, ojh'ii to some criticism, but it seemed to us the must reliable that could l&gt;e worked out with the facilities at hand. It would no doubt have given more ac - curate results to have counted only those grasshoppers actually ol»served to feed on the l&gt;ait&gt;. but where 10 or more different baits were under observation at one time and the young grasshoppers were at the pans in numbers, frequently over a dozen and some- times a- many a* •'!(• or +&lt;i to a pan. that method was not prac- ticable. Hence all grasshoppers on the pan- or within •'« inches of them were counted, without noting whether tlicv were actuallv feeding or not. tlio of course many of them were. P&gt;\ counting a]l of the grasshoppers at the pan- regularly, at 5-minuta in tervals. the baits were measured not only a^ to their initial ubilitv to attract the grasshoppers to them, but alx&gt; as to their ability tt hold the insects and probably to induce them to feed Another objection to thex- tests is the fact that &lt;ria&gt;-hoppe naturally seek open ami slightly elevated spots t&lt;&gt; roost, especial] »pers lallv in the morning when the warmth of such open spots attracts them, and the o[K'ii cleared area- on which the pans were plaetd would naturally attract a certain number of young grasshoppers, regardless of the bait*. By test- it was ascertained, however, that the number visiting the pan- for thi&gt; reason was much less than the number that actuallv did visit the baits. A pan \\a- tilled with dirt, fresh alfalfa was scattered over the dirt, and the pan was then placed in the. circle with the pan- of bait.

On June 1\. formula 20, a bait composed of fresh, chopped alfalfa, turnip and radish leaves (these being favorite food plants of the two-striped grasshopper) , white arsenic, banana oil, cattle molasses and water, was prepared and tested along with baits prepared according to formulae 1, % 1. 4.

Hi u.etin 1(S3 Is beet pulp or horse immure a satisfactory substitute for bran as a bate f Inasmuch as beet pulp is an available product of the beet sugar factories in the North Platte valley, and only about one - half as expensive as bran, it was being used more or less as ;i l&gt;a-. - for grasshopper baits by the farmers of the valley to partly or wholly replace the bran in the regular formula. Formula 17, a bait made up like the standard bran mash except that 15 pounds of beet pulp was substituted for 23 pounds of bran, was prepared and tested in competition with standard bran mash. It proved to be only OG per cent as attractive to grasshoppers as bran, prob - ably partly because it was tiK&gt; coarse to mix and scatter well and partly because it dried out much faster than bran, as well as pos - sibly other reasons, including reduced palut ability. It did not, therefore, form a satisfactory substitute for bran. Horse manure has long l&gt;een used in the Criddle mixture as a lm-e. and is usually available on farms in quantity, so formula 18, made up of fresh horse manure. Paris green, salt, lemons and water, was prepared and tested in competition with formula 12, of the same composition except that bran was substituted for the horse manure. Formula 18 proved to 1h&gt; only 65 per cent as at - tractive to grasshoppers as formula VI. thus indicating horse manure to be no more satisfactory than Ixvt pulp when ii~«'d in grasshopper baits, as compared with bran.

In other words, 6 lemons and 3 ounces of banana oil are about equivalent in attractive value, so that choice between the two attract ants devolves largely upon cost. Since banana oil is only about one - fourth as expensive as lemons, involves no cutting and grinding in its use. and has the added virtues of comparatively small bulk and excellent keeping power, it is obvious that on the whole banana oil is a better attractant to use, under our conditions, than lemons, at least early in the season when the grasshopper- are immature.

It will be noted that the grasshoppers succumbed more slowly in the tests of July 5 to 13, gradually dying on the third to fifth day after eating the poisoned bait, while the grass - hoppers in the test of August 7 to 14. all of which were adults, died very rapidly on the third and fourth, and especially the third, day after eating the poisoned bait. This indicates the greater resistance to arsenicals of the immature grasshoppers as compared to the adults. The alM)ve tests also show the varying effect of the different arsenicals in respect to the rapidity with which the grasshoppers siiccumU'd after ingesting the poison. Taking as a basis the ihiiiiImt of live grasshoppers placed in the cages the day after they had eaten the poisoned bait in the field, we find that those which had ingested calcium arsenate (formula 15) died but slowly, only 1 1 per cent being dead on the third day, 20 per cent on the fourth day and 43 per cent on the fifth day following the eating of the bait. The grasshoppers that had ingested sodium iirsenite (formulae 14 and 22) died on the average a little more rapidly than those which had eaten bait containing calcium ;trsenate. 14 per cent being dead on the third day, 25 per cent on the fourth day and 65 per cent on the fifth day. The grasshop - |hts that had eaten baits containing white arsenic (formulae 2, 6, 19 and 21) died on the average more rapidly on the third and fourth days after eating the poisoned bait, as compared with the grasshoppers poisoned with sodium arsenite, 34 per cent being dead on the third day, 51 per cent on the fourth day and 62 per cent on the fifth day. There was no enormously increased mor - tality on the fifth day. as with the grasshoppers that ate sodium arsenite. Paris green killed the grasshoppers a little more rap - idly, on the average, than white arsenic, the grasshoppers that ate baits containing Paris green (formulae 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 16 and 17) dying at the average rate of 36 per cent on the third day, 46 per cent on the fourth day and 69 per cent on the fifth day. Baits with crude arsenic killed very rapidly, and the grasshoppers that ate baits containing that poison (formulae 3 and 7) died at the average rate of 71 per cent on the third day, 84 per -cent on the fourth day and 87 per cent on the fifth day. </seg>

The crude arsenic used by us was a tine, light, fluffy powiler. mixing well with bran, and not the coarse, granular grade that has sometimes been found unsatisfac - tory in the use of poisoned baits for grasshoppers, for instance a - reported by Davis (4). It may 1m- here mentioned that Ford (§) has shown that poisoned grasshoppers consume but little food. only one-seventh to one- thirteenth a&gt; much as unpoisoned pM hoppers, until their death.

Arsenite of soda is very poisonous, as the experiment?, demonstrate. The new formula (2-2) differs from the old formula of the Scottshluff mixing plant in that, to make enough to poison 25 pounds of bran, 2.8 ounces more of white arsenic is boiled witli 1% pounds more of sal soda, to make the sodium arsenite solution, while the V 4 ounce of anise oil is replaced by % ounce of banana oil, and the molasses is increased from 4 to &lt;&gt; quarts. With little doubt the small percentage of kill of the old formula (4i» per cent) as compared with the new formula (75 per cent) was not due so much to the slightly weaker sodium arseuite solution in the old formula as to the fact that it was scented witli anise nil. which, as our experiments have shown, acts more as a deterrent than an attractant. and the grasshoppers did not eat the bait treated with it to any great extent. The cost of the new formula, omitting the molasses and allowing 13 cents for the white arsenic ■24 cents for the sal soda and 2 cents for the banana oil would be about 39 cents, while if the banana oil were increased to :5 ounces, as probably would 1*&gt; wise, the cost would amount to 44 rent-. which, considering the efficiency of the formula, would place it among the most satisfactory of our grasshopper bait&gt;. mi far a* they are at present understood.

It was observed that toward evening the grasshoppers crawled up toward the top - of the alfalfa, small grains, or weeds, to roost for the night. In the morning, beginning about 5 :00 a.m.. while the air vh yet quite cool, the grasshoppers began feeding slightly while remain - ing up on the stems where they had passed the night. They con - tinued this from 30 to 45 minutes, and then, as the temperature of the air began to rise, they began working toward the ground. By fi:00 a. m., if the day was clear, most of them would have left the stems and gone to the ground. They would then l&gt;egin to feed near the ground, their voracity increasing as the temperature rose. Feeding was at its height from i» :00 a. in. to 10 :00 a. ni. After 10:00 a. m. feeding activity diminished somewhat, but the insects continued to feed freely until 3:30 p. m. to 4:00 p. m. By that time the movement to crawl upward toward the top of the vegetation began, and it continued with increasing impetus as evening approached, so that there was a steady and fairly rapid </seg>

By 6 :00 p. m. the bulk of the grasshoppers had ascended the vegetation more or less, tho continuing to feed some. These variations in feeding for the hours from 8 :00 a. m. to 6:00 p. m. are well reflected in the following summary of the number of grasshoppers observed at the baits in the pans used in the attractiveness tests. Series 1 includes formulae 1 to 10 inclu - sive, and series 2 includes formulae 1. 11 to 16 inclusive and 18 and 1!&gt;. The suinmarv follows: Hours Series 1 Series 2 Total 8:00-9:00 a. m 562 1415 1977 The drop in the number of grasshoppers visiting the pans during the hours from 12:00 to 1 :00 p. m. as compared with the four preceding hours and the three following hours is due to the fact that the observer took out a short time for lunch during that hour. Consequently there were somewhat fewer counts made and no diminished feeding on the part of the grasshoppers during that hour is implied. The results agree in general very well with those found by Morrill (2) in his observations on the feeding habits of the differential grasshopper ( M elanophis differentialis) in Arizona and with those found by Ford and Larrimer (11, 12) in connection with the red-legged grasshopper in Indiana. The above behavior was that observed on an average clear, warm day. If the day started out clear but turned cloudy, in a few minutes after the sun was obscured the grasshoppers would In-jjin migrating to the stems of the adjacent vegetation, or to the bait pans, or to any other object upon which they could roost, where they would remain, apparently feeding but very little, until the sun again came from behind the clouds. The same be - havior was observed if the surrounding air became cooler for any cause, even if the sunlight was not obscured. On cloudy, cool days the grasshoppers did but little feeding all day, tho if the sun came out and the air warmed late in the afternoon after a cloudy, cool period extending over most of the day, the grasshop- j&gt;ers at once began to feed vigorously.
