            <seg id="p003">The Incidence of Avian Tuberculosis in Mammals other than Swine By L. VAN ES AND H. M.« MARTIN A few years ago the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station undertook an investigation for the purpose of de - termining, if possible, the cause of the manifest increase of the incidence of tuberculosis among swine, j This investiga - tion was terminated early in 1925 and the results were pub - lished by the Station (53). It was shown that the type of swine tuberculosis largely responsible for the increased number of retentions at the abattoirs was in a conspicuous manner (88.5 per cent) due to infection by the avian variety of the tubercle bacillus. Not only did these results indicate a marked susceptibility on the part of a mammal to avian tuberculosis, but they likewise reflected the| widely spread distribution of tuberculosis among the poultry of the region to which the investigation pertained. Concrete evidence of the latter fact was more recently shown by Hays (17, 18), who reported the tuberculin testing of 40,073; fowls belonging to 291 flocks in four precincts of three different counties of Nebraska. The test caused positive reactions in 3,760 fowls, 9.3 per cent of the total number tested. The disease was found to be present in 216 (74.3 per cent) of the 291 flocks examined. The investigation having to do with the origin of swine tuberculosis not only showed that avian infection has an im - portance extending beyond the poultry yard, but was warrant also for the suspicion of a potentiality for mischief in other mammals. If tuberculosis could be so readily transmitted to swine, it did not appear to be beyond the range of possibility that cattle also might acquire tuberculous disease from an avian source, a factor which would certainly have to be reck - oned with in the technique of eradication of the bovine disease. The recognition of a yery widespread and intense distribu - tion of avian tuberculosis on the farms of a wide area of the United States, as well as the involvement of a mammalian species also, brought to the foreground the question whether or not the great prevalence of poultry tuberculosis could be of importance also from a public health point of view. This phase of the problem not only pertains to the people on the farms but likewise is of fundamental importance to the con - sumers of poultry produce. European authors had already identified the avian tubercle bacillus in human lesions, while in this country careless speakers outside the profession of </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 49 medicine and irresponsible journalists had made more or less sensational statements on the subject: The alleged public health phase of avian tuberculosis was regarded as warrant for an attempt to acquire more definite information on this subject. The importance of the problem arising from the wide - spread distribution of avian tuberculosis and its demonstrated communicabihty to at least one mammalian species of eco - nomic importance justified an extension of the investigation and hence the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station undertook the inquiry, the results of which are set forth in the following account. The investigation was particularly concerned with the oc - currence or nonoccurrence of tuberculous disease caused bv the avian strain of the B. tuberculosis in cattle and in mari Efforts were also made to secure tuberculous material from other mammalian species. Nearly all the bovine material used for the purpose of typing consisted of tuberculous lesions placed at the Station's disposal thru the courtesy of various inspectors m charge at federally supervised abattoirs For the human tuberculous material, medical practitioners, clinics and organizations having to do with tuberculosis were ap - pealed to. That these appeals were not in vain will be scon from the data submitted in this report. In one investigational series lesions found in birds were also subjected to typing experiments for the purpose of control of the typing technique followed and incidentally to find an answer to the question whether or not chickens may contract tuberculosis thru contact with tuberculous mammals- When the project was nearly completed, another series of exne-i - ments was devoted to determining the typing behavior of tubercle bacilli associated with generalized cases of bovine « 3 S al - S ° Served as a contro1 experiment withh^L a i g " lde in T th e. interpretation of results obtained \iith human lesions In the typing experiments here reported the classification of bacillary types was based upon the dif - ferences in pathogenicity shown by the bacilli present in the material examined.

As the principal object of this investigation could be attained by the differentiation between </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Avian Tuberculosis the avian and mammalian bacillary strains, the error factor in typing as indicated could not be a very considerable one, and furthermore an abundance of evidence was deemed to be preferable to a reduced volume of data obtained by a more cumbersome, altho more exact, mode of procedure. The routine of the typing experiments consisted of a trituration of the lesions received, the suspension of all or part of the material in physiologic salt solution, and its in - jection into the animals used for typing. The selection of the latter was based upon their differences in susceptibility toward the three principal sti'ains of tubercle bacilli in ac - cordance with the facts revealed by previous investigations. This susceptibility may be expressed by the following schedule: Bacillary strain Degree of infection shown by Cavias Rabbits Fowls ■;...■.■'■ '•■•:■■.;■ i ■! i Bovine : + + + + + 4- 1 O Human _++_+ + ° .- " ; r~i Avian | O 1 + + + ! + + + Rabbits were not used in all of the series. As a rule the use of guinea pigs and fowls is quite sufficient to differentiate between aviah and mammalian bacillary strains. The rabbits are, however, essential when differentiation between the two mammalian types is contemplated, and this species is also valuable when positive evidence obtained in fowls requires further support on account of a doubtful origin of the latter. Not less than two animals of each species were injected and they were killed at the end of 90 days unless they died spon - taneously or had to be destroyed for various reasons. THE TYPING OF BACILLARY STRAINS ASSOCIATED WITH TUBERCULOUS LESIONS IN BIRDS The material used in this series consisted of 110 consign - ments of tuberculous lesions of avian origin. In five of these it was not possible to demonstrate living tubercle bacilli and all inoculations yielded negative results. Analyzable results were obtained from 105 consignments originating in different localities. With the exception of two consignments of turkey lesions and another set from a pigeon, the material examined originated in the common fowl. Here follow the details of the typing experiments pertaining to this series. </seg>

A Yersin type of tuberculosis was noted in each bird Classification of infection type: Mixed. Due to these findings it seemed advisable to ascertain whether the lesions in the cavias were the result of a mixture of mammalian and avian bacilli or mammalian bacilli only. Its determination was under - taken by inoculation with material from each cavia. The material from one of the cavias was injected into cavias and fowls. The suspension prepared from the second was injected into cavias, rabbits, and fowls. Inoculation Results Cavias— The first cavia died 38 days after injection and at the end of 53 days all the cavias were dead. The four animals developed a generalized, extensive, progressive tuberculosis. • R " b b' ts — Both rabbits died 43 days after inoculation. Tuberculosis in both rabbits.

Each consignment was examined microscopically and in only two instances was it possible to demonstrate acid-fast organ - isms. Suspensions were also prepared and inoculations made into experimental animals (cavias and fowls). Negative re - sults were obtained in each trial. THE TYPING OF BACILLARY STRAINS POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREGNANT UTERI OF REACTING BOVINE ANIMALS WITHOUT MANIFEST TUBERCULOUS LESIONS Material from five pregnant uteri originating from reactor bovines was studied. The writers were unable to find lesions that resembled tuberculosis in the tissues. . The material was also examined microscopically and no acid-fast organisms were noted. Animal inoculations (cavias and fowls) were made with material from two of the uteri. Negative results were obtained. .The three remaining uteri were not used for animal inoculation. THE TYPING OF BACILLARY STRAINS ASSOCIATED WITH TUBERCULOUS LESIONS OF THE SKIN AND SUBCUTIS OF BOVINE ANIMALS In this group forty cases were examined, the majority of which originated from reacting cattle, by the usual typing method (with cavias and fowls). All of these consignments were found to be free of pathogenic tubercle bacilli. Smears were made from all of these cases and it was found that 36 contained acid-fast bacilli. In addition to the cases examined by animal inoculation, attempts were made in eleven instances to isolate tubercle bacilli from as many consignments, all of which resulted in failures.' Two pig-feeding experiments were also made. In one ex- . periment the pigs were tested with bovine and avian tuber - culin before and after the feeding trials. In the second ex - periment the pigs were similarly tested at the conclusion of the experiment. All the tests yielded negative results. In the first trial, skin lesions from 52 different cattle were fed to the pigs. Following the feedings the pigs were killed and a careful autopsy made. Both animals were found to be free of tuberculosis. The two pigs used in the second experiment were fed skin lesions originating from 25 bovines. They were killed and autopsied at the end of their feeding period and both were found free of disease. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 49 the typing of bacillary strains present in isolated tuberculous lesions (mostly lymphnodes) of bovine animals The material classified in this group was selected from cattle in which, for the major part, only a small lesion could be found. They originated principally from the territory contributory to the abattoirs of Kansas City, Mo., Omaha, Nebr., and Sioux City, la., and were procured thru the co - operation of inspectors in charge of the United States Depart - ment of Agriculture Meat Inspection Service stationed at the points mentioned. A few came from more remote parts of the country. Most of the lesions pertained to lymphnodes found to be tuberculous in animals which had reacted to the tuberculin test. Altogether the lesions of 164 animals were collected arid used in the experiments. Of these 49 yielded negative results while in 115 it became possible to determine the bacillary type of tubercle bacilli involved. Here follows a detailed ac - count of the typing experiments. No. 4,193. Tuberculous cervical and mesenteric lymphnodes from a bovine. Inoculation Results Cavias — Tuberculosis of the spleen and liver of one cavia. Fowls — Both birds showed a few isolated lesions, one in the liver and spleen, and the other in the liver only. Due to the fact that both cavias and fowls developed tuberculosis it was decided to inoculate cavias and fowls with tuberculous material from the fowls. Here follow the results. Inoculation Results Cavias — In one cavia, a month after inoculation, there was tuber - culosis of the liver. The other was. killed after three months. In the inguinal lymphnodes there were caseo-purulent lesions and a few tubercles in the spleen. Fowls — Both fowls showed extensive tuberculosis of the liver and spleen.

A single cavia showed a marked individual susceptibility to the'avian virus. This animal was part of the typing set-up in No. 14,222 of the avian series and it was clearly shown that it was an avian bacillary strain which was accountable for the extensive tuberculosis encountered in this guinea pig. /?/7/&gt;/i/7.s\— Intravenously inoculated rabbits showed suscept - ibility to tuberculosis caused by any one of the three bacillary types, but with such specific variations in degree that this animal is of the greatest value in the differentiation between the two mammalian strains of the Bacillus tuberculosis, while used in conjunction with the cavia it can be made to serve also in the identification of the avian strain. The rabbits showed a marked susceptibility to infection with the bovine bacillus and a rather marked resistance to that with the organisms of human type. This specific dif - ference in susceptibility' has by previous investigators been shown to be more marked after subcutaneous inoculations than after the intravenous ones practiced in the scries here - reported. The hitter were not primarily designed to survey the incidence of the causes of mammalian tuberculosis in the various. groups examined, but were more concerned with that of avian infection sources. For this purpose, rabbits, also markedly susceptible to bird tuberculosis, were/used as a control on results obtained' in fowls used as typing animals and as a source of contributory evidence useful in interpreta - tion. The preference of intravenous inoculations to sub - cutaneous ones was based on the fact that the original ma - terial was used as inoculum and that by injecting as indicated, troublesome abscess formations could be avoided. Observa - tions on the subcutaneously inoculated cavias confirmed the wisdom of this procedure. In the experimental series in which material from 58 cases of generalized tuberculosis in the bovine was used for typing, the majority of the rabbits developed extensive, generalized, visceral tuberculosis. A few of the animals also showed lesions of the subcutis. As a rule, infection with the bovine bacillary strain pro - duced lesions in more than one body cavity and the animals succumbed to the infection much earlier than those inoculated with human material. (See Tablesl and 2, page 122.) In the series in which material of 227 human cases of tuberculosis was used for typing, 298 (65.63 per cent) of the 454 rabbits used showed no lesions at all. Of the remaining 156 rabbits, 19 belonging in serial numbers were diagnosed </seg>

Bulletin 49 as due to bovine or mammalian strains and of the 137 recog - nized as infected with the human bacillus, the resulting 1 lesions were found to be local in 127 and present in more than one body cavity in 10 of the animals. The difference in the liability to tuberculous infection by either one of the two mammalian strains is also well shown by the periods during which the rabbits survive after inoc - ulation. (See Table 2.) More than half of the rabbits-in - oculated with bovine material died before the end of the second month after inoculation, while of those injected with material containing the human bacillary type, slightly more than 90pej; cent were still alive at the expiration of this period.'* 1 In the attempt to differentiate between the two mammalian strains of -bacilli present in the original material, difficulty was encountered in four border-line cases. In one of these. bacilli recognized as belonging to the human variety were found to be quite virulent to at least one rabbit. The latter developed a marked tuberculosis of the lungs, a moderate de - gree of tuberculosis of the kidneys, and slight lesions of the spleen, while its cage mate remained free of any evidence of the disease. In another number of the .series, typed as due to human bacilli, one of the rabbits developed a very extensive tubercu - losis of the lungs and a few tubercles in the kidney while three other rabbits inoculated with the same material re - mained healthy. Of two cases eventually recognized as being caused by in - iection of bovine origin, the first showed one of the two" rab - bits dead within a month after inoculation., This animal had developed a marked tuberculosis of the spleen.

In avian infection in the rabbit a greater range of organs was shown as presenting tuberculous lesions than in the rab - bits infected with bacilli of mammalian origin. In the order of frequency, lesions were encountered in the spleen, lungs, liver, lymphnodes, kidneys, peritoneum, pleura, subcutis, testicles, and uterus. The cases of .Yersin tuberculosis were often characterized by a stupendous number of bacilli distributed thruout all parts of the body. In the spleen, in which they were probably most numerous, they were commonly found to occur as rosette-like clumps. Conspicuous also was the tuberculous involvement of the peritoneum in some of the rabbits, the membrane being covered by a continuous layer of conglomerated tubercles having the appearance of a coat of adipose tissue. In another group of rabbits inoculated with avian bacillary strains, the subcutis was extensively diseased,- the tuberculous mass ap - pearing as a dense shield covering the body surface beneath the skin. Fowls. — The common fowl must be regarded as extremely resistant to experimental infection with the mammalian bacillary strains. The evidence submitted in this report quite fully sustains this contention. This resistance, however, does not appear to be an absolute one. In one of the series here reported, the one dealing with the bacillary types associated with isolated lymphnode tuberculosis of cattle, the presence of one or two small, nonprogressive lesions in the liver or spleen of the inoculated fowls could be recorded. In most instances only one of the two birds was so affected, but in the case of two numbers of the series, both fowls pre - sented evidence of slight tubercle formation. In all these cases the cavias of the groups involved had become thoroly tuberculous in the manner to be expected after an inoculation with mammalian material. Tubercle bacilli were alwavs four?' 1 to be present in the fowl lesions. </seg>

            <seg id="p122">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 49 - epicritical considerations Bacillus tuberculosis stands not alone among obligate par - asites as one capable of forming varieties with a more or. less selective affinity or pathogenicity for certain definite host species. The phenomenon may be regarded as evidence of the variability common to all biologic forms and as such is but a means to render the existence of the species more secure. This selective pathogenicity of the tubercle bacillus is ex - pressed by a given variety thriving in an optimum host with - out having lost its capacity to exist also in another one be - longing to a different species. In the latter case the propagation of the germ may be more difficult than in the optimum host and as a result there may not arise the same progressive, generalized lesions, such as may be encountered in the species to which the bacillary strain had become most thoroly adapted. The tuberculous disease produced by such heterologous bacillary types is vary - ing in degree of lesions and extent. It ranges in character and severity from the rare, benign lesions seen in fowls after a mammalian infection, or in the cavia after an avian one. to the generalized, progressive tuberculosis which develops in rabbits, guinea pigs, swine, and other animals after the in - troduction of the bovine bacillary type. The susceptibility to heterologous strains of the tuberc'e bacillus shown by the various animal species is never entirely absent. It may be almost nil, but the fact remains that evi - dence is not lacking which shows that even in species mani - festly resistant to one of the three. better known varieties of the tubercle bacillus individual animals are occasionally en - countered which are liable to develop progressive and exten - sive lesions if the heterologous bacilli gain entrance into their tissues. In the general problem presented by tuberculosis it is quite apparent that a variability in specific host suscepti - bility must be considered as well as the variability shown by the Bacillus tuberculosis in regard to its host relations and its pathogenicity. Many forms of heterologous tuberculous infection present no problem of importance when merely considered from an economic, livestock sanitation, or public health point of view On the other hand it has been abundantly shown that in some concrete instances of frequent occurrence,. tuberculosis due to bacillary types other than the one commonly associated with the species concerned, must be given the most serious con - sideration. Furthermore, the phenomenon of variabilitv shown by tubercle bacilli in their pathogenic qualities and the variation m susceptibility of hosts touch upon a fundamental aspect of the tuberculosis problem so far as livestock sanita- </seg>
            <seg id="p123">Avian Tuberculosis tion and the maintenance of the public health are involved. Tuberculosis caused by a specific entity among microparasites is, after all, but a single manifestation of morbidity in spite of the distinct variations of the etiologic factor and the path - ologic reactions to which they may give rise in different host species. Coping with only one phase of tuberculosis, how - ever hygienically sound this may be and however urgent the necessity, will never be sufficient with any degree of finality, because the variability of parasite and host is ever apt to cause new adaptations, new problems. The morbid reaction, to which the name tuberculosis has been given, like many other biologic phenomena, is, in its epizootologic or epidemiologic aspects, a mutable one and hence there is warrant, even a need, that from time to time the part played by heterologous as well as by homologous tuberculous infection be subjected to experimental inquiry. The investi - gations here reported were undertaken with this need also in mind. While an attempt was made to secure for typing pur - poses, lesions from as many mammalian species as possible, only those of bovine and human origin were obtained in numbers sufficiently large to constitute valid evidence with reference to the bacillary types found. The addition of a series dealing with avian tuberculous material served largely for control purposes and helped to establish a certain criterion useful in the interpretation of typing results. It is to be regretted that not more species were represented in the typing experiments, but because tuberculosis in farm livestock other than cattle, swine, and poultry has in this country not assumed an economic importance, the problem connected with bacillary types is not a pressing one. As has been seen from the data presented in this report, it was pos - sible to- subject to typing experiments the bacillary strains associated with tuberculosis in cattle in a number of cases large enough to be representative of their actual occurrence and distribution. That avian tubercle bacilli may have an etiologic relation - ship to tuberculous disease in cattle has already been shown by de Jong (9), Elder and Lee (11, 12), Plum (41, 42, 43, 44), and others. Schalk (48), in showing that cattle are readily sensitized by exposure to avian infection, also demon - strated by a series of tuberculin tests of feeder cattle in transit, that this sensitization could be demonstrated to have taken place in 15.5 per cent of the 507 animals challenged. In view of the knowledge which had already become available thru the work of others and in the light of observations made of the prevalence of tuberculosis in poultry flocks (17, 18), as well as the high incidence of avian infection of swine (53), </seg>
            <seg id="p124">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station. Research Bulletin 49 the occurrence of avian tuberculosis among the cattle of! this country might well be challenged by experimental efforts. The bovine material secured for typing purposes presented above and summarized in Table 3 was divided into certain groups according to the nature and localization of the lesions It could be shown that in all the material originating from generalized cases of tuberculosis, the bovine bacillarv type only was found to be present. Living tubercle bacilli could not be demonstrated in the hemorrhagic lymphnodes of cattle reacting to tuberculin in the small number of pregnant uteri of reacting animals or in the tuberculous lesions of the skin and subcutis. The latter were typically tuberculous and with only a few 'exceptions all the specimens examined contained acid-fast bacilli not to be distinguished from the ones present in the virulent lesions in the other groups. These bacilli were apparently dead arid the material fed to pigs failed to sensitize them to tuberculin of mammalian and avian origin. A fair proportion of the cattle from which the lesions were taken had reacted to the tuber - culin used in the campaign of eradication. In most cases the lesions examined were the only ones to bo found after slaughter. It is not impossible that this tvpe'of lesion is caused by bacilli which, during a prolonged existence in soil or manure, have lost their original capacity to main - tain themselves in the animal tissues even if thev are able to initiate lesions. . . : Bacilli of the avian "type were encountered in the experi - mental series in which tuberculous, isolated lymphnodes were used. Most of these were mesentenV lymphnodes and in eleven ot the 115 specimens successfully typed, the avian bacillus could be demonstrated. In four of the specimens avian as well as mammalian bacilli were present and in the material of the remaining 100 cases bacilli of mammalian type were encountered. It is quite apparent thus that the avian bacillary strain not only is capable of adaptation to a bovine host, to become the cause of tuberculous lesions but that avian tuberculosis in cattle is by rid means uncommon in this country. As in those of swine, the tuberculous bovine lesions caused by avian bacilli are benign and nonprogressive. Whether or not a more perfectly developed adaptation of the avian bacillus to bovine tissue would tend to render the tuberculosis produced by it more malignant or more apt to spread is at this time a matter of speculation. Sueh a potentiality must, however not be left out of the consideration if the biologic </seg>
            <seg id="p125">Avian Tuberculosis The possible part played by the avian tubercle bacillus as a cause of tuberculosis of cattle or the mere sensitization of the latter to tuberculin has suggested that contact with avian infection sources could possibly be a factor in tuberculin re - actions in animals without lesions of the disease. Schalk (48) reported that 75 per cent of the cattle experimentally exposed to .fowl tuberculosis became sensitized to avian tuberculin, but not to a tuberculin prepared with mammalian bacilli. On the other hand. Plum, (41) points out that while cattle infected with avian .tuberculosis but rarely react to a bovine tuberculin subcutaneously administered', in the case of a similar tuber - culin intradermally applied, positive reactions are more fre - quent Elder and Lee (12) showed that calves which had been injected with virulent avian tubercle bacilli and had de - veloped local lesions, gave good, positive reactions to a tuber - culin used in the testing of cattle, when intracutaneously in - troduced. ■ ■ j ' It is not yet possible to assert with any degree of assurance that sensitization to avian infection is or may be a factor making for confusion in the testing technique as applied to cattle. The problem, however, is worthy of further inquiry. In tin- absence of more complete information, it appears quite significant that of the eleven cases here reported as being due to avian bacilli, six pertained to reacting bovines sent to slaughter for that reason. One Was a nonreactor, another one was from the regular kill, and of the remaining three the history was not made available. The. evidence here reported adds to the importance of avian tuberculous infection and should serve as an indication that the tuberculous poultry Hock must be reckoned with in any scheme of eradication It was shown that tubercle bacilli of avian origin are capable of causing tuberculous disease in such species as swine and cattle.. Avian infection has also been encountered in the horse by MacFadyean (36). Nocard (30), Watson and Heath (58):, and others. On the whole, it appears that most mammals do not supply optimum host conditions to the bacillus of poultry tuberculosis. In the case of some of the mammalian species the avian strain of B. tuberculosis meets with a very positive resistance. Such a resistance may, how - ever, be only a relative one, as was shown by Feldman (11, Id), who could induce avian tuberculous disease in remote organs by inoculating the bacilli intracerebrally into guinea pigs and dogs, animals ordinarily highly resistant to infec - tions by this bacillary strain.' With these facts in mind, the great prevalence of tuber - culosis among poultry over a large area of the country of which Nebraska is a part, acquires a new significance. 'The </seg>
            <seg id="p126">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 49 possibility of exposure of the people on farms and of the con - sumers of poultry products has added a public health aspect to the problem of poultry tuberculosis already of great eco - nomic importance. A possible public health aspect of avian tuberculosis was further emphasized by reports in medical literature of cases of tuberculous disease in human beings in which the avian bacillus appeared to have been etiologicallv implicated. Jansco and Elfer (19), Joannovic (20), Lipsehiitz. C8) Lowenstein (34), Volk (56), and a few other authors have reported the presence of a tubercle bacillus of avian strain in human lesions. In only a few of the cases reported in medical literature was evidence submitted that the observer was actually confronted with the avian bacillary strain. As a general rule, the very common distribution of tuberculosis of fowls was not given consideration and hence the birds used for typing were not challenged by the tuberculin test necessary to eliminate errors arising from a preinoculation tuberculosis. Nor were the typing series always supported by the inclusion of rabbits, valuable as a control' on the inoc - ulation results obtained in fowls. In some cases of human disease reported as being due to avian infection, the experi - mental evidence points more strongly to an aberrant human than to an avian bacillary type and in at least one instance the- probability of bovine infection was greater than of avian ■ In other articles the possibility. of an avian infection is merelv suggested by the authors and in one article avian infection is not even mentioned. Yet bibliographers and reviewers have not always hesitated to quote such writings as evidence of the occurrence of avian tuberculosis infection in man. Notwithstanding the questionable nature of some of tin - evidence submitted, the fact remains that avian infection was found in certain cases of human tuberculosis. This occur - rence, no doubt, tends to show, a certain potentiality on the part of the avian tubercle bacillus, which, in connection with its importance as a cause of tuberculosis of farm livestock justifies the opinion that in the genera! struggle against the disease, measures directed against its spread among poultry must not be omitted. So far as the valid evidence available in literature permits any conclusions, however, it is apparent that even in the region where most of the alleged European cases originated avian infection m man is but rarely observed in comparison to tuberculous disease caused by other bacillary strains. In this country the part played by avian tuberculosis as an infection source of human disease is even more obscure inus far, no case of tuberculosis of avian origin in man has </seg>
            <seg id="p127">■ Avian Tuberculosis been recorded within the United States as diagnosed by means of an. adequately safeguarded typing, technique. That such cases may actually exist and may occasionally be brought to light is a possibility that cannot be denied. In a large region of the United States, poultry tubei-culosis shows a conspicuously high incidence and it can scarcely be doubted that avian tubercle bacilli may find their way into the human body. Yet, in spite of this possibility, in none of the lesions of 227 cases of human tuberculosis and in none of the three cases of Hodgkin's disease included in the typing experiments undertaken by the Nebraska Experiment Station, was even the slightest indication of avian infection encountered. These wholly negative results become even more significant when consideration is given to the fact that most of the cases con - cerned originated in the part of the country where the tuber - culosis morbidity rate of poultry is the highest. The enormous stock of tuberculous infection of avian strain present in the poultry yards of a great area of the United States is economically of the greatest importance. For that reason, steps tending toward the suppression and eradication of poultry tuberculosis are fully warranted. It is, on the other hand, quite apparent that considered from a public health point of view, avian tuberculosis, for the present, at least, can be disregarded with a high degree of safety. In the series having to do with the typing of human tuber - culous material, rabbits were used in order to strengthen whatever evidence might be forthcoming with regard to the part played by the avian bacillary strain. The use of the rabbit also permitted a survey of the extent of bovine infec - tion present in the cases examined, altho this phase of the general tuberculosis problem was not the primary object of the experimental project. The 227 cases of human tuberculosis, for the greater part of an extra-pulmonary localization, included nine cases in which the bovine bacillus could be demonstrated, thus slightly less than 4 per cent. This relatively low incidence of bovine in - fection in a fairly representative group of cases of human tuberculosis other than pulmonary, may indicate a rather favorable situation with reference to bovine infection sources. In the absence of earlier data pertaining to the incidence of bovine tuberculous infection among the population of the region from which the typing material was largely obtained, it would be rash to draw definite conclusions based upon the findings here related. One observation, made in connection with the cases from which material after typing experiments revealed the presence of. the bovine bacillary strain, may be worthy of mention </seg>
            <seg id="p128">Nebr. Agr. Exp. Station, Research Bulletin 49 This pertains to the fact that the greater part of this material came from adults and not from patients belonging to the age group which ordinarily shows the highest incidence of bovine infection. _ It was not possible to secure data regarding the age-; of all the cases which furnished- the lesions used, but it could be estimated that about 40 per cent belonged to the age group of 0 to lo years. Only two of the nine cases with bovine tuberculous infection belonged to the latter group Xo evi - dence ot bovine infection was observed in material obtained tiom 31 children of less than ten years of age and of which the age was accurately known.

For adequate reasons it was predicted, many -years ago' that the elimination of the tuberculous dairy herd am? the sanitary supervision of the milk supply could only haVe a P* bm " imi tuberculosis in. children.

Avian tuberculous infection of bovine animals was found only in solitary lymphnode lesions in nearly 10 per cent of "the cases furnishing lesions of this type. 3.

While a certain, potentiality for mischief may. lie attrib - uted to the avian bacillary strain, it is not apparent that avian tuberculosis. has at this time assumed importance as a menace to the public health. 7. On the other hand, the prevalence of avian tuberculosis on farms must be looked upon as a positive hazard to other livestock.
