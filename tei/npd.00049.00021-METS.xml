            <seg id="p005">Farm Types in Nebraska, as Determined by Climatic, Soil, and Economic Factors by R. R. Spaf f ord INTRODUCTION This bulletin treats chiefly of Nebraska agricultural areas as determined by climatic, soil, and economic factors. Most of the subject matter centers about the kind of farm crops grown and their yields. Cultural practices applied to crops are only incidentally considered. Most of the data used are from the Thirteenth Census of the United States and cover the crop year 1909. The small amount of data not derived from this source comes largely from field studies in this State and is used merely to support certain methods of treat - ing census data. To make the basis of the analysis of Nebraska agricul - tural areas more stable, it has been necessary to follow thru - out the northern hemisphere some of the very general prin - ciples in regard to climate, soil, plants, and people. Further - more, it has been necessary to place the crop groups (based on the classification of annual crops) of Nebraska in line with those of the United States as a whole and to extend the size - of-farm study thruout the Great Plains region. Crop-group belts are determined largely by the quantity of heat received and in general extend from east to west. The size of farm in the Great Plains is determined largely by rain - fall and serves as a good index to the quantity of field crop and pasture growth. The general trend of any given size-of-farm belt in this region is from north to south. The fact that crop - group belts and size-of-farm belts in Nebraska tend to run at right angles to one another makes it a relatively simple matter to block out areas that have a fairly uniform type of farming. In determining the boundaries of type areas, soils are not ignored. Extreme conditions of texture and topography de- </seg>

For each type area the type of farm, as it existed in 1909, has been calculated. The facts concerning the various farm types have The principal object of this work is to correlate in a measured way a number of important facts concerning farm types. The work, it will be seen, is by no means final. The material prepared during short intervals in the past two years is published here simply as a progress report. THE OUTLINE OF AGRICULTURAL REGIONS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE North America has two large agricultural regions. One of these regions centers in Washington, Oregon, and Cali - fornia, and the other in the eastern part of the United States and southern Canada. Eurasia also has two such regions similarly located. One is occupied in part by Great Britian, France, Germany, Austria, and east-central Russia, and the other in part by China Proper, Manchuria, and Japan. The climate of each of these regions is to a large extent deter - mined by the westerly winds.* Land located along western coasts receives the westerlies fresh from the ocean while that located along eastern coasts receives these winds only after they have crossed more or less of the interior of the land mass. Climate within the belt of the westerlies ranges from oceanic to continental. Naturally the truest types of oceanic climate in this belt of winds are found on western coasts. â€¢The climate of southeastern North America and Eurasia is to an extent affected by the trade winds. leen grouped about as foil 1.

            <seg id="p007">Farm Types in Nebraska 7 Eastern coasts have what may be classed as an oceanic cli - mate, but it is not as equable as that of western coasts. The extreme continental climate is common to the interior of North America and Eurasia. In contrast with an oceanic climate, a continental climate is variable. Temperature changes are more sudden and extreme. Rainfall is comparatively lighter and when it comes it is apt to be torrential rather than steady. Also when snow falls the ground is seldom covered with a uni - form blanket. In general it can be stated that the climates found on similar sides of North America and Eurasia are more comparable than those found on adjacent sides. This is to a less extent true of points in the interior. The boundaries of the four great agricultural regions in the northern hemisphere are determined by low temperature, low rainfall, and coast lines. In southern Canada, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and in northern Russia, Manchuria and Japan, agriculture is limited by low temperature. The principal agricultural boundaries determined by low rainfall in North America are found (1) in the states of the Great Plains and (2) in the states of the Pacific coast region. In Eurasia the principal agricultural boundaries determined by low rainfall are found (1) in southeastern Russia and (2) in western China Proper and Manchuria. Figures 1, 2, and 3 indicate in a diagrammatic way these agricultural boundaries. The small circles mark temperature limits, and the dashes rainfall limits. The northern parts of the two agricultural regions in both land masses are connected by a strip of marginal agri - cultural country lying between a cold adverse region to the north and a dry adverse region to the south. This is roughly indicated in the figures by a line made up of both circles and dashes. It is possible that these strips of country are deter - mined by the fact that to the south higher temperature makes droughts very destructive while to the north the lack of heat during the growing season soon comes to act as an absolute limit to ordinary agriculture. Soil has but little visible effect upon the boundaries of these agricultural regions. Considered on any large geo- </seg>

The reverse, however, is true within any comparatively small area of agricultural land. Here variations in soil often have sufficient range to outweigh the relatively small range of climatic variations. The location of the favorable agricultural lands with ref - erence to the distribution of native vegetation is striking. The low temperature boundaries are closely marked by the southern limits of the northern coniferous forests while the low rainfall boundaries are marked by a sparse vegetation </seg>

These figures indicate why it is that farmers living well within favorable regions give a great deal of attention to soil problems, while those in the northern border areas are more interested in cold evasive and cold resistant crops; and again in dry border areas interest turns to prob - lems of irrigation, drought evasion and drought resistance. Of the people living in North America and Eurasia, 90 to 95 per cent are located within the favorable regions. To the north scarcity of food and the difficulty of maintaining a comfortable bodily temperature act as checks to immigra - tion. Along low rainfall boundaries the principal check is the </seg>

It may be added in con - nection with these statements that our inability to control bodily temperature is one of the chief hindrances to a suc - cessful intensive tropical agriculture. From the foregoing discussion it can easily be seen that Nebraska data will bear heavily upon moisture problems such as are common to areas near the center of the Great Plains. Altitude in the extreme western part of the State adds to what would otherwise be a short scale in heat differ - ences. As concerns soil, there is almost a complete scale in both texture and topography.

In some cases they are treated as annuals and in other cases as perennials. This being the case, one is justified in saying that, in general, there are but two large divisions of field crops, one division treated as annuals and the other as perennials. Crops treated as annuals divide into three groups com - monly spoken of as fall or winter annuals, spring annuals, and summer annuals. Winter annuals are usually seeded in the fall, live thru the winter, bear fruit and die the following summer. Spring annuals are seeded either in the late winter or during the spring and are harvested in the summer or early fall. Summer annuals are planted either in the late spring or early summer and are harvested during the fall and early winter. This part of the bulletin deals principally with the acre - age of the various field crops listed in the census that are treated as cultivated annuals. It appears that the variation in the acreage of the three groups of crops belonging to this division affords one of the best possible measures of the effect </seg>

The crops treated as annuals are pres - ent in nearly every county in the United States and usually occupy the greater part of the cultivated land. These points are very essential where large-scale measurements are to be made. While it is true that the acreage of cultivated crops treated as perennials is affected by heat it is also true that the effect of heat upon the acreage of perennials is often out - weighed by rainfall, soil, and economic conditions. This to - gether with the fact that cultivated perennials are scarcely represented in a large number of counties in the United States makes them almost useless in the measurement of what are more purely heat effects. The census makes no attempt to keep winter, spring, and summer annuals separated from one another. This grouping of crops in the census made it necessary in some cases to use estimates, and in other cases supplementary data. The fol - lowing outline will give an idea of how the census material was treated before beginning the study of heat in its relation </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bui. 15 14 to farming. There may be a number of serious and valid ob - jections to the classification of certain crops in the spring and summer annual groups. The outline simply shows the order in which the census material was organized for this particular study. A. Cultivated crops treated as annuals. 1. Winter annuals. (Cold tolerant but heat sensitive.) a. Winter wheat (supplementary data used). b. Rye. (The acreage of rye given in the census was treated as winter rather than spring. This of course causes error in counties growing spring rye, but this error is seldom sufficient to affect ma- terially any broad classification of farming re - gions.) 2. Spring annuals, together with such summer an - nuals as are favored by cool weather and have a rel - atively short growing season. (Cold tolerant but heat sensitive.) a. Spring wheat (supplementary data used). b. Oats. (The acreage of oats given in the census was treated as spring. If the 1909 acreage of winter oats per county had been available, the southern border of the summer-winter type of an- nual cropping could have been mapped more ac - curately. See page 18.) c. Barley. (The acreage of barley given in the cen - sus was treated as spring.) d. Emmer and speltz. e. Flax. f. Potatoes. g. Grains cut green. (This acreage could not be used, as it contained both winter and spring grains.) h. Peas. (The acreage in the Northern States was classed here .

            <seg id="p016">16 Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bui. 15 classed under the head of "cultivated crops treated as an - nuals." In certain regions conditions are such that winter annuals occupy the greatest part of the acreage given to an - nuals. In other regions the acreage of spring annuals or the acreage of summer annuals may occupy first place. Each of the regions thus determined can again be subdivided. For example, in a region where the acreage of winter annuals stands first, it may be that in some parts summer annuals stand second and in other parts spring annuals occupy that place. Thus from the six possible arrangements we derive the six types of cropping. The subdivision of these six principal types could be carried even further by determining the relative standing of particular crops within their respective groups. In this bulletin, however, very little use is made of the minute divisions that are possible. Table 1. â€” The six principal types of annual cropping.

Spring Table 1 describes and names the six principal types of annual cropping. It will be observed that the name of a type is determined by the relative standing of its two most important groups of annuals. A sample problem will serve to explain the method of determining and mapping these types. According to the Thirteenth Census of the United States the 1909 acreage of various crops treated as annuals in Fillmore county, Nebraska, was as follows: Crops Acres Corn 119,007 Oats 36,443 Wheat 85,893 Emmer and Speltz 344 Barley 88 Buckwheat 2 Rye 40 </seg>

CROP BOUNDARIES The map on page 18 (Fig. 7) shows the approximate boundaries of the six types of annual cropping as they existed in the crop year 1909. The heart of the Corn Belt is made up of the summer-spring and summer-winter types. To the north of the Corn Belt and along the Pacific coast the domi - nant type is spring-summer. Most of the Rocky Mountain region and some of the cooler parts of the Great Lakes region belong to the spring-winter type. The two remaining types â€¢The acreage of spring wheat was taken from the Nebraska Agricultural year book (crop year 1906) and subtracted from tbe total acreage of wbeat reported In the census The remaining acreage was classed as winter wheat. </seg>

            <seg id="p019">Farm Types in Nebraska 19 occupy relatively small areas within those already mentioned. The winter-summer type develops at certain points within the summer-winter areas. The largest developments of this type are in western Kansas and southeastern Pennsylvania. The winter-spring type may develop in either the spring-winter or the winter-summer areas. Its most accurately defined area covers a part of southeastern Washington and north-central Oregon. This type is also indicated on the map as occurring in Idaho, Utah, Montana, Colorado, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In as far as was possible to determine, the southern states belong largely in the summer-spring type of cropping. Tho the name of the southern type of annual cropping is the same as that applied to the cropping in the northern part of the Corn Belt, the two regions are very different when one comes to compare the per cent of annuals falling in the summer group. In the southern states the sum - mer group commonly occupies from 85 to 90 per cent of the acreage of land given to crops treated as annuals, while in the northern part of the Corn Belt this group occupies only 50 to 60 per cent of such acreage. If the above measurements are true the cropping in the northern half of the Corn Belt and the cropping in the southern states may be looked upon as examples of two divisions of the summer-spring sype. CROSS-SKCT1ONAI, V1KWS OF VARIOUS TYPES OK ANNUAL CROPPING The cross-sectional views (Figs. 8 and 9) drawn from data entering into the map on page 18 make it possible to study the relationship of one type to another. Figure 8 is a cross-sectional view along a line extending from southern Arkansas to the extreme northern part of Michigan. The per cent of the acreage of annuals given to the winter group is extremely low along the line in Arkansas; but by the time one reaches St. Louis County in Missouri, the winter group has come to occupy over 50 per cent of the land in annuals. To the north of this county, winter annuals drop out rapidly. If the acreage of spring rye does not have too great an in - fluence, one can say that there is a tendency for winter an- </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bui. 15 nuals to increase slightly while crossing Wisconsin and north - ern Michigan. Beginning at the southern end of the line in Arkansas the summer group of annuals stands over 85 per cent as far north as Ripley County in Missouri. North of this point sum - mer annuals drop out rapidly until they finally stand at almost zero in Kewaunee County, Michigan. It will be observed that along this line, from southern Arkansas to northern Mich - igan, it is the summer rather than the spring annual group that gives way to winter annuals. The most striking thing to be observed concerning the spring annual group is that its rate of increase to the north is comparatively steady. In all cross-sectional studies thus far made, the rate of change for the spring annual group has been more uniform than that of the other groups. The vertical crayon-like lines in the graph (Fig. 8) mark the boundaries between types. These occur wherever two heavy solid lines cross one another. Named in order from south to north the types are as follows : summer-spring, sum - mer-winter, winter-summer, summer-winter, summer-spring, spring-summer, and spring-winter. The cross-sectional view of types in southeastern Wash - ington and north-central Oregon (Fig. 9) gives the relation existing between the spring-summer, spring-winter, and winter-spring types. At the southern end of the line, which is in Baker County, Oregon, winter annuals stand at about 16 per cent. In north-central Oregon, some eighty miles to the northwest along this line, winter annuals come to occupy over 80 per cent of the acreage. Continuing northwest, winter annuals drop out rapidly until they reach almost zero in Snohomish County, Washington. Spring annuals, it will be seen, vary inversely as the winter annuals, for the summer annual group thruout this cross-section stands so low that it has almost no effect This is particularly true where winter annuals occupy first place.

BOINDABY LINES DETERMINED LARGELY BY HEAT The lines separating one type of annual cropping from another (Fig. 7) are to a large extent determined by heat. The boundary between the spring-summer and summer-spring types east of the Rockies follows in general the line of 200 month-degrees. (See Figs. 7 and 12.) West of the Rockies the boundary between these two types of cropping could not be accurately determined.

To classify this part of the United States one would need in some cases to use township or pre - cinct data in the place of county data.

The boundaries of the summer-winter and winter-spring types are in close harmony with certain quantities of winter wheat The center of the summer-winter and winter-spring types are usually found close to the line where winter heat measures zero month-degrees.

Figure 14 defines the boundaries of a belt of country in the United States which receives from 150 to 230 month-degrees above freezing between September 1st and July 1st. The small circles placed to the north of this belt mark certain points that receive during the winter an - nual season not less than 138 month-degrees. Only a few winter annual areas will be found to the north of these points. THE EFFECT OF FACTORS OTHEK THAN HEAT Tho heat has the greatest effect upon the boundaries of crop types, rainfall, soil, and economic conditions can have a marked influence. A few examples will suffice to illustrate how heat alone will not fully account for the position of cer - tain crop boundaries. Thus the area of winter-summer crop - ping in western Kansas is determined to a large extent by July and August droughts that are accompanied by extreme heat. Winter wheat in this area escapes the hot droughty period more often than corn and other summer annuals. If it were not for this fact this area would without much doubt drop back to the summer-winter type. The factors just men - tioned also influenced the development of the small island of winter-summer cropping in south-central Nebraska, but here extremely level land was also a factor. This type would, in all probability, not have appeared at this point in 1909 had the land been hilly. The position of boundary lines in a given year throws some light on the economic question of profits derived from certain crops. As an illustration, the boundary line drawn around the winter-summer type in western Kansas must define an area within which, according to the experience of farmers, an acre of winter annuals had been paying better than an acre of summer annuals. When one stops to consider that in this area winter wheat is about the only winter annual and corn is the leading summer annual, it is not far wrong to assume that here an acre of winter wheat previous to 1909 had been paying </seg>

If it were not for the fact that an acreage of one group of annuals sometimes of necessity carries with it a certain acreage of another group, this line of reason - ing could, without much modification, be applied to all type boundary lines. For example, it would be only approximately correct to state that in changing from a corn and oat region to a corn and wheat region the boundary line between the two marked the point at which the profits from an acre of winter wheat began to exceed those from an acre of oats. It would be more nearly correct to say that the boundary line marked the point at which the profits from a given acreage of corn and wheat began to exceed the profits from a given acreage of corn and oats. SIZE OF FARM IN RELATION TO RAINFALL AND OTHER FACTORS IN THE GREAT PLAINS DEFINITION OF THE TERM FARM A farm, generally speaking, is the area of land from which a family derives a living thru such operations as culti - vating crops, cutting wild hay, pasturing native grasses, and feeding live stock. Broadly construed, this definition makes it possible for a single farm to include owned land, leased land, and "free range." If the area of free range were to be excluded, the use of the term farm in this bulletin would be similar to its use in the Thirteenth Census. Two extracts from the instructions for the general agri - cultural schedule (1910) will serve to illustrate the census use of the word farm. Farm. A "farm," for census purposes â€” that is, for which a general farm schedule should be obtained â€” is all the land which is directly farmed by a single person, managing and conducting agricultural operations, either by his own labor alone or with the assistance of members of his household or of hired employees. The term "agri - cultural operations" is here used as a general term re - ferring to the work of growing crops, producing other agricultural products, and raising animals, fowls, and bees. A farm as thus defined may consist of a single tract of land or a number of separate and distinct tracts </seg>
            <seg id="p029">Farm Types in Nebraska 29 situated in the same or in different enumeration dis - tricts, and may be held under different tenures, as where one tract is owned by the farmer and another tract leased by him. For example, if A B operates or cultivates under his personal management one tract of 60 acres in one place and another tract of 30 acres in another place, these two separate tracts constitute one farm of 90 acres. But if A B owns 90 acres of land in one tract but culti - vates under his personal management only 60 acres of such tract and leases the other 30 acres to another person, C D, the farm of A B consists of but 60 acres â€” that is, the number of acres actually farmed or operated by him, the remaining 30 acres constituting the farm, or part of the farm, of C D. Or, again, if A B owns 90 acres of land which he ordinarily considers as "his farm," but leases 30 acres from C D, then the farm of A B consists of 120 acres â€” that is, the total number of acres actually farmed by him. Ranches using public lands. The farm of ranchmen using the public domain includes only the land which he owns or leases. If he leases public land or any other land, such land is a part of his farm. But his farm does not include any public land for which he pays no rental or upon which live stock are grazed at a fixed charge per head. Across the head of schedules for farms and ranches using public lands for grazing live stock write RANGE in large letters. In cases where cattle are grazed wholly upon the public domain and the owner of the ani - mals does not own or lease any land, fill out a schedule for the owner the same as for anv ordinary farm operator, omitting answers, however, to Inquiries 10 to 15 and writ - ing in answer to Inquiry 6 the words "No land owned or leased." When we include from a farm public land for which a farmer "pays no rental or upon which live stock are grazed at a fixed charge per head" we decrease, to that extent, the area of land from which he derives a living and his farm cannot be directly compared with one having no free range. METHOD OF CMA TI.ATING THE SIZE OF FARM IN THE i.REAT PLAINS REGION For western Nebraska the Thirteenth Census reports that less than two-thirds of the total area of land was oc- </seg>
            <seg id="p030">Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bui. 15 30 cupied by farms. Field studies at many points in that part of the State lead one to believe that the people living there in 1909 would have been seriously handicapped in making a living had even the poorest one-third of the total land area been wholly excluded from agricultural use. A farm manage - ment survey made in Kimball County in 1915 indicated that the size of farm in the county was nearer two sections of land than one section as reported in the census. In all probability the number of farms in Kimball County had increased since 1909, and so it can hardly be true that a farm at that time consisted of only one section of land. It was also observed during this survey that the area of pasture land not grazed over at some time during the year was almost negligible. Table 2 compares the average size of farms taken at random in Farm Management surveys with census figures. In most cases the average size of farm secured thru surveys (1914-1916) is more in harmony with the result obtained by dividing the total land area of the county by the number of farms it contained in 1909, than with the size of farm given in the census. If the survey figures can be relied upon, it is safe to state that practically the entire area of land is made to contribute in one way or another to the living of farmers located upon it. It is a commonly known fact that nearly every western area had, at some time previous to the last census, Table 2. â€” The size of farm calculated from Nebraska Farm Management surveys compared with census figures.

            <seg id="p031">Farm Types in Nebraska 31 seen ranchers strongly opposed to increasing the number of farms. Even in those times they must have felt that, to make a living under such economic conditions as they were experi - encing, it was necessary to use practically all of the land. The first calculations of the size of farm per county in this State were based upon the assumption that only a very small part of a county was not being used by the people farm - ing there. An attempt was made to eliminate from the total acreage of each county ( 1 ) the area occupied by the very small farms reported in the census and (2) the area occupied by town lots and railroads. It was soon found (1) that the very small farms could not consistently be separated from the largest farms and (2) that the area of land occupied by towns and railroads combined did not as a rule amount to one per - cent of the area of the county. Further studies brought out the fact that the relation between the number of very small farms and the area of land occupied by towns and railroads was such that one always tended to offset the effect of the other when the total area of the county was divided by the total number of farms. Figures bearing upon the size of farm in the vicinity of Omaha will illustrate this tendency of very small farms to offset even a large area of land in town lots and railroads. According to the order followed in the first method of study, it was estimated that Douglas county, in which Omaha is located, had 29,560 acres of land occupied by towns, railroads, and very small farms. The remaining area of Douglas county was then divided by the number of larger farms. This gave 168 acres per farm. Following the order of the second method the total area of the county was simply divided by the total number of farms. This gave 12:' acres per farm. As a check on these figures a field study (1917) was made in Papillion precinct in Sarpy county some seven miles southwest of the South Omaha market. Thp area covered was 18,880 acres. The average size of farm here proved to be 126 acres. Judging from this studv and also from field observations in practically all nrecincts in Douorlas county, the second method of calculating the size of farm gives </seg>
            <seg id="p032">Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bui. 15 32 a more accurate idea of open farming country than the first. Another very important point in favor of the second method is its freedom from any arbitrary rulings concerning very small farms. When the total area of the county is used, it gives a stable basis from which to measure any change in the aver- age size of farm brought about thru either an increase or a decrease in the number of farms. Table 3 illustrates the im- portance of this fact. In the first column of the table are found the names of the type areas in Nebraska and also the Table 3. â€” The size of farm as affected by the number of farms within a given area.

            <seg id="p033">Farm Types in Nebraska 33 in the first column of the table. The third shows the number of all farms within this same area of land in 1910. Columns 4 and 5 of the table give the calculated average size of farm for 1900 and 1910 respectively, while columns 6 and 7 give the average size of farm as recorded in the census. It will be ob - served that where the number of farms in 1910 shows an in - crease over 1900, the average size of farm recorded in the census decreases in eastern areas and increases in western areas. For example, in 1900 some five million acres of land in the western Sand Hills held 1,334 farms. Ten years later the number of farms on this area of land had increased to 3,266. The total area of land divided by the number of farms gives 4,359 acres per farm in 1900 and 1,781 acres in 1910. From the standpoint of the average area of land required to make a family living in those years, the figures are not far out of line with the experience of thrifty ranchers and farmers living there. Regardless of the fact that the number of farms in the western Sand Hills more than doubled between 1900 and 1910, the census records a 30 per cent increase in the size of farm. This increase in size would not appear if all land grazed had been included in farm. It is seldom that large areas of grass land in the Great Plains are so completely withheld from farm use as to reduce agricultural practices to zero. Where land is partly withheld farmers and ranchers simply practice more extensive methods of farming than the other factors in the region would actually reauire. What is here said of grass lands will not apply to the timber lands found in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. In this area, part of the land is used by lumber companies and cannot be classed as land in farms. The fact that much of this heavy timber must be cleared before the land can have any farm use makes it relatively easy to hold large tracts of timber from agricultural use. From these facts it can readily be inferred that in a timber region the area of a county di - vided by the number of farms contained cannot give a true index to the average size of farm. Tho size-of-farm lines, so determined, have been drawn across northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, they are of value only when compared with the </seg>
            <seg id="p034">11 1 o4 Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bui. 15 acres per person. A study of figures 24, 25, 26, and 27 in comparison with figures 28, 29, 30, and 31 will brinar out the fact that the land in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin fur - nishesa living for more than is indicated by the size-of-farm lines. It will be observed that ordinarily in a grass-covered region the 1280-acre lines are found very close to the lines in - dicating 200 acres per person (total population). The 1280 - acre lines drawn across the timber region would probably cross about as far north as the lines indicating 200 acres per person if it were possible to reduce lumbering to a farm basis. A summary of the above discussion will bring out more clearly the chief considerations that led to basing size-of-farm studies in the Great Plains on simply the area of a county divided by the number of farms contained. ( 1 ) When a farm is defined as the area of land from which a family derives a living thru such operations as cultivating crops, cutting wild hay, pasturing native grasses, and feeding live stock, nearly all of the land in the Great Plains can be looked upon as farm land. (2) The area occupied by town lots and rail - roads tends to be offset by the number of very small farms. (3) The total area of the county gives a stable basis from which to measure any changes in the average size of farm dur to a chance in the number of fanv.s.

            <seg id="p035">Farm Types in Nebraska 35 TUB HKSTIKX KIM;*: OF KiC-A&lt; KK I AHMIMi In 1880 the 160-acre farm was common as far west as - northwestern Missouri, central Iowa, and southwestern Wis - consin. A study of figure 19 will show that the 160-acre lines remained almost stationary in Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa for a period of thirty years. The great expansion during the period between 1880 and 1910 took place to the west, north, and south of this strip of country. Barring soil effects, the western edge of quarter-section farming follows very closely a normal annual precipitation of from 31 to 32 inches. (See Fig. 18.) In eastern Kansas the 160-acre lines are usually found in counties having from 35 to 40 inches of rainfall. Jt is here that the "flint hill section" holds the 160-acre lines to the east. In Texas the 160-acre farm advanced much farther south than west. The westward advance against a decreasing rainfall was scarcely greater than that taking place in the states to the north. TWO-CKCTION KAKMINC. The principal factors affecting the size of farm in the drier parts of the Great Plains can best be introduced thru a study of the 1,280-acre lines. (See Fig. 23 and also Figs. 24, 25, 26, and 27.) Between 1880 and 1910, two-section farming in South Dakota moved from a country having 24 inches of rainfall to one having but 16 inches. In central Texas during the same period this size of farm occupied the strip of country lying between the 21 and the 26 inch rain - fall lines. While 1,280-acre farming in South Dakota ad - vanced thru approximately an 8-inch decrease in rainfall, it advanced thru only about 5 inches in central Texas. The slower advance against rainfall in the south can be attributed largely to two factors, namely, greater evaporation and some - what slower development of country. Of the factors men - tioned, evaporation appears to have the greater influence. In North Dakota and Texas the 1,280-acre lines make a fairly regular advance during each ten-year interval fol - lowing 1880. In contrast with these regular movements, </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bui. 15 the lines at many points in South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kan - sas show a number of reactions. This is particularly true of the lines marking the western edge of two-section farming in 1890 and 1900. One of the outstanding features of the 1,280-acre line in 1890 is its marked westward bend into northeastern Colorado. Within this bend homesteading reached one of its highest points. In the late eighties and early nineties, people here occupied a country developed more out of harmony with rainfall and heat than could be found at any point either to the north or to the south. The line drawn for the year 1900 gives at least a partial view of the reaction that followed.* It was most severe in southwestern Nebraska and northwestern Kansas. To the north and south of these areas the reactionary movement gradually disappears. NIZE OF FARM IN RELATION TO RAINFALL AND HEAT The size of farm in 1880 and 1910 was probably more uni - formly adjusted to rainfall and heat than it was in either 1890 or 1900. (See Figs. 24, 25, 26, and 27.) Nevertheless, each map in the series just referred to shows a tendency for its lines to converge to the south more rapidly than rainfall. (See Fig. 18.) This convergence is more readily seen when the lines in the eastern quarter of Texas are covered. Figure 15 is a diagram on which the 1910 size-of-farm lines are plotted according to inches of rainfall used as degrees of longitude and month-degrees used as degrees of latitude. The 320-acre line and the lines to the east of it follow approxi - mately the same quantity of rainfall regardless of an increase or decrease in the quantity of heat. To the west of the 320 - acre line the section and two-section size of farm veer rapidly into higher rainfall to the east as the quantity of heat in - creases to the south. As was mentioned in the introductory discussion of the 1,280-acre lines, a small part of this variation may be due to a slower development of western farming in the south. â€¢It mult be borne in mind thnt pome nctions nnd reactions were so sharp that measurements made nt ten-year intervals could not fully record them. </seg>
            <seg id="p037">Farm Types in Nebraska â– â– u SlZK OF I AKM IN KKLATION TO SOIL From the preceding discussion one might be led to infer that the position of size-of-farm lines in the Great Plains is seldom affected by soil. The series of maps last referred to (Figs. 24, 25, 26, and 27) can also be used to illustrate cer - tain soil effects. The "Flint Hill" section in Kansas was men - tioned during a discussion of 160-acre lines. In 1880 this sec - tion stood out as an island of half -section farming in eastern Kansas. In 1890, 1900, and 1910 the size of farm is seen to be somewhat reduced but it still stands out as an area oc - cupied by relatively large farms. The Sand Hill region in north-central Nebraska has even a more marked effect upon the size of farm. On the map of 1880 (Fig. 24) the two-sec - tion and one-section lines in northeastern Nebraska bend sharply to the east in order to avoid the Sand Hills and border - ing areas of more or less sandy land. In 1890 these lines enter the eastern Sand Hills. In 1900 they recede to the eastern edge, where they almost meet the half-section line which has moved a little to the west and is just beginning to bend east - ward in order to avoid sandy land. By 1910 the two-section line has passed beyond the Sand Hills, leaving behind it an island of very large farms to occupy the western part. While section farming has again entered the eastern Sand Hills, half-section farming in 1910 still skirts the edge. SIZK OK FA KM IN KKI.ATION TO RAINFALL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS A cross-sectional measurement of size of farm in the Great Plains region will bring out certain facts concerning rainfall and economic conditions more clearly than can be pointed out from maps. Figure 16 is a cross-sectional meas - urement following approximately the line of 240 month-de - grees from Iowa across southeastern Nebraska and north - western Kansas into Colorado. The purpose of following a given quantity of heat is to eliminate in as far as possible the effect of heat upon the size of farm. The choice of this par - ticular quantity of heat was influenced by the fact that it crosses the Great Plains at a point where soil variations are </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bui. 15 slight. It is even possible that the western soils, being a little more open and more level than the eastern soils, give a slight advantage to the western farms. With effective vari - ation in both heat and soil largely eliminated, the study along this line can be more positively centered upon the size of farm in relation to rainfall and economic conditions. In the graph (Fig. 16), rainfall tends to give similarity to the shape of the curves while economic conditions are largely responsible for their position relative to one another. Each of these curves shows that as soon as rainfall is decreased below a certain point the size of farm increases rapidly. This point in rainfall is sometimes designated as critical rainfall. Along the line of the graph, critical rainfall varies with economic conditions. Thus in 1880, 1890, 1900, and 1910, critical rainfall stood at approximately 25.0, 19.5, 22, and 21 inches respectively. It is a rather striking fact that between 1880 and 1910 the critical point in rainfall along this line had been lowered only about 4 inches. When cross-sectional studies of this kind are made across the northern part of the Great Plains, the curves reach into lower rainfall and are less sharp. On the other hand, cross-sectional studies to the south of the 240 - month-degrees line give very sharp curves that do not reach into extremely low rainfall. SIZE OF FARM IX KKLAT1ON TO PLANT GROHTH The connecting link between size of farm and moisture conditions in the Great Plains is plant growth. It stands to reason that where rainfall is normally low and as a result crop yields are low and pasture growth is short, a farm must of necessity occupy enough land to bring the total annual growth of usable plants to a level that will insure the average farm family a living. Figure 17 gives a view of the size of farm in relation to the total annual growth of crops and pasture. As shown by the key map accompanying the figure, the heat and soil conditions in the areas chosen are much the same as those described in the preceding cross-sectional study. In the accompanying diagram the blocks placed adjoining one </seg>
            <seg id="p039">Farm Types in Nebraska 39 another illustrate how a farm in the Great Plains adjusts its area to overcome the effects of low crop yields and short pas - ture growth. The base-length of a block represents the total farm area. (Note here Table 3, columns 1 and 5.) The divi - sion of the farm area between crop and pasture land is brought out by shading. The height of one block relative to another (the height above the shading) is in harmony with the crop index of one farm type relative to another. The crop index of each of these farm types was calculated from the census and applies only to the crop year 1909. When the crop and pasture growth in the Thayer area was assumed to be 100 per cent, the Harlan and Hitchcock types measured 60.2 and 32.0 per cent respectively. Tho these measurements are based on only the crop year 1909, they serve very well as an index to normal conditions. According to the results obtained, 100 acres of the Harlan type of farm were equivalent, in 1909, to 60.2 acres of the Thayer type of farm. Comparing the Hitch - cock type of farm with the Thayer type in this year, 100 acres of the former were about equivalent to 32 acres of the latter. This principle of adjusting the size of farm to the quan - tity and value of plant growth is as old as dry land farming. It is practiced in all of the dry border regions of the world. Field studies in Nebraska lead one to conclude that until this principle is complied with the would-be dry farmer is barred from success. MONTH-DiamlC diagram which uses hi nf latitude.

To map the principal areas of the State having a fairly uniform type of farming, crop lines are used to register heat effects as slightly modified by rainfall and other factors, while size-of-farm lines are used to register rainfall effects as slightly modified by heat and other factors. In one case, that of the Sand Hills, soil is used independently to determine the outer boundaries of two types. A key to all boundary lines is shown in figure 36. It will be observed that in general the northern and southern boundaries of type areas are determined by the type of annual cropping, and the eastern and western boundaries by the size of farm. The data used in determining these lines were se cured from the Thirteenth Census. The Fourteenth Census Itol Mi wtlh - OF TVPE AREAS </seg>

For example, it would not be surprising to find that the small island of winter - summer cropping in south-central Nebraska had grown larger, that the summer-winter type was covering more of the south - eastern counties, and that certain size-of-farm lines had moved a little farther west. For the crop year 1909 Nebraska has been divided into twelve type areas. The three northwestern areas are named according to the regions they occupy. All other areas bear county names. (See Fig. 37.) To one who is familiar with the State, county names serve to characterize and locate an area almost as well as regional names. If it had been possible, however, regional names would have been given to all areas.

            <seg id="p060">60 Nebraska Experiment Station Research Bui. 15 the organization of the census data would not permit the use of the entire area of land within a given set of boundary lines, it was necessary to choose a representative group of counties to serve as a basis for farm types.* To determine farm types, each item of county agricultural data was tabu - lated according to the representative groups of counties and then totaled and reduced to an average farm basis. While the total area of land was reduced to an average farm basis by using the number of all farms as a divisor, the total number of live stock and similar items were reduced by using the num - ber of farms reporting domestic animals. This avoided at least a part of the error that would result from distributing field crops, live stock, and other items to very small farms not belonging to the general type. Table 4 brings out the fact that in most cases the difference between the number of all farms and the number of farms reporting domestic animals is relatively small. The relative standing of winter, spring, and summer annuals indicated by the crop boundaries of type areas is very accurately shown by the average figures derived from the rep - resentative groups of counties. (See Figs. 36 and 37.) Both the boundary lines and the figures indicate that the High Plains area belongs to the spring-summer type of annual cropping, that the Western Sand Hills, Eastern Sand Hills, â€¢Boyd Area â€” Boyd, Holt, and Kayapaha Counties.

Boyd, Chase, Custer, Wayne, and Cass areas belong to the summer-spring type; that the Buffalo, Harlan, and Thayer areas belong to the summer-winter type; and the Hitchcock area to the winter-summer type. The key to boundary lines (Fig. 36) shows that the Wayne area is separated from the Custer area by a line following 5 per cent winter annuals. The figures determined from county groups indicate 2 per cent winter annuals in the Wayne area and 10 per cent winter an - nuals in the Custer area. The relation that exists between the size-of-farm bound - aries and the average size of farm determined for county groups can be seen on comparing figure 36 with figure 38. The average size of farm determined for a group of counties in no case exactly agrees with the average indicated by the size-of - farm lines. This is in part due to the fact that the size of farm does not change at a uniform rate from one line to an - other. Each type area outlined holds a wide range of farm con - ditions. This is particularly true of western areas.

Tlie iiverafte size of farm In tlie various type areas of Nebraska (1!K*M I III- PRINCIPAL VSES OF FARM LAND Nearly all of the land in a farm can be classed as either cultivated land, wild hay land, or pasture and waste. In this study the cultivated land together with the wild hay land will be spoken of as the crop area. The difference between the total farm area and the crop area is assumed to be the area occupied by the farmstead, pasture, roads, and waste. Since the land occupied by lots, roads, and waste is often used more as pasture than as crop land it will not be far wrong to treat all of the farm area aside from crop land as simply pasture. THK \&lt; KK \i.l AND \ II I n OF CHOPS The acreage of the various crops grown on a given type of farm varies less from year to year than either the yield per acre or the total yield per farm.

This is in part explained by the fact that effective changes in weather during the crop season often affect areas as large or even larger than the State. The last column in the following group of tables usually expresses the yield per acre in terms of percentage. Wher- ever this is done, the yield per acre on the Cass type of farm is used as a base, or 100 per cent. These percentage figures picture the normal standing of one area relative to another only in so far as yields in 1909 had the same percentage vari- ation from normal.

THE HARVEST VALl'K OF CROPS The census reports the value of crops grown on crop land, but does not report the value of pasture growth. If the value of plant growth on one type of farm is to be compared with the value of plant growth on another type of farm, pas - ture must be included. Furthermore, the value assigned to pasture growth must be comparable with the value assigned to crop growth. Since the census gives to crops what might be termed a harvest value (Table 17), it will be necessary to compute a similar value for pasture (Table 18). In com - puting the so-called harvest value of pasture it was assumed that the acreage of pasture per farm multiplied by the average value of all land would give a fair index to the total value of pasture land, and that 5 per cent of the total would not be far from the actual harvest value of pasture per farm. If it had been possible, however, the average value of pas - ture land would have been used in the place of the average value of all land and T% per cent (three times what is approxi - mately the actual rent) would have been used in the place of 5 per cent.

CROP INDEXES In 1909 the Hitchcock type of farm produced on 48.70 acres as many bushels of corn as the Cass type of farm pro - duced on 16.94 acres.* According to this ratio 100 acres of corn in the Hitchcock area would have produced as much as 34.77 acres in the Cass area. In Farm Management this statement would commonly read â€” the crop index of corn land in the Hitchcock area is 34.77 per cent of that in the Cass area. Table 20 illustrates the method of determining the crop index of the cultivated land, the crop land, and the farm as a whole. It will be observed that according to this calculation 'Representative counties in tbe Cass area â€” Cass, Dodge. Johnson, Otoe. Paw - nee. Saunders. and Washington Counties produced 21,977,553 bushels of corn on 795.719 acres. Acres per farm reporting domestic animals, 59.82. Bushels per farm. 1,662. Tield per acre, 27.02 bushels. (1906) Representative oonnttes in Hitchcock area â€” Hitchcock county in Nebraska and Logan, Rawlins, Sheridan, and Thomas Counties in Kansas produced 2,082.805 bushels of corn on 214.529 acres. Acres per farm reporting domestic animals, 46.70. Bushels per farm, MB. Yield per acre, 9.61 bushels. (1908) 386 .55 300 2.46 348 1.74 302 3.51 1.67 15 7.24 15 5.48 16 9.79 14 368 .78 1629 2.42 15 230 1.77 1429 5.13 ; 14 224 3.73 1942 10.55 14 232 4.30 1844 10.78 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p073">Farm Types in Nebraska 73 200.12 acres of cultivated land in the Hitchcock area were about equivalent in 1909 to 83.19 acres of cultivated land in the Cass area. It is readily seen that this is a ratio of 100 acres to 41.6 acres, and that the crop index of the Hitchcock culti - vated land must therefore be 41.6 per cent. Wild hay occupies such a small acreage on the Hitchcock type of farm that there is little difference between the area of cultivated land and the area of crop land. This being true, it is not surprising to find that the crop index of crop land measures very nearly the same as the crop index of the culti - vated land. The value of land is here assumed to be in harmony with the normal yield of native pasture grasses. (Field studies in many parts of the State indicate that this is in general true.) If the inventory of live stock and the use of pasture in one area could have been directly compared with the in - ventory of live stock and the use of pasture in another area, the carrying capacity of the land rather than its value would have been used as an index to pasture yields. When pasture land is added to crop land the index to yields is decidedly lowered. This is especially true of western areas where the greatest difference exists between the quantity of plant growth on the land selected for crops and the quantity of plant growth on the land left for pasture. </seg>
