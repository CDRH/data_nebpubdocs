         <seg id="p002">SUMMARY New seed corn is preferred to old seed, other qualities being equal. However, seed aged up to four \cars has proved satisfactory for planting when well preserved and of strong germination. Before planting any seed, its viability should be established by means of a representative and reliable germination test. Small but sound cars and kernels which have been stunted as a direct effect of severe moisture shortage, are suitable for u;c as seed. In years ot late maturity, seed corn may be harvested a week or two before ftitty ripe without impairing the seed value, provided it is properly cured to avoid spoilage. Successful corn production is highly dependent upon the use of adapted seed. An important requirement of adaptation is that the inherited vegetative characteristics of the corn grown be suited to the local climatic and soil conditions. In general, open - pollinatcd corn that has been grown in any locality for a period of years has become adjusted to such conditions as moisture supply, temperature, and length of growing season. Home-grown seed of recognized established varieties should be given first choice. However, it is entirely possible to introduce seed which is immediately suitable from a distance. Such suitability can be definitely known, however, only through previous local experience with the corn in question. When grown comparably at Lincoln, corn obtained from extreme southeastern Nebraska ripened 11 days later than corn from northeastern Nebraska, and an entire month later than that from the extreme southwestern panhandle section o£ the statt. Varying with latitude, altitude, and moisture supply, many intermediate regional strains arc found within the slate. Striking correlations arc found between carlincss, plant height, and Icafiness. Reg - ional strain*, obtained from various parts of the United States, which required less than !0U days in riper, al Lincoln, avrrajicl (&gt;~n square inches of icat-arca per stalk, whi!r rhosc requiring mure than Hu days averaged 2.U27 square inches. The amount of water nrirlnl in the nn-nial iiruwlh (it ihr corn crop has been found to increase with the vegetative we anil lateness of ripening. If seal of open-pollinated varieties is to be brought to eastern Nebraska from other states, the most suitable sources appear to be points in lowa and Illinois of about equal or slightly more northern latitude. It the distance is slight the latitude may be the same. But il the distance approaches 100 miles or more, it is well to procure the seed at a latitude of approxinutclv one degree farther north, as this will tend' to offset Ithe effects ot greater rainfall r.iMu.ird upon the vegetative size and lateness of the types bcinj; grown. | Gtrn t\ po in noriiurn (ihi.i .md southern Wisconsin and Michigan arc rather similar in wijeutiw development to those grown in central Nebraska, and iced from these areas might be usable in central Nebraska in an emergency. Such short-season 'talcs as North Dakota, South IV-ikou. Minnesota. Wyoming, and northeastern Colorado ma\ be considered as out-nl-st.iic seed sources for western Nebraska, the exact source depending upon where the seed is to be planted. In general, within a locality in Nebraska il is permissible to interchange seed corn without respect to the level of soil fertility. This would not be true for states where extreme phosphorus deficiency characterises the infertile soil, as corn maturity is greatly delayed on such soil. Since corn develops more rapidly under conditions of favorable soil moisture, :arger and later-ripening vegetative types arc commonly grown on irrigated and sub - irrigated land than on dry land in the same locality. For this reason the irrigated seed corn from central and western Nebraska may be moved a considerable distance to dry land cast or south but may prove too large and late for the local dry land. In contrast with open-pollinated varieties, the adaptation of any specific corn hybrid is unaffected by locality or condition under which the seed is produced. Its adaptation depends entirely upon the component inbred lines and not upon whether the seed is produced in the north or south and whether on dry or irrigated land. There is a wide difference in the regional adaptation and merit of different hybrids, which can be known only through tests. </seg>
         <seg id="p003">Effects of Age, Size, and Source of Seed on the Corn Crop : : T. Aj KIESSELBACH The productivity of op :n-pbllinated corn in relation to source and quality of seed is of special interest in years of serious seed-corn shortage. Such a condition prevails ir, the spring of 1937. In Nebraska and a num - ber of other states the carryover supplies of viable seed are very limited due to the excessive drouth i of 1934 and 1936 and severe freezing injury of the seed in 1935. The current crop is almost negligible in large sections of the corn belt. Conservari &gt;n of seed supplies is urgent in such regions. It is the purpose of this bulletin to present the results of experiments bearing directly on the que itions which arc most commonly asked under conditions of seed scarcity: [1) What is the effect of age upon the produc - tivity of seed corn? (2) H&gt;w much of a handicap is the reduced kernel and ear size resulting from severe drouth? (3) How is the productivity of seed com affected by han esting before fully ripe in order to avoid freez - ing injury from severe fall irosts? (4) Is it practical to use seed produced elsewhere in this or other s atesjahd what are.the most suitable sources? (5) Is it (practical to use seec produced under different soil-fertility and soil - moisture conditions? i'; ' " ¦¦'¦'¦ ; , ..-.'¦'-. ]¦:_¦-¦ USE OF OLD SEED ¦ Satisfactory¦ results .may, commonly be l. expected \ from well-matured , viable seed corn aged up to iour years, provided it has been kept free from external moisture and insect or rodent injury. This conclusion is based on frequent observations and ai i experiment (Table 1) of five years' duration in which seed ranging frprr one to four years of age was tested annually for yield on the experiment nation farm at Lincoln. The comparative acre yields in bushels from seed af various ages were as follows: one year old, 36.6; two years, 37.4; three rears, 35.7; and four years, 35.1. These differ - ences are so small that they would seem to have little sginificance. There were no material effects of age upon the vegetative development of the crop. It was found that when corn aged up to four years gives a good germination test, satisfactory field stands may be expected. It is not un - common for well preserved four-year-old seed to germinate as high as 90 per cent. Thereafter its viability is apt to deteriorate rather rapidly. The maximum delay in emergence of the seedlings after planting sound old seed in the field has been one day. This delay may perhaps be accounted for by the thorough drying out of the seed, and its reduced vitality. Taking all things into con; ideration, new seed is to be preferred if its adaptation and viability ars equal to the old seed. But it would seem preferable to use old seed of known local adaptation, rather than use new imported seed with which tiere has been no previous experience. These tests have been largely condi cted Jn three-row plats replicated three to four times. Yields were based on the middle .rows. The iced was planted at a double rate and the crop thinned com - parably in the seedling stage to three pints per hill, except that only two plants per hill were retained in the wsts reported in Table 6. ¦ ; ¦ • " . : </seg>
         <seg id="p004">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 305 Regardless of age or source, seed should never be planted without first ascertaining its viability by means of a representative and dependable germination test. In the case of seed germinating less than 90 per cent, the kernels may be planted proportionately closer in the row in order to compensate for the dead seed. While this results in some irregularity of stand, experiments have shown that satisfactory yields may be expected if the germination tests and adjustments in spacing are properly made.

As an average for 10 years (Table 2) large seed yielded 43.8 bushels per acre, com - pared with 42.4 bushels lor small seed. There was no appreciable difference in the development of the crop, other than one day later tasseling and one percent higher moisture content at lime of husking in the grain from the small seed. In this experiment the small seeds averaged 54 per cent as heavy in - dividually as the large seeds. The large kernels were of such size that 7 pounds would plant an acre, or in other words, a bushel to 8 acres, spacing the seeds 14 inches in rows 42 inches apart. The small kernels required only 3.8 pounds per acre, thus planting 15 acres per bushel. It is possible that very small seed would be at a disadvantage in case of planting at a depth much greater than normal. There is seldom occasion for planting seed of such small size. In the preparation of the two grades of seed for these studies, care was taken to have essentially the same inheritance repre - sented in both by removing equal numbers of kernels from the middles and extreme tips of a large number of individual ears for the respective grades. In another test the yields of seed taken from the butts, tips, and middles of ears averaged respectively 55.3, 55.4, and 56.0 bushels per acre during the nine years 1914-17 and 1920-24. No material differences in plant development were noted from the various seed grades. By giving proper attention to grading and planter adjustments, it would seem practical to utilize a greater portion of the seed ear under conditions of seed shortage than is customary. </seg>

Ears in this immature condition cannot be piled with safety, but should be placed in drying racks located in a well ventilated building so that the corn will dry thoroughly and thereby maintain good germination. During five years, seed harvested one and two weeks before ripe, respec - tively, was compared for yield with seed that ripened fully. The average results (Table 3) were as follows: (1) ripe seed, 55.8 bu.; (2) seed harvest - ed one week before ripe, 54.4 bu.; and (3) seed harvested two weeks be - fore ripe, 54.9 bu. per acre.

An important requirement of adaptation is that the inherited vege - tative characteristics of the corn grown be suited to the local climatic or soil conditions. In general, open-pollinated corn that has been grown in any locality for a period of years has naturally become adjusted to such local conditions as moisture supply, temperature, and length of growing season. Because of striking variations within so-called varieties it is the intention in these studies to stress regional rather than varietal differences. Seed from Nebraska localities.—The hazard of securing unadapted seed from unsuitable sources may be illustrated by four years' results reported in Table 4. Locally adapted seed corn was obtained from 12 divergent sources in Nebraska and planted comparably on the experiment siation farm at Lincoln. These strains differed as much as 31 days in time of ripening. 29 inches in plant height, and 16 bushels or 38 per cent in grain yield. The vegetative growth tends to be progressively smaller and earlier ripening as the distance o{ introduction from the west or north increases, and the opposite holds for corn moved from the south and east. Just as the local type of corn was most productive at Lincoln, so also are the local types likely to be most productive in other localities. In send - ing elsewhere for seed, attention should be given to similarity of cropping conditions. Taking both yield and grain quality into consideration, it is commonly wise to avoid introducing types that are materially different as to vegetative size and time of ripening from the recognized best local types. </seg>

         <seg id="p009">Effects of Age, Size, and Source of Seed Corn It should also be noted that as much difference as 11 days in time of maturity and 5 bushels in grain yield per acre was obtained from seed of two different sources but of the same variety. Seed source is normally or much greater importance than is variety name. Seed from other corn-belt states.—While there is always uncertainty as to the adaptation of seed com introduced from a distant point in another state without previous experience with the particular corn in question, yet it is entirely possible to locate suitable strains elsewhere. This may be illustrated by the tests reported in Table 5. The comparison consisted of three prominent strains of corn from each of four central corn-belt states, namely, Indiana, Illinois, lowa, and Nebraska. A variation of 3 to 8 bushels per acre was found between^ the varieties from any one of the states and there was as much as 5.7 bushels average difference between the states. The three varieties from eastern Nebraska averaged 43.7 bushels per acre; lowa, 41.5; Illinois, 39.8; and Indiana, 38.0 bushels. However, at least one strain from each of the otheristates in this group yielded within one bushel of the Nebraska average. This is a favorable result when one considers that two of the Nebraska strains had been grown at Lincoln for 15 to 25 years and were locally superior in yield to most other varieties grown extensively in the state. It is important for anyone responsible for introducing seed from an - other state to have personal acquaintance with the characteristics and adaptation of the corn under jconsideration. It would clearly be hazardous to make promiscuous introductions. Seed from nation-wide sources.—Under conditions of deficient local seed corn in large sections of Nebraska, it becomes of interest to know just how corn types from various parts of the United States might fit into this state. Information of this nature is available (Table 6) from a five-year test at Lincoln of seed supplied by the experiment stations of 43 different states.; The specific localities where the various lots were adapted and grown in the originating states is shown in the table. In addition to determining the comparative! productivity at Lincoln, detailed measure - ments of various vegetative characters were taken as evidence of regional type differences. The suitability of these introduced varieties may per - haps be judged by their time of maturity, plant height, leaf area per plant, shrinkage of ear corn, test weight of shelled grain, and yield per acre. By comparing the types native to various part's of Nebraska (Table 4) with those obtained from elsewhere in the United States (Table 6) it is possible to appraise in a measure whether effective importations may be made. It should be pointed out that each of the other states also has several other regional types of corn in addition to that included in these tests. The extreme variation in length of time from planting to ripening of dent varieties was 155 days for Mexican June of New Mexico, and 96 days for Northwestern Dent of North Dakota (Figs. 3 and 4). The earliest ripening corn of the test was Gehu Flint from Montana, requiring only 86 days. Since the Nebraska types (Table 4) ranged from 97 to 128 </seg>

Lines of equal latitude are inserted in this map at three-degree intervals, ranging from 30 degrees latitude in southern Louisiana to 48 degrees in central North Dakota. A very striking transition from large, late types to small, early types is noted from south to north across the United States. This may be associated with progressive short - ening of the length of growing season and extension of day length from south to north. Averaging the days required to ripen the regional strains secured from each of the three-degree belts of latitude, these are found to be as follows: (I) lat. 30-33, 144 days; (2) lat. 33-36, 141 days: (I) lat. </seg>

The direct effect of latitude as a factor in adaptation may best be visual - ized by type comparisons witiin an area of fairly similar altitude.

From east to west some striking differences in the varietal types may also be noted. These are doubtless largely the result of adaptation to differ - ences in rainfall and altitude, though soil may also be a factor. Altitude is an indirect factor by way of influencing the temperature and length of growing season. ,127' '22 * I|T * ''^ *"* IO2 * 97' 92* 67* 62* 77* 72* 67* ..* !U li? l 07 * 102' 97' 92' 67* B2*~ 77* Fig. 4. —Map ot the United Sates showing locjlitics and latitudes in the various states from which the regional type* of corn reported .in Table 6 were obtained.

If one were wishing to introduce seed into eastern Nebraska from another state, it would seem advisable to consider points of approximately equal latitude. In going eastward for seed to lowa or Illinois, it would be preferable to keep a little to the north as this tends to offset somewhat the influence of the higher rainfall on the vegetative type grown. For localities farther west in central and western Nebraska it would be most logical to introduce seed from a northeasterly or westerly direction. It is of interest to note that the local corn, long grown on the experi - ment station farm at Lincoln, surpassed seed from all other sources in the United States that were represented. The next two highest-yielding regional strains were from Ames, lowa, and a somewhat early-ripening strain from Lafayette, Indiana. In Table 6 the strains are grouped in </seg>

The high correlation between number of days, plant height, and leaf area per plant is very apparent. . ¦¦" SEED FROM DIFFERENT SOIL CONDITIONS Information regarding the extent to which soil is a factor in the adapta - tion of corn] is more a matter of observation than experiment. It is known that corn develops and matures more rapidly on soil that is favorably sup - plied with phosphorus than where this element is deficient. Corn well suited to phosphorus-abundant soil would therefore prove too late ripen - ing on phosphorus-deficient land under identical climatic conditions. It appears that Nebraska soil in general is not so variable in phosphorus con - tent that thi| need be regarded as an important factor in adaptation. Appli - cations of thiselement to eastern-Nebraska soils have not hastened ripening more than one or two days. • ¦ Table 7. — Average results with seed corn native to ten upland and ten bottom-land farms in Lancaster county, Nebraska, when grown at Lincoln.] Average for five years, 1923-27. ¦ Source , . .

Kieuelbach, "The Adaptation of Corn to Upland and Bottom Land Soili," Jour. Amcr. Soc. Agron., Vol. 23, Ko. 11, 1931. | . -. An exchange of seed between farms situated in the same locality but differing as Ito level of fertility is not likely to bring unfavorable results. This may be illustrated by a five-year experiment reported in Table 7. Seed was obtained annually from. 10 Lancaster county farmers who had continuously grown their corn on well-drained bottom land and from 10 other Lancaster county farmers who had, on the contrary, continuously grown their! corn on upland.) It was estimated that the bottom-land soil was about twice as productive as the upland soil in seasons of favorable rainfall. This difference in previous condition of growth did not materially influence the heritable vegetative characteristics or acre' yields when both types were grown comparably! on the experiment station farm. It is a matter of common observation that irrigation hastens the develop - ment of the'crop as compared with dry-land conditions, and earlier matur - ity results. This same physiological principle makes it possible ifor farmers to successfully grow a later and larger type of corn on surface-irrigated or sub-irrigated land than on jdry land in the same locality. This differen - tiation having come to be the accepted practice, it is usually not advisable </seg>
         <seg id="p016">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 305 to interchange seed from the two conditions in the same locality unless an extreme emergency exists. It is, however, entirely feasible to move the seed which is adapted to the irrigated land of central and western Nebraska to dry land considerably farther east or southeast where the longer grow - ing season and higher rainfall will accommodate the larger growth and later maturity. THE ADAPTATION OF HYBRID CORN With the advent of hybrid corn and its rapid replacement of open - pollinated varieties in much of the corn belt, it becomes important to dis - criminate between these two kinds of corn in respect to the influence of seed source upon their adaptation. The adaptation of hybrid corn origin - ating from the crossing of inbred lines is entirely dependent upon the component lines and not upon the locality where the seed is produced, as is the case with open-pollinated varieties. All hybrids are not equally good and they also differ widely as to vegetative size and number of days required to mature. After the local adaptation and superiority of any specific hybrid has been established through trial, it is possible to procure this same hybrid with identical characteristics year after year irrespective of where the seed is produced, provided the same parental stocks and proper crossing have been used. This constancy of character is due to the essential purity of the inbred parents, which do not undergo radical adaptive changes as do varieties. Thus, if the climatic and soil conditions are favorable for the production of sound seed, it is immaterial whether the seed of any specific hybrid is produced in the north or south, and whether on dry or irrigated land. The identity of hybrid corn may be assured through the use of seed pro - duced under conditions of official state inspection and certification. IlOM] </seg>
