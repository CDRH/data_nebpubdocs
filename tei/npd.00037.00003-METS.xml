            <seg id="p004">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 149 GIRLS' INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL Geneva, Nebraska To His Excellency, Honorable John H. Morehead, Governor, and to the Honorable members of the Board of Commis - sioners of State Institutions, Howard Kennedy, Henry Gerdes and Silas A. Holcomb: Gentlemen : In conformity to custom and compliance with law, I sub - mit for your consideration the biennial report of this insti - tution. This report covers the period extending from Decem - ber 1, 1914, to December 1, 1916, and will be found to contain a complete review of results obtained in our several depart - ments. The object of the report is to convey to the reader a comprehensive presentation of the administrative policy in dealing with our population of girls, — the educational, do - mestic, moral and religious training ; finances ; general recom - mendations for future plans ; maintenance and improve - ments. If careful study is given the report it will confirm the belief long held that the affairs at this institution are in excellent condition ; that orderliness and cleanliness are in evidence; that a spirit of co-operation and mutual helpful - ness permeates all departments ; and that efficiency and thoroughness have become fixed standards. On June 30, 1915, the new Auditorium building was opened for the first time to the public. The keys were pre - sented by Architect Joseph W. Salmon, and accepted by Chair - man of the Board, Silas A. Holcomb, who delivered to a large and interested audience a masterful address. The new building erected at a cost of $45,000 is a re - inforced concrete, fire-proof structure 48x120 ft. It consists of four floors occupied as follows: 1st floor, large general </seg>
            <seg id="p005">150 SECOND BIENNIAL REF-ORT OF kitchen, teachers' and girls' dining rooms, dry storage room, and teachers' suite; 2nd floor, reception parlors, superintend - ent's apartments, and auditorium ; 3rd floor, hospital, dormi - tory, matron's apartments, and family manager's suite. Con - necting the two buildings is a subway electrically lighted and steam heated. The steam heating plant was improved greatly by lev - elling the mains. Now, both buildings can be easily heated and kept comfortably warm. The new septic tank is dis - posing of the sewage which in past years has caused so much serious trouble and annoyance. In the laundry there has been installed one double-geared solid head metal washer 36 "x64" ; one single washer 36"x36" ; and one solid curb extractor, and one improved flat-work ironer. The basement of the old building formerly used as gen - eral kitchen and girls' dining room has been transformed into a spacious playroom with bath and dressing rooms. We now have three large recreation halls for the special family divisions, and have classified our little people as follows: Family "A", receiving ward and girls who need to be segre - gated; Family "B", the bright, intelligent, normal and pro - gressive girls ; Family "C", children from three and one-half to fourteen years of age. This classification of our wards has made it possible to carry out our work with a greater decree of efficiency. SCHOOL The unique conditions which exist at this institution have enabled us to do something along the line of educational ex - perimentation bearing particularly upon the course of study, the content of the curriculum, and the re-adjustment which seems to us to be desirable in the lives of our students. Owing to the varying conditions from which the members of the institution come, the instruction given and the method used must necessarily differ from that in the public schools. One reason is, that the vocational and educational training received here is practically all the girls will get, and much must be obtained during their period of stay in the school. There- </seg>
            <seg id="p006">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 151 fore, a course of study where the vocational training is closely allied with the academic is necessary, and every lesson must have a distinct moral value as well. On June 30, 1915, we held our first graduating exercises, eleven girls completing the course of study as prescribed for 8th grade work. These exercises were attended by a very large number of town and out of town people who were gen - erous in their expressions of approval and words of encour - agement. We have made graduation an annual feature in our work, and this year nine more completed the course. Our first Alumnae organized June 6, 1916, the girls entering into it with a perfectly keen and gratifying sense of appreciation. MUSIC All students of child life and development have long classed music among the most important studies as a means of reaching and stimulating natures to which other studies do not appeal. As a softening and refining influence in schools of this kind its value cannot be over-estimated. Instruction is given in voice, chorus work, wind and string instruments, and piano. We have a marvelous band of twenty-four pieces and an orchestra of fifteen. The band has played many en - gagements during the summer months at home and in our neighboring towns, and were frequently presented with a liberal purse from enthusiastic audiences. DOMESTIC SCIENCE Instruction in this important department covers the preparation of nourishing meats, the making of soups, plain cooking, dressing of fowl, preparation and cooking of vegetables, making of bread, cakes, pies, jelly, and preserves, setting of tables and serving. SEWING This includes all kinds of sewing by hand and machine, making of skirts, waists, aprons, dresses, gowns, and all household linens ; mending, darning, patching, making but - tonholes, hemstitching, embroidering, tatting, crocheting, and drawnwork. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">152 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF HOUSEWORK In this department the girl is instructed in the care of the house in general; the proper way to sweep and dust, polishing and oiling woodwork, cleaning windows and bath - rooms; her work is carefully supervised by the different de - partmental heads, and the importance of its being done neatly and thoroughly is emphasized. MORAL AND RELIGIOUS TRAINING Sunday School and Chapel services are conducted on Sun - day afternoons or evenings, using the International S. S. literature. Our classes are divided into advanced, inter - mediate, and primary. The Chapel services are conducted by the ministers of our city. These exercises are open to the public and we are glad to welcome our many visitors on the Sabbath afternoon. The girls join heartily in the singing of hymns, and the dignity and effectiveness of our services have been greatly enhanced by the introduction of fine or - chestra music, choir and solo work. The inspiring and re - ligious sermons or talks given by our interested and friendly chaplains are greatly appreciated and produce meritorious results. LIBRARY The State Library Commission has furnished us with many new books, also a varying supply of magazines. The girls enjoy their reading hours, and the usefulness of our splendid library cannot be over-estimated. DAILY ROUTINE The daily routine is about as follows: Breakfast at 6:30, then all engage in household duties such as making beds, wash - ing dishes, sweeping, dusting, etc. ; at 8 :30 general assembly and morning prayer, then special girls are detailed to laundry, sewing room, and domestic science departments, the remain - ing attending school. At 12 o'clock dinner, then there is time for recreation and play besides the adjustment of minor household duties. At 2 o'clock promptly, general assembly, when a half hour is devoted to singing (chorus work) and frequently a number rendered by the band or orchestra for </seg>

            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 153 the general enjoyment of the school. The second period of the day is again divided into detail duties and school session, just reversing the attendance of the morning, and in this way every girl receives training in household duties and has four and one-half hours of school. The division of the day into half day for vocational and half day for educational work has proved to be an admirable plan, especially when it is re - membered that the practical work of each department is not play work, not simple demonstration, but practical laundry work, cooking, serving meals, and sewing for a large family. The opportunities for play, recreation, and amusement are substantially provided for throughout the day. FUTURE PLANS The Legislature will, of course, make adequate and proper provision for the general maintenance of the institution, care and instruction of its wards, but we need legislation along other lines as well. In my last biennial report I spoke of our legal jurisdiction over the girl, and asked that it be extended to the 21st year, the same as in the case of the boy. Reforma - tion cannot always be effected in a few months, and the girl of seventeen coming to us as she often does unsophisticated as regards law, order and decency, lacking in school attain - ments, devoid of household training, tenacious of evil habits, cannot be made over and ready to return to society in so short a time. She should be under government until she becomes capable of self-control and self-support. This does not neces - sarily imply that she should remain in the institution until she is twenty-one, but that the protection and authority of those in charge be given her. The feeble-minded of all public institutions should be permanently retained in the proper institution. We must re - member that the defective delinquent can be educated and trained to a degree that will make her valuable in many ways, but should have continual supervision and direction that she may be safe herself and society protected. I further recom - mend that the little children from three and one-half to twelve years of age and the bright, likely girls, free from sex-experi- </seg>
            <seg id="p010">SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF 154 ence, be placed in the Nebraska Home for Dependent Chil - dren. We are coming to regard the institution home for children as not only a convenience for the care and training and disposition of needy children, but as a laboratory in which their physical, mental and moral needs may be discovered and appropriate remedies applied. The work of constructive moral education must have daily thought and care. Children need perfect surroundings and examples, because their instinct for imitation is active and powerful and they become what those are who are about them. Good examples, then, of general conduct, of self-control, of speech, of kindness and cheerful - ness should surround them, creating in their little minds and hearts a love for the good, the beautiful and true, and a dis - like for their opposites. These are problems before us, and every effort should be put forth to solve them. There is a maze of ideas and suggestions along this line, and we should labor unceasingly for ultimate and permanent results. Let us be mindful of our duty; and be it remembered, in Christ's picture of the last judgment, condemnation is pronounced not for what men did, but for what they failed to do. tThe final point to submit for consideration is the fol - wing catalog of our needs, — these to cover the period ending arch 31, 1919. Before closing, I want to say something about the health of our girls. Considering their usual physical condition on entering, it is astonishing to note their improvement. Their health is certainly excellent. JThis is accounted for partly by the skillful attention given by our physician and the faithful nursing of the matron. We have had some very Maintenance: Salaries and Wages _ $17,000.00 General Repairs 3,000.00 Other Maintenance 50,000.00 iJew Equipment and Furniture 'ermanent Improvement to Buildings and Grounds Jew Buildings rliscellaneous $70,000.0; 3,000.0 8,000.0 1,000.0 500.0 </seg>
            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 155 serious cases during the biennium — pneumonia, erysipelas, and the removal of tonsils. The cases were so skillfully handled that the patients were soon restored to health. We are grateful to our friends who have made it pos - sible for us to give the girls many privileges and treats. It is gratifying to know that the general public and particularly educators, legislators, and the professional classes are com - ing to understand the industrial school and its work better than ever before. The feeling toward our girls is changing favorably although slowly. We are coming to understand the ever increasing complexity of modern life, rendering existence more and more difficult for children, and that most of our cases have never had a fair chance in the world which is largely responsible for juvenile delinquents. The peril in the girl's life is not as many suppose, bad companions, bad books, etc., but it is the peril of homelessness. This does not necessarily mean houselessness and foodlessness, but that kind of homelessness which often does exist in well to do homes, the homelessness of being alone in a home, of being a nominal member of a family, yet living in isolation, having no one to talk to who sympathizes and understands. This is the homelessness which drives girls out into the world in search of the sympathy to which they know they have a right. I cannot say enough in appreciation for the benevolent kindness bestowed by our excellent local friends and neigh - bors upon the inmates of this "home", — the liberal treats, auto rides, tickets for lecture and chautauqua courses, and especially the continual "homey" visits that have aided us so materially in carrying out our plan in making the institution a real home in every way. The girls look back to the years spent in the institution as the happiest years of their life, and many return to visit their old home, the place where their childhood days were spent. They manifest a continual interest in the school and loyalty to its ideals. In some cases the girls who have returned to their home have sent through their influence the younger sisters from their own home, to be educated and cared for. </seg>
