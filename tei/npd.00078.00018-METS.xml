            <seg id="p003">Common Grass Weeds of Nebraska F. D. KEIM AND A. L. FROLIK ■ It is the purpose of this bulletin to illustrate, descr be, and present methods of eradication for a number of Ithe more common grass weeds m Nebraska. Only grasses that are recognized as weeds are included. These weeds hkve been brought m through seed mixtures with desirable crops, m railway freight cars, by birds, and by other means. Among other weeds, the grass weeds play a prominent part. Some have become established and disseminated to such an extent as to become very undesirable. Others have been less aggressive and are not conspicuously notice - able. Only the more aggressive ones are discussed m [the following pages. Some have a limited distribution, as yet,, but unless a determined campaign is carried against thfem,. they will increase until they become a tremendous problem. That weeds are of decided economic significance m Ne - braska is generally recognized. Losses occur through decreas - ed crop yields and expense of labor and machinery involved m the preparation of the seed bed, the tillage of crops, m6w - ing of roadsides, fence rows, and waste places, burning fof weeds, weeding of lawns, hoeing of gardens, and other means. The State Department of Agriculture maintains a sled laboratory m the capitol at Lincoln. Samples of seed can be sent for purity and germination tests free of charge. This laboratory should always be used whenever there is the slightest doubt m regard to the purity or viability of farm seeds. Two ounces (i/ 2 cupful) of small seeds and eight ounces or approximately one pint of the larger seeds such as the cereals should be sent. Illustrations and descriptions of the individual species are presented so that the bulletin may be used by those with limited botanical training. This publication should prove of value to farmers, high school teachers and stu - dents, 4-H club members, and the general public who des re to become better acquainted with the more common grass weeds. Family, tribe, and scientific names are presented for the benefit of those who are interested m the botanical phase. Those common names which are generally recog - nized are included. The common name introducing a pkr - ticular species is preferable for general usage. ThJSJh ,l* t^l^l "?! 'ISJl't, 0 !,!'"? bulletin, to be published on Nebraska w.edii.

            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 4 CRAB-GRASS Other common names: Water grass, Finger-grass, Large crab-grass. Scientific name: Syntherisma sanguinalc (L.) Dulac. Family: Gramineae. Tribe: Paniceae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seeds and rooting of lower nodes on the stem. Plant. — This species grows 1 to 2 feet tall, is usually much branched, and assumes a semi-erect habit, the stems being decumbent at the base. If the. plants are subjected to mowing or grazing, they grow prostrate, forming mats. The vegetative organs are commonly purplish, the leaves hairy, and the lower nodes of the stems root freely. It is susceptible to cold and is commonly killed by the first frost m the fall, leaving dried patches of vegetation particularly noticeable m lawns. Inflorescence. — The inflorescence consists of a spike divided into few to several digits or racemes. It is commonly purplish m the earlier stages. Distribution. — Crab-grass occurs m lawns, golf greens, cultivated fields and waste places. It occurs generally over the state, but is very common m eastern Nebraska. It is particularly troublesome m lawns, being considered one of our worst pests m this respect. In southern states, it is sometimes harvested as volunteer hay m fields where crops have been removed earlier m the season. Eradication. — Since crab-grass depends entirely upon seed to propa - gate from year to year, the prevention of seed production will aid m control. This may be accomplished through clean cultivation and timely mowing. In lawns crab-grass presents a difficult problem be - cause the plants are fairly well adapted to frequent clipping, can grow prostrate, and seed close to the ground. The entire plant must be removed to prevent seeding. Hand weeding is the most effective method. It is well to become familiar with crab-grass m its early stages of growth, as it is more effectively eradicated at this time. Often crab-grass appears so abundantly that hand weeding is not prac - tical. Thorough raking of crab-grass patches prior to mowing will cause prostrate stems which have rooted at the nodes to be pulled loose. These plants can then be pulled, spudded out, or clipped with the mower. Certain practices if carefully followed will help m pre - venting crab-grass infestation m lawns. First, do not mow the lawn grass shorter than two inches at any time. The turf will then help to keep the crab-grass from rooting at the nodes. Second, light spwn - kling is better than heavy watering during the hot summer months. Crab-grass thrives especially well under extremely moist conditions. Bluegrass will turn brown if it becomes dry, but it is not likely to die Third, fertilize the lawn with well-rotted, weed-free manure or commercial fertilizers so that the very best possible turf will be main - tained. </seg>

            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 6 BARNYARD GRASS Other common names: Water grass, Cockspur grass. Scientific name: Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv. Family: Gramineae. Tribe : Paniceae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — The plant grows 1 to 5 feet tall, branches at the base, with the culms erect or partially decumbent and spreading over the ground. The blades and sheaths are generally smooth. Inflorescence. — The panicles are from 3 to 10 inches long with the spikelets borne on short pedicels attached to the branches. The branches of the panicle are usually more distant and longer on the lower part of the axis and become shorter and closer above. Stiff hairs abundant at the base of the branches are of varying lengths, occasionally longer than the spikelets. The spikelets are green to purplish m color, bear awns, and contain one fertile flower per spike - let. This species flowers, and fruits from 1 the middle of July until frost. Distribution. — This introduced weed is generally distributed over the state. It prefers moist, rich soil and hence it is usually f ound m valleys, about sloughs, and m low places. It is not particularly trouble - some except under high moisture conditions. It grows prohncally and becomes a nuisance around farmsteads, cultivated fields, and waste places* Barnyard grass resembles Japanese barnyard millet, to which it is closely related. During the early stages this grass weed makes reason - ably eood pasture for livestock. If harvested during the early stages of thf flowering period it makes fairly good hay After maturity the stems and floral parts become harsh and unpalatable to livestock and the plant becomes worthless as a forage. Eradication. Thorough cultivation and mowing to prevent seed formation are effective means of eradication As i is the case with most of the other weeds it is very important to kill the plants while they are small and before the extensive fibrous root system becomes well developed. </seg>

            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 8 TICKLE GRASS Other common names: Tumbleweed, Witch grass, Old witch grass. Scientific name: Panicum eapillare L. Family: Gramineac. Tribe: Paniceue. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — The plant is branched, growing from 6 inches to 2 feet tall. The stems are erect or ascending and often prostrate at one or more of the lower nodes. The leaf sheaths are very hairy. The upper sheaths usually enclose the lower branches of the panicle. Inflorescence. — The inflorescence consists of a large, open panicle, the latter being nearly half as long as the whole plant. The panicle is covered with small numerous spikelets. At maturity the panicle breaks away and is blown about by the wind as a tumble grass. The name, tickle grass, is applied to several species of grass weeds by the public. The name is so commonly used for several species that it is usually questionable as to which plant is being considered, unless specimens are available. It is preferable to confine the name tickle grass to this weed. Distribution. — This species is quite generally distributed over the state. It commonly occurs m waste places, cultivated fields, stubble fields, and along roadsides. It is also found along ditches and m other moist places. Because of its prolific seeding and the tumbling about of the panicles by the wind, it is readily scattered over the fields. Tickle grass like some of the other grass weeds makes fairly good hay if cut m the early stages of growth. During the extremely dry periods of the nineties this was a common practice. Eradication. — It is not a particularly difficult weed to control. Clean cultivation and mowing of waste places to prevent seed formation are effective. Stubble fields should be plowed or disked soon after harvest. The plants are easily killed when small. </seg>

            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 10 BRISTLY FOXTAIL Other common name: Foxtail grass. Scientific name: Setaria vertidllata (L.) Beauv. Family: Gramineae. Tribe: Paniceae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — This species grows 1 to 3 feet tall branchng at the base, with the stems erect or ascending. The leaf blades are roughened on the upper surface, but are not hairy- The sheaths are smooth. Inflorescence. — The inflorescence is a dense, slender, and cylindrical panicle. The axis is angular. The bristles, Ito 3 below each spikelet, are retrorsely rough, hence the name bristly foxtail. The mature heads appear as a mass of seeds and bristles adhering together because of the barbed nature of the bristles. Distribution. — This weed is found m many localities m eastern. Nebraska and is spreading and becoming more common. It is found m waste places and about dwellings; but at times stubble fields, potato patches, and other cultivated areas become badly infested. The barbed bristles provide this weed with a special device for spreading. The fetlocks, manes, and tails of horses, and the hair and wool of other animals feeding m fields infested with this pest are likely to become thoroughly matted with the seeds and bristles of the weed. Cornfields infested with barbed foxtail are a nuisance to shuck because the mittens and other clothing, become covered with these barbed bristles. The plants are hardy and persistent under Nebraska con - ditions. Eradication. — Since this weed is dependent upon seed production for its perpetuation, cleaning up of the places where it grows is desir - able. Since it is a weed of minor importance as yet, it should be eradicated with the idea of preventing its increase. Clean cultivation or persistent mowing, pulling, and hoeing are necessary for complete eradication. Too much stress cannot be laid on the importance of complete eradi - cation of this weed pest. A program of community co-operation is ad - visable, as is the case with all other weeds. </seg>

            <seg id="p012">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 12 YELLOW FOXTAIL Other common names: Pigeon grass, Wild millet. Scientific name: Sctaria lutescens (Weigel) Hubbard. Family : Gramineae. Tribe: Patdceae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — The plants are from 1 to 4 feet tall, branching at the base, with the stems usually erect or ascending. The leaves are generally smooth with the exception of some hairiness on the upper surface of the blade. Inflorescence. — The inflorescence consists of a compact, cylindrical panicle. The numerous bristles below the spikelets cause the heads to appear hairy. The inflorescence, of yellow foxtail is quite similar to green foxtail except that the dense panicles are somewhat larger m diameter and the seeds are conspicuously larger, making the heads of the former appear coarse. Upon maturity the seeds of yellow fox - tail are yellow m color, while those of green foxtail commonly retain their green color. Distribution. — Yellow foxtail is a common weed generally distributed over the state, although it is most abundant m eastern Nebraska. It does not usually appear as abundantly dn stubble fields, alfalfa meadows, roadsides, waste places, and gardens as dqes the green foxtail. Yellow foxtail prior to maturity is eaten by animals as hay or pasture. Stubble fields often contain considerable quantities of the yellow and green foxtails and are grazed freely m the early stages of growth by livestock, especially cattle. The seeds of the foxtails are common impurities m the small-seeded grasses and legumes. During some years it is difficult to find a sample of alfalfa or red-clover seed that does not contain at least a few fox - tail seeds. Eradication. — Prevention of seeding is necessary to control this weed. Persistent cultivation or mowing is effective. Infested areas should be cultivated while the foxtail plants are small and before the fibrous roots become well established. During those seasons when conditions are not favorable for the germination of the foxtail seed, intertilled crops should be cultivated just as late as possible and especially after late-season rains so that the soil will not become infested with those foxtail plants coming from seed delayed m sprouting. Flocks of sheep are sometimes valuable m cleaning up cornfields badly infested with foxtail and other weeds. </seg>

            <seg id="p014">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 14 GREEN FOXTAIL Other common names: Foxtail grass, Pigeon grass, Bottle grass. Scientific name: Setaria viridia (L.) Beauv. Family: Gramineae. Tribe: Paniceae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. plant. This species grows from Ito 3 feet tail. It branches at the base, with the culms erect or ascending. The blades and sheaths are smooth. Inflorescence. — The inflorescence consists of compact, cylindrical panicles tapering a little toward the apex. The numerous bristles cause the heads to appear decidedly hairy. Large quantities of seed are produced. Distribution. — This weed is among those most generally distributed over the state. It is particularly abundant m cultivated fields and gardens. It occurs m waste places, stubble fields, and along roadsides, and it readily enters disturbed areas m meadows and pastures. Be - cause of its prolific seed production, gre«n foxtail propagates freely and is one of the most abundant weeds m most localities. Foxtail prior to maturity is eaten by animals either as pasture or as hay and is not nearly so objectionable m prairie or alfalfa hay as other weeds. According to the Federal Hay Standards, early-cut fox - tail grass m alfalfa is considered as grass hay and not as foreign material. Green foxtail is even more commonly found m timothy, alfalfa, and red-clover seed than its close relative, yellow foxtail. Tbis aids materially m the spread of this weed. Eradication. — Although it seeds abundantly, green foxtail is not especially difficult to eradicate. Thorough cultivation and hoeing and timely mowing can be effectively used. Frequent cultivation and mow - ing must be practiced, since it blooms throughout the season, and may mature seed m cornfields after cultivation has ceased. As is the case with- yellow foxtail or any of the other grass weeds, the earlier the plants can be destroyed the easier the task can be accomplished. Early plowing or disking of small grain stubble fields and pasturing cultivated crops with sheep will help m keeping the foxtail seed from maturing. -. </seg>

            <seg id="p016">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 16 SANDBUR Other common names: Bur grass, Hedgehog grass. Scientific name: Cenehrus tribuloides L. Family : Gramineae. Tribe: Paniceae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — This species grows from 6 inches to 2 feet tall and is usually much branched and decumbent at the base, sometimes rooting at the lower nodes. The stems are ascending, compressed, and have short internodes. Inflorescence. Because of the characteristic burs, this species is not readily confused with any other grass. The burs are borne m dense panicles and are armed wtih retrorsely barbed spines. The spikelets, usually two m number, are contained within the burs. The burs are easily detached from the flowering stalk and may be carried around by animals or other objects to which they may become readily attached. Distribution. — This is a common weed, appearing over most of the state. It usually occurs m cultivated fields, waste places, run-down permanent sandy pastures, and gardens. It occurs very commonly m sandy soils. The young growing plants are palatable to livestock. The plants seem relatively unimportant until the burs appear, which make them unsightly and troublesome. The burs may inflict painful wounds and are very objectionable as foreign material .m the wool of sheep. Alfalfa or prairie hay which contains more than a trace of mature sandburs causes the hay to be graded sample grade-, according to the Federal Hay Standards, because of injurious foreign material. Eradication. This species may be brought under control by thorough cultivation m the fields and hoeing of gardens. The plants often mature seed m stubble after a small-grain crop has been removed. Timely disking or plowing of the stubble fields will prevent thds from occurring. Precaution should be taken m the cultivation of sandy soils to prevent blowing. All plants must be destroyed if complete eradica - tion is to be expected. The burning of fields containing mature plants is often a good practice. </seg>

            <seg id="p018">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 18 WIRE GRASS Other common names: Prairie triple-awn, Few-flowered Aristida. Scientific name: Aristida oligantha Michx. ( Family : Gramineae. Tribe : Agrostideae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — The plants grow from 6 inches to 1% feet tall. The stems are much branched and usually free from any hairiness. The leaf blades are small and very narrow. The plants mature early and pre - sent a dried mass of vegetation m late summer and fall months. Inflorescence. — The flowering organs consist of a compact panicle with small spikelets. The inflorescence appears very open and bushy but this is largely due to the three long awns of each flower. Distribution. — Wire grass grows most readily m dry areas where there is least competition from other species. As a result it commonly grows m pure stands. It is found m prairies, abandoned fields, washed slopes, along dry roadsides, and along railroad tracks. Wire grass often occurs m disturbed areas of prairie land which are dry and not especially favorable for growth of other species of vegetation. It is quite generally distributed over the state and is often found growing m alfalfa fields where the stand of the latter is poor. It is difficult to mow, especially when the plants are wet from dew or rain. Alfalfa or prairie hay containing more than a trace of mature wire grass is graded sample grade, according to the Federal Hay Standards. Eradication. — This weed is not considered especially serious. Since it appears only m drier areas, it seldom competes seriously with culti - vated crops. Mowing or clean tillage of infested areas is generally re - commended. Other vegetation will crowd out wire grass, if the in - fested area is made more favorable for plant growth. </seg>

            <seg id="p020">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 20 WILD OATS Other common names: None. Scientific name: Avena fatua L. Family: Gramineae. Tribe : A veneae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — This species grows from 1 to 4 feet tall with the plants branching. The stems are stout and erect. Inflorescence. — The inflorescence consists of open panicles, similar to cultivated oats, with the exception that the wild oats appear some - what more open and bristly. The prominent awns of wild oats account for the bristly appearance. If wild oats appear m a field of cultivated oats, they are not readily recognized. Distribution. — Wild oats make their most common appearance and propagate most freely on tilled land along with cultivated crops. They will intermingle especially easily with spring wheat, oats, barley, and flax. The life cycle is similar to that of these crops and hence the plant is capable of maturing seed. It is a pernicious weed &gt;m the spring-wheat area, Montana, the Dakotas, and Minnesota. It has advanced as far south as northern and especially northwestern Nebras - ka, where a considerable acreage of cultivated land is devoted to spring-seeded small grain with but little corn or other intertilled crops. The weed is spreading rapidly. Eradication. — The rule of sowing weed-free seed is very important m connection with wild oats. The practice of buying the so-called feed and mixed-feed oats is a very dangerous practice, because this type of grain is usually badly mixed with wild oats and other per - nicious weed seeds. Clean cultivation of intertilled crops and rota - tions are the most effective methods of control. Pulling or hoeing out the stray plants before the seed is mature is necessary for com - plete eradication. </seg>

            <seg id="p022">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 22 YARD GRASS Other common names: Goose grass, Wire grass, Crow's foot. Scientific name: Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn. Family: Gramineae. Tribe : Chloridcae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — This species grows from 6 inches to 2 feet tall, branches at the base and nodes, and possesses both erect and ascending culms. The stems are flat. The sheaths are rather loose and usually hairy to - ward the top and decidedly so at the junction with the collar. The blades are usually smooth. Inflorescence. — The spikes are terminal, digitate, and straight, being Ito 3 inches long. The spikelets are sometimes purplish, closely im - bricated m two rows and contain 2 to 9 flowers, usually 4 or 5. Yard grass flowers and matures seed from the first of July until frost. Distribution. — Yard grass has been introduced m a number of local - ities m the state, but as yet is not generally distributed. It occurs as a weed m dooryards and along roadsides and waste places where it often spreads and forms a dense mat. This species is a tough grass resistant to tramping and drying and especially persistent m lawns, yards, and paths. In the drier sections of some areas such as central Kansas, it often invades and occupies alfalfa fields aa the stand of the latter becomes thinned out. Eradication. — Seed formation must be prevented to eradicate yard grass. Timely and clean cultivation are essential on tilled land. Mow - ing of untilled areas prior to the time of seeding is necessary. The mowing must be repeated, as new flowering stalks will continue to emerge. This grass may present a problem m lawns. It can be readily de - tected while yonng and can easily be pulled or hoed out. Eradication while the plants are still very young greatly simplifies the task. </seg>

            <seg id="p024">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 24 STINK GRASS Other common names: Love-grass, Candy grass. Scientific name: Eragrostis major Host. Family: Gram&amp;neae. Tribe: Festuceae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. plant. The plants grow from 6 inches to 2 feet tall and branch freely with erect or ascending stems, the latter being mostly decumbent at the base. The leaf sheaths are shorter than the internodes. The leaves are free from hairiness for the most part, except at the base of the blade. Glands on the plant produce a strong and disagreeable odor. Inflorescence. — The inflorescence is of the paniculate type. The spikelet is characterized by its large number of flowers, 8 to 40. When emerging the panicles are grayish-green but fade out as maturity is approached. The plants seed profusely. The seeds are reddish and very small when ripe, dropping readily from the spikelets. They are a common impurity of timothy and other small grass seeds. Distribution. — Stink grass occurs m all parts of Nebraska along road - sides, railroads, m waste places, about dwellings, m overgrazed pas - tures, and m cultivated fields. Because of the large number of seeds produced, this weed is very common m certain areas. Although it has an attractive appearance it is decidedly unpalatable to livestock either as pasture or hay. This is due to the offensive odor of the plants and the unpalatable quality of the forage. Eradication. — This plant, although seeding abundantly, is easily ex - terminated by preventing the development of seed. Thorough culti - vation and timely mowing are ordinarily all that is necessary. </seg>

Family: Gramineae. Tribe: Featueeae. Length of life: Perennial. Means of propagation : Seed. Plant. — This species grows from 6 inches to 2 feet tall. The culms are mostly decumbent at the base, rarely erect, -with the plant branch - ing diffusely at the base. The sheaths are usually sparsely pubescent, but densely hairy about the collar. The base of the leaf blade is also hairy. Inflorescence. — The panicles are large with the branches widely spreading, sometimes partially enclosed m the upper sheaths. This grass is conspicuous m the autumn, because of its large purple panicles. These often break off and are blown by the wind like tumbleweeds. The spikelets contain 5 to 15 flowers and are borne on long, stiff pedicels. This grass flowers and matures from the first of July until frost, but mostly during August and September. Distribution. — This species occurs as a weed over most of the state, growing along streams, ditches, roads, railroads, and waste places, and it may also occasionally occur m cultivated fields and pastures. It is not particularly troublesome m cultivated fields. Eradication. — Most oi the common grass \jeeds m Nebraska ate annual, but purple love-grass is a perennial. It is not an aggressive perennial and depends solely upon seed for its dissemination. Because of the tumbling of the large, mature panicles 'm the wind, this species will scatter large quantities of seed over a large area. Accordingly the prevention of seeding is especially recommended. Clean cultiva - tion will easily eradicate it on tilled land. Mowing of untilled land which is infested with love-grass prior to the time of seeding is import - ant m preventing the spread of this weed. Cultivation, hoeing, or pulling of the plants by hand is essential for the eradication of this weed m untilled areas. </seg>

            <seg id="p028">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 28 SLENDER FESCUE-GRASS Other common name : Slender fescue. . Scientific name : Featuca oetoflora Walt. Family: Gramineae. Tribe: Festuceae. Length of life: Annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — The plants attain a height of 3 to 15 inches and are often tufted. The slender culms are usually erect although sometimes geniculate at the base. The sheaths are commonly smooth. The blades are very short and glabrous. Inflorescence. — The panicles are narrow and contracted, appearing spikelike. The branches are short and erect, usually bearing 1 to 8 spikelets. The spikelets are long and flat and possess 5 to 13 flowers each. The awns are short and not particularly noticeable. The in - florescence presents a greenish to reddish-purple color. This species flowers and matures seed during the months of May to July, thereafter presenting a dried mass of vegetation when occur - ring dn appreciable quantities. Distribution. — This species occurs m dry soil over most of the state. It seeds abundantly and accordingly is capable of. readily perpetuating itself. It is not particularly well adapted for competing with other taller plants, if the latter can grow under the existing environment. Slender fescue is unpalatable to livestock, especially as it reaches maturity and readily spreads as an undesirable grass m overgrazed sandy and other pasture lands. Since this grass is not particularly aggressive or unsightly m appearance where it occurs, it is not usually considered as great a nuisance as it really is. Eradication. — The presence of slender fescue indicates overgrazing m pastures, and overgrazed pastures should receive attention. Good practices are (1) reducing the number of livestock, (2) delaying grazing m the spring until the grass has made four or five inches of growth, (3) application of a light top dressing of manure, and (4) mowing of weeds at the proper time. </seg>

            <seg id="p030">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 30 DOWNY BROME Other common names: Military grass, sometimes incorrectly called wild oats. Scientific name: Bromus tectorum L. Family: Gramineae. Tribe : Fcstuceae. Length of life: Fall annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — This species grows from 6 inches to 2 feet tall, the culms branch at the base, and the sheaths and blades are distinctly hairy. Inflorescence. — The paniculate type of inflorescence is commonly drooping. The spikelets bear 5 to 10 flowers, the latter bearing prom - inent awns. The panicle often assumes a characteristic purplish color. This species may be distinguished from cheat by the hairiness of the plant and the characteristically drooping, chaffy, heavily awned spike - lets. Downy brome flowers and matures seed from the middle of May until the middle of July. If it comes up m the spring it is possible for this plant to mature seed m the late summer. Distribution. — Downy brome is an introduced weed which is be - coming generally distributed over the state. It commonly occurs m waste places, along railroad tracks, and along roadsides. It invades alfalfa meadows and pastures but offers little trouble m cultivated fields. It is unpalatable to livestock, particularly when approaching maturity, and is very undesirable m meadows and pastures. This weed has become especially serious m alfalfa fields m northwest Nebraska. Eradication. — It is essential to prevent seeding. Thorough mow - ing and clean cultivation are advisable. Since this species flowers so early m the season and is relatively unpalatable to livestock, it seeds freely m meadows and pastures after once becoming established. If it has been present for some time, plowing up of such areas is recom - mended. Pasturing with sheep m the early spring is sometimes very effective. Cultivation of alfalfa fields m ther fall and early spring with the spring-tooth harrow is considered a good practice. It has been suggested that where a spring-tooth harrow is not available a disk may be used. The disk should be set so as to cut the grass loose and the field should then be harrowed crosswise to the direction of the disking. This operation should be done when the grass is small and before it has developed very much of a sod. </seg>

            <seg id="p032">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 32 CHEAT Other common name: Chess. Scientific name: Bromus secalinus L. Family: Grammeae. 'Tribe: Festuceae. Length of life: Fall annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — This species grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, the plant branches, and the stems are erect. The stems and leaf sheaths are typically smooth. Inflorescence. — The inflorescence is of the paniculate type. The open-type panicle consists of numerous branches usually drooping somewhat. The spikelets contain sto 15 flowers. The individual flow - ers are rather deeply enrolled. The flowering glumes bear short awns. Distribution. — This species occurs m various localities over the state. It occurs most frequently m winter wheat fields, but also m waste places. It was introduced from Europe but has now spread all through the temperate part of North America. The idea somewhat prevails that wheat turns into cheat. This is impossible but the idea arises through the fact that the seeds of cheat when buried retain their viability for some years and may appear even when clean seed wheat is planted. Eradication. — It is especially important to prevent this weed from seeding and to avoid seeding wheat which contains cheat. It can easily spread and increase through winter wheat, because their life cycles are similar, i.e., both are fall annuals. Mowing of waste places and crop rotations are recommended. Where cheat is present, the wheat fields should be carefully gone over and the cheat pulled out before the seed is mature enough to germinate. It is not uncommon to find cheat m common brome grass (Bromus inermis) seed. Growers of brome grass should always guard against this pest. </seg>

            <seg id="p034">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 34 QUACK GRASS Other common names: Couch grass, Quitch grass, Witch grass. Scientific name: Agrojryron repens (L.) Beauv. Family : Gramineae. Tribe : Hordeae. Length of life: Perennial. Means of propagation: Rhizomes and seed. Plant. — The plants grow from 1% to 3 feet tall, and are perennial with long, slender rhizomes. The culms are erect and smooth. It occurs most commonly m pure stands and frequently m circular patches. Inflorescence.— The inflorescence is a spike. The spikes are 2to 4 inches m length. The spikelets are arranged flatwise to the rachis and consist of 4to 6 flowers each. The flowers are awn pointed or bear short awns. This grass may be confused with western wheat grass but is distinguished from it by the broader, darker green leaves, the lower sheaths of which are usually covered with short hairs and 4 to 6 flowers per spikelet while the latter has more rigid, bluish leaves, no hairs on the lower sheaths, and mostly 7 to 12 flowers per spikelet. Distribution. — Quack grass occurs occasionally m small patches m eastern Nebraska. It does not thrive well under the drier environ - ment of central and western parts of the state. It is considered a noxious weed according to the Nebraska Seed Law and consequently its promiscuous entry into this state through crop seeds has been care - fully guarded against. Quack grass has proved to be one of the most troublesome weeds m some of the eastern and northern states. It is very persistent and detrimental particularly m cultivated fields and m vegetable and flower gardens. It is grazed readily by livestock and is not generally discriminated against m pastures. The danger lies m its escaping to cultivated lands. Eradication. — The use of crop seed containing quack grass should be avoided. Seed shipped m from northern and eastern states is most likely to contain such contamination. If the ground is kept clean by continuous tillage throughout two growing seasons, the underground reproductive organs and roots are eventually killed out. The use of chemicals is effective. Sodium chlorate applied either as a spray during the summer months or m the dry form m the fall at the rate of 3 pounds per square rod will give favorable results. This applica - tion may have to be followed by a light treatment the following season, if any growth of quack grass appears. The use of tar papeT or other coverings to suffocate small patches of quack grass may be practical. This covering should be sufficiently heavy to prevent any green growth. One season may be sufficient, although two are commonly necessary. This covering should extend at least 6 feet beyond the edge of the above-ground vegetative growth. </seg>

            <seg id="p036">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 36 LITTLE WILD BARLEY Other common name: Barley grass. Scientific name : Hordeum pusttlum Nutt. Family: Gramineae. Tribe: Hordeae. Length of life: Fall annual. Means of propagation: Seed. Plant. — This species grows from 6 inches to 1% feet tall and branches at the base. The culms are erect. The stems and leaf sheaths are smooth. Inflorescence. — The heads, a spicate type, are from % to 3 inches long and less than % inch m width. The spikelets are arranged m groups of three, the lateral ones being imperfect. The glumes of the spikelets are narrow and appear very much like awns. The perfect or central spikelet is awned. Each spikelet bears one flower. This species flowers and seeds m May and June. Distribution. — Although not generally distributed, this weed increas - es rapidly along railroad tracks and other waste places. It grows readily m certain soils where other plants grow with difficulty. Little barley invades overgrazed pastures and thin lawns, replacing the more desirable grasses. It is drouth resistant and becomes very unpalatable to . livestock as it approaches maturity. It is not generally trouble - some m cultivated fields. Pastures that have been used for feeding corn fodder and hay. to livestock during the winter months provide a very common place for this pest to get started. Eradication. — Since this weed is a fall annual and propagates by seed only, the prevention of seeding is esential for its eradication. Remedial practices must be resorted to early m the season, since the weed matures seed so early. Since it is -increasing so rapidly, it should be guarded against to prevent additional spread. Mowing, burning, and cultivation are recommended. Livestock should be removed from pastures infested with this pest and the desirable pasture grasses given a chance to re-establish themselves and occupy the ground. Other recommended practices for the improvement of run-down permanent pastures should be followed. These are enumerated an the discussion of slender fescue. </seg>

            <seg id="p038">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 288 38 WILD BARLEY Other common names: Squirrel-tail grass, Tickle grass. Scientific name: Hordeum jubatum L. Family: Gramineae. Tribe: Hordeae. Length of life: Perennial, sometimes annual. Means of propagation: Seed and inconspicuous rhizomes. Plant. — This plant grows from 6 inches to 2 feet tall, the base of the plant branching profusely. The culms are usually erect although sometimes bent at the base. The leaves are generally green but occasionally take on a bluish cast, particularly when the plant is young.' Inflorescence. — The heads, a spicate type, are from 2 to 4 inches long. They are especially characterized by the long, slender, rough awns which give the heads a bushy appearance. The spikelets are arranged m groups of three, the lateral ones being imperfect. The outer glumes of the spikelets are awn-like m appearance. Each spike - let bears one flower. This species flowers and seeds from May to July. Distribution. — This weed is generally distributed over the state, occurring along railroad tracks and m waste places. It sometimes in - vades' pastures and hay meadows, particularly when these are over - grazed or the sod is disturbed. The awns upon maturity become stiff and sharp and when eaten by livestock cause inflammation and ulcera - tion of the mouth and nostrils. Tbis is particularly noticeable m hay containing mature wild barley. Sheep are especially apt to be injured by the awns. The injuries m some instances have been so severe as to cause death of the animals. Alfalfa or prairie hay containing more than a trace of mature wild barley is graded sample grade, according to the Federal Hay Standards, because of injurious foreign material. Eradication.- — Prevention of seeding is recommended. This must be accomplished relatively early m the season because of the early seed - ing of wild barley. Plowing up of badly infested pastures m eastern Nebraska is advisable. Hay-stack bottoms should be carefully cleaned up and the ground reseeded to desirable grasses. It is easily controlled 'm cultivated fields with ordinary tillage practices. </seg>
