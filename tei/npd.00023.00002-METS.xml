            <seg id="p004">55 Mr. President, Gentlemen oj ttf and House, Mil Fellow Citin RVe are here today in the performance of the ceremony vided by the constitution of the state of Nebraska. This occasion, then, is typical of the fact that we live in a state and a nation whose characteristic features are love of order and law. FREEDOM NOT LICENSE riur country is free, yet no man has a right to do as pleases. In the language of De Tocquiville we - " In no country in the world does the law hold so absolute a language as in America." Our transitory periods, then, or our changes in policies of government are always marked by sober and well defined purposes. There is never an alliance with the turbulent passions of anarchy. In a word we are revolutionary never, but democratic always. And this leads us to assert that theories of economics are embodied and set forth in the platform of political parties and hence a campaign of enlightenment and education is inaugurated. Newspapers and public speakers begin a serious discussion. The people become interested. They listen, read and gather information and they think the matter out for themselves. Soberly and quietly, they go to the polls, register their opinions and convictions. And when the vote is counted in nearly every instance, American history tells us that the majority is for good government and the rights of society. And this responsibility that the voter assumes makes him one </seg>

Eo better illustration of a campaign of education is s found than in the unselfishness and patriotic attitude med by the country press in the campaign just closed. I great debauching and o'erweening brewery trust e an assault upon the very life of our state. Under specious and deceptive plea of "personal liberty" sought to take the government out of the hands of people. Then it was that the country editor rallied nd the colors and sounded the tocsin of war, and his e call reverberated throughout the state and the lant energies of Nebraska's citizenship were thor - ily aroused. Men and women of all religious creeds political beliefs responded and on November 8th, wrote in living burning words: The people must : Decent government shall prevail: Debauchery lawlessness shall feel the strong hand of the law. Ehus did Nebraska come forth from that conflict fied and ennobled, her patriotism made stronger and e enduring by the ritual observance of the fun - ental principles of representative government. PLAYING POLITICS The people decided also on November 8th last, thai they do not want this present legislature to play politics. They did not permit a republican governor to have a republican majority in the legislature. Neither did they give a democratic majority a democratic governor. And a republican governor will not permit this democratic majority to work at democratic politics. The plain lesson </seg>
            <seg id="p006">57 beneficial to sill the people, then adjourn ano save the people money. Let us hope that this distribution of power between the two parties will work out for the general good of the entire state. The situation after all may be fortunate, because we meet here in a sense, not as republicans and democrats seeking a party advantage by enacting laws to perpetuate one party or the other in power, but rather we are met on that higher and greater plain, to-wit, as American citizens, to transact some serious business for our fellows. And if we enter upon our business, earnestly and vigorously we will easily have finished by March 1st. This can be accomplished if each member goes seriously about his duties and turns a deaf ear to the pernicious lobbyist. But it is expecting too much to even hope for this legislature to escape altogether the arts and insidious wiles of the corrupt lobbyist. I do not wish in this con - nection, however, to be understood as being opposed to having business interests properly represented by decent agents acting in a proper manner. But I do say that when the county option measure and the initiative and referendum comes up for consideration, if the members of this legislative body will cooperate with me, the liquor trust lobby will find the city of Lincoln too hot for their personal health. And I warn you now that there is already organized a powerful combination fin - anced and backed by the brewery trust of this state to defeat direct legislation. The recent election has taught them nothing. And I say to the people of the several legislative districts of this state, that if any one of your representatives is not acting right or is supporting an </seg>
            <seg id="p007">58 initiative and referendum measure that has a joker in it or so framed as to be impractical, that he is representing the breweries and not you. Any private interest that seeks to defeat county option and the initiative and referendum, ought to be held up to public scorn. If the recent election has any one lesson -more emphatic than another that lesson is that the people must rule, and he who is opposed to direct legislation is opposed to the people. NON-PARTISAN MEASURE All parties are pledged to submit an initiative and referendum measure. Then there can be no question about such a measure going through. But there may be serious doubts as to the proper kind of a law on this subject. The fact that we are all pledged to enact such a law carries with it the promise to enact a fair, honest and effective measure. One that in all of its details will give the people the benefits of its principles and virtues. And in this matter we are not left in the dark as to what should be done for several of our sister states have adopted this kind of legislation, and let us hope that no liquor interests will be strong enough to impose impossible or impractical conditions in the adoption of the initiative and referendum. And here permit me to observe that in voting amendments to our state constitution, that a majority of those voting for or against said amendment, should determine the issue and thus carry the amend- FOR COUNTY OPTION Ee who claims to be in favor of the initiative and 'endum and at the same time is opposed to county on must fail to either act in good faith or to under- </seg>
            <seg id="p008">59 r how can we refuse to enact a county option mea. - which is only one small detail in direct legislation. County option was the paramount issue in the recent campaign. Seventy-four out of the ninety-two counties decided that â€¢ople and not the breweries should rule. Then by vhat right can you refuse to enact a county option Lei us hope that you will not. ic primary election law in theory and pri; In practice it is a vast improvement over the )ld convention system. The Nebi rimary law, was tinkered with by the politi ustly lan it was after it bore their finger marks. In ! ne particular at least this law should bo put back where Xo party should be permitted to help o- nominate another party's candidates. Our present pri- mary law may have to be overhauled, but with all its faults it has had virtue enough to kill the political boss and smash the cog wheel of corrupt machine politics. With - out doubt this law is here to stay. In the case of large cities the great problem is to let he people, and not a corrupt gang, run its government. As matters now stand very often a majority is turned, by dishonest manipulation, into a minority. City officials are too often the employes and sympathizing friends of breweries and brothels and other kindred spirit-. We suggest that this legislature enact a law giving cities of five thousand or more the right to adopt their own charters without going to the legislature for one. This makes it possible for cities like Omaha, Lincoln and other towns to adopt such a charter as the people want and no charter could be forced upon the people against the will of the </seg>
            <seg id="p009">60 majority. Under this system officials would become the employes of the people and thus would be brought about home rule in the truest and best sense. We suggest this without going into detail and hope it will receive the serious consideration of each member of this legislature. As matters now stand our present form of municipal government is unbusinesslike and works against true progress and checks the best side of city life because the best men of a great city rarely are in its employ. There are many other matters of importance that will or ought to come up for consideration in this session, but we shall reserve for some future time their discussion and if occasion requires shall from time to time present them in the form of a message to the senate and house. But on this occasion we cannot refrain from discussing a few more subjects of vital interest to the people of the state. EDUCATION INTERESTS t)ne of these is our state university and normal schools, ere is an important problem for solution in the matter of providing room for the constantly increasing attend - ance at our state university. There is but one thing to be considered and that is what is the best thing for the university. This is a cold blooded business matter and should only be decided after a careful and impartial investigation. In the long run no cost is too great in pushing this magnificent seat of learning to the front. The election laws of our state as they apply to large cities should be amended in some particulars and repealed in others. The statute providing for a voting machin â–  instead of preventing fraud is an apt instrument of it, and should be repealed. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">61 I Iltrlllotrl \ to &lt;X I lilt. J J' M ! 1 1 1 J^ J ) iclC f l^ tVlLll C di( IS, SuIU CdiUS telling the judge of election how the bearer should vote. The election judge would work the levers and when through tell the alleged American citizen he had voted and to get out and make room for another government builder or to speak accurately government wrecker. The registration laws are also sources of fraud as illustrated at the last primary election in Omaha. The city clerk would attach his seal and name to certify and hand out said certificates to agents who would go out on the streets, get his voter, fill in the blank places and have his trusties as witnesses. This is one method of preventing the majority from ruling. In a certain ward in this metropolitan city there were nearly three times as many votes cast as the census shows there were male inhabitants in said ward. In the matter of selecting juries in large cities the pres - ent statute is wholly ineffective and should be amended or repealed, and authority given whereby the district judge or judges could appoint a commissioner to select jurors and thus destroy the political and corrupt in - fluence in this regard of well known undesirable and dangerous citizens. THE INCOME TAX There is an issue now before the entire country con - cerning an amendment to the federal constitution pro - viding an income tax. And I urge upon you the im - portance of ratifying that amendment. I also respectfully urge you to pass a resolution asking our senators to support an amendment providing for the election of United States senators by popular vote. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">62 Kcall your attention to the fact that the anti-treat law - its present form is wholly inadequate and should be ended. IVe suggest an amendment imposing a fine upon the &gt;on keeper or bar tender who permits the treating to done as punishment for the first offense. And upon viction of a second offense of allowing treating then that case the license to be revoked. A procedure uld in this regard be also devised so that delays would impossible and appeals have a speedy hearing to the that the law may be effective. The saloon keeper he man who derives the profit from treating and he le should be responsible. Ehe state library is conceded to be one of the most [able in the country, yet we are caring for it as though ere so much junk. Ehe state house during the sessions of the legislature i: yded to the extent of seriously interfering witl ness. As has already been observed we should provide for a new fire proof library room and also a place for the supreme court. This could be done by going on with the building to be used by the state historical society. IVith these observations necessarily brief and incom - te, let me urge upon this law making body the impor - ice of acting patriotically and fairly. Your responsi - ty is indeed great, and we should remember that laws the index of civilization. A state thus classifies itself the laws it adopts, and by the lax or rigid way it orces those laws. Good laws and their enforcement the safeguard of the home, and of every legitimate iiness; they are the only sure promise of safe and </seg>
            <seg id="p012">63 it is the duty of the law abiding to use every means within their power to reduce the number of the lawless to a minimum. A most solemn obligation then rests upon every loyal citizen of the state, to demand just and impartial laws; to stand like a Gibraltar for their en - forcement; and to encourage those officials who are specifically entrusted with enforcing them. Nebraska is a progressive state. The people have placed it in that column and they will never recall that verdict. The people want a progressive and business - like administration. They want the official ads of every ublic servant to be open to inspection. They want no They want every legitimate enterprise to be en- They want the business of every state in- Â»U! stitution to be skillfully administered. They want a just and equitable taxation. They do not want the people's money wasted in unnecessary expenditure. This body will be called upon for largely increased appropri - ations. Every item and request should be scrutinized with the closest care. I recommend that we be generous without being extravagant, and that we be economical without being parsimonious. The business of the state should be conducted on the most approved business principles, and all appropriations should be made with this in mind. Signed) Chester H. Aldrich. </seg>
