In 1921, near the peak ;of the- movement, 465 farmer-owned grain elevators were reported in Nebraska. 2 The number decreased to 363 in 1930 and the number now operating is undoubtedly smaller than the 1930 figure. The map in Figure 1 shows the distribution of the farmer-owned elevators in the state in 1930. ¦ \\ V The experiences o£ three decades have been the basis for the develop - ment of sound practices for elevator operation. Because of geographic handicaps many local elevators do not have full opportunity to draw on and profit from the experiences of other elevators. . Each year, for one reason or another, a few farmers' elevators become insolvent and cease operating. Most frequently the cause is unsound busi - ness practices/Loss of trade area to stronger competitors, shifting of the type of agricultural production, and general business conditions have played some part in the failure of farmers' as well as other kinds of elevators. Fire or explosion may have destroyed a building that has not been replaced. A knowledge of what contributes to failure is helpful in avoiding failure. Likewise, a knowledge of the factors contributing to success may provide the basis for successful operation. , | SOURCES OF DATA . -•. This study is based primarily on information obtained from annual audit reports of Nebraska farmers' elevators since "1922. These audit statements were. obtained from the office files of the'Farmers' Elevator Association of Nebraska, which maintains an audit service for cooperative organizations. The number of individual reports available in leach year varied. The reports in all cases were not complete in all respects.. Because of this the number of elevators used in constructing different tables may not be the same Expense reports'were more complete than income reports. The number of audits used varied from 54 to 107 per year. About 20 per cent of the farmers' elevators of the state are represented by the data obtained from the audit reports. Some variation existed among the elevators in the periods covered by the audits. For more than half of them, the fiscal year corresponded with the calendar year. The records were grouped according to the calendar year, in which the end of their fiscal year fell. Thus all records showing a fiscal year ending in 1931 were classed as 1931 records. Since more than two-thirds 1 The author U indebted" to I. W. ShorthiU, former secretary, and Frank B.

         <seg id="p004">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 314 of the records have a closing date in November or December, the dis - crepancy because of variations in fiscal year is not serious. The distribution of the elevators studied over the state corresponds quite closely with the distribution of all farmers' elevators, the largest num - ber being in the southern and southeastern parts of the state. On the whole, the elevators studied may not be quite representative o£ all in the state. The fact that they employed an outside audit service suggests in itself that they were among the more progressive of the elevators. SCOPE OF STUDY This study was confined to farmer-owned elevators. The large majority of them were organized under the cooperative laws of Nebraska. A few, organized prior to 1911 when the first cooperative law was passed in the state, do business under the corporate form of organization but the stock is held by farmers; hence, they are farmer-owned, even though not strictly cooperative. The organization of the elevators was not investigated. Although independent, line, and mill-owned elevators were not represented in the data, much of the discussion of operating problems which follows is applicable to them as well as to farmers' elevators. Studies similar to this one in many respects have been made by the federal Department of Agriculture and in several other middlewestern states. The results should be helpful to those charged with the manage - ment of Nebraska elevators as they reflect conditions in Nebraska. FINANCIAL PROGRESS OF NEBRASKA FARMERS' ELEVATORS SINCE 1922 There have been two sharp declines in the prices of farm products since January, 1920. The first began in May, 1920, and the second in October, 1929. The latter was more severe and the effects of. it are still with us. In view of the severe financial strain on all types of businesses during these depressions farmers' elevators have made a reasonably good showing. On the whole, the group of elevators studied appeared to be in lietter shape financially in 1931 than in 1922. Evidence of this progress is indicated by a comparison of certain financial items at the beginning and close of the period and by operating results obtained during the period. Table 1 gives these data. There was a return above expenses for the group of elevators as a whole every year from 1922 to 1935, which would indicate an economical organization of the farmers' elevators in view of extremely low prices during certain parts of the period. There was a greater fluctuation in the income than in the expenses, which suggests that these associations must look toward an increase in income instead of a reduction in expenses if they are to increase their net returns. The elevators that made a net return in years of low prices made a fairly good return for the period as a whole, thus indicating an effective organization. No material change occurred in the amount of capital stock out - standing between the earlier years of the study and the later years. There </seg>

Despite the depressed conditions after 1929, the average surplus account did not decrease nearly as much as it did following the 1920 downturn in farm prices. Surpluses were reported by 76 per cent of the elevators in 1920 as compared with 82 per cent in 1929. In 1931 there ¦.still remained 73 per cent of the elevators with surplus accounts.

         <seg id="p006">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 314. by variation in expenses. For example, the data in Table 1 show that the low net income in 1932 was the result of a decrease in income of 52 per cent from the high net income year in 1928, while the reduction in expenses was but 25 per cent. The increase in income from the low net income year previous to 1928 to the high net income year of 1928 was 55 per cent, while the increase in expenses was but 9 per cent. As there was but little variation in the capital stock during the period, the net income per $100 of capital stock varied with the income. CAPITAL STRUCTURE The capital structure of the farmers' elevator gives some indication of its ability to withstand adversity and survive through the years. Informa - tion regarding the capital structure is provided by items appearing in the balance sheet of the usual audit report. Certain ratios and percentages provide more definite measures of the soundness of the capital structure than do the actual balance sheet items taken alone. To determine whether an elevator is sufficiently capitalized, the amount of capital must be considered in relation to the need for it. There is the need for fixed capital, the investment in the elevator. Over and above that is the need for operating capital to provide the organization with funds for business operations. Too much dependence on borrowed capital is risky. On the other hand, providing share capital sufficient for any possible need of the concern that may arise is usually wasteful. The grain business is seasonal. An organization with sufficient capital to make borrowing unnecessary at the season of greatest grain movement will have part of its capital idle for part of the year. The ratio between the net worth and the fixed assets is a measure indicating whether the elevator is sufficiently capitalized or not. A safe ratio of net worth to fixed assets is 1.5 to one. The lowest ratio for the period 1922 to 1935 was 1.3 in 1922 and the highest was 1.7 in 1924, 1928, and 1()29. This ratio was approximately the same in the latter part of the period as in the earlier part and offers evidence of soundness in the capital structure of Nebraska farmers' elevators in view of the low prices for grain in the fatter part of the period, [n 1931, only 13 per cent of the elevators reporting had net worths insufficient to cover the value of fixed assets as compared with 38 per cent in 1922. The ratios given in Table 2 indicate the safety of the capital structure of farmers' elevators during the period. Another measure ot sufficiency of capital is the ratio of sales to fixed assets. Past experience has shown that there should be SB.OO or more of sales for each $1.00 tied up in fixed assets to carry the overhead of the association. Table 2 gives these ratios for the period, 1922 to 1935. The ratio of fixed assets minus reserve for depreciation to sales fluctuated largely according to the price of grain received by farmers. </seg>

         <seg id="p008">Nebraska Acriclltiral Experiment Station Bulletin 314 8 of these years is below the standard of 1.5, which is considered to be safe (Table 3). The effect of low prices for grain on capital structure is indicated by the data for the year 1932. The ratio of sales to fixed assets is much above the standard recom - mended in 1928, a year of high grain prices and considerably below what it should be in 1932, a year of low grain prices. A standard ratio of 8 is recommended. It has been found that with $8.00 worth of sales for each dollar tied up in the business, an association can carry its overhead, pro - sided the elevator has fair margins in its grain transactions. The prices received for grain are very influential in the determination of this ratio. The average number of bushels of grain handled per elevator in 1928 was 210,071, and in 1932 it was 116,961. It is necessary to consider various items in the balance sheet to deter - mine the adequacy of the working capital. When large inventories arc carried or a credit business is done, more working capital is needed. The proportion of the current assets that is in the form of receivables gives a Table 4.— Ratios with rejerence to wording capital of farmers' elevators, 1922 to 1935.

With low incomes in that year farmers were compelled to use more credit, which accounted for lhe high ratio. </seg>
         <seg id="p009">Operating Problems of Farmers' Elevators 9 The solvency of an elevator is indicated by its ability to pay current obligations as they come due: The ratio of current assets to current liabil - ities is usually considered to: be a fair measure of debt-paying ability. A safe standard of this ratio is 2'to 1; that is, the current assets should amount to twice as much as the current liabilities. This ratio was distinctly higher in the later years than in the:earlier years of the 14-year period (Table 4). It increased continuously with the exception of the two years, 1925 and 1926, and averaged 2.5 for!the period. After 1926 the ratio indicated solvency of the elevators. 1 The ability of an elevator to pay its liabilities in reasonable time is indicated by the ratio of cash and accounts receivable to current liabilities. There should be sufficient cash on hand and in the bank to take care of the pressing current liabilities, and sufficient receivables to meet the less urgent liabilities. A ratio of 1 to 1 is recommended between these two factors. A ratio of less thanjl means that the liabilities cannot be readily liquidated. Table 3 gives the three ratios mentioned above and they indicate the sufficiency of the working capital for the elevators included in this study. ¦¦¦' • '••¦' I • .'¦:¦'"¦ ' ¦ ¦•.'' ¦•. . ...

Only for the elevators that handled less than 100,000 bushels in 1932 was this ratio higher than that; recommended.

The ratio of current assets to current liabilities averaged higher in the years of low than in those !of high prices. The unusually high ratio for the group of elevators handling 200,000 to 299,000 in 1932 was due to an unusually small amount of current liabilities for this group of ele - vators, the liabilities amounting to only $823 per elevator as compared to </seg>
         <seg id="p010">Nebraska Agriccltural Experiment Station Bulletin 314 52,842 for all elevators. This ratio was below the standard for the ele - vators below 100,000 bushels in 1928. For safety the current assets should be equal to twice as much as the current liabilities. The ratio of cash and receivables to current liabilities for all elevators in each of the two years was well above the standard recommended. It was below the standard in 1928 for the group of elevators handling less than 100,000 bushels and in 1932 for the group handling over 300,000 bushels. In general it would appear that the volume of grain handled by an elevator was a more important factor in securing safe ratios in the work - ing capital structure than the prices received for grain. TRADE AREA AND COMPETITION When country elevators were first built their trade area was limited to that served by horses and wagons. The area served by the elevators extended along the railroad rights of way a shorter distance than it did into the territory in other directions where there were fewer elevators to offer competition. The change from horse to motor-truck transportation not only enlarged the trade area of the stronger elevators but was responsible in part for less grain in a territory passing through the local elevators. The longer haul made possible with motor-truck transportation enabled farmers to deliver at markets farther from home, thereby diverting some grain from the local elevator to seemingly better markets farther away. There were 1,168 elevators in Nebraska in 1930. There were 346 line elevators with .in average capacity of 26,900 bushels, 363 farmers' ele - vators with an average capacity of 21,900 bushels, and 459 independent elevators with an average capacity of 18,700 bushels. Thirty-one per cent of the elevators in the state in 1930 were farmers' elevators, and 31 per cent of the elevator capacity of the state was in farmers' elevators. The proportion of farmers' elevators in the various counties having' ele - vators ranged from none in ten counties to 60 per cent or more in five counties. The average capacity of farmers' elevators at railroad stations, where their number predominated, was considerably less than that of line or independent elevators at the same stations. There were 116 mills in the state reporting an average storage capacity of 22,600 bushels. The 1,168 elevators were located at 653 stations, thus averaging 1.8 elevators per station. There were 253 stations that had one elevator, 303 stations with two, 79 stations with three, 17 stations with four, and one with five. Table 6 gives the distribution of elevators according to size of station and type of organization. The independent elevators were more common than either of the other two kinds. For example, out of the 253 one-elevator stations, 112 had only the independent elevator. Out of the 303 two-elevator stations, 54 had only independent elevators. Out of the 79 three-elevator stations', 34 had two or more independent elevators. Out of the 17 four-elevator </seg>
         <seg id="p011">Operating Problems of Farmers' Elevators stations, 11 had two or more independent elevators. Except for the one - elevator stations the farmers' elevators were less common than the line or independent elevators, j ¦ &gt;.-.. Fanners' elevators did a larger proportion of the elevator business in the small towns than in the; larger ones. Less than 10 per cent of the ele - vators in towns having four elevators were farmer-owned, while in the one-elevator towns 32 per cent were farmer-owned.

The remaining 37 per cent, or 211 stations, which were two-elevatori stations, had more than one kind of elevator. The acreage of grain in a locality is a fair indication of the volume of business available for elevators. The acreage per elevator varied from 6,100 acres in Scotts Bluff county to 80,000 in Hayes county. It should be recognized that such figures are limited to county boundaries and do not necessarily represent the true trade area of an elevator, because the trade area of an elevator located near the boundary of a county will extend into an adjoining county. . _ ¦;¦ In-general*the grain acreage per elevator is smallest in the southeastern part of the state, where the grain acreage per elevator varies from ap - proximately 7,000 to 11,000 acres. The comparatively large acreage per elevator in some of the counties in the northeastern part of the state is due to an unusually small number of elevators in those counties instead of an unusually large acreage of grain. The large acreage of grain per elevator in the southwestern part of the state is the result of a larger percentage of the crop land : devoted to the production of grain than is true in the eastern part of the state. Figure; 2 shows the acreage of grain per elevator by counties for 1930. ; - ¦ : ' ; Because of a larger percentage of the land in grain crops devoted to the production of corn in the eastern part of the state, the amount of grain sold per elevator was less than in the-western part.

A capacity turnover of 10 has been established as a generally satis - factory goal for elevators to attain. This means handling 10 times as much grain in a year as the capacity of the elevator.

In the northern part of the state it was 1.7, in the panhandle 17.8, and in the sand-hill area 14.3. These data indicate that in a large part of the eastern and southern parts of the state there is more elevator capacity available than is needed to handle the production over a period of years. This overcapacity is the result o( competition among buying agencies and results in an overhead larger than is necessary to handle the marketable grain in most localities. The low turnover is partially the cause of an increase in the quantity of sidelines handled by elevators. Figure 3 shows the estimated elevator capacity turnover for 1930. In years of low grain production the turnover would be less and in years of high grain production more. From these data it appears there is more elevator capacity in most parts of the state than is needed to handle the grain. The proportions ol rive grain crops produced in Nebraska are given in Table 7. The proportions of the different kinds of grain handled by farmers' elevators are given in Table 8. Although the proportion of the total grain production represented by corn decreased in the latter part of the period 1922 to 1935, the proportion of grain marketed as rep - resented by corn showed little change. Except for the years 1933 and 1934 there was a slight tendency for corn to become less important in the grain marketing of these elevators. Undoubtedly the government programs in buying livestock and the higher price of corn had considerable influence on the corn marketings these two years. </seg>

         <seg id="p015">Operating Problems of Farmers' Elevators The income from the sale of grain reached the peak in 1928 when the average sales per elevator amounted to $192,951. From 1928 to 1932 there was a continuous decline in the amount of sales from grain and a continuous increase'from 1932 to 1935. There was some indication, parti - cularly for the years 1929 and 1930, that the relative importance o£ the grain business was declining. This contention is supported by the number of bushels of grain handled, which will be presented in a later table. The income from other sales was from a rather wide variety of side - lines. The income from such sources reached a peak in 1929 and declined continuously through 1933. There was an increase in 1934 and again in 1935.

EXPENSES The elevator expenses in this study have been grouped into fixed and operating expenses. The supposition is that the fixed expenses are those that remain more or less constant, varying chiefly according to changing rates. Operating expenses are those that vary according to the amount of. business done and the variation is due largely to change in physical quanti - ties used. The amount of these expenses per elevator is listed in Table 15. Table 15. — Amount of fixed and operating expenses per elevator from 1922 to 1955.

Be - cause of the particular trends in the expenses, fixed expenses became rela - tively less important and operating expenses more important in the latter part oif the period. FIXED EXPENSES The fixed expenses include interest, insurance, taxes, rent, and depreci - ation. Where insurance is on grain in storage it may be classed as an oper - ating expense, but because of the inability to separate the insurance into the various items all insurance has been treated as fixed expense. Table 17 gives the amount of fixed expenses per elevator for the period 1922 to 1935. ."¦¦.' i .¦;.-., i Interest.—lnterest as used here means the payment for the use of borrowed money. It constituted 7.18 per cent'of all the elevator cost for the period covered in the study. It was approximately one-fourth of the fixed expenses and amounted to $379 per elevator. It included both the interest on the mortgage and the money borrowed in financing the market - ing of the grain. It varied with the method of financing and the interest rates charged. The reduction-in the amount of interest paid in the latter part of the period was due primarily to a reduction in interest rates. Insurance.—lnsurance included both the [insurance on the building and on the grain while in storage. Variation in insurance cost is due to kind of policies, kind of risks covered, and the kind of grain covered. It averaged $254 per elevator arid constituted 4.81 per cent of the total expenses.

Taxes lor the period studied averaged 8298 per elevator and constituted 5.64 per' cent of the total expenses. There was not much variation in the taxes, the most noticeable change being a slow decline after 1928. Rent.—Rent was the smallest of the fixed-expense items. It included the lease of the site and additional space required by the elevator It was la.rly un.form during the period and averaged $39 per elevator or less than one per cent of the total cost. Depreciation.—Depreciation is a charge against the building and equipment and amounted to about 4 per cent of their value. It was the largest .tern of fixed expenses and amounted to $551 per elevator for the period. It constituted 10.45 per cent of the total cost. One reason for the variation in this item during the period was the change in the number and identity of the elevators each year. r\BLE 17. —Fixed expenses per elevator for the period 1922 to 1935.

Fic. s—Distrihutioti o£ cost pet bushel of all grain handled by farmers' elevators in Nebraska, according to volume, 1932. Costs of operation vary widely among elevators in the same year and in the same area. There are several reasonslfor this wide variation but the two most important ones are the amount of business done and the efficiency of labor. The relationship of volume of grain handled to cost of handling per bushel for: the years 1928 and 1932, years of high and low prices respectively, is shown in Figures 4 and 5. •• Three elevators in Figure 4 are decidedly out of line with the trend in the costs of the other elevators. One had a total cost of 4.0 cents per bushel, one 4.7 cents, and one 63 cents with operating costs of 3.2, 3.0, and 4.5 cents, respectively, i The first elevator handled 325,374 bushels of grain, the second 405,163 bushels, and the third 398,231 bushels, each of which is considered a good volume for a country elevator. Their wage cost was 2.2, 2.2, and 2.8 cents per bushel, respectively, as compared to 1.4 cents for all elevators handling over 300,000 bushels of grain and 1.5 cents for all elevators studied in 1928. Another elevator handling 253,705 bushels had a total cost of 9.0 cents per bushel with an operating cost of </seg>
         <seg id="p024">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 31.4 6.9 cents, of which 5.8 cents was labor. Inasmuch as most of the differ - ence in operating costs can be traced to wages, either in the form of too much labor hired or too high a rate paid for labor, it would appear that the regulation of the labor cost rests largely in the hands of the manage - ment. Table 21 gives the cost per bushel of handling grain for 1928 and 1932 for important items. Table 21.— Cost oj handling grain per bushel jor the years 1928 and 1932.

The cost of handling grain in 1932 was seven-tenths of a cent per bushel higher than in 1928. This was an increase of 27 per cent. The volume of grain handled per elevator in 1932 averaged 93,111 bushels less than in 1928, a decrease of 44 per cent. The increased cost per bushel in the latter year was the result of a decrease in the volume of grain handled. In many cases the wage rate was lower in 1932 than in 1928, so the increased cost is a result of a change in the volume of grain handled. The costs per bushel were higher in 1932 than in 1928 for elevators of different size as indicated in Table 22.

         <seg id="p025">Operating Problems of Farmers'Elevators In. 1932, the elevator cost per bushel decreased as the volume of grain handled increased. In-1928 the cost for all groups, except the smallest - volume group, was the same. The average for all elevators in 1928 was seven-tenths of a cent lower than for all elevators in 1932, although the largest-volume and the smallest-volume elevator groups had a- lower cost in 1932 than in 1928. All groups handled a smaller quantity of grain in 1932 than in 1928 and the tendency toward increased costs, because of the smaller volume, was partially offset by a decrease in both fixed and operating expenses. i- ..; .'-.¦;...'.' Apparently the elevator managers saw the need for reducing expenses during the period of low grain prices'because the financial condition of. the elevators as shown in Table 1 indicated this need. Labor effectiveness in elevator operation may be measured by wage cost per dollar of sales. Low wage (costs per dollar of sales indicate the effective use of labor and high wage costs per dollar of sales the ineffective - ness of labor. Table 23 gives the cost per dollar of sales according to volume of grain handled in 1928 and 1932. : Table 23.— Income per dollar of wages according to volume of sales in 1928 and 1932. r Saks per dollar ; Sales per dollar Size groups ¦ of wages, 1928 of wages, 1932 All . 1 Grain All I Grain : sales' I sales sales I sales Under $100,000 ......... $51.83 5«.05 : $18.58 $15.03 5100,000 to $199,000 ..... 77.94 71.39 • 38.37 31:39 $200,000 to 5299,000 ..... 92.04 84.22 $300,000 and over ........ 85.74 70.5-) .... Average $72.59 $70.98 $20.29 $16.58 In 1928 the effectiveness of labor, as measured by income per dollar spent for wages, increased with the increase in sales except for the group having sales of $300,000 and over. Inasmuch as there were 14 elevators in this group, there is some indication of an optimum volume of sales from the standpoint of labor effectiveness and this would be between 5200,000 and $300,000 of sales. The average amount of sales for this group was $245,607. In 1932 there were jno elevators with sales of {200,000 or more, due in part to a smaller quantity of grain handled than in 1928 and in part to the lower grain prices. In general there was a tendency for the sales per dollar of wages to increase as the proportion of grain sales to total sales increased. The only exception to this was for the group in 1928 having 71 to 80 per cent of their 'total sales from grain. (See Table 24.). As there were but two elevators in this group, it is not representative of general conditions. 1n1928, a year of high grain prices, the wage cost per dollar of sales averaged 138 cents and there was a general :decline as the importance of grain sales increased, except for the second, group as mentioned above. </seg>

The standard suggested for this cost is two cents per dollar of sales. In other words, an elevator with 5100,000 sales should not spend over $2,000 for wages and one with $300, - -000 sales over $6,000. The cost of wages per dollar of sales increases as the proportion of income from the sale of sidelines increases. It costs more to sell sidelines, which make up a comparatively small proportion of the entire business and which are sold in small units, than it does to sell grain, which is sold in carload Jots. This fact should be recognized in considering an expansion of sidelines in the elevator business. A reasonably safe guide to follow in deciding whether or not to hire labor would be to consider whether the sales would be fifty times the labor cost if a high degree of labor effectiveness is desired. The relatively higher cost of wages per dollar of sales in 1932 as com - pared to 1928 was caused by wage costs not falling as rapidly as income from sales. Grain prices in the United States decreased 66 per cent from 1928 to 1952, while the total wage cost per elevator for the elevators included in this study decreased but 20 per cent. PROBLEMS CONFRONTING COUNTRY ELEVATORS Undoubtedly the most important problem confronting country elevators is that of increasing their volume of business. Elevators were built primarily for the purpose of handling small grain, chiefly wheat. At the time of their construction transportation facilities were such that all grain shipped out of a locality passed through local elevators. Under those circumstances the size and number of the elevators were more nearly adjusted to the local production of grain that was to pass through these elevators than at present. The conditions today are quite different. There has been a shift in the grain production since most of. the eleva - tors were constructed. Wheat has become less important, from the stand - point of bushels produced, and corn more important, while the importance of oats and barley has not changed much. (See Table 7.) With die increase </seg>

With the development of better roads and; motor transportation came the possibility of a wider choice of markets by farmers, which resulted in longer hauls, particularly where the more distant market appeared to offer more favorable prices than the local market; This has been especially noticeable in some areas where certain strong elevators have attracted grain , from sections in which grain was formerly marketed through local eleva- ' tors. "' -' :;.: .-.'¦' There was a decrease in the volume of grain handled per elevator in the latter part of the period 1922 to 1935, from that handled in the first half of the period. Volume fell from 171,000 bushels to 154,000.

Because of the competi - tion in sidelines offered by other elevators and retail dealers, together with the reduced income of farmers, there was notj much possibility of increas - ing income by sideline sales. As a result, the curtailment of expenses was the method used by these elevators in maintaining their solvency. A larger proportion of the elevators were handling under 200,000 bushels in 1932 and 1935 than in, predepression years as represented by 1924 and 1928. This is indicated by data presented in Table 25. This trend appears to have occurred irrespective of the production of the five principal grains produced in Nebraska. The total production for these grains for the years 1924, 1928, and 1932 was above the average for the period 1922 to 1935 and below in 1935. j . Another problem with which these elevators have had to cope is the extension of credit. This problem is always acute in depression times, as </seg>
         <seg id="p028">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 314 it is difficult for most organizations to curtail credit extension to customers in poor times when they have had a rather liberal credit policy during good times. The amount of bad debts indicates the write-off these elevators have had to make and is the amount that is considered uncollectable. The notes and accounts receivable indicate the credit extension to.the elevator customers in the purchase of sidelines and some grain. Table 26 gives the percentage that notes and accounts receivable were of the side - line sales and the percentage bad debts were of the total expense for the period 1922 to 1935.

The proportion of sideline income represented by the notes and accounts receivable increased almost continuously from 1926 to 1933, indicating a more liberal policy in the extension o£ credit. During the first half of the period it averaged 9.9 per cent and the second half 26.7 per cent. On the other hand considerable discretion was used in the extension of credit^ because the percentage that bad debts were of the notes and accounts receivable was slightly less during the second half of the period than the first half, averaging 2.3 and 2.5 per cent, respectively. The increase in the amount of credit extended per elevator in the second half of the period over the first half was 11 per cent, while the increase in bad debts was but 3 per cent. The proportion that bad debts were of the total expense was larger in the second half of the period than the first half by 11 per cent. This indicates an effective curtailment of other expenses inasmuch as the in - crease in the amount of bad debts per elevator was but 3 per cent. </seg>
         <seg id="p029">Operating Problems of Farmers' Elevators The question of management is always important in the operation of any business. Effective management is required to guide a business to economic success even in the best of times and farmers' elevators are not an exception in spite of the fact that they have weathered the period of adversity in a reasonably satisfactory manner. The board of directors of a cooperative elevator is charged with the duty of formulating a policy and is responsible to the association members for its operation. A manager is hired to carry out these policies and may have little to say in the determina - tion of a policy. If the elevator makes a good return, the success is usually attributed to a good manager-and if the return is poor to a poor manager. In either case, the policy is determined by the board of directors.: A good manager is in position, however, topffer valuable suggestions to the board of directors and should be encouraged to do so. With the'many prob - lems that elevators are facing today, a good manager is a decided asset to an organization even though the salary may seem high, and with the proper training and background can do a variety of jobs which, in the long run, will prove beneficial. , . ¦¦¦¦ / ¦:."¦¦.¦¦¦¦;¦¦."¦ i•¦¦.¦ "¦ - ¦ ¦,;¦",•¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦.. : ¦ </seg>
