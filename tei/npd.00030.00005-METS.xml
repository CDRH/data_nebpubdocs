The hogs which an- shipped from sections where n cholera exists require a larger amount of serum for protect io than those jrrown in cholera-infected Ngkta*. Third In the "simultaneous method" of treatment, the .ondi lion of the virus used with the serum may not always Ite normal, and this abnormal virus may produce unfavorable results, even when the serum is of proper quality.

COOPERATIVE EXPERIMENTS Tli&lt;- Station is cooperating with a number of farmers in tesi ing the selected strains of Turkey Red wheat developed at thi Station. Twenty one farmers raise&lt;l these improved strains o wheat in 1910 1911. and twenty one additional farmers nre co operating in 1911-1912. The average yield jmt acre secured h the twenty one farmers last year was a little more than fon Imshels in excess of the yield from their own seed sown upon th name field. Eight acres of the improved strain in each case wa mi as i part of a larger field. The increase in yield was show mainly u|«»ii those fields which produced normal or more tha pdi-mal yields from local seed. Tn some instances where a \ ields wen- poor, the yield from the selected seed did not eqiin the vield from the local seed. The Station is cooperating with a number of farmers in Polk i n— tj, known as the 1'olk County Corn Club, to work out a ina.ti«al system for the selection of improved seed corn which ra Im' used b\ any intelligent farmer. At the present time fourteen men in one neighborhood are cooperating. The two methiMls in use are: First.

In case one of the pair of cylinders should be broken md another of different internal diameter should have to be sub stituted. it becomes necessarv to employ ■ measuring stick and to record the height of the column of solution.

This will permit in the end the use of many different standards — as many as there are soils of which the humus has been determined gravimetrically, as well as photometrically. Provided that the same weight of soil has been used and that he humus extracts have been made up to the same volume, the lercent acres of humus will be inversely proportional to the leights of the columns of extract required to hide the candle flame.

In the an of th ptnrfaep soil of prairiea there is no such action tending to prodxu uniformity. Slijrln difference* in texture lend to prodm marked differeBcea in the chemical coiiijM&gt;sitinn.

In ippijtag this method to tUktmkm soils, following the d failed directions of Washington we have found that we con not ohiain concordant results luplicate determinations, tl filiation Maua duplicates being sometimes as much as K per -ent. Krintou" has already noted that in some iron ores tl ireatinein with sulphni-ic and hydrofluoric acids does not gi\ '•ompleie extraction of the manganese, and we have found th; i his is the case with all of the noils which we have investigate* In most of these soils, three, and in some canes four, extract ioi with hwlrotluoric and sulphuric acids were necessary before a or the manganese was obtained in solution. Inasmuch a* ea. extraction requires nearly three hours, it will Ik- seen that t accurately determine manganese in soils by this method is \cr\ tedious operation. We have, therefore, endeavored to d i inethiMl which is much more rapid, more accurate, an which requires less attention, and eliminates all fumes of hvdrt lluoric kM or sulphur trioxide. The smaller amount of platinui required in the priK-ew is also a decided advantage \&gt; an oxidizer we have used sodium hismuthatc instead &lt; imnioiiiuui |KMsulphate. inasmuch as it girca a iM-tter oxidation alwa\s giving the true permanganate color, while the persulphat oxidation often produces a reddish tint that is difficult to rea accurately. Ulair and Brintou" seemed to recognize the si |M-riority of the -liismiithate' oxidation by stating that "for sail pies containing not over 2 ft cent of manganese the bisinuthat ! i he most adulate method known." Walters 4 states that th persulphate oxidation does not always progress smoothly, fo when the salt is dry "the reaction is very incomplete and irregu lar and not to lie depended on," a fact that is not mentioned i the description of the method by Hillebrand or Washington K </seg>

The summer tilled fields contain more water at all depths during Juue. -luly. and August for the years IMt, 1910, and Wl ihan MMM producing wheat, oats, or alfalfa. t. The moisture content is a 1st) comparatively uniform in the upper six feet and thruout the growing season. The moisture data shown in the columns under June am •luly in the corn table are similar to the amounts in the summer tilled fields, largely because the corn does not begin to use exees - sive quantities of water until luly. It may lie well to remind the reader again that the moisture contents here shown were laiued at the beginning of the various mouths and conse - quently the percentages of moisture in the July column represen the conditions for the latter part of June and the early part o I uly 4. The small grain crops contain the least percentages of mois - ture in the upper four feet in June, July, and August for the under consideration. B. The alfalfa and brome grass fields contain a lower per cent &lt;&gt;f moisture in the fifth and sixth feet than any of the other fields represented in the tables. They contain a trifle more water in the upper three feet than the small grain fields. i&gt;. The moisture content of the small grain fields increases with the depth in the MMjef six fe&lt;-t. while the moisture content of the alfalfa fields decreases with depth from the second foot. </seg>

For the de - termination of ilic organic carbon three different methods have lieeu employed, viz., i 1 | ignition of the soil, mixed with copper oxide, in a current of oxygen, {-) the oxidation of the soil with chromic acid solution, and (3) the combustion of the soil with -.odium peroxide. The lirst method, which has been the basis of i lie remarkable development of organic chemistry during the • •iglm years, is one permitting of great accuracy but is wry time-consuming. The amount of time it requires is the ob - jection that has prevented its universal use and which has &lt;aused the easier and more expeditious chromic acid method to ba MM generally employed. The latter, however, as it has been used, fhm loo low results on account of the incomplete oxida tiou of the organic matter.
