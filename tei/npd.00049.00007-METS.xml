            <seg id="p003">Spring Grains in Western Nebraska Dates of Seeding and Com - parative Yields This bulletin reports the results of experiments conducted at the University of Nebraska North I'latte Experimental Substation to ascertain the effects of seeding grains at different dates and to determine the relative yield of Bpring grain. The crops used were wheat, oats, barley, and emmer. The last is frequently but improperly called spelts. Kubanka durum wheat was used in all years except 1!)1S, 1914. and 1915, in which years the Marquis variety was grown- Kherson oats were used during the entire period. Common six - row barley was grown in all years except 1917 and 1918. when Smyrna was substituted. The emmer used was ordinary white spring. Intervals between seedings averaged twelve days. The aver - age dates of seeding were March 2."), April ti, April IS and April 'SO. A period of ten consecutive years from 1909 to 1918. inclu - sive, is covered. In this time, nine crops were harvested. Owing to the extreme drouth, no spring sown grain was harvested in 1911. Results from the first four years of this work were published in Bulletin 135. The crops have been grown each year on the bench land at the Substation on disked corn stubble and the seeding done with a press drill. Seedings were at the standard rates in use on the Substation, i. e., 4 peeks per acre for wheat, ti pecks for oats and barley, and 5 or 6 peeks for emmer. The plats were one-half acre in area, having dimensions of 2 rods by 40 rods. CLIMATIC CONDITIONS The average precipitation for the ten-year period was 18.77 inches, or .09 inch less than the 44-year average as reported by the North Platte Weather Bureau Station.

From this it may be noted that the precipitation exceeded the -44-year average in but two years, while in eight years the precipitation was below the average. The extremes are represented by the years 1910 and 1915, the precipitation of these two years being 11.18 and 34.85 inches respectively. These are also the extremes for the 44-year period, during which a record has been kept at North Platte. Chart II shows the precipitation by months for each year as recorded at the Experimental Substation gauge. The average monthly precipitation for the past 44 years as reported by the North Platte Weather Station is also shown. A careful study of this chart in connection with the crop yields shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3 indicates that the distribution of the rainfall and the moisture condition of the soil at the beginning of the year are sometimes of greater importance than the amount of the annual rainfall in determining crop yields. DATES OF SEEDING The plan followed in the dates-of-seeding test was to seed each of the four crops on four dates each year. The first seeding was made as early as it was possible to get the work done in the spring. The successive seedings were then made at intervals of 12 days, more or less. As the time at which field work can be begun in the spring varies greatly from year to year, no attempt was made to have the first seeding made on a given date. The intervals between seedings are not all of the same length, either in the same or in different years. Chart III shows the dates of seeding for all years except 1911, in which year no crop was har - vested. In 1912 and 1915 but three seedings were made. For these years the first seeding is designated as both first and second and the yields are thus made to do double duty in Tables 2 and 3. The average dates of first, second, third, and fourth seeding were March 25, April 6, April 18, and April 30. respectively. The dates of first seeding in the different years varied from March 12 to April 14. Allowing for differences in seasons, each one of these dates may be considered as early. In most cases they are earlier than the first seedings made in the locality. </seg>

            <seg id="p007">Spring Grains in Western Nebraska 7 Probably 60 per cent of the small grain seeding of the local - ity is dene in the period between the second ami third dates of .seeding of this test. About 25 per cent is done before the second date and :i5 per tent later than the third date. Very little seed - ing is dene later than the fourth date. Table 1 presents the results with each crop for each seeding each year, the averages of the four dates of seeding each year, the axerages of each seeding for the entire period and the aver - age yield from all seedings of each crop for the entire period, in bushels per acre- Table II presents the same data as Table I, except that the yields are given in pounds instead of bushels per acre. In 1912 and 191 "&gt;. when but three seeding* of each group were made, the yield from the first seeding is used in the column for both first and second seedings. In 1910 the fourth seeding of barley and emmer was omitteJ. This is supplied by using the yield from the third seeding. In 1909 the second seeding of emmer was omitted. This is supplied by using the average of the first and third seed - ings. The differences in yields secured in different years are out - standing. A comparison of these differences with the precipita - tion records shown in Charts I and II afford interesting studies. The largest yields were secured in 190!), 1915, and 191ti. The first two of these are years of high precipitation, while the pre - cipitation of 1916 was the lowest with one exception of any year of the ten-year period. The explanation for its good yield is found in the fact that a good supply of moisture was stored in the subsoil from the excessive moisture of 1915 and that the June precipitation was above normal. That is, there was sufficient moisture stored from 1915 to give the crop a good start and the June rainfall came in time to complete the growth. The years 1911 and 1916 furnish interesting contrasts. The annual rainfall of the former is 1.44 inches greater than that of the latter, yet the crop of 1911 was a total failure and that of 1916 one of the best secured. It should be noted, however, that 1911 follows the year of lowest rainfall, while 1916 follows the year of highest rainfall of the perio-d. Also that the May and </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 172 June rainfall of 1911 was very low, while that of 1916 was but slightly below normal. In 1912 the May and June rainfall was only slightly greater than in 1911, yet a fair crop was secured. The 1912 crop was doubtless made on the moisture stored from the March and April rains and that carried thru from October, 1911. These studies furnish additional evidence of the truth of con - clusions made in Bulletin 135 that the distribution of seasonal rainfall may be of as much or more importance than the amount of precipitation, also that seasonal differences frequently exert a greater influence in determining crop yields than do cultural differences- While yields may be materially affected by varying the time of seeding any of the spring grain crops, these effects vary greatly in different seasons. The results of one season may be almost the reverse of those secured in another season. It is, therefore, possible to draw dependable conclusions only from tests extending over a number of years. The average yields from each seeding as shown in Tables 1 and 2 show an advantage for the earliest seeding of each crop. It is realized that these averages are subject to considerable error on account of the wide differences between yields of different years. While the relative difference between seedings of diff - erent dates may be greater in a year in which the yields arc light than those in a year in which the yields are heavier, yet the ab - solute difference might be greater in the year of heavy yield and it would thus have a greater weight in determining the average. In Table 3 the yields from each seeding are shown as per - centages of the total yield of each crop for each year. This method gives equal weight to the results of each year, but is also unsatisfactory in that small differences in yields in those years when the yields are light may make large differences when ex - pressed in percentages. Both methods, however, show the same trend in the differ - ences in yields between seedings. That is, the averages indicate an advantage for the earliest dates of seedings, and a less yield for each succeeding date for each crop. In most years the great - est drop in yield is between the third and fourth dates. This difference would be more apparent in the average were it not for the result of 1914, when the yields from early seedings were very </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Spring Grains in Western Nebraska 9 poor. The difference in yield does not measure the entire differ - ence between the seedings of different dates. Superior quality is closely related with high yield. The average quality of the earlier seedings was in all cases better from the early than from the later seedings. The quality of the grain from the last date of seeding was in nearly all cases very inferior. The influence of seeding at different dates is more marked with wheat and emmer than with oats and barley. While the advantages of early seeding are greater in some years than in others, there was a quite consistent advantage in all years except two. In 1909 the average yield of the first and second seeding was slightly more than that of the third and fourth seeding. There are several cases in which the yield from the second seeding was greater than that from the first and sev - eral cases in which the yield from the third seeding exceeded that from the second. The only case in which the last two seed - ings exceeded the first two by a significant amount was in 1914. This was true of all crops except barley. All seedings in 1914 were made earlier than usual. Temperatures were high for the season, but rainfall for March, April, and May was considerably below normal. Growth of the early seedings was not rapid enough to keep ahead of the weeds and by the time rains came in June most of the crop was too badly choked out to recover. The later seedings started more rapidly, kept ahead of the weeds, and were able as a result of the June rains to make fair crop3. The control of weed growth is one of the most important Factors in the successful culture of spring grain in the western part of the State. The most troublesome weed is the Russian thistle. It seems to require slightly higher temperatures for germination and rapid early growth than the grain crops, but makes it most rapid development in those hot, dry spells of weather when the grain crops are apt to be held back. Early seedings of spring grain are able in most seasons, if there is a fair supply of moisture, to cover the ground before the thistles become established. If this takes place, the thistles are not able to cause very much injury. In late seedings the grain and thistles are apt to start at about the same time and when this occurs the grain has very little chance of making a full crop, unless there is an unusual amount of cool, wet weather. It is also important in </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 172 controlling weed growth that seeding should be done immediately after the seed bed is prepared. Grain is at a great disadvantage if seeded upon land in which weeds have already sprouted. RELATIVE YIELDS OF SPRING GRAINS Any of the four spring grains discussed in this bulletin may be fed successfully to live stock. Henry and Morrison give the following total percentages of digestible nutrients for the differ - ent grains: Durum wheat, 78.8; oats, 70.4; barley, 79.4, and eramer, 76.5. From this it would seem that there is very little difference in the feeding value of wheat and barley. Under the conditions of the test, where the percentage of barley hulls to total weight is frequently above the average on account of poor filling, it is thought that wheat is somewhat the better feed. I'nder the dry conditions which frequently exist there at thresh - ing time, a considerable percentage of hull is removed from emmer. On this account it is thought that the difference in feed - ing value between emmer and either wheat or barley is usually less than the figures above indicate. For practical purposes then, it would seem that the difference in the feeding value of these three crops is of slight importance. As oats are frequently poorly filled and thus have a high percentage of hulls, it is thought the difference between its feed - ing value and that of the other grains is as great or greater than the figures indicate. Table 2, in which the yields are expressed in pounds, furn - ishes the best means of comparing the relative yields of the four crops. Taking the average yield of all seedings for all years as a basis of comparison, it is noted that barley outyields all other crops by a considerable amount. Oats occupy second place, wheat third, and emmer last, with a yield of slightly more than half that of barley. In Table 4 these yields are compared on a percentage basis. In the first column the yield of wheat is called 100 and the yields of the other three compared with it on that basis. In the second column the yield of oats is called 100 and the barley and emraer yields likewise used in the third and fourth columns. In Table 5 the same plan is employed but the average yield </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Spring Grains in Western Nebraska 11 of the first two seedings is used. In this comparison the margin of difference between crops is quite materially narrowed in all cases except between barley and oats, which is made somewhat wider. It is probable that these differences more nearly repre - sent what may be expected between the crops when seeded at the optimum time than do those of the former table. From these tests it appears that considerably higher yields can be expected from barley than from wheat, oats or emmer. The yields presented in this bulletin are not from the same fields as those presented in Table 21 of Bulletin 135. There is therefore some difference between the yields given in the two cases for the same crops in the same years. In either case, however, barley outyields any of the other crops. In the tests reported in this bulletin oats were the nearest competitor of barley in yield. In the tests reported in Bulletin 135 wheat was its nearest competi - tor. All of the tests so far conducted at the Experimental Sub - station point to the conclusion that barley is the highest yield - ing, surest, and most valuable of the four spring grain crops grown. Barley is less affected than wheat by late seeding. It is, therefore, an important emergency crop for seeding areas upon which winter wheat has been injured by winterkilling, particularly where the extent of winterkilling cannot be deter - mined until it is too late in the season to successfully seed spring wheat- In the drier portions of the State the live-stock farmer can lessen the risk of failure in producing feed by grow - ing crops which develop and mature at different seasons. The years in which both the grain and corn crops fail are much fewer than those in which one or the other fail. Direct compari - sons of the yields of barley and corn are not available at the Substation but in what comparisons it is possible to make between different fields the yield of barley is somewhat the greater of the two. The acreage devoted to barley in western Nebraska has been much less than that devoted to spring wheat or oats. The tests at the Experimental Substation indicate that it might with profit be given greater attention both as a feed and cash crop. Emmer is not widely grown and has shown no superior quali - ties. While it is a good feed for nearly all classes of stock, it is </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 172 not superior to the other spring grains. It is later than the other spring grains in maturing and is, therefore, more subject to drought and grasshopper injury. On account of these things, and the low average yields which can be expected from it, there seems to be little reason why it should be grown. In the various tests conducted at the Experimental Substa - tion there is not an agreement in the relative yields of spring wheat and oats. The tests reported in this bulletin indicate a substantial margin in favor of oats. The tests conducted on the bench (second bottom) land and reported in Bulletin 135, indi - cated that wheat is superior. In still another series of experi - ments Durum wheat has slightly outyielded Kherson oats. In the lists here reported conducted on the tableland 19 plats of Durum wheat and 22 plats of oats have been grown for 12 years. These plats are one-tenth acre in area and several methods of seed bed preparation have been used. The 12-year average yield has been 764 pounds per acre for wheat and 742 pounds for oats. Considering all of these experiments it seems probable that there is not much difference to be expected between the yields of the two crops for a series of years. Oats are preferred as a feed for horses and cattle while wheat is regarded as somewhat better for hogs. The per pound price of wheat is usually more than that of oats. For the ten - year period during which the tests reported in this bulletin have been run, the average farm price (Sec. 1) according to the reports of the United States Bureau of Crop Estimates, has been $1.94 per hundred pounds for wheat and $1.64 for oats. At these prices the average value per acre for the first two seedings of these tests for the ten-year period would be $12.62 for wheat and $13.07 for oats. On this basis the lead maintained by oats over wheat amounts to only 45 cents per acre. If, however, the yields to be expected from wheat and oats are about equal, as indicated by all the tests at the Experimental Substation, wheat would be the more profitable crop to grow. The average price for the same period was $1.46 per hundred for barley. The value per acre of the first two seedings of barley would be, therefore, $14.48 per acre. [»— 1— '19— SM] </seg>

            <seg id="p016">Summary Ten years of experiments with early and late seedings of spring wheat, oats, barley and emmer in western Nebraska gave the following results: Early seedings produced the best yields every year except two. The average yield of all crops were materially better from early than from late seedings. There was less difference between early and late seedings of barley and oats than of wheat and emmer. Barley outyielded any other crop. On account of the length of season in which barley can be successfully seeded, its high feeding value and high yielding power, it should be more gen - erally grown. Lowest yields were obtained from emmer. There seems little justification for growing this crop in the western part of the State. There was little difference between the values of spring wheat and early oats, either as a feed or cash crop. Weed growth is usually less troublesome in early than in late seedings. 6 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 172 ?able 4.— Percentage ratios between crope. Average yield of all seeding.
