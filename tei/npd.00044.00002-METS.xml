            <seg id="p005">STATE OF NEBRASKA OFFICE OF THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Lincoln, Nebraska, February 25, 1918. Honorable Keith Neville, Governor of Nebraska: Sir: In compliance with the requirements of Section 6119 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 as amended, we have the honor to submit herewith our Tenth Annual Report, covering the thirteen months ending December 31, 1917. Very respectfully, THOS. L. HALL, Chairman. H. G. TAYLOR, Commissioner VICTOR E. WILSON, Commissioner. Attest T. A. BROWNE, Secretary </seg>
            <seg id="p006"/>
            <seg id="p007">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION PART I General Review ORGANIZATION The Nebraska State Railway Commission is at present organized as follows: Thomas L. Hall, Chairman; H. G. Taylor and Victor E. Wilson, Commissioners; T. A. Browne, Secretary; Emma J. Hedges, official re - porter; Mary E. Sheehan, filing clerk and stenographer; Jennie M.

Ripley, examiner; Roscoe Davidson, stenographer. Because so much of the work of the Commission requires careful investigation of court decisions, and because the press of work made it difficult for the Commission members to devote time to these matters, the legislature of 1917 made provision in the biennial appropriation for legal aid. &amp;«* R II Supervision of the Blue Sky department had until 1917 been con - ducted in connection with other departments, but the work became so burdensome that the Commission found it not only advisable, but necessary for a competent examiner to devote his whole time to the subject. E. S. Ripley, of Lincoln, was selected for this duty. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT NEW LAWS OF 1917 AND THEIR OPERATION The legislature of 1917 enacted seven laws which changed or added to the duties of the Nebraska State Railway Commission. Some were at the suggestion of the Commission. Brief mention of these and ref - erence to experience in their operation during the major part of the year is possibly advisable. Distribution of Cars House Roll No. 40. — Places the regulation of distribution of freight car equipment directly under the Commission and designating certain principles which should, except in extraordinary cases, govern rules which the Commission was authorized and directed to promulgate in times of shortage. The law which this statute superseded was enacted in 1905, and provided for distribution according to the amount of freight on hand and offered for shipment. It applied specifically to the movement of grain. This law caused a great deal of dissatisfaction in the serious shortage period, which was at its height during the legislative session, and House Roll No. 40 was enacted to give expression to the legislative idea of what should be the law. The essential features of this law are that when the Commission on its own investigation and after hearing shall have determined that a car shortage exists, it shall promulgate rules for the distribution of car equipment available for loading within the State of Nebraska. The legislature set forth as its conclusion that such rules should use as a basic principle a distribution in accordance with the volume of business done in a preceding period, to be designated by the Commission. Pur - suant to that statute, the Commission held a hearing on May 11, 1917, having previously set forth in a preliminary order a suggested set of rules, worked out after arduous labor, as a basis for discussion. With the exception of the North Western and the Chicago, St. Paul, Min - neapolis &amp; Omaha, all roads voluntarily agreed that shortage existed. Evidence as to these two roads indicated that there was no shortage at the time of the hearing. No action was finally taken on the rules at that time, because immediately thereafter conditions became so im - proved as to make the rules unnecessary. Early in December the movement of corn became pronounced enough to render evident a shortage of equipment that had improved but little during the summer and fall. An informal conference between the Commission, representatives of the carriers, and shippers was held to discuss the application of distribution rules in their relation to the complex situations which had developed from war conditions. Priority orders relative to different commodities had rendered the full scope of the rules proposed in May highly impracticable. At this conference it became evident that the carriers were much adverse to the application of rules based on volume of preceding shipments, because of the possi - bility of liability as common carriers under federal statutes. The posi - tion appeared to the Commission to be well taken, and when the rules were finally promulgated, effective January 12, 1918, they provided a </seg>
            <seg id="p009">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 9 compromise method of distribution for regular shippers, based half on the volume of business done in 1917 by each shipper at a point and half on the amount of freight on hand and tendered for shipment. The rules, because of the complex condition in traffic movement, due to the war, were confined to the grain business and to distribution of grain cars at stations. There has been considerable dissatisfaction as to the working of the rules, particularly in their determination as to the attention mis - cellaneous shippers might receive, and from a number of shippers who felt that the basis used worked to their serious disadvantage in getting business. Electric Transmission Line* Senate File No. 59. — Amended the electric transmission line law of 1915 by forbidding any company constructing cross-country transmission lines at certain pressure to begin or carry on such construction without complying with the provisions of the law, and further amended by pro - viding definite penalties for violations. The amendments to this law were passed at the request of the Commission after two years' experience endeavoring to enforce the pro - visions of the act. The penalties theretofore applying had been those of the Railway Commission act, and were applicable only for violation of orders of the Commission. Very frequently construction was com - pleted before the Commission was aware of any activity. Since the amendment of the law, transmission line companies have been far more careful in following the provisions of the act, and the Commission feels now that it is in a position to carry out the legislative intent. Grain Warehouse Law Senate FileNNo. 145. — Amended the original act of 1915 by provid - ing that if grain Is held in storage in any warehouse or elevator more than ten days without being settled for, the company so holding is to be considered a public grain warehouse and subject to the provisions of the act; providing also much wider liability on the bondsmen in pro - tection of stored grain; and providing that the Commission might call on county attorneys to enforce the statute. The amendment, more closely designating what should be consid - ered stored grain, was inserted to correct practices occasionally used in the state to avoid the provisions of the law and at the same time not properly protect the owner of grain. The broadening of the scope of the bond was in conformity to the recommendation by Dean W. G. Hast - ings, of the University of Nebraska school of law, who found that the wording of the original act did not protect the owner of stored grain to the extent the legislature evidently intended it should be protected. During the last several months the storing of grain has been greatly curtailed by the restrictions and requirements of the federal government food administration. So far as the Commission knows, the act is work - ing satisfactorily in those places where it is used. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 10 Movement of Live Stock House Roll No. 419. — Provides that on -intrastate movements of live stock in carload lots main line speed of eighteen miles an hour should be maintained and twelve miles an hour on branch lines, with certain allowances at junction points for watering and feeding; provides also that on branch lines, with the consent of the State Railway Commission, carriers may designate certain shipping days; provides also that the State Railway Commission shall have power to hear and determine whether the provisions of the act are unreasonable and unjust to either the carrier or the shipper, and shall have the power to amend the provisions of the act to conform to any conclusions reached after a hearing. This act was passed as the result of court action declaring uncon - stitutional a former law regulating the speed of live stock trains. That former law was not under the jurisdiction of the Commission and the new law carefully provided for hearing and changes found necessary in order to correct legislative requirements found by the court to be un - reasonable. No cases were brought before the Commission in the year 1917 as a result of this statute. Pipe Lines Common Carriers House Roll No. 252. — Provides that any company created for the purpose of transporting or conveying crude oil, petroleum or its prod - ucts or gases, from one point in Nebraska to another shall be consid - ered as common carriers, with all the rights and privileges of common carriers in the matter of securing right-of-way for such pipe lines, and also placing said companies under the control and regulation of the Nebraska State Railway Commission on the same footing as other com - mon carriers. House Roll No. 229. — Declares to be common carriers companies organized for the purpose of storing, transporting or conveying salt, alkali brine and other mineral solutions or their products from one point within the state of Nebraska to another, and holding itself out to render transportation service for a consideration; gives said companies the rights of other common carriers in the matter of securing right-of-way and places them under the jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway Commission as to rates and service. No casfs have arisen under this act, and insofar as is known no companies have been organized for purposes which would place them under the provisions of either of the above statutes. Branch Line Train Service House Roll No. 67. — Provides that on new extensions of railroads within Nebraska built after January 1, 1917, railroad companies are re - lieved from operating exclusive passenger trains until such time as such extensions or lines shall earn to exceed V7&lt;- net per annum; to determine the earnings the formulae of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be used until the Nebraska State Railway Commission shall promulgate and make effective other formulae. This statute is dormant at present. Extensions of railways within the state have been negatived by financial conditions brought on by the war and the necessity of conserving funds for the improvement of equipment and roadbed already in existence. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 11 Reports of Common Carriers House Roll No. 155. — Amends the State Railway Commission act by providing that common carriers must report to the Commission an - nually, snail make such reports as of date December 31st and file Uie report not later than March 31st. Formerly the law required that the reports shall be made out as of date June 30th and be filed not later than August 1st succeeding. The National Association of Railway Commissioners agreed that a uniform date of reporting would be advisable because of the convenience of the different states and as a reduction in amount of work required from the reporting carriers. The Interstate Commerce Commission changed the date of report of common carriers doing an interstate business to December 31st also. The change enables railroad, express and tele - graph companies to prepare the reports for the federal government and for the various state governments at the same time, and enables telephone companies to make up their reports prior to the date most of them hold their annual meetings and at a time when other work is not so pressing as heretofore. The change of dates has given general sat - isfaction. IMPORTANT LITIGATION Passenger Rate Cases At various times through a period of a year and a half testimony was presented, either by the Commission and the state jointly or by the Missouri Pacific Railroad company, on the question whether the two - cent passenger rate law when applied to that carrier is in violation of the federal guaranty of protection to property rights. In the fall of 1915, following a decision of the state supreme court that the State Railway Commission was prohibited by the two-cent law from consider - ing the advisability of increasing passenger fares in Nebraska, an appeal was taken by the Missouri Pacific and the Rock Island to the federal court and injunctions there secured against the state and the Commission to prevent them from interfering with the collection of three cents per mile. Surety bonds were required of both these car - riers by the court to cover the excess which might be charged pending the determination of the litigation. The court appointed Frank H. Gaines, of Omaha, special master to receive the testimony and to make a report thereon. A considerable amount of testimony was taken in the summer and fall of 1916. Begin - ning on January 22, 1917, testimony was taken nearly every day up to and including February 10th. Another session was held on February 26th and February 27th. A recess was then taken to allow examina - tions of the testimony already presented and to prepare for cross - examination. For five days, beginning July 30th, testimony was again introduced. Upon motion of the Missouri Pacific, depositions were taken at Baltimore and at Chicago, where experts were examined, and </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT at these hearings the Commission was represented. Final introduction of testimony was scheduled for January, 1918. About five thousand pages of testimony and more than one hundred intricate exhibits made up the sum total of the offering to the master, as the case was submitted to him. An important factor in the ques - tion whether two cents per mile is enough to charge for passenger fares on the Missouri Pacific was the division of expenses between passenger and freight business for the maintenance of ways and struc - tures. The carrier insisted on a larger percentage of this being charged to passenger business than the state and the Commission are willing to grant. To support its theory the Commission developed an inven - tion for the purpose of measuring the effect on track-bed of the move - ment of passenger trains at a high rate of speed and of heavy freight trains at lower rates of speed. Numerous charts made by this machine were used in the preparation of the testimony. In December the court notified the Rock Island and the Commis - sion that the injunction case of that road, which had been held in abeyance pending the disposition of the Missouri Pacific case, ought to be taken up and pushed speedily. After two or three conferences the court named John F. Stout as special master to receive this testimony. At the request of the Commission arrangements were made that when hearings began on this case they should for the most part be held in Lincoln, as a matter of convenience to the larger number of persons who would be in attendance. According to tentative schedules made out before the end of the year, this case should be in the hands of the master for his conclusions by early fall of 1918. Class Freight Rates Except for preliminaries, not much progress was made in the con - test inaugurated in federal court by the Commission in opposition to the conclusions reached by the Interstate Commerce Commission re - sulting in increased class freight rates into and out of the jobbing cen - ters of Nebraska and the elimination on such movement of the rates prepared and promulgated by the Commission for intrastate business. Ed. P. Smith, of Omaha, was retained by the Commission to direct this litigation, because in the opinion of the Commission he was better pre - pared to handle the case than any other lawyer in the middle west. Stockyards Rates As a result of hearings, the Commission fixed the price for feed at the South Omaha stockyards on a sliding scale at a certain percentage above the price paid by the stockyards company. An appeal from this decision was taken to the state supreme court, where it has not yet been argued. Directly thereafter the Union Stock Yards company of South Omaha prepared to increase the price of hay from $20.00 per ton to $30.00 per ton. Louis B. Clark, of Chicago, a stockholder, brought suit in federal court against the Union Stock Yards company </seg>
            <seg id="p013">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 13 and against the Nebraska State Railway Commission, asking for an injunction to prevent the stock yards company from obeying any orders of the Nebraska State Railway Commission and against the Commission to prevent its attempting to enforce any orders. Application ior a temporary injunction was argued on September 15th before three judges of the federal court at Omaha, and the temporary injunction was de - nied. The main case had not come to argument by the end of the year.

Mandate issued by supreme court, dismissing appeal on motion of appellant. (See Part IV.) PEDDLING FROM CARS As a result of an appeal by certain shippers of Nebraska to the u. terstate Commerce Commission, the status of selling produce from rail - road car equipment was definitely determined. This appeal resulted in a considerable curtailment of privileges theretofore enjoyed. Peddling on purely intrastate movements of farm products had been permitted in Nebraska. In the appeal an effort was made to secure an extension of this privilege to interstate shipments, but the Interstate Commerce Commission found that it was an abuse of the use of freight cars and directed the carriers to eliminate the discrimination in favor of purely state business. Conferences were held between carriers and the Commission as vo what should rightly be called peddling from cars. The result was that the carriers agreed to permit distribution from cars provided that sales were not made at the cars. Under this understanding shippers who distributed their products from cars have not been seriously interfered with. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 15 CASES BEFORE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION Interstate Commerce Commission Docket No. 975, St. Joseph Live Stock Exchange v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., and Docket No. 9928, Kansas City Live Stock Exchange v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. In this case the St. Joseph Live Stock Exchange charged that the rrain service from Nebraska sta - tions to Omaha, as compared to Kansas City, is discriminatory; that the failure of the C. B. &amp; Q. to allow free transportation for a live stock care - taker on a shipment of one carload of live stock from Nebraska stations to St. Joseph, while at the same time allowing free return transportation for a caretaker of one carload of live stock from Omaha to Nebraska stations, constituted unjust and unlawful discrimination against St. Jo - seph; that the rates from certain Nebraska stations, viz., stations north and west of Aurora, to St. Joseph, as compared with the rates to Omaha, are discriminatory and unreasonably high on carload shipments of live stock from said stations to St. Joseph. The Nebraska Commission filed a protest with the Interstate Commission and in a hearing held at Kansas City on November 17 appeared and cross-examined witnesses and has prepared numerous exhibits for the purpose of introduction in testi - mony before the Interstate Commerce Commission. At the time of clos - ing this report the matter had been set down for further hearing to be held in Chicago on March 11, 1918. Town of Torrington v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. (The Henry Case.) Upon its own motion the Interstate Commerce Commission suspended an order entered in this case and set the matter down for further hear - ing. In February the complainants and the Nebraska Commission with its representatives introduced testimony before an attorney examiner of the Interstate Commerce Commission at a hearing held in Lincoln. In due course of time briefs were filed and the matter was finally sub - mitte'd to the Interstate Commerce Commission for its decision. Up to the presant time no decision has been handed down by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket No. 9009. Loss and Damage Grain in Settlement of Claims. On July 17. 1917, the Nebraska Commis - sion was represented in a hearing held before a special examiner of tne Interstate Commerce Commission at Omaha. Witnesses were cross-ex - amined and in due course of time a brief was filed with the Interstate Commission. At the time of the closing of this report the Interstate Commerce Commission had not made its findings and order in this case. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket No. 8182. The Cement Case. On account of testimony introduced before the Interstate Coiu - merce Commission by the complainants in this case wherein said com - plainants sought to establish the fact that there was a discriminatory adjustment of rate as between tha Nebraska intrastate rates as estab - lished by the Nebraska Commission and the rates applicable upon inter - state shipments having points of origin in the Kansas Gas Belt territory. The Nebraska Commission appeared before the Interstate Commerce </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT Commission in a hearing held in Washington in January of this year, and introduced testimony attempting to show that the Nebraska intrastate rates did not cause unjust and unlawful discrimination against inter - state traffic. Briefs were filed bsfore the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion by the Nebraska Commission and later Commissioner Wilson ap - peared before the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington in oral argument upon a tentative order submitted for the consideration of the Interstate Commission by Examiner Armes. Up to the time ot closing this report the Interstate Commerce Commission had not handed down its findings and order in this case. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket No. 1151. Advance in Potato Rates from North and South Dakota and Minnesota Producing Points to Nebraska Stations. The Nebraska Commission filed a pretest, against the advance in rates in this case and on November 22, 1917, ap - peared before an attorney examiner of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission at a hearing held in Omaha. Witnesses were cross-examined and in due course of time briefs were filed. Up to tha closing of thib report no decision had been entered in this case by the Interstate Com - merce Commission. Fifteenth Section Application on Behalf of the Express Companies Operating in United States to Increase Their Rates Ten Per Cent. Inter - state Commerce Commission Application No. 9972. On November 23, 1917, at the request of the Nebraska Commission, representat've.-&gt; of the state commissions of Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, South Dakota and Nebraska met in conference in Omaha. At said conferenc ; it was determined that the stale:, mentioned should appoint a committee to ap - pear before the Interstate Commerce Commission in a hearing which was to fci; held in Washington on December 6 &lt;=.Dd 7, for the purpose of pro - testing against the ten per cent advance in express rates as proposed by the several express companies. Hugh LaMaster, counsel for the Nt - braska Commission, was made chairman of said committee, and on the above mentioned date appeared before the Interstate Commerce Con* mission, together with representatives of states of Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri, and cross-sxamined witnesses offered by the express companies. On December 17 and 18, U. G. Powell, rate expert for the Nebraska Com - mission, presented a volume of exhibits on behalf of the state commis - sions mentioned. Up to the time of the closing of this report no furthei action has been taken in this case by the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion. Kansas City Millers' Club et al. v. A. T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., Minimum Weights of Grain Products. During the year the Commission held a hea. ing in its offices in the capitol building, relative to the minimum weight applicable to Nebraska intrastate shipments of grain products. At the time of the hearing one of the attorney examiners of the Interstate Com - merce Commission sat with the Nebraska Commission in hearing the case and interrogated witnesses. As a result of the hearing before tne Nebraska Commission an order was entered in which specific provision </seg>
            <seg id="p017">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 17 was made for minimum weights on intrastate shipments of grain products In a hearing held before an Interstate Commerce Commission examiner in Kansas City on November 29, the record made before the Nebraska Commission and the order entered by said Commission were introduced in testimony in said hearing. On the date of the closing of this report no decision was as yet handed down by the Interstate Commerce Com mission of this case. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket ex parte No. 57. In March of this year the railroad companies filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission tariffs which made a fifteen per cent advance in all class and commodity freight rates in the United States. The Nebraska Commission in company with some sixteen western state railway com- missions filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a protest ask- ing the railroad companies to justify the advance in the rates. The Ne- braska Commission, through its rate and accounting departments, pre- sented exhibits to the Interstate Commerce Commission intending to show that the revenues of the carriers were sufficient to pay all operating ex- penses, maintenance, taxes, and a reasonable income on the property in- vested to public use. Briefs were filed and oral argument was made be- fore the Commission and in July the Commission handed down an opinion in which it determined that the railroad companies had not justified the advance and the tariffs providing the increase in freight rates were ordered cancelled.

            <seg id="p018">18 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT SUMMARY OF COMPLAINTS AND APPLICATIONS Following is a brief summary of the business of the Commission for thirteen months ending December 31, 1917, where such business re - quired that the matters involved be docketed. This summary does not include a vast amount of correspondence on matters pertaining to the business of the department but classified as correspondence only. It will be noted that no small part of the Commission's activities relates to claims against the railway companies either because of alleged over - charges or because of loss or damage in transit. Over the latter class of claims the Commission has no jurisdiction but it does offer its services in negotiating with the carriers, and reaches settlement for many com - plainants. In the list also will be found certain complaints concerning sidetracks and industry sites. The Commission has been denied juris - diction over such matters by the United States supreme court, but it uses Its good offices anyway. 3ctavia Lumber &amp; Grain Co Octavia 10,000 *Vilsey Grain Co Arcadia 5,000 Oxford 2,000 hlynes Elevator Co G«neva 10,00b Grafton 13,000 Hansen 5,000 Lush ton .... 10,000 Trumbull .. 3.00C Fairmont .. 6,000 3.

            <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 127 PART III Opinions and Findings ORDERS ON FORMAL COMPLAINTS FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 226. South Omaha Live Stock Exchange, Complain ant. vs. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis A Omaha Rail - way Company, Defendant. Appearances : For Complainant: A. F. Stryker and W. H. Schellberg, For Defendant: A. A. McLaughlin and H. M. Pearce. OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Commissioner On January 6, 1916, this Commission issued an order directing the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company to file a tariff on or before February 10, 1916, providing for the absorption of the switching charges of the Missouri Pacific Railway company and the Union Stock Yards company on shipments of live stock destined to or originating at South Omaha, Nebraska, and originating at or deRtinad to stations on its lines in the state of Nebraska. This order was in sal's faction of a complaint filed by the South Omaha Live Stock Exchange and followed a hearing. Prior to the effective date of the order defendant filed a petition asking for a rehearing of the case and a suspension of th; - order. The petition for a rehearing was granted and on February 7, 1916, a supplemental order was issued suspending the order above referred to pending further action by the Commission. The grounds of the complaint are set forth in the original opin"io?-. and it is unnecessary to repeat them here. For the purpose of convenience in discussing the present record, the grounds upon which defendant asks for a rehearing will be summarized, as follows: (1) The Commission, in Its opinion and order, assumed facts not shown in the record; (2) it as - sumed in said opinion that the Wabash, Illinois Central and Chicago &amp; North Western are similarly situated to defendant with respect to the delivery of live stock at South Omaha, and that these lines absorb all switching charges on such shipments. It is alleged, however, that the situation with respect to these lines is very different from the situation </seg>
            <seg id="p128">128 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT of defendant, in that each of said carriers collects a freight rate to South Omaha which is considerably in excess of the freight rate from the same points to Council Bluffs, so that the shipper pays a freight rate from point of .origin to point of delivery at the Union Stock Yards company in South Omaha; (3) defendant's railroad in northeastern Nebraska ex - tends through a rough and hilly country and has many steep grades and sharp curves, so that it is unable to transport with the same power the tonnage other lines are able to transport, thereby increasing its expenses; (4) if defendant is compelled to absorb all of the terminal charges, as re - quired by the order, its rates will be so diminished as to make them less than those charged by other carriers for transporting live stock, and shippers will be getting transportation for, the ten miles from the M. &amp; O. terminal in North Omaha to the stockyards in South Omaha frae of charge. In this connection it is further alleged that the order is confiscatory; (5) the order works irreparable injury, from which defend - ant has no speedy and adequate r,emedy. At the rehearing defendant submitted a large amount of evidence in support of the allegations above set forth, thus supplying a deficiency in the original record. The new cvidencs quite materially changes the aspects of the case and will be reviewed in some detail for that reason. It is unnecessary to re-state hers the conditions under which live stock is delivered by the various lines to South Omaha. That matter was quite fully discussed in the original order. It is desirable for the pur - pose of clarity, however, to say that the defendant has no terminal at the stock yards in South Omaha, but makes delivery over the Missouri Pa - cific paying that road for the service $3.00 for each car handled. It also pays $1.00 per car to the Union Stock Yards company for switching service and rental of facilities. Of the $4.00 terminal charges thus pro - vided for in the tariffs, defendant absorbs $2.25 and assesses $1.50 against the shipper. With regard to the remaining twenty-five cents, the present record makes clear that, while the switching tariff provides for a charge of $3.00, its actual practice is to charge defendant but $2.75. This clears up a point not explained in the other record. The sole question to be determined here is one of discrimination. Are there reasons presented in the record as it is now before us which justify defendant in declining to absorb all of the terminal charges at Omaha? Defendant contends that there are, and we shall now proceed to a consideration of these contentions. First, defendant contends that the line haul rates on live stock as charged by the other carriers are higher than those in effect on the M. ft O. For this purpose comparisons are made on all lines entering Omaha, covering horses, cattle, hogs and sheep. Next a comparison is made of the rates charged by defendant from points in Nebraska to Omaha with the rates charged by certain other Nebraska carriers for equal distances. A comparison is also made of the rates charged by defendant from points on its line to Sioux City and from the same points and points equi-distam to Omaha. And finally, a comparison is made of the rates from points ta </seg>

Over four, hundred joints in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri are cov - ered in the general rate comparison first referred to.

            <seg id="p130">130 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT Station Road Distance Horses Cattle Hogs Sheep Pattonsburg, Mo Wabash NOTE: — Rates on horses in Nebraska are quoted in dollars per car, whereas in Iowa they are quoted in cents per hundred pounds. This explains the use of the two methods of stating the rates for horses. Defendant's allegation that its rates on live stock are less for the road haul than are charged by the carriers with whom it competes ap - pears to be borne out by the above comparison. Calculating the earnings per car on the basis of carload minimums (21,600 for horses, 22,000 for cattle, 17,000 for hogs, and 22,000 for double-deck sheep), we find that the revenue of the M. &amp; O. averages $2.52 per car less than the average of the eleven other lines used in the comparison. Examination of the re - mainder of the exhibit submitted by defendant indicates that this aver - age is fairly representative of the whole. The rates on hogs on the M. ft O. vary but little from those of the other carriers. In fact, in the figures shown above they are a trifle higher. On horses, cattle and sheep, how - ever, the difference Is quite marked. If the comparison was limited to the lines operating from Iowa into Omaha the spread would be considerably greater, the Iowa rates being higher on the average than those in effect in Nebraska. It is clear then that even with the addition of the $1.5o ter minal charge now assessed against the shipper by defendant, its rates are lower to the same market than are charged by the roads in the same territory. With respect to the comparison between rates on defendant's lines in Nebraska and those in effect on the North Western and Union Pacific, much the same situation is revealed. Comparisons for twelve zones are submitted, covering thirty-six towns, the distance running from 42 to 159 miles. Reducing the rates shown to the basis of car earnings, we find that the average revenue per car on all classes of live stock is $2.28 less on the M. ft O. than the average for the other two lines. A check of the rates submitted indicate that the comparison is a fair one and that the rates selected by defendant are not the lowest on its line and the highest on the other lines. As in the other comparison, it is manifest that after paying the terminal charge of $1.50 shippers over the lines of defendant pay a less aggregate charge than do the shippers over the other roads. Next, the rates from M. ft O. territory to both Omaha and Sioux City are compared, twenty-four points equi-distant from both markets being se - lected for comparison. The table covers cattle and hogs, and sheep, in both double-deck and single-deck cars. Pursuing the same method as in Jrofton, Neb Omaha leligh, Neb _.C. ft N. W. ibbott, Neb _..C. B. &amp; Q. It.

            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 131 the other two comparisons and reducing the rates to earnings per car, we find that the rates to Omaha produce a revenue of $3.40 per car less than the rates to Sioux City. In this connection it should be explained that the table of rates submitted by defendant at the time of the hearing was taken from tariffs then in effect. Subsequent to the hearing the M. &amp; O. reduced certain of its live stock rates from Burlington competitive points to Sioux City to meet a reduction put into effect by the Burlington. The new rates were submitted after the hearing, as per the request of the Com - mission, and in the comparison upon which the above calculation is based the lower Sioux City rates are used. A live stock shipper located on the lines of the defendant, it is apparent from this comparison, can ship to Omaha and pay the terminal charge of $1.50 and still enjoy a lower rate than if he ships to Sioux City, where the $1.50 is absorbed. In all of the comparisons discussed, the rates for the M. &amp; O. are based on the distance from the originating point to Omaha, although delivery is made to the stock yards at South Omaha, ten miles farther. In order to show that a comparison of the rates based on distance gives the shipper even a greater advantage than the above statements indicate, defendant submits a table of rates from twelve distance zones, covering as many points on the M. &amp; O., North Western and Union Pacific. In this table ten miles is added in each instance to the M. &amp; O. distance, the point being that if defendant is required to deliver the shipments to South Omaha for the road haul rate it is entitled to charge for the full distance to that point. For example the distance over the M. &amp; O. from Tekamah to Omaha is 42 miles and defendant's rate at the present time is figured on that basis. In this table, however, ten miles is added to the distance to complete the shipment to the stock yards. The 52 miles is then compared with a like distance on the North Western and the Union Pacific. That this produces a much lower rate per ton per mile than is iu effect on the other lines is self-evident, in view of the showing made by the foregoing comparisons. In other words, if the rates are already lower than those on other lines tha spreading of the same rates over an addi - tional ten miles of distance simply increases the advantage in favor of the M. &amp; O. shipper. In this connection a table is also submitted show* ing that the lines entering South Omaha from the east have a lower rate to Council Bluffs than they do to South Omaha, showing that the full distance from point of origin to South Omaha is taken into consideration in the fixing of the road haul charge. For example, the rate on horses from Arthur, Iowa, to Council Bluffs is 11.2 cents, whereas the rate from the same point to South Omaha is 12.8 cents. The rate on cattle from Arthur to Council Bluffs is 10.3 cents and to South Omaha 12 cents. The rate on horses from Manning, Iowa, to Council Bluffs is 10.6 cents and to South Omaha 11.5 cents. The rate on hogs from the same point to Council Bluffs is 10.6 cents and to South Omaha 12.4 cents. The differ - ence in the charge per car runs from $1.95 to $4.00 or $5.00 in the table submitted. It is argued with considerable force that if other lines make a distinction between Council Bluffs and South Omaha it is proper for defendant to make a like distinction between Omaha and South Omaha, </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT the distance in both cases being substantially the same. As described in the original order, the Wabash, Illinois Central, Great Western and North Western are compelled to make use of intermediate facilities to get from Council Bluffs to South Omaha, but while they assess no' terminal charge, as such, against the shippers of live stock, they do, in fact, include sucn charge in their rate for the road haul. In other words, the shipper pays for the terminal charge, but not in a specific amount that is added to his freight bill, as is the case with defendant. Defendant makes an elaborate showing as to the nature of the country traversed by Us lines, the point being that it has many curve* and steep grades which necessitate the use of extra engines to handle its trains, thus materially increasing the cost of transporting live stock. Comparison on these matters is made with the North Western and Bur - lington and it is shown that they are not subject to the same disability. While this showing might have a material bearing on the issue in this case if the rates for the. transportation of live stock were the same as on other lines, we are of the opinion that, in view of the rate situation as it has been shown to exist, it will not be necessary to discuss this feature of the evidence. In the original order we said: "If defendant actually maintained a lower scale of rates into South Omaha than the other lines serving that point that fact would furnish a persuasive argument in favor of its refusal to absorb all switching charges. With rates substantially the same as are charged by other carriers, however, it is not in position to insist that it is extending any advantage to shippers in the matter of charges for transporta- tion." The record in the original hearing lacked proof of the contention that the rates maintained by defendant were lower than were charged by other lines entering South Omaha. While that contention was urged, It was not supported by any evidence. The Commission lacked the neces - sary time to make adequate comparisons and upon the record as then made up came to the conclusion that the rates charged by defendant were substantially the same as were in effect on the other lines. The deficiency in that respect has now been supplied, and, as we have shown, the pres - ent record clearly proves that live stock rates on the M. &amp; O. are, on the average, less than on the other lines serving South Omaha. This state - ment remains true, even after the terminal charge of $1.50 per car is added to the charge for the road haul. Complainant insists that this is solely a question of discrimination; that the assessment of the charge of $1.50 puts the shippers of live stock over defendant's lines to a disadvantage as compared to those shippers who are located on other lines entering South Omaha or those on the M. &amp; O. who ship to Sioux City. As we view it, the shipper is con - cerned only in the amount of his transportation charges, and not in the manner in which those charges may be made up. If the total amount which an M. &amp; O. shipper has to pay for the transportation of a car of live stock to South Omaha is no greater than the amount a shipper on </seg>
            <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 133 another road has to pay for a like distance, there certainly is no dis - crimination, all other things being equal. The fact that the M. &amp; O. charge is composed of two items, one for the road haul and the other for a portion of the terminal cost, constitutes no discrimination. It does not even constitute an inconvenience for the shipper. In the former order we^said that "under the conditions as found in this case a shipper has the right to expect, when he starts a shipment of live stock from some point on defendant's lines for South Omaha that it will be delivered to the stock yards under the charge assessed for the line haul and that he will not be required to pay an additional charge for transportation over another road." In reaching that conclusion, however, we had in mind the facts as they were shown by that record. It had not been shown at that time, as has been clearly shown in this record, that defendant was, transporting live stock from points on its line to Omaha for considerably less than other lines were charging for the same distance, and that the charge of $1.50 could be added to the charge for the road haul and still leave the amount paid by the shipper the same or less than that paid by the shipper on another road. The appearance of the item of $1.50 on M. &amp; O. freight bills and its absence on the freight bills of otb^r car - riers gives rise to the presumption that the former is exacting a charge not exacted by the latter, but it is a presumption only, and the record discloses one not warranted by all the facts. Complainant argues vigorously that the practice of defendant to ab - sorb the $1.50 on shipments originating at points competitive with other roads is discriminatory as against shipments originating at non-competi - tive points. With respect to this contention we said in the original order: "If that were the only ground upon which this complaint rested, it would not be sufficiently conclusive of itself to prompt this Com- mission to issue the order prayed for." There appears to be reason to modify that conclusion. As was shown in the former opinion, the practice is not confined to the M. &amp; 0., but ob - tains on practically every road in the country. It has the sanction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. For the reasons shown in this record the case referred to by complainant (30 I. C. C. 552-561) is not comparable. Sioux City is not being accorded any advantage not enjoyed by Omaha. The advantage, if there is any, is enjoyed by Omaha rather than Sioux City. Defendant absorbs a terminal charge of $1.50 at Sioux City and adds nothing to the road haul charge, but it absorbs $2.25 at Omaha and because of the rate adjustment the shipper pays less for his transportation to the latter market than he does to Sioux City. It follows that the Commission is of the opinion that its original order should be cancelled and the complaint dismissed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the order issued in the matter herein on January 6, 1916, be, and the same hereby is, cancelled and set aside. </seg>

Browne, Secretary. • (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 240 E. R. Chace and August G. Moderow, Com - plainants, vs. The Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Com - pany, Defendant. Appearances : W. P. Cowan, for complainant; A. A. McLaughlin. for defendant. OPINION AND FINDING Clarke, Chairman: The complainants herein are farmers and shippers residing in Stan - ton county, Nebraska, near what is known as Siding No. 2, which is a passing track located on the main line of the North Western railway 5.3 miles west of Stanton and 6 miles east of Norfolk. They seek an orftr requiring the defendants to provide a stock yards and suitable side track at this point for the loading and unloading of live stock and grain, etc. The gist of the complaint is that the complainants and other ship - pers tributary to Siding No. 2 are subjscted to greater inconvenience and expenses in driving their live stock to and hauling .grain from the sta - tions of Norfolk anfl Stanton and neighboring towns on the Union Pacific and Minneapolis and Omaha than they would be if the defendant fur - nished the facilities asked for at Siding No. 2. Complainants name some thirty-seven shippers whom they claim ship in the aggregate 74 cars of live stock and five cars of hay and grain in the year. Complainants, however, tailed to make proper proof of this statement at the hearing. Defendants, on the contrary, showed that in th3 year prior to the filing of the complaint 24 of the parties neither made nor received any carload shipments, and that the remainder shipped or received but 37 carloads, 32 of which originated or destinated at Stan - ton and the balance at Norfolk. Fifteen of the cars in question were. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 shipped by or consigned to the complainants at Stanton. from which point they are six and one-half and six miles respectively. Complainants subsequent to the hearing filed an agreement with the Commission agreeing to furnish such additional land as might be neces - sary for the proposed improvements and to do all the grading that might be necessary to be done in the construction of the same. There are no unusual features in connection with the topography of the country which contribute to the inconvenience of the complain - ants delivering and receiving freight at Norfolk or Stanton. The ques - tion of distance is the main factor, though complainants urged the incon - venience of driving live stock through the streets of the larger towns. Siding No. 2 was constructed by defendant for the purpose of facili - tating the movement of trains. It is used as a meeting point or passing track for both freight and passenger trains. Several years ago during the so-called Bonesteel rush defendant maintained an operator at this siding for a short period of time. No freight has evar been received or delivered at this siding. Complainants offered evidence of sidings serving shippers located at points short distances from established stations which had been voluntari - ly established by defendant. The conditions under which these sidings were established appear to have been somewhat if not entirely dissimilar to those appearing in this case. Unless they constituted an undue or un - just discrimination against the complainants, the fact of their existence would not estop the defendant from claiming that the facilities furnished the complainants were reasonably convenient and adequate. To find for complainants on the record in this case would establish a precedent which if adhered to by the Commission would involve the location and maintenance of many sidings in the state in communities just as populated and prosperous. This we are not prepared to do. The time may come when by reason of scientific an% intensified methods of agriculture ths population and traffic to be served by the location of shipping facilities at this point will be sufficiently great to justify affir - mative relief on the part of the Commission. The Supreme Court of this state in the case of the Chicago A North Western Railway Company v. Nebraska, 74 Neb. 77, involving the dis - continuance of an agent at a station already established, held: "The general power to manage and control the business of a rail - road company, including to establish, maintain and discontinue freight and passenger buildings and stations and to employ and discharge servants, is administrative in its character and of a discretionary na - ture, and, in the absence of legislation to the contrary, is vested in the company itself. It is a power which from the very nature of things the courts themselves cannot exercise, and it follows of necessity that they will not interfere with its exercise, unless in exceptional cases in which it is made clearly to appear that there has be9n an abuse of discretion amounting, in practical effect, to the denial of a public right or a repudiation of public obligations, which the corporation expressly or impliedly assumed in the acceptance of its charter and franchises." </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT The opinion quotes with approval the decision in State v. Railway, 87 Iowa, 644, in part as follows: "There is nothing in the case which tends to show that the mana - gers of the roads had any intention to deprive anyone of proper fa- cilities for transacting business with the company. * • * • it appears to us that the owners of the road should not be interfered with in the management of their property, including the location of their stations, where, as in this case, there is no competent evidence that any patron of the road has been deprived of reasonable facilities for transacting business with the defendant." The Commission upon consideration or the evidence and briefs is convinced that under the facts disclosed by the record the defendant has not abused its discretion; that there has been no proof of unjust discrimination; that complainants are not deprived of reasonable ship - ping facilities, and that the complaint should be dismissed. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint herein be and the same is hereby dismissed. Entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 19th day of December A. D. 1916. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, Henry T.

Appearances : For complainant, Ben P. Sanders, M. F. Grigg, Houston T. Waddell, Francis Skinner; For defendant, L. H. Costley, Edwin Johnson, R. W. Turner, A. A. McLaughlin, Atty. OPINION AND FINDING Hall, Commissioner: The matter herein came on to be heard at Irwin on the 23d day of June, 1916. It is alleged in the complaint that the depot facilities at Irwin are inadequate to serve the public because there is no agent at that point and the depot consists of two box cars, one of which is used as a waiting room and the other for freight. Irwin is located on the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company's line fourteen miles east of Gordon and fourteen miles west of Merriman, </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 137 and has a population of about thirty. The territory surrounding Irwin, from which it draws its patronage, extends to the south about thirty miles and at least fifteen miles to the north. The land is principally used for grazing purposes and but very little farming is done. The depot and station facilities consist of one passing track and an industry track, upon which are located large and well constructed stock - yards, one water tank, two section houses, and bunk cars for section crews, and two box cars which are used for a depot, and a platform. The depot grounds are clean and all facilities referred to are in a good state of repair. The complaint and all testimony by the complaining witnesses is to the matter of the inadequacy of the two box cars used as a depot and that there is no agent at that point. There is a telephone in one of the section houses which is used by patrons of the road for railroad business. The testimony shows that pas - sengers coming from long distances are compelled to build a fire in the box car used as a waiting room, kindling and coal being provided by the section hands for that purpose. All less than carload freight for that point is put off either at Gordon or Merriman unless the freight is pre - paid. When the freight is prepaid it is unloaded at Irwin at owner's risk. This compels the consignee to be at the station on the arrival of the train to receive his goods or run the risk of losing them. It is difficult for the consignee to know on what train his goods will arrive, which re - sults in great annoyance and inconvenience to him. In shipping out goods it is necessary for him to leave it at the box car and telephone to the agent at either Gordon or Merriman and have him prepare the freight bill, which is given to the conductor when the train reaches that point. The train then picks up the goods at Irwin. The same general condition prevails in this respect as to all carload freight, which results in great In - convenience to the shipper. Parties loading out cattle, for instance, for Omaha are compelled to telephone to Merriman and have the cars billed at that point for Omaha. If he goes with his stock the train stops long enough for him to sign up the contract. If he does not go with his stock it is necessary for him to at least go down to Merriman and sign up the contract and then return to Irwin. This, according to the testi - mony, does not often occur, because usually shippers accompany their stock to Omaha or to any other destinating point to which they ship. It is not necessary for the Commission to discuss at length the Inconveni - ence shippers are put to at non-agency stations. The matter has been discussed many times before the Commission, and from all the light that has been thrown upon the subject all should admit that a depot, properly lighted and heated, and an agent should be provided where the revenues will at all justify the necessary expenditures of money to provide such accommodations. The complaining witnesses were not prepared to make a showing in this respect, but asked that the data on file with the Com - mission as to all traffic in and out of Irwin be made a part of the record and that it be considered by the Commission in reaching its conclusions and findings in this case. This, however, is the rule that has been fol- </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT lowed by the Commission in all complaints as to depot facilities. The amount of traffic moving in and out of a station and the revenues re - ceived therefrom must necessarily bs one of the controlling factors con Bidered by the Commission in reaching its conclusions as to the ade - quacy of facilities. It is more necessary for several reasons that com - fortable depots and an agent be provided at stations where Cue surround - ing territory is sparsely populated and the traffic comes from long dis - tances than in a community that Is densely populated and all of the traffic comes from a territory adjacent to the station. For instance, people llv ing in the centar of the town which ie located close to the depot do not suffer to any appreciable extent on account of the inconveniences of a waiting room, because they do not have to leave their homes until a few minutes before the arrival of the train. If the train is scheduled to arrive at the station in the night the party living in the town can remain at his home until approximately train time, while the party living a long distance in the country Is compelled to leave his home several hours be fora train time, and when he reaches the station and finds that the train is several hours late the only glace he has to wait is at the station. At Irwin by far the larger part of the traffic comes from long distances. The Commission has carefully analyzed the data on file in its offices as to the amount of traffic moving in and out of Irwin and the revenues re - ceived by the defendant. A study of those figures shows that the traffic has been steadily increasing, which will be borne out by the following con - densed figures. The records show that the total receipts at Irwin for the years 1914, 1915 and 1916 were as follows: It will be noted, according to the above figures, that by far ttir greater part of the revenue is received from freight forwarded, which represents, in the main, catils shipments. It will further be noted that the ticket sales, as shown by the above figures, is the small part of the revenue, but it must be remembered that the receipts from the ticket sales, as shown by the records of the Commission, do not represent the total amount of passenger traffic at that point, because parties taking the train at Irwin in going to Omaha pay a cash fare on the train for fourteen miles to Merriman and buy a ticket at Merriman to their destinating point. Parties going west beyond Gordon pay cash fare for fourteen miles lu Gordon and then purchase a ticket to the point of destination, while if there was a depot and an agent at Irwin practically ail passengers taking trains at that point would purchase their tickets there to their destinat - ing point. Also, according to the testimony, people living in th e country, Year Ending June 30, 1914 Freight Forwarded Freight Received Ticket Sales $2,843.97 $1,349.04 $458.14 Total $4,661.15 Year Ending June 30, 1915 $7,528.75 $ 840.00 $400.40 $8,769.15 Year Ending June 30, 1916 $9,166.62 $2,202.80 $508.20 $11,877.62 </seg>

This to some extent applies to the freight traffic. The figures on Hie with the Commission do not reflect the truth as to the amount of business that properly belongs to the station where there is no agent. The Commission iE of the opinion, under all of the circumstances, con - sidering the amount of traffic moving, the territory from which it comes and the amount of revenues that are being received by the defendant, that a small, comfortable dapot should be built at that point; that said depot should be kept open, in accordance with the statutes of Nebraska, before the arrival and departure of all trains carrying passengers; that an agent should be provided to transact all of the company's business at said dspot. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the defendant herein, the Chicago &amp; North Western Rail - way ccmpany, te and is hereby directed to erect a depot at Irwin, Ne - braska; that said depot shall be comfortably heated and well lighted, in accordance with the statutes of Nebraska, before the arrival and de - parture of all trains carrying passengers; that an agent shall be pro - vided upon the completion of the depot, to transact all railroad business at that station.

It was a con - dition of the order that The St. Joseph ft Grand Island Railway company be granted leave to file an application for the discontinuance of the motor train, after the lapse of a period of not less than ninety days' opera - tion of the same. The motor was installed as directed and pursuant lo the condition cited application is now made to discontinue the same. The ninety-day period expired December 25, but the motor is still in service. if is the contention of the defendant that the motor service has not been remunerative and that it has been maintained at a loss. Extensive data covering the earnings and expenses of the train for the period was submitted at the hearing. No attempt will be made by the. Commission to analyze these figures nor to make any finding as to their significance at this time. The original complainants in the case, particularly the Hastings Chamber of Commerce and the Fairbury Commercial Club, have indicated to the Commission, by verbal testimony and by letter, that they have no objection at this time to the discontinuance of the service, though they desire it understood that they taks this action with - out prejudice to any future course they may desire to pursue. They are not altogether satisfied as to the reliability of the test made, but waive their objections on that score at this time. In view of the attitude of the public, as represented in this case, the Commission is of the opinion that the application of defendant should be granted.

            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 143 Appearances: For Complainant, A. D. McCandless For Defendant, C. B. ft Q. R. R. Co., Byron Clark. For Defendant, U. P. R. R. Co., John H. Benewltz. OPINION AND FINDING Clarke, Chairman: The complainant is engaged in the wholesale ice business at Wymors, shipping in carloads to other points. The defendants, the Chicago, Bur - lington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, hereinafter referred to as the Bur - lington, and the Union Pacific Railroad company, hereinafter referred to as the Union Pacific, converge to a point one-half mile east of the corporate limits of Wymore, where they are seventy-four feet apart. From this point they practically parallel each other to a po'nt three - fourths of a mile farther east where they intersect. Between the two points D. H. Davis, the owner and operator of certain stone quarries, has switches on each road; the one on the Union Pacific running direct to his crushers and the one on the Burlington necessitating a wagon haul. Complainant asks that the defendants be required to construct a transfer track between the two points. There are fonr locations which are practical from a physical and operating standpoint, two to the east, where an interlocking plant safeguards the intersection, and two to the west which are not so protected and though less expensive by reason thereof would increase the hazard of operation. Complainant offers to pay the cost of the construction of the proposed track at the latter lo - cation. Complainant offered evidence showing the movement of ice to Kan - sas points on the Union Pacific, particularly during periods of ice famine. These shipments were transferred from the Burlington to the Union Pa - cific at Beatrice, Nebraska, or Atchison, Kansas. These movements are all interstate. Such Nebraska points as afforded him a market for his ice were all reached by the Burlington. Certain grain, lumber and coal dealers, located at Wymore, testified that the construction and operation of a transfer track at this point would afford wider and more favorable markets in which to buy and sell the particular commodities in which they dealt, all shipments of which would either originate or destinate at Wymore. Most, if not all, of such shipments would be interstate in character. Mr. Davis, who operates the stone quarries, testified that it would convenience him only to the extent of saving a wagon haul to the Bur - lington track, costing two dollars, and if the switching service cost that much and was not absorbed his sole benefit would be possibly the develop - ment of more business on the Burlington. While these stone quarries are outside the corporate limits of Wymore, the Burlington sidings serving them should properly be considered as at Wymore. There was no evi - dence offered tending to show that there would be any traffic, intrastate or </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT interstate in character, which would originate beyond Wymore on the one line and destinate beyond Wymore on the other. The existence of a transfer switch at Beatrice, 12 miles north ot Wymore on the Burlington, almost precludes the possibility of developing any considerable traffic of that character. It. is clear from the record, as suggested above, that the entire use, which complainant and the other witnesses contemplated making of the proposed transfer, was for the placing of cars loaded or empty, whose point of origin or destination would be Wymore (including the quarry tracks) and the nature of the traffic almost entirely, If not exclusively, interstate in character. Such being the case, the Commission is not justified in granting the relief prayed for under the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in the case of L. A N. R. Co. v. Central Stock Yards Company, 212 U. S. 132, and again in the case of the I. C. R. Co. v. C. L. DeFuentes et al., Railroad Commissioners of Louisiana, 236 U. S. 157. In the former case the court held: "The duty of a carrier to accept goods tendered at its station does not require it to accept cars offered by competing roads at arbitrary points near its terminus for the purpose of using its terminal station. A law requiring the carrier so to do is unconstitutional as taking property without due process of law." In the latter case the court was called upon to pass upon the consti - tutionality of an order of the Louisiana Railroad Commission, which was similar to the one which would have to be entered by this Commission if the petition was sustained, the order being: "No railroad company operating in the state of Louisiana shall re- fuse or decline to switch cars for any other railroad with which It connects for any shipper, or consignee, at rates approved or estab - lished by the Commission, whether such cars are to be loaded with freight to be shipped out of the state, or are to be loaded with freight shipped into the state. All tariffs for the 'service' of switching cars in the state of Louisiana, shall be filed with the Commission, within thirty days from the date of this order, and all the Commission's rules and orders relative to rates and changes in rates, will also apply to switching charges." This was attacked, both because it was an attempt to regulate Inter - state commerce, and also an attempt to exchange uses of terminals. The court in its opinion, on page 163, said: "From the foregoing summary of the facts stipulated it fairly appears that obedience to Order No. 295 would require appellant, upon demand of a carrier or shipper and on terms fixed by the state com - mission, to switch empty cars from any connection with a competing interstate railroad to a designated side track within its own terminals for the purpose of being loaded there with goods intended for inter - state commerce, and when so loaded to move the same back to com - petitor's line for continued transportation to another state. Likewise appellant would be required to accept from competing interstate lines at points within the city loaded cars brought from other states and place them on its own side track, although such track was the real destination contemplated at the time of the original shipment. </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 145 Switching movements of this kind (we do not now inquire as to others) constitute a part of interstate commerce the regulation of which Congress has undertaken, and consequently the order of the state commission transcends the limits of its powers." It may be, however, that complainant or other interested parties could develop facts which would bring them within the rule !aid down in the Supreme Court in the case of Jacobson v. Wisconsin, M. &amp; P. R. Co., 179 U. S. 287. For this and foregoing reasons laid down in the order it follows that the complaint herein should be dismissed without preju - dice.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, Henry T. Clarke, Jr., Chairman. Attest: T. A. Browne, Secretary. (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 291 The Lincoln Commercial Club, Complainant, vs. The Missouri Pacific Railway Company, De - fendant. Appearances: For Complainant, W. S.

OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: This matter came on for hearing on a complaint filed by the Lincoln Commercial Club, bringing in review before the Commission the absorp - tion rule of the Missouri Pacific Railway company in its application to the absorption of other carriers' switching charges on Missouri Pacific road haul traffic having point of origin at an exclusive Missouri Pacific station. » 1 * f\ -U 3 The complaint, as set out in paragraph three, is not entirely clear as to just what charges are to be considered by the Commission, but the rec- </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT ord in the case clearly outlines that the charges at issue have been cor rectly stated. Paragraph 3 reads as follows: "That said defendant publishes in its switching tariff No. 4778, legally on file with the Commission, certain prescribed charges, that said defendant is charging, demanding and collecting on carload freight having origin or destination at local points upon its lines of of road in the state of Nebraska consigned to or moving from warehouses located upon lines of connecting carriers in the city of Lincoln, that are unjust and unreasonable to the extent of the charges affected for switching such carload freight between defend - ant's point of interchange and warehouses located upon lines of con - necting carriers." The Missouri Pacific would legally have no authority to undertake to establish switching charges applicable from connecting carriers' trans - fer tracks to industries on other lines of railroad. However, the Com - mission considers that the absorption rule is here under consideration, as published by the Missouri Pacific Railway company in its tariff No. 4778 and supplements thereto, specifically referred to as follows: Original tariff item 35, page 4, reads in part as follows: "Switching charges of connecting lines will ba absorbed, (a) on all carload competitive shipments excepting as provided in Item 38. The term 'competitive' used herein covers all carload shipments ex - cepting those which originate at or are destined to local stations on the Missouri Pacific-Iron Mountain railways ; and which originate at or are destined to stations on connecting lines reached exclusively via the Missouri Pacific-Iron Mountain railways including junction points with such railroads as indicated in note." (No Nebraska sta - tions are mentioned in the note.) Item No. 38, exceptions to: "Absorptions. — Switching charges of connecting lines will uot be absorbed, (a) on outbound shipments of grain, grain products (see note), seeds and alfalfa that is given transit privileges at cleaning or milling stations, except as provided in Circular No. 2-J, I. C. C. No. A-2216, supplements thereto and re-issues thereof; (b) on less than carload shipments of packing house products and fresh meats (see note) in Trans-Missouri territory, viz., stations north, south and west of Pleasant Hill, Missouri, as described in Trans-Missouri Tariff No. 11-1, W. A. Poteet, I. C. C. No. 253, (Missouri Pacific No. 1192-C), supplements thereto and re-issues thereof except as provided for at South Omaha, Nebr. ; (c) on live stock, including live stock with emi - grant movables, stopped at Missouri River stockyards for inspection account state or federal regulations; (d) on shipments of petroleum and Its products moving between points in the state of Kansas under tariff 2445 series (not interstate) ; (e) on carload shipments when the gross revenue (freight charges) per car is not sufficient to allow minimum net revenue (freight charges less connecting lines' switch - ing charges) of $8.00 per car. If the gross revenue is sufficient to allow of the absorption of a portion of connecting lines' switching then an amount not exceeding the difference between the gross reve - nue per car and the minimum net revenue of $8.00 per car will be absorbed; but in no case more than the published charge of the line performing the switching service or more than the amount specifical - ly set forth In section (b) of Item No. 35. Example: Gross revenue — ~ _ ,.......,$8.70 </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 147 That portion, to-wit, "on all carload competitive shipments," is the portion of the rule that the complainant brings in question before the Commission in this case. In the answer entered by the defendant denial is made of all the aver - ments contained in the plaintiff's petition. The complainants offered testimony in support of their petition as to material facts as follows: — That defendant, the Missouri Pacific Railway company, in certain tariffs makes provision for the absorption of shipments originating at local points on its line of railroad in Nebraska; that on car - load shipments of stone originating at Nehawka and Weeping Water, con - signed to industry tracks of connecting carriers at Lincoln, defendants ab - sorb the switching charge down to where their net revenue will be $15.00 per car; that other carriers operating In Lincoln absorb other line switch - ing charges without regard to the point of origin of the shipment; that shipments of hollow building tile could not be made on the defendant's line of road because of the fact that the absorption of the switching charge of the originating carrier would not be absorbed by the Missouri Pacific Railway company; that shipments of drain tile from manufactories located in Lincoln to local points on the Missouri Pacific railway were handi - capped by reason of the fact that defendant would not absorb the originat - ing carrier's switching charge between the manufacturing plant and the connection with the Missouri Pacific Railway company; that certain fruit jobbing firms located on industry tracks of connecting carriers at Lin - coln received fruit billed from local points on the Missouri Pacific where the absorption of the switching charges was not made by defendant as to some companies and that competing firms who were located on joint in - dustry tracks — joint as between the Missouri Pacific and the North West - ern — received shipments of fruit at their warehouses without the payment of switching charges. Mr. D. R. Lincoln, general freight agent of the Missouri Pacific Rail - way company, testified on behalf of the defendant. His testimony sum - marized shows as follows: "It is true that the Burlington have a rule under which they ab - sorb switching on local business in Nebraska and I believe that the North Western has." That the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company does not ab - sorb switching charges from non-competitive points; that a similar ques - tion had been presented before the Interstate Commerce Commission and that the said Commission had acted, "in each of such cases ths position of the railroads in refusing to absorb the switching charges has been sus tained." That the absorption of switching charges from local points on carload shipments of sand was established by the defendant. In this con - nection the record shows the following testimony: q. — The rate on sand was a voluntary rate made some years ago? [inimum net revenue 8.0 mount to bs absorbed .. — $ .7i </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT A. — I will admit it was in a way a voluntary rate. We have a list of fool rates in our tariff, made by ourselves, and we cannot get away from them." That the absorption of switching charges on carload shipments of brick, regardless of point of origin or destination, was voluntarily estab - lished by the defendant. At the end of the taking of testimony the fol - lowing statement was made on bshalf of defendant by counsel: "In view of Mr. Lincoln's opinion that the earnings of the road should enter into the consideration of a matter of this kind, we would like to ask leave to insert in the record data to be furnished later, on the annual statement on file with the Commission of our total receipts and disbursements in Nebraska, say from 1909 up to date." Leave was granted by the Commission. In view of the fact that the defendant has on its own motion estab - lished in its tariff a provision that switching charges of connecting car riers would be absorbed on competitive business and without showing in the record that the service performed from local points of origin was any more expensive to the defendant to handle than traffic originating at competitive points, and further, in view of the fact that all of the carriers operating lines of railroad into Lincoln provide in their tariffs rules that allow the absorption of switching charges of the connecting lines without regard to point of origin or destination, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that it is a reasonable and fair requirement for the Missouri Pacific to establish tariff provisions that will allow the absorption of con - necting lines' switching charges, with the general exceptions that apply in the tariff provisions herein noted as to certain commodities, etc. As to the showing of the defendant in regard to the results of opera - tion of the company's property located in the state of Nebraska for the years 1909 to 1915, inclusive, this is of no assistance to the Commission in determining the question herein presented. The statement does not undertake to separate the Nebraska traffic between freight and passenger or between state and interstate business. Before such figures would be of any assistance divisions of the traffic outlined above should be made and special studies as to expense of intrastate freight traffic, both as to road and. yard services, should be presented for consideration. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the defendant, Missouri Pacific Railway company, shall, on or before thirty days from the date of this order, cancel that part of Item No. 35, page 4, Missouri Pacific Tariff No. 4778, to-wit: "(a) On all carload competitive shipments excepting as pro - vided in rule 38 the term 'competitive' used herein covers all car - load shipments excepting those which originate at or destined to local stations on the Missouri Pacific-Iron Mountain railways; and which originate at or are destined to stations on connecting' lines reached exclusively by the Missouri Pacific-Iron Mountain railway)), including junction points with such railroads as indicated in note." </seg>

Axtell et al., Complainants, vs. Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, De - fendant. Appearances : For Complainants, W. J. Moss, attorney. For Defendant, W. H. Barnes, attorney; L. E. Hurtz, general manager. OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Commissioner Subsequent to February 1, 1912, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company had filed with this Commission the following schedule of rates for service on farm lines: These rates cover metallic service only and were the only rates on file. The company was furnishing grounded farm line service, however, for which It was charging and collecting a rate of $12.00 per year. Its authority for this rate rested upon the filings of the Fairbury Telephone company, whose property it purchased in February, 1912, the schedules in effect being a combination of the rates filed by both companies prior to the consolidation. On June 1, 1915, when the action was taken that really brought about this controversy, defendant was furnishing service to 351 farm subscribers, distributed among the three classes as follows: — Metallic lines with more than ten subscribers to the line, 206; metallic lines with ten subscribers or less to the line, 35; grounded lines, with ten or more subscribers to the line, 110. At this time the company determined that its farm lines were in need of reconstruction, and it also desired to ra- rarm, 10-party _ $18.00 yer yeai f more than ten parties on a line (maximum sixteen) $16.00 per yea: </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT adjust its farm line rates so as to bring about uniformity and remove discrimination. Accordingly, it started a campaign to solicit all farm subscribers to the $1.50 rate, which called for ten-party or less metallic ssrvice. This campaign continued until late in the fall of that year, the work being done by Bert R. Overcash, employed ordinarily as local mana - ger of defendant's exchange at Beaver Crossing, and by W. C. Ewing, the company's local manager at Fairbury. When the canvass was com - pleted 232 farmers had signed contracts in which they agreed to take the ten-party metallic service at $18.00 per year; 26 agreed to the serv - ice and rate, but refused to sign contracts; 31 either refused to agree to the rate or gave no answer; and 15 or 20 were not seen. Following a number of conferences with the Commission, and after considerable informal correspondence, representatives of certain of the farm subscribers on May 20, 1916, filed the complaint herein. They al - lege that at the time defendant purchased the plant of the Fairbury Telephone company it assumed the contracts at that tims in effect with the company's subscribers, by the terms of which complainants were to pay the sum of $1.25 per month for metallic farm line service; that said farm lines were and are in bad condition; that in 1915 defendant falsely and fraudulently represented to complainants that if they would agree to pay $1.50 per month it would rebuild its entire farm line system by putting in new poles, install a new switchboard in Fairbury and give the best service possible, and that under such representations a number of the complainants signed contracts; that defendant has not rebuilt its lines nor has it installed a new switchboard, so that the service is no better than before; that defendant is violating the contracts entered into with the Fairbury Telephone company by raising their rate for farm service from $1.25 to $1.50. The petition asks that defendant be restrained from discontinuing service to such of the complainants as refuse to pay the $1.50 rate and that it be required to restore service to those who have been disconnected. A hearing was held at Fairbury on September 26, 1916, at which twenty-nine witnesses appeared in behalf of complainants. The testi - mony for complainants developed two main contentions, — first, that da - fendant's representative, Overcash, misrepresented the facts in his ef - fort to induce subscribers to sign the new contracts, and second, that the service, poor before the change, had if anything become worse sub - sequent to it. Condition of Physical Plant. With respect to the first contention, the testimony of the witnesses was very much the same. The statement of W. L. Shane is fairly typical of all. Mr. Shane said (Record, pages 54-55): A. — Mr. Overcash drove in the yard somewhere near 12 o'clock one day when I was cutting wheat and he says, "I suppose you know I am a notorious telephone man," and he went on to tell me what poor service we had and he said they were going to rebuild the line and make a metallic system and put in a new switchboard. That was one thing he talked very strongly about, and he made all sorts </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 151 of fun of the service we had now and said he didn't see how we could get service such as we was getting with the system the com - pany had, and be said they were going to put in thirty poles to the mile and a metallic system and a new switchboard and that we would not be charged any more until this was done. We were pay - ing $1.25 at that time and we would not be asked to pay $1.50 until after January 1st and by that time they would probably have the lines all rebuilt. Q. — Did you sign one of these contracts? A. — I signed one of those contracts. Q. — What kind of service did you have after they alleged that they fixed up the line? A. — I am sorry to say worse than it was before. Most of tha witnesses testified that Overcash promised a new switch - board, although some admitted that he said the old one would be im - proved. A few testified to some new construction which they had ob - served and most admitted the stringing of an additional wire. Their testimony is practically unanimous on the point that the company re - duced the number of subscribers on each line. In fact, that appears to be one of their points of complaint, Mr. Shane, for example, complaining that when there were seventeen on his line he could get all of his neigh - bors very well, but that after they cut the line in two and there were only eight on his line it was difficult to get those on the other line when they had to go through central. Overcash enters a flat denial of the charges made by complainants that he misrepresented any of the conditions or plans proposed by the company, and in explanation of the representations he made said, (Rec - ord, pages 176-177): A. — They misunderstood me all the way along; the only thing I said about a new switchboard was this, that after the company went into the town and rebuilt the lines and put them into first class shape to give the town people first class service, if they did not give the people first class service they would install a new switchboard and not until then; that is ail that was said about a switchboard, or the switchboard proposition, that the people in town would have to be governed by that themselves. Q. — Did you represent to any of the farmers, for the purpose of inducing them to sign contracts for the telephones and agreeing to pay therefor $1.50 per month, that the defendant telephone company would or intended to install a new switchboard at the Fairbury ex - change? A.— No, sir. Examined by the Commissioner presiding, he further testified (Rec ord, pages 180-181): Q. — You heard these men testify that they were told by you, a number of them, that there would be a new switchboard installed? A.— Yes, sir. Q. — Now, did you make no such statement as that to any of these men A.— I mada no such statement as that Q. Did you to any of them or many of them refer to a new switchboard in any manner? A.— Yes, sir. </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT Q. — Did you do that with most of them? A. — With a good many, they invariably brought up the proposi - tion of the switchboard and I told them that if the company ever went into town to rebuild the town they would probably put in a common battery system and that would call for a new switchboard. Ewing, local manager, testified to much the same effect, denying that he promised a new switchboard, but stating that he did say if the town plant was rebuilt it would be necessary to install a new switchboard When asked what promises he made, he said: "Well, I told them we would rebuild the lines and make them first class metallic and limit them to ten parties; that we would put in a multiple on the board to improve the service and I said nothing about a new switchboard. That was about the extent of it." J. E. Skinner, wire chief of the Fairbury exchange, had charge of the reconstruction work done by the company, and gave in detail ttitj nature and extent of the improvements made. He stated that the pole lines were all overhauled, about three hundred miles of pole lines being reconstructed. The old poles were examined and where found to be sound were reset. Where they were unfit, new poles or poles brought from other places were used to replace them, 1,100 such being put into the lines. Of the three hundred miles of line about twenty miles now have less than thirty poles to the mile, the remainder having from thirty to forty. In the change from grounded to metallic equipment and in the reconstruction of existing metallic lines, 210 miles of additional wire waa used. Approximately 60% of the telephone instruments were remodeled or replaced, those that were remodeled being sent to the company's fac - tory for that purpose. The wiring of each house was gone over so as to make it conform to the requirement for good metallic service. With reference to the switchboard, Mr. Skinner stated that one position on the local board was vacated and all the farm subscribers were put on one position, so as to be taken care of by one girl. The farm lines were then "multipled" through the board so each operator could call any farm sub - scriber without trunking. Previous to the hearing the Commission Instructed its engineering department to make an Inspection of the farm lines on the Fairbury ex - change and to make a thorough test of the service. Two such inspec - tions and tests were made before the hearing, the first on July 20th by Chief Engineer B. E. Forbes and his assistant, H. B. Couch, and the sec - ond on July 26th by Mr. Couch alone. In his report covering both of these inspections, which is a part of the record in this case, Mr. Forbes makes this statement concerning the condition of the farm line plant (Com - mission's Exhibit No. 1, p. 8) : "If the solicitor promised a new switchboard there is no appar- ent reason why he should, have done so and so far as the farm sub - scribers are concerned no benefit could come to them by installing a new board. In fact, the erection of new poles, new wire, installa - tion of new telephone, and a new switchboard would be absolute folly and a willful waste of capital. The company did do all that was reasonably necessary to furnish good metallic commercial farm serv- ice which the subscribers now have." </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 153 In his testimony Mr. Forbes, answering a question as to the con - struction of these lines as compared with other farm lines of the state, said: "I think it is the best I have seen; I don't know of any other farm lines where the per cent is as high as it is here In answer to a similar question, Mr. Couch, who has had over twelve years experience In the construction and operation of telephone plants, said (Record, p. 191): "It appeared to me to be of a very good class of construction and in a good condition of repair." In his investigation Mr. Couch gave particular attention to the type and condition of the switchboard. With respect to that he testified (Record, p. 194): A. — I found the switchboard apparently as well kept as a nsw one and in close detail it showed but very little wear, all the parts of the switchboard which show wear mostly to cause trouble is the cords, which seems to be apparently in very good repair; they are something which usually show wear oftentimes before they really give trouble. Their power apparatus is practically the Eame as a common battery plant; they have such apparatus that I do not think it would be improved even though a common battery board would be installed, so far as the rural lines are concerned. * * * It is a magneto multiple switchboard of the double clear-out type, and it has a busy test on the telephone, and in no way that I know of tould a board be more modern and yet be a magneto board. While few of complainants' witnesses were positive that no new con - struction of any kind had been attempted by the company, several ad - mitted that some improvements had been made. It was apparent from the testimony of a majority of them, however, that they had given but little thought to the matter and were not in position to state definitely as to the facts. In the opinion of the Commission the record is conclusive that defendant did make extensive improvements in its farm plant. It is possible that in their effort to persuade the subscribers to pay the increased rate the solicitors may have somewhat overstated the com - pany's plans, although it does not appear that they made any represen - tations with respect to the new construction that were not fulfilled by the company in so far as the equipment was designed to give the servicb promised. The farm subscribers are not concerned as to whether there are thirty or forty poles to the mile or whether the switchboard is new or remodeled. They are concerned as to the quality of service rendered by the company. If the service rendered is equal to that promised, the subscribers' requirements are satisfied. In other words, they are con - cerned with the quality of the service, and not with the equipment through which it is furnished. It now remains to be determined there - fore whether the service is adequate and efficient and whether it meets the promise of the company.

Practically every witness recited experiences wherein they had difficulty in "ringing central" and a number stated that they had found it impossible at times to put calls through, making it necessary if the message was important to use automobiles or teams for a personal visit to the person with whom it was desired to communicate. According to others, it was possible be - fore the lines were divided to talk to neighbors on the same line, but after the lines were cut in two it was difficult to reach neighbors if they happened to be transferred to another line, due to ihe trouble of go - ing through the central office. Several witnesses stated that the service had considerably improved during the last two or thre e months and others admitted on cross-examination that their difficulty was experi - enced following the February sleet storm when many of the country linss were almost completely destroyed. Two or three admitted daafness, but thought that hardly explained their inability to hear distinctly. Several confessed to taking the receivsr off the hook before ringing central, not - withstanding the company had issued instructions not to do so. Some of these, however, insisted that they had tried both methods at times without detecting any difference in results. While a portion of the complaints recorded by the witnesses were undoubtedly warranted by poor service, it is apparent from the record that many of these occurred during the period of reconstruction of the farm plant and following the severe sleet storm in February. That the service for a period of three or four months just prior to this investiga - tion was not adequate and efficient, is not borne out by this record. On the contrary the preponderance of evidence is to the effect that the serv - ice furnished by defendant is good and up to the standard of metallic farm line service furnished by other companies. As previously stated, the Commission through its engineering de - partment made two tests of the service previous to the hearing, the first being made by Messrs. Forbes and Couch with the assistance of two of the complainants, Messrs. Axtell and Benson. Under the direction of the latter, the Commission's representatives called upon the parties who were reported to be having the most trouble and from their telephones called other subscribers. One whole day was put in on this occasion. The results of the tests showed that the service for that day was excel - lent, this fact being readily admitted by Messrs. Axtell and Benson. In his report Engineer Forbes expresses this conclusion: "The above test shows that the service on July 20th was first class, metallic, commercial service and no reason was apparent for subscribers to report to the contrary. Mr. Axtell and Mr. Benson both admitted that the pole lines were in good condition and that the service was good on this day. and that they would have no com - plaint to make as to the service if the standard on July 20th was maintained by the company." (Commission's Exhibit No. 1, p. 4). This test was made with the knowledge of the company and Messrs. Axtell and Benson insisted that unusual efforts had been put forth to make the service good on that particular day. When this objection was </seg>

Accord- ingly, on July 26th Mr. Couch returned to Fairbury and spent another day in the country, this time visiting sections not visited on the first day. He was accompanied only by the driver of the automobile, who was not connected with the company in any way, and made his tests alone. In much the same manner as in the first instance. According to his re- port, he found the service good.

Precau- </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT tions were taken to keep any knowledge of the test from the company or any of its employes, and there is every reason to believe that these precautions were effectual. Twenty-eight farm subscribers were visited and from their telephones 128 other subscribers were called. Particular attention was given to the three points of complaint, — first, difficulty in signalling "central;" second, supervision of the service by the central operator; and third, condition of the lines as to distinctness of conver - sation. In addition, each subscriber visited and each subscriber called was questioned as to the quality of the service. The result of this test was substantially the same as the others. The service was found to be good. Indeed, with respect to the promptness of the operator's response to signal and her supervision over the calls, the service was considerably above the average. Out of the 128 subscribers called, there were six - teen failures to answer. In two instances, however, other parties on the same line answered that the person called was not at home. At several homes visited the people were away. It is obvious therefore that of the sixteen subscribers who failed to answer a majority were away from home or out of hearing of the telephone. In ten out of the sixteen cases, however, fhe operator gave evidence of close supervision of the calls by ringing two or three times. In a few instances the talk was a little faint, but in the great majority of cases the conversation was clear and distinct. Of the 156 subscribers visited or called, 97 expressed satisfaction with the service. As to the others, minor complaints were reported, only three or four reporting that the service was not satisfac - tory. Out of the 128 calls made, the testers reported 111 as prompt, clear and satisfactory. The remainder were not necessarily indicative of poor service, most of them being failures to answer or busy lines. As to the latter condition, the tester was delayed sixteen minutes in one instance by conversation between two women on the same line. This in - dicated that rsports of "line busy" by the opeerator were well justified in some instances at least. It was interesting in this connection to observe that both of the women who were parties to this conversation complained vigorously of the service when the testers called upon them. Defendant offered considerable testimony in defense of its service. The most important testimony submitted in behalf of the company on this point was that of Miss Bertha McNabb, chief operator. Miss McNabb's sincsrity, ability and experience were readily conceded by all parties. She was examined at great length concerning the operation of the switchboard and the methods of testing the service. She stated that a supervisor is kept on the floor at all times whosa duty it is to "listen in" on the operators to see that they answer promptly and to determine whether or not they continue their efforts to get the subscriber called in the event there is no answer. Each operator is drilled in her duties for fifteen or twenty minutes each day. Operators are required to cut in on a line after a call is made and ask "Do they answer?" or "Are you waiting?" and if it is found that the called subscriber has not answered, to ring again. Upon completing the conversation subscribers are ex - pected to signal the operator by ringing, but according to Miss McNabb </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 157 the majority fail to comply with this rule, making it necessary for the operator to keep cutting in on the line to learn when it is clear. If the subscriber rings the bell and pushes the button on the instrument at the same time the necessary signal is not given. One subscriber on each farm line is called daily for the purpose of testing the condition on that line. In this manner each subscriber on the line is called in the course of a few days. Seventeen operators are employed by the company, seven being the highest employed at any one time. Miss McNabb stated that the im - provements to the switchboard greatly increased its efficiency so far as farm line service is concerned. Bafore the beard was "multipled" it re - quired the services of two girls to handle each farm call, it being neces - sary to "trunk" each of such calls to the farm position. At the present time any of the five local operators can handle a farm call, so that the full time of all the girls is utilized during the peakload. Under the old arrangement the farm lines all centered before one operator, the others having to relay such calls to her from the other positions. Therefore, when the traffic became heavy the number of calls put through from farm lines was limited by the ability of the one operator to handle them, not - withstanding other operators might at the moment not be busy. With reference to the admissions of several witnesses that they usually ring central after taking the receiver off the hook, it is necessary to call attention to the fact that this is contrary to the instructions issued by the company. A card of instructions is given to each subscriber with the suggestion that it be posted by the telephone for ready reference. On the card are the following rules: 1. The receiver must always be on the hook when ringing. 2. To call Central. Push the button while ringing. 3. To call a party on your own line. Ring, but do not push the button. 4. To recall Central after you have just finished a conversation or when you want to ring Central again after she has answered the first time, give one long ring but do not push the button. 5. After you have finished a conversation always ring off by giving one short ring without pushing the button. 6. Report trouble promptly to the Chief Operator. 7. Six short rings calls everyone on the line. Manager Ewing explained that the removal of the receiver before ringing makes the ringing current weaker and less likely to throw the drop at the switchboard, which is the signal to the operator that a subscriber is asking for a number. Conclusion*. On the facts presented in this record, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the grounds of this complaint have not been established. It appears clsar that defendant did rebuild its farm line sys - tem at Fairbury and that, while it may not have used entirely new ma - terial, it did do all of the things necessary to put the farm lines in first class condition to give metallic service. It would have been an unwise </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT and unnecessary expenditure of funds to have junked all of the old ma - terial and replaced It with new. It was conceded by practically every witness that he would not object to paying $1.50 per month provided the service was efficient. It is apparent therefore that the representations made by the company's representatives with reference to th nature of the contracts. If the company did reconstruct its plant in such a way as to give th e service promised, the fact that it did not do so in exactly the manner described to each subscriber was not necessarily a misrepresen - tation. On the question of service there appears no room for reasonable doubt that the service at the present time, and for three or four months previous to the hearing, was efficient. No telephone service can be per - fect. There will be times when trouble will arise on the line from any one of numerous causes. It is very likely true that at the time the first in - formal complaints were filed with this Commission the service on the farm lines was poor and the objections raised at that time by certain of the subscribers were probably justified. The record indicates, however, that these conditions have now been corrected and that the company has reduced all causes for service troubles to the lowest possible minimum. In the opinion of the Commission the service as furnished at th e present time is efficient and an improvement over that furnished before the farm lines on the Fairbury exchange were rebuilt.

            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission This matter came on for hearing on a complaint filed by the Lincoln Commercial Club against the Union Pacific Railroad company, the cause of action, as stated in the third paragraph of the complaint, being as fol - lows: That said defendant publishes in its Freight Tariff No. 14,400, legally on file with this Commission, certain prescribed rates which said defendant is demanding, charging and collecting on brick, carloads, from Lincoln, Nebraska, to stations in Nebraska on the line of the Union Pa - cific railroad that are unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory in each and every instance where said brick commodity rates exceed the Class "E" rate as prescribed in the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion's Classification No. 1, in conjunction with specific Class "E" rates from Lincoln to points on the Union Pacific railroad as named in Gen - eral Order No. 19, effective September 6, 1914; that said Class "E" rates should govern in all cases as the maximum charge for the transportation of brick in carloads between stations in Nebraska. In defendant's an - swer to the complaint, as to paragraph No. 3, the following statement is made: "The defendant denies that Class "E" rate should govern as a maximum charge on brick between stations in Nebraska. The de - fendant further alleges that Order No. 19 specifically provides that it shall in no way modify, alter or change the rates in effect be - tween stations in Nebraska published as commodity rates on car- load shipments." Complainants offer in support of their complaint testimony tending to show that as a general rule all carriers operating in the state of Ne - braska make provision in their tariffs for an alternative application of the Classification Class "E" rating where such rates provide a lower charge than that carried on the specific commodity and carried in com - modity tariffs; that the Union Pacific tariff G. P. O. 14,400, which be - came effective on Nebraska intrastate business April 1, 1916, provides on page 95, section 2, — "If the rates named in this section make a lower charge on any shipment than the rates named in sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 of this tariff, the rates in this section will be applied;" that the rates named in the Nebraska Commission's General Order No. 19, effective September 6, 1914, for commodities rated at Class "E" (brick being one of said commodities), from Lincoln to certain statione on the Union Pa - cific Railroad company, make a less rate than the rates named by said defendant, on carload shipments of brick under its commodity tariff section of the above mentioned tariff. Testimony offered on behalf of defendant by the general freight ('.gent, Mr. C. J. Lane, tends to show that the rates on "brick in carload shipments from Lincoln to Union Pacific stations have been in effect for a "term of years;" that the defendant is willing to check in Class "E" rales on carload shipments of brick to all stations, thereby advancing «o'ne of the commodity rates and lowering others. The record contains the following testimony: </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT "Lincoln will have a few incidental raises, and she will have west of Grand Island in one instance, and Kearney in the other, a de pendable line of reductions of from one to 4.5 cents under at Haig, and she ought to stand some place, on Class "E" or our commodity tariff that was made for us seme years ago, and not want the frost ing off the cake. You, as a Commission are asking us to stand up be - fore the brick shippers of the central section of the state and others, and say you have the commodity rates which are reasonable, now give us a chance to say that to Lincoln." General Order No. 19 contains the following provision: "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the provisions of this order shall in no way modify, alter or change the rates now in effect be - tween stations in Nebraska published as commodity rates on car - load shipments." The above quoted language was incorporated in General Order No. 19 for the reason that the Commission did not desire to be considered as having passed on the commodity rates in effect on different commodities in that case, and for the further reason that the revenues of the carriers on class rates only were considered in the above mentioned hearing. A large number of commodity rates had been established by the carriers and the Commission did not desire to make an order changing the said rates until the carriers had had a chance to present their reasons why the commodity rates should not be reduced to the basis provided in Ne - braska Classification No. 1 and the rates as provided in General Order No. 19. In these proceedings such a case is presented for the considera - tion of the Commission, and we are unable to find from the testimony of the defendants any reason why the Class "E" rates as established by the Commission should not be applied as a maximum on carload shipments of brick from Lincoln to stations on the Union Pacific railroad in Ne - braska. An order will be entered accordingly. ORDER IT 18 THEREFORE ORDERED that the defendant, Union Pacific Railroad company, be and the same is hereby instructed to provide and publish in its tariffs alternative application which will establish as a max - imum the specific Class "E" rates named in General Order No. 19 from the station of Lincoln to stations on its line of railroad located in the state of Nebraska to which intrastate rates are applicable. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the provisions of this order shall become effective on or before thirty days from the date of this order.

OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: Complainants in this 'case are manufacturers of brick, with a plant located at Doniphan, Nebraska, a local station on the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company twelve miles south of Grand Island and thirteen miles north of Hastings. In paragraph three of the petition complainants allege as follows: "That the above named defendants maintain through joint rates on brick, carload, from Doniphan, Nebraska, to points on the Union Pacific railroad in Nebraska, located on main and branch lines west of Grand Island, Nebraska, that are unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory in that they exceed the rates charged by the U. P. Rail - road company on like shipments from Hastings, Nebraska, to same points of destination as referred to herein." At the opening of the hearing complainants asked leave to amend their petition to read, as to paragraph three, that the rates from Doni - phan to points east as wall as west of Grand Island should be considered. Defendants did not object to the petition being so amended and same was granted. Complainants have operated a brick manufacturing plant at Doniphan for more than thirty years. By testimony complainants showed that the rates from Doniphan to points on ths Union Pacific railroad on joint haul between the St. J. &amp; G. I. and the Union Pacific were established by the defendants as a joint distance tariff rate, applying on all classes of freight, both carload and less than carload; that Nebraska Classification No. 1 applied as to the rating and minimum weight, which at the time of the hearing was Class "E", and the minimum weight 30,000 pounds; that the joint class distance tariff schedule of rates just mentioned is now and had been in effect for many years prior to the time when the Nebraska State Rail- </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT way Commission promulgated its General Order No. 19; that the rates from Hastings to points on the Union Pacific were found by using the Class "E" rate, as promulgated by the Nebraska Commission in General Order No. 19 and Nebraska Classification No. 1, which provided, as here - inbefore stated, a minimum weight of 30,000 pounds; that the distance from Hastings to Gibbon is 28 miles; that the distance from Doniphan to Gibbon, continuous mileage via Grand Island, is 41 miles; that to points east and north of Grand Island the rates from Hastings were based on the same schedule and minimum weight as applied from Doniphan, the distance in all cases being thirteen miles farther; that the complainants had been unable to sell common brick in certain cities in Nebraska west of North Platte by reason of the competition from Hastings. Mr. J. H. Allen, for the complainants, testified as follows: Q. What is the general condition in that country at the present time? A. We took an order at North Platte for 300,000 brick and it was turned down on account of the difference in the rate; we took one at Gering for 200,000 and that was turned down; Oshkosh we took an order for 300,000 and that was turned down; ("happen, for 200,000 and that was turned down; Sutherland, three or four cars, besides other smaller orders from North Platte west on the O'Fallon branch, the Gering line, we had orders turned down at small stations from North Platte west on the main line running cut to Sidney. Q. (By Commissioner Hall) All the orders you have just re - ferred to were turned down on account of the rate? A. Turned down on account of the difference in the rates from Hastings and Doniphan. Q. And for no other reason? A. No other reason. Q. (By Chairman Clarke) Did Hastings get the business? A. Yes, sir. Numerous tables of comparison in rates on brick from Doniphan and Hastings were offered by complainants. Complainants contend that the rates from Doniphan are from 15% to 20% higher than the rates from Hastings on carload shipments of common brick. Defendants Defendants were represented by Mr. C. J. Lade, general freight agent of the Union Pacific Railroad company, and Mr. S. E. Stohr, assistant general freight agent of the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway com - pany. Mr. Lane contended that the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island and the Union Pacific are independently operated properties; that years ago Doni - phan was given the advantage of a continuous single line distance tariff prior to the time when General Order No. 19 was promulgated; that at the time General Order No. 19 was established joint rates and continuous mileage under that schedule were not established from Doniphan; that "this therefore continues the old brick rates of Doniphan undisturbed as found on page 308, item 3300, of commodity tariff 13,675. The basis of Order No. 19's Class "E" has been regarded by all lines that have dealt </seg>
            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 163 with this Nebraska situation as too low for a two-line haul, and the old distance rates were continued"; that Doniphan, by reason of its geographi - cal location, has an advantage ovar Hastings to territory north and ea.-t of Grand Island on the Union Pacific for twenty-five or thirty miles; that the rates from Hastings were based on a one-line haul. The Union Pacific Railroad Company is the lessee of the Hastings &amp; Northwestern Railroad Company, consequently the rates from Hastings were estab lished on a continuous mileage basis and one-line haul; therefore, Order No. 19 Class "E" rates and Nebraska Classification No. 1, minimum weight 30,000 pounds, applied on carload shipments from Hastings. The cause of this complaint is brought about by reason of the Union Pacific Railroad company having built a branch line of railroad from Hastings to Gibbon and operated as a part of their railroad in Nebraska. When General Order No. 19 was promulgated by the Commission, effect - ive September 6, 1914, it had ihe effect of reducing the rates from Hast - ings, while by reason of the rates from Doniphan to points on the Union Pacific being considered as a two-line haul there was no change in the rates from that station. The question of whether or not the Union Pacific and the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island are to be considered as one property is not definitely before the Commission and is not specifically passed upon in this case. In view of the fact, however, that ihe St. J. &amp; G. I. and the Union Pacific have for many years maintained a schedule of class rates applying with continuous mileage between stations on the two lines of railroad, for the purposes of this case it appears to the Com - mission just and reasonable to consider carload shipments of brick from DonipHan to points on the Union Pacific as though moving over one line of railroad. It is a well known fact that brick is sold on a very close margin and that a small difference in the amount of the rate would make considerable difference on a carload shipment, and further, in view of the fact that the defendants have established commodity rates on brick applying from certain stations en their lines of railroad to points in the state of Nebraska, it appears reasonable that the Commission should de - fine and establish a schedule of commodity rates applying on brick from the station of Doniphan to points on the defendants' lines of railroad. In considering the commodity schedules which have been established by defendants, it appears that a basis has been arrived at which is, generally speaking, 10% to 15% less than the Class "E" rates in effect prior to the promulgation of General Order No. 19. In the establish - ment of commodity brick rates, having in mind more specifically the rates from Lincoln to Union Pacific points, the same appears to have been established first to meet competitive conditions and then running with a greater spread of mileage than is generally contemplated In the schedule of distance class rates. In consideration of the testimony and the record in this casa, it ap - pears to the Commission that the complainants are entitled to some re - lief from the present adjustment of rates, and it will therefore order the defendants to establish a schedule of rates applying on carload ship - ments of brick moving wholly within the state of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT In consideration of this somewhat reduced schedule of rates, the Commission will order that defendants load their cars of brick to the full carrying capacity of the car. The carriers on their own motion have es - tablished commodity rates, and provided that cars will be loaded to their marked capacity except when cars are loaded to their full visible capacity. This provision appears to the Commission to be just and reasonable and same will be established on carload shipments from Doni - phan. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that defendants, the Union Pacific Railroad company and the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company, be and the same are here - by directed to establish and maintain the following schedule, which shall apply on carload shipments of common brick from the station of Doni - phan, Nebraska, to stations on the Union Pacific railroad, based on the continuous mileage via the nearest junction point, as provided in the Table of Distances, Part IV, sections 6 and 7, final order in General Order No. 19, promulgated August 5, 1914, effective September 6, 1914: shipments of brick from the station of Doniphan to points on defendants' lines of railroad shall be the marked capacity of the car except when cars are loaded to their full visible or space-carrying capacity.

Bush, Receiver of The Missouri Pacific Railway Company, Defendant. Appearances: For complainants, James H. Adams. For defendant, J. A. C. Kennedy. OPINION AND FINDING. Clarke, Chairman Complainants herein are manufacturing and business concerns and citizens doing business and residing in the village of Ralston, a manufac - turing suburb of the city of Omaha, located eight miles distant there - from on the Denver main line of the Burlington and eleven miles there - from on the Weeping Water branch of the defendant. They petition that the defendant be required to construct, 'ocate and maintain a depot, team track and stock -yards adjacent to the intersec - tion of its line with 77th street, the main north and south street of the village, and that it be required to maintain an agent at said station. Ralston is a village of about 500 inhabitants, is about seven years old, and has a $4,000.00 modern brick school house; a $35,000.00 system of water works, a general sewer system, electric lights and power; one and one-half miles of paved street; four miles of concrete sidewalk; a state bank with $75,000.00 total assets; seven manufacturing plants en - gaged in the manufacture of furniture, stoves, varnish, trucks, silos, serums and stock remedies. There are likewise located at Ralston two live stock concerns whicn feed and handle live stock on a large scale; an elevator and milling com - pany, and the usual number of retail establishments. The record shows that a seed company is engaged in the raising of seeds adjacent to Ral ston, that the surrounding territory is peculiarly adapted to the growing of tomatoes and that a canning factory recently located on the defend - ant's line between Ralston and Omaha will, if furnished reasonable serv - ice and facilities, ship large quantities from Ralston to its factory in Omaha. The record further shows that the Burlington road maintains three employees at its station at Ralston, and has done a business in freight and passenger aggregating $18,448.60 in 1916, $19,777.95 in 1915, and $26,405.67 in 1914. The above figures, however, do not truly reflect the total earnings col lected on freight originating or destinating at Ralston, inasmuch as they do not contain what is known as the advance or interline charges (i. e., earnings of other roads) and on interstate business only include the Ne - braska mileage pro rata earnings of the Burlington. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 TENTH ANNUAL. REPORT Defendants argue that the figures show a falling off in business and that they do not substantiate the claims of the complainants as to the prospective growth of the town. An examination of the record shows that the amount of carload business in and out of Ralston was 363 cars in 1914; 416 in 1915. and 413 in 1916; and that if defendant furnished the facilities prayed for the volume would increase. Defendants argue further that inasmuch as a number of the manu facturers are located on an industrial track served by the Burlington that they cannot expect to participate in or share their business to any considerable extent. This is undoubtedly true, but the furniture fac - tory is not so served, nor are the serum plants, the lumber yard or the live stock feeders and shippers. With the exception of the furniture factory, those not served by the Burlington industry track are adjacent to the defendant's right-of-way and will be served as conveniently if not more so by facilities at the proposed location on defendant's lines than by the Burlington. The record is convincing in its proof that a consid - erable volume of business, both state and interstate, originates on de - fendant's lines or can and will be diverted to it at connecting points, which shippers are now compelled to route or divert to the Burlington at Omaha, South Omaha and other connecting points. The record shows that the Burlington is doing a large L. C. L. busi - ness at Ralston, and while it cannot be expected that the defendant's business will aggregate nearly as much by reason of the large territory served by the former, it is more than likely that with facilities furnished as prayed for the class of traffic will exceed in volume that which is handled at many stations where defendant voluntarily maintains agents. The defendant has a depot and team track at Seymour Lake station which is three-quarters of a mile from the main industrial portion of Ralston. It is at present occupied by a section foreman's family and the freight room is used to house chickens. There is a heavy hill interven - ing between the town and the station, which together with the distance involves a drayage cost of 50% to 75% greater than wouM be involved to the proposed location. The present station grounds are located on comparatively low ground subject to overflow in periods of flood and is more or less unsightly. From the standpoint of accessibility and con - venience to the travelers and shippers of Ralston the proposed location is far superior, presents no serious engineering difficulties and can be provided at a reasonable cost. The volume of business done at Sey - mour Lake station affords no criterion of what might be done by the defendant at Ralston, inasmuch as the location, facilities furnished and the manner of handling the business all tend to discourage rather than develop any traffic. It is clear to the Commission that defendant's refusal to voluntarily provide the facilities prayed for is due to the rates obtaining on defend - ant's line, and the objection made by the business interests of Ralston to an increase and readjustment which was applied for by the defend - ant to this Commission and refused. A letter of the gemeral superin - tendent and the voluntary statement of the division superintendent </seg>
            <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 167 on the witness stand, to- wit: "You give us the same rates" (Burlington rates) "and you will get your depot; that is coming out from behind the bush," justifies the conclusion. The rate situation is under the control of the Commission and Is not a determining factor in the present issue where facilities alone are involved and should not be permitted to prejudice the complainants in obtaining the relief prayed for. Irrespective of the attitude of the defendant road, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the present facilities furnished by the defendant at Seymour Lake station are not reasonably adequate or convenient to properly serve the village of Ralston, and that defendant should be required either to move its station from Seymour Lake to a point adjacent to the intersection of its line with 77th street in Ralston or to erect a new depot, together with suitable team tracks and ade - quate stock yards for the receiving and delivering of live stock. While it is impossible to estimate the probable amount of business that will be tendered defendant at this point, the Commission believes and so finds that it will be sufficient in volume to justify the maintenance of an agent, at least for one year. Should the expectations of the complain - ants and the Commission fail in their fulfillment, defendant at the ex - piration of one year's trial period will upon application and sufficient proof be relieved from maintaining an agent there. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Benjamin F. Bush, Receiver of the Missouri Pacific Railway company, be and the same is hereby noti - fied and directed on or before July 1st, 1917, to provide and maintain at a point adjacent to the intersection of the Missouri Pacific Railway company's line and 77th street in Ralston, Nebraska, a suitable depot station together with team track and stock yards; provided, however, that the said defendant may at his option discontinue the station at Seymour Lake. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the said defendant ihall not later than July 1st, 1917, install and maintain an agent in the depot herein ordered until the further order of the Commission. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant shall on or before March 1st, 1917, file with the Commission for its approval plans ana specifications of the depot, team track and stock yards herein ordered.

            <seg id="p168">168 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 315. Charles W. Hinzie, Complainant, vs. Union Pacific Railroad Company, Defendant. Appearances: For complainant, Charles W. Hinzie, C. E. Harman, John Fitzgerald and E. Erway. For defendant, Edson Rich. OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Commissioner: In the operation of its double track in Nebraska the Union Pacific Railroad company maintains a rule requiring passengers to alight from and board trains on the right hand side, regardless of the location of the station buildings. The complainants would have the rule changed so as to permit the loading and unloading of passengers on the side next to the depot. Two complaints of a similar nature (F. 154 and 156) wera consid - ered by the Commission in 1912, at which time the Commission declined to modify the rule, but did order the Union Pacific to construct shelters for passengers opposite the depots at Lexington, Gothenburg and Central City, (Annual Report 1912, page 133). By stipulation of the parties the rec - ord in that case was made a part of the record in this. The testimony offered in this case is substantially the same as that presented at the former hearing. Indeed, thiTTecord made in the first hearing is more complete and convincing than is before us in the instant case. So far as the record discloses, nothing new has developed to change the conditions as they were found by the Commission five years ago. The criticism which complainants lodge against the present prac - tice of the defendant rests on two points. First, that the danger to peo - ple getting on and off passenger trains is much greater under the present rule than it would be if trains were open on the side next the station; second, that the patrons served by the defendant's passenger service are put to unnecessary inconvenience by the present rule. Unfortunately for the first contention, it is not supported by the evidence. Numerous in - stances are cited of narrow escapes and near accidents and of two or three deaths, the cause of which probably can be ascribed to the present method of handling passengers. The striking feature of this testimony, however, is that in comparison to the number of people handled in the passenger service and to the number of trains operated by defendant, the casualties have been remarkably few in number. Such a state of facts suggests one of two conclusions: Either defend - ant has been unusually fortunate in escaping serious accidents, or the rule in question is a successful measure of protection. Of the near acci - dents reported it is significant that serious consequences were averted in a number of instances by the timely warning of the unwary one by those alert to the impending danger. This indicates that the present method of operation has resulted in the education of the traveling public to the </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 169 necessity for caution and watchfulness to such a degree tnty those experi - enced in traveling on the road not only are on the lookout for their own safety, but are prepared to and do warn others. In other words, the ef - fect of the rule has been to make the traveling public fully alive to its own responsibility as well as that Of the railroad, a prime requisite to the safe operation of the railroads, whether 1 singU or double track. While it may be urged that the present method is so dangerous as to raquira extreme caution on the part of the traveling public, which ifl and at itself is sufficient grounds for its discontinuance, it should be rememberad that, the operation of railroad trains is, at the best, a dangerous business »nri particularly so on a double track railroad. Any rule therefore that tends to put the public on guard is a step in the direction of greater safety. It would appear from the two investigations made into this matter that that has been the direct result of the application of the present rule. The principal objections of the complainants at this t me, as they were in the former case, are that people desiring to board a train on the side opposite the depot must cross the track in advance of the in - coming train, and those leaving the train are required frequently to pad * around the ends of the train while it is still standing at the station, and thus place themselves in danger from a moving train on the other track, Manifestly, there is a large element of danger in this manner of getting to and from trains, but the small number of casualties resulting there - from is the best evidence that the precaution has reduced the danger to a minimum. It is by no means certain that a change to the plan pro - posed would reduce the probability of accidents. On the coiitrary, th0 experience and practice of railroads the country over indicates that it would be increased. In loading and unloading from the inside, people* in large numbers would of necessity be kept upon and between the traffics- Their attention would be centered in getting on and off the train and the 1 approach of a train from the opposite direction would be far less likely to be observed. It is urged in this connection that they would have the advantage of a clear view of the train in either direction, which is true, but, as we have stated, their undivided attention would be given to getting on and off the standing train, making it extremely likely that they would be run down before becoming aware of their peril. While there is a Strict rule that a train shall not pass between the depot and a train standing on the opposite track while the latter is receiving and dis - charging passengers, the rule is at times disregarded either through igno - rance or carelessness on the part of the crew, or the failure of the engine crew to observe lights and signals, or through the failure of the air brakes to operate properly. The consequences of such a train running into a crowd of people, at times consisting of several hundred, are too fearful to contemplate. One such catastrophe might cause more deaths and injuries than would occur under the present system in years. Fur - ther, what the Commission, in its former opinion in this matter, said with reference to the rule, is perfectly applicable here: "As an abstract proposition, no one would contend that it is not safer outside of the tracks than between them. It was suggested that one door be opened on the side nearest depot for the egress </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT and ingress of passengers, but this would necessitate a division of the train crew, consisting of a limited number of men who are made responsible for the safety and comfort of the passengers, as well as the handling of mail, baggage and express, and it must be conceded that it would be bad practice and almost impossible to discharge mail and express between the tracks. Baggage, mail and express men are frequently crowded for room and must arrange their loads in the most economical manner and space near the door from which it Is to be discharged must be conserved so the work can be correctly and quickly accomplished. To discharge passengers from one side of a train, and express, mail, and baggage from the other side would mean that the crew must be divided, and' schedules for the performance of its duties would not be uniform, but would vary according to the side of the tracks on which depots were located. Established rules are essential in the operation of trains, but it must be conceded thai the human element, on which the enforcement of such rules depends, is liable to err, and every possible precaution is necessary to guard against accident in case such error occurs." The fact that the defendant opens its trains on the side next the de - pot at Fremont, Columbus, Grand Island and Kearney, or other division or junction points, is justified by the explanation that at such stations strict yard limit rules are observed, engineers being required to bring their trains under control as soon as the yard limit is reached, which migfit be one-half mile or more from the station. They thus approach the station with caution at all times and regardless of whether there is another train standing at the station. The danger of running into a crowd at such a station therefore is reduced to the minimum. With reference to th e almost universal adoption by other railroads of the rule here complained of, the testimony in this case is the same as at the former hearing, and as the Commission observed in its opinion: "It is incumbent on the Commission to make a very careful in- vestigation by every possible method at its command, before ordering a railroad company to reverse a rule that has been adopted by all railroads and has stood the test of a quarter of a century's experi- ence." Nothing has developed in this testimony to change that conclusion. Surely a practice that has earned the approval of the management of practically every prominent railroad in the country, is entitled to stand until it can be conclusively proven that a better can be submitted. There is no such proof in this record. It is manifest that the method which requires passengers to cross both tracks and stand on the opposite side from the station in order to board trains, and which requires passengers getting off the train to either wait until the train pulls out or to go around the ends of the train, is much more inconvenient than if the passengers were permitted to enter and leave the train from the depot side. This is a disadvantage, however, which appears to be incidental to the operation of a double track railroad, and where it is a question as to convenience or safety, preference should in every instance be given to the rule that insures the greater measure of safety. It follows from the foregoing that the complaint should be dismissed. While the evidence in this complaint indicates that the agents are </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 171 more alert in giving notice&lt;of the arrival of trains than they were for - merly, there is still room for improvement. Some of the near accidents cited were due to failure on the part of the agent or operator to give any warning of the approach of the train, and in some instances they were due to inaccurate information concerning the arrival of the train. Safety would be insured and much inconvenience to passengers be pre - vented if responsible station employees would give better attention to this matter. It is a service which the company owes its patrons and one which they are entitled to demand and receive. We are of the opinion, therefore, that defendant should take steps to secure better compliance with its rules in this respect and we believe a bulletin calling the attention of the employees to the rule and its proper observance should be served upon every employee charged with this duty.

(SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 319. In the Matter of the Complaint of Otte Wilson, et al., vs. The Union Pacific Railroad Com - pany. Appearances : Mr. A. L. Sutton, for complainant. Mr. Edson Rich, for defendant. </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission This matter came on for hearing on the petition of Otte Wilson and seventeen others, fi'ed with the Commission July 10, 1916, praying that tha Nebraska State Railway Commission issue an order directing the Union Pacific Railroad company, defendant herein, to cause an opening to be made in the grade of the railroad company near the village of Water loo, of sufficient area to permit the flood waters flowing in the Elkhorn river to pass through said grade or embankment, and further to order the defendant's bridge erected over the Elkhorn river at Waterloo to be made of sufficient length that the river may flow under said bridge free from obstructions at the high water stage. The defendant's answer, filed with the Commission June 25, 1917, denies each and every allegation of the petitioners, except that it is a corporation which owns and operates a railroad in the state of Nebraska. A public hearing was held by the Commission at its offices in Lin - coln on June 15th, 1917, at which all parties interested were represented. The testimony shows that the Elkhorn river approaches the vil age ol Waterloo from the north and passes the town on the east side where It passes under a bridge erected by the defendant and continues in the same general direction to the south. The testimony further shows that the valley of the Elkhorn river is about two miles in width and com - paratively flat, and that the channel of the river was shallow, sandy and very crooked. The stream is subject to large floods, which exceed the carrying capacity of its natural channel, and at such times extends over and upon large area of adjacent lands, devoted to agricultural purposes. At different times in the past when the river has been out of its banks it has formed other channels in that locality and one of these, which is now known as the Little Elkhorn, makes its appearance a few miles north of Waterloo on the cast side of the river and extends south for a few miles and joins the main channel a short distance north of the defendant's bridge. This is not in fact a running stream and only carries water during the floods in the valley. A bluff bounds the valley three-fourths of a mile to the east of the bridge and extends north in the same general direction as the Elkhorn. Witnesses testified that the ground to the east and at the foot of this bluff was lower than the present channel of the river and the theory was advanced that at some time in the past this low ground on the east side of the bluff served as a channel to the river. In fact, water accumu - lates and stands at different points on this low ground along the bluff and one of the largest of these pools, which is a short distance north of the railroad company's embankment, is known as the Oden-Rider Lake. The record shows that the right-of-way of the Union Pacific Railroad company extends across the valley of the Elkhorn river in an easterly and westerly direction. The company has erected an earth embankment on each side of the present channel of the river. The embankment on the east side of the river is about 4000 feet in length and has an average height of approximately twenty feet. The embankment on the west side </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 173 of the said river is about one-half mile in length and for several hun - dred feet west of the river is about ten feet in height, gradually decreas - ing in height and volume as the line extends west. The defendant herein has erected a bridge across the river connecting with these embankments, which is about eight hundred feet in length, and consists of ten sixty-five foot steel girders and one one hundred and sixty-foot steel truss. The truss spans the deepest part of the channel and joins the embankment on the west side, while the girders extend to the east and join ths embank - ment on the east side. This truss and the girders are supported by ma sonry piers. The bottom of the girders is from seven to nine feet above the ground on the east side of the main channel, which is only occupied by the river at flood time. The testimony shows that at some time in the past the company maintained an opening in its grade at a point south of the Oden-Rider lake. The company also placed a large pipe opening in its borrow pit which extends east and west along the top of the embankment on the north side of the grade. Some distance north of the company's right-of-way, and extending in an east and west direction, a canal has been excavated from the river channel east to connect with the lake referred to. These openings appear to have been made to drain the territory in the vicinity of the Oden-Rider lake and form a connection with the river. No provision has been made to close these openings and it naturally follows that water flows towards the lake from the river when the river is high and the water in the lake is low. It also appears that the company at one time maintained a pile bridge joining the truss on the east and extending over part of the present channel now occupied by the steel girders. When the timber structure was replaced by steel, the piling were cut off at the ground level. Sub - sequent floods caused the soil from around these piling to be washed away and driftwood and other debris lodged among them and impeded the flow of the river under this part of the bridge. In the summer of 1916 the company removed this obstacle and placed loose rock around the masonry piers of the structure to insure its safety. The petitioners allege that these rocks obstruct the channel of the river under the bridge during the periods of high water. The complainants introduced a number of pictures of a flood which occurred in June of 1917. These exhibits show that the entire area be - tween the bluff on the east and the village of Waterloo on the north side of the bridge was completely submerged. These views also show that practically the same condition existed on the south side of the bridge. Other views were taken for the purpose of showing that the water on the upper side of the bridge was about ten inches higher than the water on the lower side. These views, however, were taken at the piers and no measurements at this point were introduced to show the difference in ele - vation between water above the bridge and below between the piers. Water would naturally rise to a greater height at the piers above the bridge, on account of the obstruction, than it would between the piers. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">174 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT and it is doubtful whether the water between the piers was more than six or eight inches higher just above the bridge than immediately below. Actual measurements were taken, however, at a point three-fourths of a mile east of the bridge and south of the Oden-Rider lake, which showed that the water above the defendant's embankment was standing at an elevation of three and nine-tenths higher than it was on the south side of the embankment at this same point. The record shows that a drainage district exists which includes the immediate territory of the Elkhorn for several miles above and below the defendant's bridge across the river. This drainage district has caused the crooked channel of the Elkhorn river to be straightened and made more uniform for a distance of eight or nine miles north of Waterloo and a corresponding distance to the south. However, a sharp curve or ox-bow occurs in the river channel north of the bridge at Waterloo. This part of the river channel is a mile or more in length, and the drainage dis - trict has not straightened the natural channel of the river at this point in order that the water might flow freely and unobstructed to the bridge. A sharp curve also occurs in the river channel south of this structure, which is a mile or more in length, and the drainage district has not extended its canal to join the bridge on the south side. The fact that the drainage district straightened the channel of the river for several miles north of Waterloo and made the section more uniform, has the ef - fect of bringing the flood waters of the Elkhorn down to the territory of the vicinity of Waterloo and north of the defendant's bridge in less time than it would naturally require. Witnesses testified that these floods exceed the carrying capacity of the old channel of the river and the water extends east and north, parallel to the river, over a large area. The Commission believes that the drainage district owes a duty to Its members and the residents of Waterloo to provide all the means within its power to correct this condition. The petitioner's engineer testified that the drainage canal should be extended south across the territory now occupied by the ox-bow to connect with the bridge, and he believed that this would greatly improve the present situation. The Commission, having all these facts in mind, believes and so finds, that the defendant herein, the Union Pacific Railroad company, should provide an opening in its embankment at a point south of the Oden-Rider lake and about three-fourths of a mile east of the defendant's bridge at Waterloo. The Commission does not believe that an opening at this point will entirely cure the condition complained of, but it believes that it will help the situation. The Commission also believes that the rock which the defendant caused to be placed around the piers supporting the girders on the east part of its bridge should be removed and that the foundation of the piers should be lowered to a point equal to the lowest point in the river channel, in order that the water at flood time may cut channels between the piers and make the bridge opening larger as the conditions may re - quire. </seg>

(SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 329 Hastings Ice Company, Complainant, vs. Chicago, Burlington &amp; QuLncy Railroad Com - pany, Defendant. Appearances: For complainant, W. H. Young. For defendant, W. W. Johnston. OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Commissioner The Hastings Ice company is a co-partnership composed of Myron E. Larkin and Horace M. Larkin, with its principal office at Hastings. It owns a lake at Ayr Junction, eleven miles south of Hastings, where It is equipped to harvest, store and sell natural ice. The lake is about fourteen acres in extent and the records show will produce about 10,000 tons of ice each year. During the season of 1916-1917 ice to the amount of 260 cars, averaging 30 tons each, was cut from the lake, 150 cars ot which were shipped at the time of the cutting, the remaining 100 being </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT placed in storage. The company has storage for 3,000 tons and can load, when cars are furnished, from 25 to 40 cars per day. The complainant avers that the present rates as charged by de - fendant for the transportation of ice are unreasonable and unjust in and of themselves and relatively so when compared with rates charged upon like traffic from other points of origin, particularly on the traffic moving during the months of December, January, February and March. The Commission is asked to prescribe a reasonable scale of rates to apply during the months just named. This complaint is very similar to the one filed in Case 241, N. S. R. C. 7th Annual Report 185, wherein the Crete Mills, operating at Curtis and Maywood, complained of the rates on ice in effect from those points. The Commission found the rates to be unreasonable and prescribed a dis - tance scale, which, however, was to be effective only during the months of December, January, February and March, and was made subject to a minimum weight of 60,000 pounds. Complainant in this case now con - tends that it is entitled to a similar scale applying from its shipping point at Ayr Junction both because the conditions are as favorable to a lowar rale basis as obtain at Curtis and Maywood, and because of the rates it has to pay it is unable to compete with the Crete company. While the quantity of the traffic originated by complainant is not as great as that originated by the Crete Mills, the other conditions sur - rounding the movement are much the same. Cars are handled by the local freight during the greater portion of the ice cutting season, although there have been times when a switch engine was furnished to complain - ant upon additional compensation to the railroad company. The cars are shunted on to the siding by the local freight crew and are "spotted" at the loading platform by the ice company. The crew returning in the afternoon takes out loaded cars and sets in other empties. While box cars are ordinarily furnished, slock and flat cars are sometimes pro - vided. As the ice is sold at approximately sixty cents per ton f. o. b., it has a very low value and the losses in transit as a consequence arc prac - tically nil. From the standpoint of transportation cost, ice as a com - modity possesses some advantages not common to other commodities which move at the same or lower rate. As we said in F. 241, supra: "The business comes at a time when other traffic on the road is light and as a consequence car equipment and motive power is avail - able. Ice can be shipped in either box cars or stock cars and the cars require no special preparation. In fact, the older equipment is usually assembled for ice loading, as it answers the purpose as veil as the newer cars or those in a good state of repair. With winter shipments time is not an essential element and if necessary o^rs can be held for several days to permit the assembling of a irainload. The record shows that the average loading at the two points is 66,000 pounds, which permits of the maximum loading efficiency of the equipment as well as its maximum earning capacity." The rates on ice now in effect from Ayr Junction are by no means uniform as regards gradation for distance. For example, Cowles and Lawrence, both 19 miles distant, have rates of 3 cents and 2.2 cents re - spectively; to Campbell and Trumbull, a distance of 23 miles, the rates </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 177 are 3 cents and 3.5 cents; to Hildreth, 40 miles distant, the rate is 3 cents, whereas at Aurora, an equal distance, the rale is 4 cents; likewise to Ong, a distance of 44 miles, the rate is 4.5 cents, as against a rate for the same distance to Wilcox of 3.5 cents. There are many other in - equalities, all of which indicate that the adjustment has developed with out any particular attention having been given to securing a consistent, uniform schedule. Defendant maintains rates, voluntarily established, on ice from other producing points that are lower than the rates complained of here and lower even than the rates proposed. For instance, the rate from Mem - phis to Omaha, a distance of 49 miles, is 2 cents; from Laketon to Lincoln, a distance of 129 miles, 5.5 cents (Ayr Junction to Lincoln, a distance of 108 miles, 7 cents) ; Laketon to Omaha, a distance of 136 miles, 4 cents. While differing conditions impair the value of these comparisons, they may be cited as indicating the belief on the part of the defendant that ice is a commodity entitled to a low rate basis. What the Commission had to say in F. 241, supra, with reference to car earnings, speed re - quirements, high minimums, loss and damage, and traffic regulations has, full application here and need not be repeated. Our conclusion is that the present rates on ice out of Ayr Junction are unreasonable and that plaintiff is entitled to a schedule of rates similar in all respects to that prescribed by the Commission in F. 241, subject to the conditions therein imposed.

Taylor, Commissioner: The complaint in this case wag filed in December, 1915. It sets up that the train service furnished by the Union Pacific Railroad company on its line from Norfolk to Columbus is inadequate, and asks that the railroad company be required to install a motor train and an additional freight train and that the work of the existing freight train be so ar - ranged as to permit that train to operate on schedule time. The train service on the Spalding and Albion branches has from time to time been before this Commission on complaints. As a result of one of these com - plaints a motor train was installed on the Spalding line, which is now in operation. A complaint asking that an additional train bs installed on the Albion branch went to a hearing. Subsequent to the hearing in the Albion case a conference was called .41 to 150 4.62 321 to 330 8.71 51 to 160 5.01 331 to 340 8.97 «1 to 170 5.20 341 to 350 9.17 .71 to 180 5.40 351 to 360 9.43 81 to 190 5.66 361 to 370 9.62 91 to 200 5.85 371 to 380 9.82 !01 to 210 6.11 381 to 390 10.10 391 to 400 10.30 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that during the months above specified. </seg>

The com - plainants in this case were notified and were present. The Albion com - plaint waa&gt; settled by changing the terminus of a main line local train from GraD|d Island to Albion, thus furnishing the patrons of the Albion branch (with the service they desired. At this conference complainants in this case concluded that their needs would be substantially met if the schedule of No. 30, the southbound passenger train, now running between Norfolk and Columbus, be changed so as to permit the departure of the train from Norfolk at 6:30 A. M. instead of 9:30 A. M. This would per - mit connections at Columbus for points east and south, which were much desired. At the conference it was also decided to try to arrange for connections at Norfolk, both morning and evening, with eastbound and westbound North Western trains whereby people living in the northern part of Madison county could get to and from Madison, the county seat, in one day. The Union Pacific was willing to make the change in its schedule as suggested, and on April 8, 1917, the new schedule went into effect. After the time of the train was changed numerous complaints were received by the Commission, protesting against the new arrange - ment. Two subsequent conferences were held, at which representatives were present from commercial bodies in Norfolk, Platte Center and other points on the line. While the earlier departure of the train is undoubtedly of advantage to the people of Madison, it apparently discommodes many other patrons in the territory served by the train. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the report of the Union Pacific as to the relative amount of travel since the time was changed as compared to the same period before the change. The figures as submitted are as follows: When the revenues of the train under the new schedule decrease from 25% to 30% and there is a falling off in the number of passengers hand- HiAKINlINUS U. f.

Perhaps one of the factors contributing to the failure of the new schedule to come up to expectations is the in - ability to secure connections with North Western trains at Norfolk. For reasons which it is not necessary to discuss, it was found impractica^re to insure these connections. This doubtless prevented a number of pe&gt; pie from riding on the train who otherwise might have used it. It is clear to the Commission that the old schedule should be re - stored, and an order will be entered to that effect. Such order, however, will be issued without prejudice to the issues as raised in this complaint, concerning which no hearing has been had and with reference to which the Commission expresses no opinion.

            <seg id="p182">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 182 Williams and other citizens of Curtis. No action resulting from the in - formal complaint, the Commission, on July 10, 1916, issued an order directing the Nebraska Telephone company to show cause why it should not connect its toll line terminating at Curtis with the exchange of the Curtis Telephone company, in accordance with the provisions of the statutes. At the hearing, which was held at Curtis on August 1, 1916, the Curtis Telephone company entered its appearance as an intervenor. At the time of the filing of the informal complaint there were two telephone exchanges at Curtis. One was owned by the Curtis Telephone company and the other by the Moorefield Farm. &amp; Ranch company. Ex cept for a free exchange of service between Curtis and certain nearby towns, no toll service was furnished by either company. Until the fall of 1915 the toll line of the Nebraska Telephone company terminated at Elwood, a station on the Burlington about forty miles east of Curtis. For some time there had been a demand by the people of Eustis, Farnam, Moorefield, Maywood, Curtis and other towns for an extension of this toll line. The Nebraska company had refused to make the extension on the ground that the territory to be served would not produce traffic enough to justify the investment. During the summer of 1915, however, the com - pany made a canvass of the field and its engineers prepared an estimate of the cost of the proposed line. This investigation developed the fact that the various local telephone companies serving the territory had a free exchange of service with each other. This free service covered a zone fifty to seventy-five miles in diameter. In view of the fact that from fifty to sixty per cent of the prospective traffic in that territory would originate and terminate within this free zone, the Nebraska company de - clined to enter upon the construction of the toll line unless the local telephone companies involved would agree to discontinue this free serv - ice and place it upon a paid message basis. A canvass of the various companies involved and conferences with a certain number of telephone users resulted in agreements being en - terad into by the Nebraska Telephone company and the companies operating at Eustis, Farnam and Moorefield whereby the latter were to discontinue their free service, in return for which the former would ex - tend its line and make connections with their exchanges. The Farm &amp; Ranch company, operating at Moorefield, also operated an exchange at Curtis, as we have shown, and the agreement covered its exchange at the latter place. The Curtis Telephone company refused to enter Into the agreement, but notwithstanding this the Nebraska company extended its line to Curtis. It made no connection, however, with either exchange at Curtis, but installed a booth in a hotel. The company operating at Stockville declined to enter into the free service agreement and the ex - tension of the branch line to that place was not made. Following the entrance of the toll line into Curtis there was a de - mand on the part of the telephone users for a connection with one or the other of the competing companies. The Nebraska company declined to make the connection on the ground that it could not connect with both companies and that it would not connect with the Curtis company so long </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 183 as it refused to enter into the free service agreement. At this point it should be stated that the Curtis company served about 400 patrons, where - as the Moorefield company only served about fifty. There was consider - able agitation for the consolidation of the two plants. At this point the Curtis company filed with the Commission a complaint demanding that the Nebraska company be compelled to make the connection with its ex - change, stating at the same time that it desired the question to be sub - mitted on the issues as shown by the pleadings. Upon the Nebraska company making a showing in its answer to the effect that it had en - tered into an agreement with the Moorefield company and that if com - pelled to make a connection with either it would establish connection with the latter exchange, the Curtis company withdrew its complain.. This was followed in a few weeks by the purchase by the Curtis com - pany of the plant of the Moorefield company at Curtis. Whereupon the Curtis company renewed its demand for the connection, but the Ne - braska company still declined for the reason that the Curtis company would not enter into the free service agreement, nor would it agree to fulfill the terms of the agreement it assumed from the Moorefield com - pany, in so far as it applied to the discontinuance of free service. We have now arrived at the point where it is necessary to determine whether the Nebraska company can be required to make the connec - tion demanded. There can be but little doubt that the toll company exercised a proper discretion when it exacted from local exchanges the condition with reference to the elimination of free service. It had reason to believe that the construction of the toll line would not be a remunera - tive venture, even under the most favorable conditions, for several years. It concluded, however, that if the extensive free service between ex - changes could be eliminated, the resulting revenue to a toll line would be sufficient to cover the actual operating charges. Results of operation of the portion of the line constructed hardly bear out this conclusion. The cost of the extension from Elwood to Maywood was $24,500. The toll re - ceipts for the first six months of 1916 from this portion of the line were as follows: Curtis, $241.90; Moorefield, $78.30; Farnam, $287.35; May wood, $112.35; Eustis, $335.55; Elwood (tolls to points west thereof only), $328.60; making a total of $1,384.05. Deducting the usual commission of 25% on originating calls leaves $1038.00 to cover expenses and. deprecia - tion. This would make an annual revenue of $2,076. Allowing 8% on the original cost of the property for maintenance and depreciation, we have left only $136 for direct operating expenses and nothing for return on the investment. This is the showing, it should be remembered, after the Nebraska company had induced all but one of the connecting ex - changes to discontinue free service. The revenue would have been materially less had the free service continued. It is apparent, there - fore, that wise business -judgment justified the company in taking the action it did with reference to the exaction of certain conditions before it would consent to make the necessary outlay of money for the build - ing of the line, and that so long as it was able to secure voluntary acquies - ence to its conditions it was acting within its legal rights. Equity would </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT seem to require, therefore, that if one of the exchanges refused to com - ply with the conditions the toll company should have the right to re - fuse to give it service. This is a matter, however, covered specifically by statute, Section 1, Chapter 79, of the Session LawB of the State of Nebraska, 1913, read - ing as follows: "Any telephone company, corporation, association, person or persons doing a public telephone business in the state of Nebraska shall take the calls or messages coming from any oih&gt;r tele - phone company, corporation, association, person or persons, and so switch and connect its wires that such telephone message from any point in Nebraska may ba delivered to any subscriber served by its telephone exchange or switched through, so that any message may be passed on to another exchange over such toll or trunk lines as may be available and designated by the exchange or switching sta - ticn where the call originated, regardless of ownership of such lines, and such telephone company, corporation, person or persons shall also take calls from its subscribers and public pay stations and pass such calls through its exchange toward destination and over the lines and the route designated by the person making such telephone call if there be competing lines existing between such points. Pro - vided, that in case the person making such telephone call, does not designate a route for such message, or that no competing lines exist between points of origination and destination, then the com - pany may by its operator at originating point make such destina - tion of route, but calls or messages must be switched through to destination if the point be reached by any connecting wires." This statute plainly requires that under circumstances such as pre - vail in this case connection of the toll line and the exchange must be made. The toll line now reaches Curtis. Through a booth in a busi - ness house it is partially serving the citizens of that community. The Curtis Telephone company has an exchange there. It has no toll faclll - ities and its subscribers can reach adjoining towns only by means of poorly constructed and heavily loaded trunk lines. Whatever the equi - ties may be as between the two companies involved there can be no argu - ment over the proposition that the citizens of Curtis and vicinity are entitled to telephone toll service and that under the statute as herein set forth they can demand it. The Nebraska company contends that by reason of its connection with the exchange at Moorefleld it is complying with the statute in so far as Curtis is concerned because of the connec - tion between Moorefleld and Curtis by means of a free service line. When it is considered that the line referred to is a farm line owned by an association of farmers and that toll messages passing between the two towns must be constantly interfered with by calls originating on the line itself, it is clear there is but little force to this contention. The connection plainly contemplated by the law is a physical connectiun of the toll line direct with the switchboard of the exchange, and not through intermediate lines used for other purposes. It is not for this Commission to determine what rights the Nebraska company may have under its contract with the Moorefleld company and which the Curtis company later assumed. Certainly, insofar as \t affects </seg>
            <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 185 the rights and service of the telephone public at Curtis, it can be set aside by this Commissfon. If the Nebraska company has suffered dam - age because of the non-fulfillment of this contract that is a matter for the courts. Wherefore the Commission finds that the Nebraska Telephone com - pany should make a physical connection of its long distance toll line now terminating at Curtis with the exchange of the Curtis Telephone com - pany, the expense of such connection to be borne by the Nebraska Tele phone company. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Nebraska Telephone com - pany be, and tha same hereby is, notified and instructed to connect its telephone toll line now terminating at the town of Curtis with the switch - board of the Curtis Telephone company, and to keep the same in service for toll business to all points in the state of Nebraska reached by the toll lines of, the defendant and its connections; that the said defendant fur - nish toll connections and service within the state of Nebraska with the ex - change of the Curtis Telephone company whenever there may be any toll line connection available therefor; that defendant shall at its own ex - pense connect its toll line now terminating at the town of Curtis with the exchange of the Curtis Telaphone company and furnish toll service there - on as herein provided; IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Curtis Telephone company shall keep an accurate accowut of all toll calls and make collections originating on its own lines, chargeable to its subscribers, on a basis of 15% com - mission on all outgoing calls and 10% on all incoming calls.

Beatty, auditor of passenger accounts; Lyman Sholes, G. F. A.; H. W. Truelsen, Traveling Agent; A. A. McLaughlin, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: On November 18, 1916, the Commission received an application, num - bered by the Commission Application No. 2954, signed by Mr. E. C. Blun - dell, superintendent of the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Railway company, in which the authority of the Commission was asked to make certain changes in C. St. P. M. &amp; O. time card No. 128, same to bs published in a new time card known as time card No. 129, same to become effective at 6:00 a. m., November 26, 1916. In the above mentioned application certain changes as to the lea« ing and departing time of train at certain stations was mentioned. On account of the time being short between the time when the application was made and the effective date of the time card, the new time card was not checked in detail against the old card, and on November 22a the Commission in its order in Application No. 2954 authorized the changes as provided in time card No. 129, same to be subject to com - plaint. On December 7, 1916, there was filed in the office of the Com - mission a complaint signed by duly representative officers of the city of South Sioux City, complaining that changes had been made in time card INFORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 4337 </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 189 No. 129, which reduced the service provided by said C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Railway company to the city of South Sioux City. Similarly, a complaint was filed on behalf of the citizens living in Dakota City, Nebraska. On December 6, 1916, the Commission entered an order, addressed to the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Railway company, to show cause why the changes made in time card No. 129, as compared with time card No. 128 as to the stopping of trains 10, 11 and 12 at the stations of Dakota City and South Sioux City, should not be cancelled and that said trains should be required to stop at said stations, as previously provided for in time card No. 128. The facts are as follows: In time table No. 128 — and speaking now especially as to that portion of the line over which the above mentioned trains operate between Emerson, Nebraska, and Sioux City, Iowa, — the time card comparisons are as follows: At to Train No. 10, — carded to leave Emerson at 3:30 P. M. with a flag stop at Nacora, regular stop at Hubbard, Coburn and Dakota City, arriving at Sioux City at 4:30 P. M. The following time card rule was provided on page 3 of time card No. 128: "No. 10 will stop at South Sioux City to let off passengers ticketed from Emerson and points west." The rule just quoted was not carried into time card No. 129. The ruu - ning time of No. 10, as shown by time card No. 128, was as follows: — Coburn, 4:03 P. M.; Dakota City, 4:13 P. M.; Ferry, 4:18 P. M.; South Sioux City, 4:19 P. M.; First Street, 4:26 P. M.; Sioux City, 4:30 P. M. Time card No. 129 provided as follows as to train No. 10: — Due out of Emerson, 3:45 P. M.; makes no stops at stations between Emerson and Sioux City except as provided in time card rule shown on page 3 of said time card, reading as follows: "Nos. 10 and 12 will make all station stops north of Emerson on Sunday." The running time of No. 10, as shown by time card No. 129, is as follows: — Due out of Emerson, 3:45 P. M.; Nacora, 3:55 P. M.; Hubbard. 4:08 P. M.; Coburn, 4:17 P. M.; Dakota City, 4:26 P. M.; Ferry, 4:31 P. M.; South Sioux City, 4:33 P. M.; First Street, 4:41 P. M.; arrive at Sicux City, 4:45 P. M. It will be noted from the above figures that the running time of train No. 10 between Emerson and Sioux City is one hour, as provided for in time tables 128 and 129. As to Train No. 11,— in time table No. 128 No. 11 is carded to leave Sioux City at 4:50 P. M., with provision to stop en signal or to leave passengers at stations First Street and Nacora, and regular stop at Hubbard. The running time of the train between Sioux City and Emer - son was as follows : —Leave Sioux City 4:50 P. M.; First Street, 4:54 P. M.; South Sioux City, 5:01 P. M.; Ferry, 5:02 P. M.; Dakota City, 5:08 P. M.; Coburn, 5:18 P. M.; Hubbard, 5:27 P. M.; Nacora, 5:43 P. M.; arrive Emerson 5:53 P. M. The following tima card rule appears on page 2 of the above mentioned time card: </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT No. 11 will stop on signal at South Sioux City and Dakota City to take on passengers south from Coburn and on Sundays will make stop at all stations." The rule just quoted was not reproduced in time table No. 129. Neither was the fact mentioned that said rule was to be cancelled in time card No. 129 in the application of the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Railway company, heretofore referred to. Time card No. 129, as to train No. 11, provides as follows: — Due out of Sioux City at 4:50 P. M. with running time and stop provisions the same as provided in time table No. 128 with the exception that Coburn is made a flag stop to let off and take on passengers, and Hubbard is changed from a full stop station to a flag stop station. It will be noted that the running time of this train between Sioux City and Emerson is the same on both cards. However, as heretofore noted, the time card rule quoted abova was not reproduced in time table No. 129. As to Train No. 12, — time table No. 128 provides as follows: — Due out of Emerson at 8:50 A. M. and carded to make full stops at all sta - tions between Emerson and Sioux City with the exception of Ferry and First Street. The carded time of the train was as follows: — Emerson, 8.50 A. M.; Nacora, 9:06 A. M.; Hubbard, 9:20 A. M.; Coburn, 9:28 A. M.; Dakota City, 9:37 A. M.; Ferry, 9:43 A. M.; South Sioux City, 9:44 A. M.; First Street, 9:51 A. M.; Sioux City, 9:55 A. M. Time card No. 129 pro - rides as to train No. 12 as follows: Due to leave Emerson at 8:50 A. M., making no stops at any station between Emerson and Sioux City. The carded time of train No. 12 at all stations in time card No. 129 is the same as shown in time card No. 128. The running time of train No. 9 between Sioux City and Emerson on time card No. 128 was one hour, carded to leave Sioux City at 8:16 A. M., arriving at Emerson at 9:16 A. M., and provided for no stops at stations Sioux City to Emerson with the exception that First Street was made a flag station. However, time card rule shown an page 2 of time card No. 128, provides as follows: "No. 9 will stop at all stations to let off passengers ticketed from connecting lines and on Sundays will make station stops north from Emerson." The rule just quoted is shown on page i of time card No. 129, so as to train No. 9 there is no change as to train stops between time card No. 129 and card No. 128. There was a change in the leaving time of the above mentioned train out of Sioux City. On time card No. 128 train No. 9 left Sioux City at 8:16 A. M. and time card No. 129 provides for leaving time 8:40 A. M. The same running time is used between all stations Sioux City to Emerson. CONCLUSIONS Counsel for defendant gives reasons for making the changes provided for in time card No. 129 as compared to time card No. 128 as follows: "The stops at these stations were eliminated for a twofold rea - son, the one appealing to the operating officials and the other to the </seg>
            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 191 traffic department. These trains, in order to make the schedule in force prior to November 26, 1916, were required to move at a danger - ous rate of speed between stations and were generally late in arriv - ing at their terminals, thus endangering and delaying interstate com - merce. The operating department approved the elim.nating of cer - tain stops in order to reduce the maximum speed between stations and enable the trains to make thejr scheduled tima without endanger - ing passengers and property." Dangerous Rate of Speed. — In considering this phase of the testi - timony, the Commission has limited its consideration to the trains oper - ated by the defendant between Emerson and Sioux City, inasmuch as the two complaining cities are located between the two cities just men - tionad. The "dangerous" operation of trains 10, 11 and 12 will be more specifically considered by the Commission, inasmuch as train No. 9 is not materially changed in time table No. 129, and for the further reason that there is no direct complaint against the present operation of said train. In the determination of ths question of speed presented in these pro - ceedings, it will be necessary for the Commission to make comparisons of passenger trains Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 and 12, being all of the pas - senger trains operated by defendant over tha track between Emerson and Sioux City. First, let us show here the equipment carried on the different trains. as shown in defendant's Exhibit No .) Train No. 1 Train No. 2 5 cars 5 cars 5 cars 5 cars 5 cars 5 cars 5 cars 5 cars Train No. 3 Train No. 4 Train No. 9 Train No. 10 Train No. 11 Train No. 12 From the above tabulation it is r&lt; ence in the regular equipment carried us consider the running time and the trains, as provided for in time card adily seen that there is no differ - on the different trains." Next, let number of stops for the different No. 129. No. 1 is carded to leave Sioux City at 7:40 A. M., arriving 1 at Emer - son at 8:42 A. M., one hour and two minutes for making the run of 29.1 miles, which is the distance, as shown by the time card, Sioux City to Em arson. Train No. 1 is carded to stop as follows: — Stops on flag at First Street; regular stop at Sioux City, Dakota City, Coburn, Hubbard and Nacora. The card provides time for this train between station: as follows: — Sioux City to First Street, four minutes; First Street to South Sioux City, seven minutes; South Sioux City to Ferry, one minute; Ferry to Dakota City, six minutes; Dakota City to Coburn, ten minutes; Coburn to Hubbard, nine -minutes; Hubbard to Nacora, fifteen minutes; Nacora to Emerson, ten minutes. Inasmuch as the equipment of train No. 11 is the same as train No. 1, it appeals to the Commission that it would be proper to compare No. 11 with train No. 1 as to running time. </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT Time card No. 129 shows that train No. 11 is cardsd to leave Sioux City at 4:50 P. M., arriving at Emerson at 5:53 P. M., one hour and three minutes in making the run of 29.1 miles, as compared to one hour and two minutes for train No. 1. No. 11 is carded not to make any regular stops at stations Sioux City to Emerson. There is provision for flag stops at First Street, Coburn, Hubbard and Nacora. The carded tims between stations is as follows: — 4 minutes, Sioux City to First Street, same as train No. 1 ; First Street to South Sioux City, 7 minutes, same as Train No. 1; South Sioux City to Ferry, 1 minute, same as train No. 1; Ferry to Dakota City, 6 minutes, same as train No. 1; Dakota City to Coburn, 10 minutes, same as train No. 1; Coburn to Hubbard. 9 minutes, same as train No. 1; Hubbard to Nacora, 7 minutes, as compared with 6 minutes for train No. 1; Nacora to Emerson, 10 minutes, the same as train No. 1. The question naturally arises in one's mind, how can the defendant company operate train No. 1 within a satisfactory margin of safety anil make all of the stops between Sioux City and Emerson, with the ex - ception of First Street and Ferry, and make the run in one hour and two minutes, while train No. 11 was considered dangerous with a running time of one hour and three minutes, as provided in t!ma card No. 128, between the same stations, and was carded to make a few«r number of stops. A comparison of train No. 3 with train No. 11 shows the following: — Train No. 3 is carded to leave Sioux City at 2:40 P. M., arriving at Emer - son at 3:45 P. M., running time one hour and five minutes, as compared with ona hour and three minutes on train No. 11. Tra'n No. 3 is carded to make stops at all stations between Sioux City and Emerson with the exception of Ferry and the further exception that First Streat. Dakota City, Hubbard and Nacora are flag stations. Train No. 3 has a carded running time of 5 minutes from Sioux City to First Street as comparad with four minutes on train No. 11; 7 minutes, First Street to South Siou\ City, as compared with 7 minutes on train No. 11; one minu e, South Sioux City to Ferry, the same as No. 11; 5 minutes, Ferry to Dakota City, as compared with 6 minutes on train No. 11; 9 minutes, Dakota City to Coburn, as compared with 10 minutes on train No. 11. From the above comparison it appears that, notwithstanding the fact that train No. 3 stops at South Sioux City and on flag at Dakota City, defendant company provides but 22 minutes for making the run from First Street to Coburn for train No. 3, as compared with 24 minutes for making the run from First Street to Coburn for train No. 11. Train No. 3 is expected to make ths stops at all stations while train No. 11 is carded not to stop at intermediate points. According to the record, defendant company undertakes to show that train No. 3 is operated at a speed that is considered safe and that No. 11 is compelled to run at a speed said to be dangerous. What we have said above applies to westbound trains. Now let u consider *&lt;&gt;r a few minutes the situation as to eastbound trains, Nos. 10 and 12. </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 193 Trains Nos. 2 and 4 on time table No. 129 are carded to make the run between Emerson and Sioux City in respectively one hour and five minutes and one hour and ten minutes, and to make stops at all stations as to both trains with the exception of the stations of Ferry and First Street, while the carded time of trains Nos. 10 and 12 between Emerson and Sioux City are respectively one hour and one hour and five minutes. Inasmuch as the equipment of trains 2 and 12, as shown on the ex - hibit heretofore mentioned, is the same, in the opinion of the Commis - sion it woukb be proper to compare the carded time of train No. 2 with trains Nos. 10 and 12 between Emerson and Sioux City. The above men - tioned card shows the following facts: — The running time on train No. 2 is as follows: — 13 minutes, Emerson to Nacora, as compared with 15 miii - utes for train No. 12 and 10 minutes for train No. 10. Nacora to Hub - bard, train No. 2 is carded to use 15 minutes, as compared with 15 min - utes for No. 12 and 13 minutes for No. 10. No. 2 stops at Nacora whils Nos. 10 and 12 do not. Between Hubbard and Coburn train No. 2 is carded to use 10 minutes; No. 10, 9 minutes; No. 12, 8 minutes. No. 2 stops at Hubbard while Nos. 10 and 12 do not. From Coburn to Dakota City, No. 2 is carded to use 9 minutes; No. 10, 9 minutes; No. 12, 9 minutes. No. 2 stops at Coburn, Nos. 10 and 12 do not. No. 2 is carded to use 5 minutes, Dakota City to Ferry; No. 10, 5 minutes; No. 12, 6 minutes. No. 2 stops at Dakota City, Nos. 10 and 12 do not. No. 2 Is carded to use one minute making the run, Ferry to South Sioux City; No. 10, 2 minutes; No. 12, 1 minute. Trains 2, 10 and 12 do not stop at Ferry. No. 2 is carded to use 7 minutes in making the run from South Sioux City to First Street; No. 10, 7 minutes; No. 12, 7 minutes. No. 2 stops at South Sioux City, Nos. 10 and 12 do not. No. 2 is carded to use 5 minutes from First Street to Sioux City; No. 10, 4 minutes; No. 12, 4 minutes. Trains 2, 10 and 12 do not stop at First Street. A comparison of train No. 4 with trains Nos. 10 and 12 would show substantially the same comparison as made with train No. 2 and trains 10 and 12. Train No. 4 is carded to meet train No. 31 at Coburn and by reason of this fact loses two minutes of the time as compared with train No. 2. If train No. 2 can be operated with safety between Emerson and Sioux City, the above comparison surely shows that trains Nos. 10 and 12 can be operated with equal safety and provide stops at the sta - tions of Dakota City and South Sioux City, as prayed for in complain - ant's petition. Relative to the question of the "dangerous" operation of trains Nos 10, 11 and 12, the record discloses the following testimony: Q. What is the fact as to whether you were required on these trains 10, 11 and 12, in order to make the old schedule and make the stops provided for, to run your trains between stations at a speed that appealed to you as being unsafe? A. It increased the speed of these trains from 32.4 miles per hour to 28 miles per hour average speed. (Evidently error; should read 28 miles per hour to 32.4 miles per hour.) Q. What does that mean, as a maximum rate of speed at which you would run between stations to maintain the average speed* </seg>
            <seg id="p194">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 194 A. That is the maximum. We would have to run gome down hill at a speed of 55 or 57 miles per hour, while making a speed of 20 miles up hill to 32.8 on No. 12 and 32.52 on No. 10, as an average speed we would have to make up and down hill. Q. Including your stops? A. Yes, including stops. Q. Now, when you speak of average speed of 32 miles per hour you mean from terminal to terminal? A. Yes, sir. A comparison of the carded time of trains between terminal points, where the question is as to the elimination of train stops at certain sta - tions, is not material. The real question at issue is what is the time con - sumed in making the run between stations where the stops have been eliminated. Time table No. 128 provides time for train No. 11 from Sioux City to Hubbard, the first station at which the train is carded to stop, as 37 minutes. Time table No. 129 provides 37 minutes for making the run from Sioux City to Hubbard, with no carded stops, while the same time card provides running time of 35 minutes for train No. 3 and 37 minutes for train No. 1. The last two mentioned trains are carded to make rega - lar stops at South Sioux City, Dakota City and Coburn. Superintendent Blundell testified that the heavy grades and sharp curves on the line of railroad Sioux City to Norfolk, with the exception of the approach to the grades over the Missouri River east of South Sioux City, was all south or west of Dakota City. South Sioux City and Dakota City are located in the valley of the Missouri River, and the track serv - ing said cities is practically level with but few curves. From the above statement of facts, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the defendant company has failed to show that trains Nos. 10, 11 and 12 should not stop at South Sioux City and Dakota City because cf tha speed of said trains. At to reasonable train service at stations South Sioux City and Dakota City. The greater portion of the testimony introduced of record goes to the question of passengers, originating or terminating at Nebraska stations, getting off or on the defendant's trains 10, 11 and 12 at South Sioux City and taking the street car across the Missouri River to Sioux City. De - fendants contend that this constitutes a direct interference with inter - state commerce, and unless the company attempts to prevent the use of their facilities as here stated, they are subject to prosecution. It is admitted of record that no passengers use the facilities of tilt, defendant between Sioux City and South Sioux City and there buy tickets on the basis of two cents per mile as provided by the Nebraska statute. The interstate journey, so far as the defendant railway com - pany is concerned, as testified to in the record, is performed by a street railway. The only question before this Commission is, what constitutes a rea- </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 195 sonable train service for the carrying of passengers to and from the cities of Dakota City and South Sioux City, and other Nebraska cities. The defendant has elected to attempt to correct this so-called illegal practice of interference with interstate commerce, by refusing to stop all of its passenger trains passing through said cities of South Sioux City and Dakota City which serve all the Nebraska territory west of Emer - son, and because, as admitted in the record, passengers living on the line of road Emerson to 0maha do not have occasion to go to Sioux City, propose to carry all the passengers originating and terminating at South Sioux City and Dakota City on trains operating over the line of road Sioux City to Omaha. In other words, a passenger living at any station south of Dakota City and south of Emerson can board the train and com - plete his journey to either Dakota City or South Sioux City without tut&gt; necessity of transferring to another train, while all passengers living on defendant's line of railroad west of Emerson must be inconvenienced to the extent of several hours' wait at the last named station in order to get to tbeir| destination when the same is Dakota City or South Sioux City. The same is true of passengers who desire to go to stations west of Emerson located on defendant's line of railroad, or its connections, who get on the train at Dakota City or South Sioux City. Such an adjustment of passenger train service tends in a measure to cause discrimination and gives passengers living on the Omaha line the advantage over passengers living on the main line and branches Emer - son to Norfolk. Exhibit No. 21, introduced by defendants for the purpose of showing that intra8tate passenger fares were being used for the purpose of ds - feating the interstate fares, contains some very interesting figures and has a tendency to raise the question in the minds of the Commission why South Sioux City in 1915 should show such a small number of passengers purchasing tickets at that station as compared to the stations of Oak - land, Ponca and Randolph, cities of approximately the same population as that of South Sioux City. For the period February 1st to October 31st, 1915, the figures are as follows: The above figures clearly show that for some reason the number of passengers purchasing tickets at South Sioux City in 1915 was from three to four times less per unit of population than the number of passengers buying tickets at Oakland, Ponca or Randolph. The record shows that there was a material increase in the number of passengers purchasing tickets at South Sioux City for the same period mentioned above in the year 1916 as compared to 1915, but there still remains this unexplained difference in the number of passengers purchasing tickets at South Sioux City in the period of 1915. It was not shown of record that South Sioux South Sioux City . Oakland Ponca Randolph Population 1196 1073 1000 1137 Number of Passengers 4025 14751 10045 9766 Revenue % 2593.48 12610.41 6605.12 9761.39 </seg>
            <seg id="p196">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 196 City has any materially different class of population than that located at the cities of Oakland, Ponca and Randolph. It may be admitted, for the purpose of this opinion, that some pas - sengers to purchase tickets from Nebraska stations to South Sioux City who immediately avail themselves of the street car service between South Sioux City and Sioux City for the purpose of completing an interstate journey, and vice versa; however, this fact alone certainly would not justi - fy the defendant in so arranging its train schedules so as not to furnish reasonable service to patrons located at South Sioux City and Dakota City. We have already shown that, so far as the dangerous operation or trains is concerned, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the taking out of the stops of trains Nos: 10, 11 and 12 at Dakota City and South Sioux City is not necessary for the safe operation of said trains. We further find from the testimony of record and all of the facts sub - mitted for the Commission's consideration in this case that the cancel - lation of the stop provision, as shown in time card No. 129 as to the sta - tions of South Sioux City and Dakota City, does not provide said cities with a reasonable passenger train service between said cities of South Sioux City and Dakota City and Nebraska stations west and north of Emerson. It would therefore appear, and the Commission so finds, that the de - fendant company should be required to provide in its time card No. 129, supplements thereto and reissues thereof, at least one passenger train each way a day operated over the line of railroad between South Sioux City and Norfolk and not less than one passenger train each way a day over the line of railroad South Sioux City to Omaha. From the testimony introduced of record the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the needs of the traveling public will best be served by defendant company being required to stop its trains Nos. 11 and 12 at Dakota City and South Sioux City. The Commission further finds that if the defendant company elect* la stop but one train each way a day operated over its line of road be - tween South Sioux City and Omaha, instead of two trains each way a day on the line of road just mentioned, the defendant company may make ap - plication to the Commission to change its time card No. 129 and discon tinue the stopping of the trains that it may select at South Sioux City and Dakota City; provided, however, that the trains so selected to make tha stops at said cities shall best serve the necessities and conveniences of the people at South Sioux City and Dakota City. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com mission tha^ the defendant herein, C. St. P. M. &amp; O.

APPLICATION NO. 2055 In the Matter of the Application of the Hazard Telephone Company for Authority to Issue $2175 of Common Stock. Appearances : For applicant, Hiyo Aden, President; C. W. Trumble, Secretary. ORDER AND FINDING By the Commission: This matter came on for consideration by the Commission without a formal hearing. The applicants represent to the Commission, orally and by a statement of its assets and liabilities, that the said company has an outstanding capitalization of $3150.00 and an authorized capital! zation of $3200.00, leaving $50.00 that has been authorized unsold. It now applies to the Commission for authority to issue additional common stock in the amount of $1,500.00. The company shows to the Commission that the assets of the com - pany have been gradually built up out of the opsrating income until they now show a book value of $6502.32; that for the past three years all of the operating income above operating expenses has been put back into the plant and that no dividends have been paid to the stockholders of the company; that prior to the said three years the company paid out 8% dividends to its stockholders, except for the first year of the company there was a 25% dividend paid on a portion of the capital investment, which amounted to about $600; that upon the first year's investment of the company no dividends were paid at all. The company now asks for authority of the Commission to issue and sell the $1500 of common stock above referred to for the purpose of placing itself in a position to buy an exchange building should occasion require, and for the purpose of making further investment of $200 in a portion of a line of a compet - ing company in that territory, and for the purpose of retiring approxi - mately $400 of present outstanding indebtedness. </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT The Commission is of the opinion that the application herein is reasonable and that the authority of the Commission should be granted, subject to the following conditions: — That before any of the proceeds of the said $1500 of common stock be invested in additional properties the company shall submit to the Commission the plans and specifications of said properties, detailed inventories of the same, and cost data, that the Commission may pass upon the value of the properties so purchased. that the applicant will further make a showing to the Commission o( the retirement of the $400 of outstanding indebtedness; and further, that the applicant shall set aside as a maintenance and depreciation reserve fund out of the operating income not less than 8% annually upon all authorized capitalization outstanding. The Commission is further of the opinion that stock should be issued to the applicant herein for the amount of operating income that has been invested in the plant for extensions and betterments in lieu of dividends for the past three years. At 7% upon the $3150 now outstanding it would amount to $661.50. This added to the $1500 will make the total issue authorized by this order amount to $2161.50. The Commission is further of the opinion that in issuing the last amount referred to, which is $661.50, that the present stockholders shall be given the option of taking stock in lieu of the dividends that they have not received for the past three years, and if it should be impracticable to make the proper apportionment of the stock then the company may exer - cise the privilege of selling the stock to purchasers in denominations of $25.00 per share and apply the proceeds to the payment of dividends to (he btockholders as above set out.

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 19th day of March, 1917. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, T. L. Hall, Chairman. Attest: T. A. Browne, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 2293 In the matter of the Application of the Cedar County Farmers Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Its Exchange Rates. Appearances: For Applicant, J. D. Clair Smith. For the Rural Renters, A. H. Cressy and E. Burgel. SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND OPINION Taylor, Commissioner: The original application in this matter was filed on January 15, 1915, and prayed for a uniform increase of 25 cants on all classes of service on the Hartington and Fordyce exchanges, which constitute the system of the Cedar County Farmers Telephone company. Through an agreement entered into with the authorities of the city of Hartington, the company withdrew that portion of its application re - ferring to residence subscribers within the city of Hartington. The ordi - nance granting the company a franchise in that city limited the rates for service to $1.50 for business and $1.00 for residence telephones. The ordinance was amended by the city to permit the increase of 25 cents on the business telephones, in return for which the company withdrew Its request for an increase on the residence telephones. After a hearing, at which considerable testimony was taken concern - ing the financial condition of the applicant, the Commission on May 15, 1916, issued an order granting an increase of 50 cents per month on business and farm telephones, at the same time approving a request for permission to make a discount of 25 cents per month to all subscribers paying their rental by the 10th of the current month. Objections were made by the farm subscribers to the proposed increase, — first, on the ground that it was not warranted, and second, that the increase was a discrimination against the farmers and in favor of the residence sub - scribers whose rates had not been increased. Whereupon, the company applied for a suspension of the order, at the same time renewing its ap - plication for an increase of 25 cents on residence telephones in Harting - ton and Fordyce. On June 5, 1916, the Commission issued a supplemental </seg>
            <seg id="p200">200 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT order suspending its original order until a rehearing could b3 had. This rehearing was had on June 29, 1916. A complete recital of the financial h story of the company was given in the original order and it is not necessary to repeat it here. In addition to a desire to remove any grounds for discrimination as between the vari - ous classes of subscribers, the company asks for an increase for all subscribers because it contends that since the filing of the original appli - cation its expenses have been materially increased so that tha present revenues are not sufficient to pay all the operating expenses, maintain the property and pay a reasonable return on the investment. Applicant's contention as to an increase in its expenses is borne out by the record. Its showing in that respect, which is not disputed by protestants, is as fol'ows: Annual Increase Chief lineman's salary, increased from $60.00 to $70.00 $ 120.00 Second lineman's salary, Increased from $50.00 to $60.00 120. 00 Additional operator at Fordyce, $30.00 per month 360.00 Additional operator at Hartington, $30.00 per month 360.00 Salaries of three operators at Hartington, increased from $87.50 to $102.50 180.00 Salary of five directors at $2.00 per meeting 60.00 Total $1200.00 There appears to be no reason for &lt;iuesi on ing the necessity of these added expenditures. As a matter of fact, a portion of them are occa - sioned by the original order of this Commission. In that order the Com - mission found that the switchboard at Hartington was not large enough and that not a sufficient number of operators ware being employed to handle the traffic in a manner to give efficient service. The company was therefore required to purchase new equipment for the switchboard and to employ another operator. This portion of the order was complied with, notwithstanding the increase of rates did not become effective. The addition of the second operator at the Fordyce exchange was occa - sioned by the demand of the subscribers at that place for a full 24-hour service. After careful consideration of the situation the company con - cluded that the demand of the subscribers was a reasonable one and pro - ceeded to comply with it. At the annual meeting of the stockholders in January, 1916, it was decided to pay the five directors of the company $2.00 for each meeting which they attended, up to a maximum of six for the year. They had received no compensation up to that time. The In - creases in the salaries of the linemen appear to be reasonable and were granted because the company was of the opinion that the men were en - titled to greater compensation. This applies also to the increases granted the three operators at Hartington. None of the salaries- paid are exorbi - tant nor in excess of what is required to secure competent, experienced help. The added expense authorized by the company largely goes into the production of a broader and better service to the patrons. In its original order the Commission used the financial statement of the company to this Commission tor the year ending June 30, 1916. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 201 This report was compiled by Mr. J. D. Clair Smith, who became manager of the company in the year 1914. Up to the time Mr. Smith assumed the management, the records of the company were indifferently kept and it was difficult to arrive at figures that truly reflected the actual operating conditions. Mr. Smith introduced a new system of accounting, which was still in process of adjustment at the time the figures used in the original order were compiled. The figures for the year 1916, therefore, should be more reliable and for that reason the Commission uses them. The earnings and expenses for the year ending June 30, 1916, as shown by the annual report, constitute the basis for the following statement, readjustments having been made as to maintenance and depreciation and dividends, as will be explained later: Operating Statement for Year Ending June 30, 1916. $ 1,231.03 Dividends (7% on $16,304) 1,141.28 $ 89.75 There is considerable discrepancy between the revenue shown for toll service for the year 1916 and for the year 1915. This is explained EARNINGS Toll service $ 693.73 Subscribers' service 9,443.63 Switching service 178.75 Sundry sales 9.53 Miscellaneous earnings 17.99 $10,343.63 Operation $2,081.25 Stationery and advertising 234.05 Light, heat, water, power 140.92 Rent of buildings 92.50 Incidental 25.09 Pole attachments 15.50 $2,589.31 Salaries of officers $ 975.00 Salaries of clerks 172.50 Fxpense of collection 34.61 Insurance 24.25 1,206.36 Maintenance and depreciation (9% on $54,298) _ 4.886.82 8,682.49 Net operating income Taxes $ 223.24 Uncollectible accounts (2% of $10,343.63). . 206.87 $1,661.14 430.11 </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT by the fact that the company reports its gross toll revenue, deducting from the net operating income of the company the toll commissions paid to other companies. The amount of $693.73, as shown in the above state - ment, is the net earning from toll to the company for the year 1916, and is the full amount that should be credited to the gross earnings of th«j company from that source. It should be stated here also that the figure given for revenue from subscribers' service is the gross figure that would accrue if the full charges were collected from all the subscribers in service for the year. The amount given in the previous statement was the result of the actual collections only. Testimony submitted by the company indicates that the amount allowed by the Commission (2% on )10,343.63) probably will not cover the actual losses from uncollectible accounts in this company. It is very probable that if the full amount of these losses were taken into consideration that the statement for the year 1916 would show a small deficit without taking into consideration the increase in the expenses. When allowance is given to the increase in the expenses there is a deficit of between $900 and $1,000. In this connection we are eliminating the increases in the salaries of linemen for the reason that the 9% on the reproduction new value of the property contemplates adequate salaries to all employes engaged in the maintenance department. This leaves at least $960 of annual expense, however, which must be provided for out of the earnings of the company. But a very small portion of this in - crease is included in the 1916 statement for the reason that practically all of the changes referred to were made in the spring and summer, too late to be reflected in these figures. With reference to the allowance for dividends, we have used in the above statement the figure of $16,304 as the basis of the stockholders' actual cash investment in the property. In the original order we al - lowed $20,000 for the investment. Objection has been raised, however, to any allowance for services donated by stockholders in the early his - tory of the company, credit for which was given in the figure of $20,000. The amount of $16,304 is arrived at by adding the capital stock of $9700.00, all of which, according to the record, was paid for in cash, the outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3500.00, and unpaid divi - dends for four years, amounting to $3,104.00, this money being permitted by the stockholders to remain in the property. The record in the original case contains considerable testimony to the effect that a large amount of service was contributed by the stockholders in the early days of the company, particularly during the first two years. No definite figures were given by the company, however, as to the amount of this donated serv - ice and for the purposes of this case no attempt will be made to estimate it. It is apparent from the foregoing figures, therefore, that the com - pany is at the present time operating at a substantial deficit. There is reason to believe from the record that this deficit will increase rather than decrease. In our original order in this case we recommended to tba company that it should reduce the number of subscribers per line </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 203 on its farm lines so as to improve the service to farm subscribers. At the present time these lines are heavily overloaded. The reconstruction of these lines will call for a considerably larger investment and a cor - responding increase in the cost of maintenance and depreciation. It Is apparent that the company has been operated for some time on a very economical basis. It shows no expense for traveling, notwithstanding the officers of the company have found it necessary to make a number of trips to Lincoln and other points in the interest of the company, nor is any expense shown for legal services, these having bsen contributed in the past by the president of the company, who is an attorney and who has received no compensation. The manager of the company ex - pressed the opinion that the business at the present time demands con - siderable legal service and that it should be in a position to pay for the same. The salary of $900 per year paid to the manager of the com - pany is low compared to that paid by many other companies in the state and it will doubtless have to be increased in the future. A uniform increase of 25 cents per month as applied for by the com - pany would produce an added revenue of $2,172 per year. It would ap - pear that for the present at least this increase is hardly necessary. The Commission is of the opinion that an increase of 25 cents per month on business telephones and an increase of 15 cents per month on farm and residence telephones would produce sufficient revenue and at the same time maintain the relation between the various classes of service on a basis that is not discriminatory. Such rates would produce an added in - come of approximately $1,398.00. This will take care of the present deficit and provide, in a measure at least, for the increased 1 expense which the company may reasonably expect in the near future. We are of the opinion, however, that any surplus above the expense of opera - tion, cost of maintaining the property, and dividends on the actual in - vestment, should be set aside for the improvement of the service and betterment of the property. We are further of the opinion that the company should be required, within a reasonable time, to reconstruct its farm lines so as to reduce the number of subscribers to a maximum of ten to the line. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Cedar County Farmers Telephone company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to charge and collect the following schedule of rates for its exchanges at Hartington and Fordyce: Business $2.00 per month Residence 1.40 per month Farm 1.40 per month Extension telephones 75 per month Note: A discount of 25 cents will be allowed from the above rates when rental Is paid on or before the tenth of the month in which it falls due.

Clements OPINION AND FINDING Clarke, Chairman: The application herein recites that the installation of an electric light plant in the town of Elmwood. together with the existing tree con - ditions and the physical condition of the property, render it necessary for it to rebuild its plant and change from a grounded service system to a metallic system in the town: that the existing farm lines have an un- </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 205 limited number on each line, and that it desires to rebuild said lines on a ten-party basis. The evidence shows that the exchange was built about 19U3; that about three and a half years prior to the filing of this petition applicant purchased the exchange for approximately $15,000.00 and had since ex - pended $1624.27 in additions and betterments; that the estimated cost of changing to a metallic cabled system in the village and rebuilding its farm lines to a ten-party-line basis will aggregate from $7,000 to $8,000. The engineer of the Commission, after an examination of the prop - erty, reports in part as follows: "The plant as a whole is about twelve years old and the results of natural depreciation make it necessary to rebuild the entire ex - change in the near future. The town pole lines and wire are in need of immediate reconstruction. The usual growth of trees along the streets requires that the open wire construction now in use shall be replaced with cable to avoid the numerous grounds affected by the contact of the wire and the trees. "The tree condition and the fact that the telephone circuits are grounded are especially important in view of the fact that an elec - tric light and power plant was completed in Elmwood about six months ago, and is now in operation. "The voltage of the primary lines of the light and power company is 2300 and the primary circuits extend through the business district and well into the residence sections of the village. It follows that where these transmission lines parallel the grounded telephone cir - cuits the telephone service suffers from induction. "The rebuilding of the town telephone property being necessary, the necessity of erecting cable is obvious for the above reasons. "There are 205 stations on 16 farm lines, making an average of 13 stations to the line. Some of these lines carry as many as 11 stations. This condition makes good service on the farm lines im - possible and the telephone company's plan to erect new lines and re - duce the stations per line to 10 or less is very necessary. The farm lines in general will be improved by rebuilding." He further adds that a conservative estimate of the fair value of the property when rebuilt, including the existing office building and real es - tate, would approximate $20,500.00. Under such circumstances the appli - cation to install a metallic service cable system in the village cannot properly be denied. The reasonableness of the existing rates and those proposed remain for determination. The cost of operating the exchange for the year prior to the hear - ing, exclusive of current maintenance and repairs charged to reserve (ag - gregating $1429.81) and including $42.10 of uncollectible accounts, which in the statement of earnings are treated as collected, aggregate $2061.73. There is no reason *o expect that the direct operating expenses of the re - built exchange will be less. The Commission has uniformly allowed from 8"^ to 9°; of the value of properties of this character for current maintenance and depreciation, and has likewise found a return of seven per cent on fair value to be reasonable. </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT Accepting its engineer's value of $20,500 as a basis, the company should be entitled to earn sufficient to meet the following charges Direct operating expense $2,061.73 8% allowance for current maintenance and depreciation on $20,500 1,640.00 7% return on $20,500 1,435.00 Total - $5,136.73 The present earnings of the exchange, crediting it with the statutory 25% of toll earnings, aggregate $4267.26, and fall far short of meeting the requirements of the reconstructed exchange. The schedule of rates which petitioner submits for approval con- form to and are identical with the rates previously found by the Com- mission to be reasonable in exchanges of like size and character to ex- change proposed. They are as follows: Individual business $30.00 per year Individual residence 18.00 per year Two-party residence - 15.00 per year Farm lines, ten parties on a line, each 15.00 per year Additional charge outside of city limits where there is an existing pole line, for each quarter mile or fraction thereof, one party 5.00 per year Two-party 3.00 per year Extra service, business, two parties using same phone „ 12.00 per year Extension sets 12.00 per year Extension sets (special wall) residence only 6.00 per year Extension bells _ 3.00 per y«ar The above rates are for metallic service, excepting farm lines. The estimated yearly revenue of the exchange under the above schedule is $5,403.35. If correct, this would provide a surplus of $266.62 over the estimated requirements. In view of the fact that the engineer's estimate is admittedly conserv- ative, is several thousand dollars less than the capital investment plus cost of additions and betterments proposed, and considering the known appreciable increases in material costs since the hearing herein, the Com- mission seriously questions whether the experience of the company will show a surplus after meeting the requirements of the reconstructed ex- change. In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the application herein is reasonable and should be approved, the schedule of rates proposed to become effective only upon the filing of a report by the Commission's engineer that the exchange and farm lines have been reconstructed as provided in the application. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele- graph company be, and the same is hereby, authorized to discontinue grounded service in the village of Elmwood and substitute therefor metallic service, and to charge and collect therefor the schedule of rates </seg>

In the Matter of the Application of the Monroe Independent Telephone Company for Au - thority to Issue and Sell $55,000 of Capital Stock to be Used for the Purchase of the Property of the Albion Telephone Com - pany.

Appearances: For Applicant — Alfred Bratt, president; E. B. Dannels, secretary; E. C. Hurd, engineer; J. P. Bratt. OPINION AND FINDING. Taylor, Commissioner: On December 16, 1915, the Monroe Independent Telephone company filed application for authority to issue $55,000 of its common stock and on June 29, 1916, it filed application to issue $6,500 of common stock. In the first application it was set forth that the purpose for which the </seg>
            <seg id="p208">TENTH- ANNUAL REPORT 208 stock was to be issued was to provide funds for the purchase of the property of the Albion Telephone company. The second and smaller issue was to cover additions and betterments to the existing system of the Monroe Independent Telephone company, for which the full amount is outstanding in the form of notes and bills payable. Hearing on both of these applications was had at the same time, and as the issues in - volved are practically identical they will be considered together. The record shows that two telephone exchanges were in operation at Albion, one by the Albion Telephone company (which will hereafter be referred to as the Albion company) and one by the Monroe Independent Telephone company (which will hereafter be referred to as the Monroe company). The Monroe company operates exchanges at a number of other points in that territory, having upwards of 2,000 subscribers on its system. Its exchange at Albion had less than 200 subscribers and was operated at a distinct loss because of the competitive situation. It was desirable for the Monroe company to have an exchange at Albion because of the fact that that is the county seat of Boone county and it was felt by the officers of the Monroe company that it was necessary to occupy that territory In order to more fully complete the service ren - dered to the Monroe system as a whole. Accordingly, it was decided by the board of directors of the Monroe company to negotiate for the purchase of the Albion property. These negotiations resulted in the purchase of that property and a contract for the possession of the same was entered into, to become effective February 1, 1916. Because the necessary issue of stock could not be authorized by this Commission by that date, the property was taken over by Alfred Bratt, John Bratt, E. B. Dannals and A. C. Bratt and held in trust by them until it could be purchased by the Monroe Independent Telephone company. At the time of the purchase of the Albion property the authorized capital of the Monroe company was $60,000. On December 8, 1915, a few days prior to the filing of this application, the board of directors of the Monroe company held a meeting and at that meeting voted to in - crease the authorized capital to $150,000. Subsequent to the hearing the company was advised that the board of directors had no authority to take this action and the company was instructed to have the stockholders pass upon the matter. This action was not taken until February 7, 1917, at which time a special meeting of the stockholders was held and the authorized capital increased to $150,000. It is obvious that the question involved here is as to whether the Monroe company as a corporation should be authorized to issue common stock in the amount of $61,500 for the purposes set forth in the two ap - plications herein. At the present time the Monroe company has au - thority from this Commission to issue and sell $57,975 of its common stock. Of this amount $52,525 has been sold and is outstanding, $5,450 remaining in the treasury of the company. The Commission has passed at three different times on the capitalization of this company, approv - ing increases in each instance of $8,000, $6,000 and $15,000, respectively. </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 209 At the time of the first order of the Commission there was outstanding $28,975. If allowance is made for $5,450 of stock now in the treasury jf the company, authorized but unsold, the company would have outstand - ing, if the Commission authorizes the full amount asked for in these applications, $113,725. It remains to be determined, therefore, whether tki&lt; &lt;*s&amp;ets of the combined properties and the actual investments therein justify such a capitalization. Physical Valuation Applicant by its engineer submits a physical valuation of the combined Monroe and Albion properties, made as of February 1, 1916, and which is as follows: Cost New Less Depreciation $ 67,040.53 S 50,934.21 Albion Telephone Co. Monroe Independent Tel. Co. 137,288.80 96,150.84 Additions to Monroe property after in - ventory at Tarnov, Platte Center, etc 1.000.00 1,359.13 970.00 Consolidation costs 1,359.13 Total $206,688.46 $149,414.18 The engineering department of valuation of the properties involved company, and June, 1916, for the M&lt; as follows: the Commission likewise made a ed, as of April, 1916, for the Albion Monroe company, these figures being Cost New Less Depreciation $ 52,651.63 $ 38.286.41 Albion Telephone Co. Monroe Independent Tel. Co 107,019.83 74,553.47 Total $159,671.46 $112,839.88 2.431.65 1,670.59 Deduction account duplication $157,239.81 $111,169.29 The marked difference in these valuations calls for some analysis, although for the purposes of this case it is not necessary to attempt to reconcile all of the figures. For the Commission's valuation it should be said that no more thorough inventory and field study was ever made by the department. As to the Albion property, the engineer inspected it in its entirety, traveling every mile of the farm lines and making a detailed examination of the physical elements to determine their con - dition. Not bo thorough an inspection was made of the Monroe prop - erty, but here the work was sufficiently complete to get all of the es - sential facts. Applicant's engineer has incorporated some elements of value not usually included in the physical valuation, although proper in the sense that they may have a place in the assets or investment of the com - pany. We refer to the claims for "cost of securing subscribers" and "working capital". With reference to the former the engineer seta up the figure of $4,534.00 for the Albion company and $10,348.20 for the </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT Monroe company. In arriving at these figures the engineer assumes that it cost the company $4.00 to solicit and contract each city sub - scriber and $7.00 to solicit and contract each farm subscriber, and that this cost is properly chargeable to capital. The Commission finds nothing in the history of either company to warrant such an assump - tion. Both companies started as small units and gradually grew to their present proportions. They began business at a time when the public was clamoring for telephone service and when the problem was not one of securing subscribers, but of finding capital to provide the facilities for the service demanded. Moreover, whatever solicitation was necessary was paid for out of the revenues of the business and was an operating charge. The figures submitted by the engineer are mere estimates, there being nothing in the record to support the amounts claimed. With reference to the claim for "working capital" the engineer has allowed an arbitrary amount in excess of stores and supplies, — $1,000 for the Albion company and $1,850 for the Monroe company. This allowance appears to be reasonable and as a capital charge is justifi - able, the money required for the payment of current obligations being a part of the real investment. This allowance, however, will be treated later. The remaining differences are largely matters of cost units and judgment on the part of the engineers. In view of the painstaking in - vestigation made by the Commission's engineers, we are inclined to ac - cept their figures as being reasonable. Applicant makes claim to largely increased values due to prevailing high prices of labor and materials. If conditions promised to make such prices permanent there might be good reason for using them as a basis for valuation figures, but it is universally conceded that present conditions are abnormal and may terminate at any time. The figures used by the engineers of the Com - mission cover a ten-year average, included in this average being a por - tion of the period of high prices. Both properties were bought during the period of normal prices. During a portion of their history prices were very low. It would be just as fair to base the reproduction cost of the property on the abnormally low prices as on the abnormally high prices. As a matter of fact, it is more equitable to all parties to adopt an average, covering an extended period, as has been done by the Com - mission's engineers. The figures of $157,239.81, reproduction new, and $111,169.29, present value, are regarded by the Commission as reason - able so far as the physical valuation is concerned. Book Cost of Property Investment. The books of both companies have been kept in such a manner as to make it impossible to determine the actual cost of the properties to date. While the books of the Albion company present an accurate rec - ord of all the money received and paid out, there is not sufficient de - tail to show the development of the property from year to year. Main - tenance expenditures are intermingled with expenditures for additions </seg>
            <seg id="p211">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 211 and betterments to such a degree that the amount of the latter cannot be ascertained. In 1909 the owners of the Albion company took an in - ventory of their property and the figure thus obtained was entered upon the books as the amount of the property investment, this amount being $35,644.96. The investment as for June 30, 1915, as shown by the books, is $41,153.04. The accounts of the Monroe company are even less illuminating than those of the Albion company. In 1909 an inventory was made and to the figures thus obtained various sums for betterments and extensions have been added, so that the book investment as it stands on February 1, 1916, is $76,793.63. From the manner in which the records have been kept and from the methods of operating the company, it is clear that this is a very conservative figure and does not represent the actual money investment in the property. The sum of these two figures is $117,946.67. Estimated Original Cost. The effort to ascertain the actual investment of the stockholders in the two properties under consideration is beset with many difficulties and the best that can be done, particularly as to the Monroe company, is to make an estimate, using as many facts as can be obtained and testing the final result in as many ways as possible. As to the cash investment in the Albion property, the record is fairly clear. This com - pany was started as a partnership by M. G. Needham and T. F. Martin in 1899 and they continued as sole owners until Mr. Martin sold his half interest to Mr. P. A. Krause in 1914. This ownership continued un - til the property was purchased by Alfred Bratt and his associates for the Monroe company. The records show that Needham and Martin invested varying sums from time to time as # the plant developed until their investment reached $10,629. During the time when the property was owned by the partners — sixteen years — $7,800 was paid to them in dividends. This is approximately $2,000 short of what they were en - titled to on the basis of 7% on the money invested. It was the plan of the partners to draw $100 per month each as salaries. As they devoted their full time to the business it is probable that these salaries would not properly compensate them for their services. If we allow $50.00 per month each during the period of the development of the business, there would be an additional $12,000 to add to the investment, making a total sacrifice of $24,629. When P. A. Krause purchased Needhani's half in - terest in 1914 ke paid $25,000 for it, indicating a belief on the part of the owners at that time that the property was worth as a going concern $50,000. Alfred Bratt and his associates paid $55,000 for the property when purchasing it for the Monroe company. It is apparent from these figures that a considerable portion of the property was built out of the earnings of the company. As we have shown, the exact amount is im - possible to determine; we are of the opinion, however, that the estimate of the actual sacrifice made by the owners of the property as above de - termined is a fair one. </seg>
            <seg id="p212">212 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT Apart from the outstanding capital stock, all of which was paid for in cash, there Is no means of ascertaining from the records the stock holders' investment in the Monroe property. At the present time there is outstanding $52,525. This undoubtedly represents actual investments on the part of stockholders, the greater portion having been issued in amounts of two or three shares as new subscribers were added to the service. Originally the company was a mutual organization and every telephone user was required to purchase sufficient stock to cover the cost of his extension. When the system got large it became difficult to en - force this rule, but the greater part of it was built in this manner. As stated at the outset, the Commission has approved three separate is - sues of stock. The first was on October 4, 1910, at which time there was outstanding $28,975. On that date an additional Issue of $8,000, cover ing additions and betterments, was authorized. On January 22, 1914, an issue of $6,000 for the same purpose was approved and on April 14, 1915, an issue of $15,000 was authorized. It is clear, therefore, that the $52,525 of capital stock represents a sacrifice to that extent on the part of the stockholders. In addition, there is a claim on the part of applicant for an allow - ance for services performed by Alfred Bratt, president, E. B. Dannals, secretary, and certain directors, for which services there was no pay - ment by the company. In an affidavit made by Mr. Bratt and constitut - ing a part of the record in this case, it is recited that he became presi - dent of the company in 1906 and that, notwithstanding he devoted his time to the building, operating and managing of the property, he re - ceived no compensation for his services until the year 1914, and no charge for the same was entered on the books until after that time. Subsequent to that date he states that the amount received was barely sufficient to pay his living, expenses. He further alleges that during his connection with the company certain members of his family performed service as switchboard operators, linemen and collectors of rentals, for which nothing was paid by the company. During the same period he made a practice, in order to further the interests of the company, of furnishing board and lodging to men engaged in the construction and maintenance work and to girls employed as operators, for which he re - ceived no compensation. At numerous times it was necessary for him to advance money to meet pressing claims against the company, for which he received no interest. For these and other services to the company, for which he was never rewarded in any form, he makes claim for $13,000. At the present time Mr. Bratt receives $100 per month as presi - dent of the company, which salary he has received since 1914. If he were allowed for the seven years from 1906 to 1914 $160.00 per month to cover a reasonable salary and other expenses which he claims, the total would be $12,600, which, in our opinion, would be a fair allowance for this purpose. From the numerous investigations made of this com - pany by the Commission, we are convinced that such an allowance to Mr. Bratt is justified. From the first he has made sacrifices of time and money to the company in the belief that ultimately the increased prop- </seg>
            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 213 erty investment, a portion of which came from the sacrifices of this character and the remainder from the surplus earnings of the com - pany, would justify an increase in the capital stock through which he might secure tangible evidence of his investment. In other words, he conducted this telephone plant just as he would have conducted a private business, expecting to be rewarded for his economies in behalf of the company by the increase in the value of the property. This Com - mission has adopted the policy, in bo far as its application is practicable, of basing earnings to owners of utility properties on the actual invest - ment they have in such properties, disallowing any claim for property created out of surplus earnings. This position, however, should not preclude the favorable consideration of claims for contributions of money and services where it can be shown that such forms of investment have been legitimately and actually made. A claim of $8,000 is made by applicant for E. B. Dannals, present secretary of the company, on similar grounds. Mr. Dannals was one of the original promoters of the Monroe company and has been its secre - tary continuously from the first. In addition, he has been actively en - gaged in construction and maintenance work, for a long time being the only lineman in the service. At the same time he acted as manager of one or more exchanges. He has received a salary from the first rang - ing from $700 in 1908, the first record we have, to $1,000 in 1914. Since that date he has received $1,200 per year. Out of his salary he has al - ways paid his own expenses, being required to keep a team in the early days and an automobile in recent years. As early as 1908 the company had over 700 subscribers, so it is needless to say that Mr. Dannals has devoted his undivided attention to the telephone business. Like Mr. Bratt, he has pursued a policy of rigid economy so far as the expenses of the company were concerned. At the first he was interested in the enterprise as a purely community affair, but as the system has developed, with a consequent demand for more and more of his thought and atten - tion, he has come to regard it as a business venture, from which he should realize a reward equal at least to his actual investment. If we were to allow Mr. Dannals a salary of $125.00 per month from the starting of the company in 1904 up to 1914 and deduct therefrom the amount actually received by him, we would have a figure of approxi - mately $3,500, which should represent his investment over and above the amount of stock owned by him and for which he has paid cash. Claim is also made for an allowance of $6,000 for the other officers of the company, none of whom have ever received any compensation. These men devoted but a portion of their time to the management of the company, but as directors occupy positions of responsibility, for which some compensation might be allowed. With a present gross in - come of approximately $30,000, this company has grown to be a business institution of considerable proportions. If it is to be treated as a busi - ness institution in the future the actual investments in it must be given consideration. If we were to allow $150 per year as the combined sal - aries of the directors and other officers, that would be the minimum for </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT such service. This would be $1,500 (or the period up to 1914 when the affairs of the enterprise were adjusted to a more businesslike basis. An allowance of $19,100 is asked for by applicant to cover "labor, teaming and other expenditures in building of plant by stockholders, as per estimate of Mr. Dannals, which was not paid for in money nor charged on the books of the company." While the history of this com - pany shows that such contributions of labor and services were actually made, the amount of such contributions, even to an approximate degree, is impossible of ascertainment. It was the plan of the company to have stockholders assist in the construction of the plant, but no record of such services was ever made and an estimate borders so closely on mere speculation that the Commission is disinclined to accept it. At the present'time the company has an outstanding indebtedness of $6,500, represented in short term notes and bills payable. The record is clear that the money thus borrowed went into additions and better - ments to the plant, inventories of the improvements having been sub- mitted by the company. Summarizing the foregoing, therefore, we have this statement: While realizing that this figure is made up partially from estimates, the Commission is of the opinion that it is a fair and reasonable ap - proximation of the original cost of the Monroe property. It is to be re - gretted that in a property of such size reliable records are not available, thus necessitating deductions and estimates, but the lack of such in - formation does not justify this Commission, as we see it, in refusing to attempt to arrive at a figure that will be a near approach at least to the real cost of the property to the owners. If to the figure obtained for the Monroe property we add the cost of the Albion property, $24,629, we have a cost of the consolidated plant of $101,254. Conclusions. We have, then, a figure of $111,169.29 as representing the present or depreciated value of the physical property; $117,946.67 as the figure found on the books for the property investment; and $101,254 as the esti - mated original cost to date of the consolidated property. At some point within the range of these amounts, the Commission is convinced, is to be found a figure that will equitably represent the "fair value" of this property for rate and capitalization purposes. Aside from the allowance for stores and supplies in the physical valuation, nothing is included in any of the figures for working capital. As before stated, the Commis - sion believes such an allowance to be a proper charge to capital. In apital stock outstanding iervice8 of Alfred Bratt lervtces of E. B.

Accepting the original cost figure of $101,654 as best rep - resenting the actual investment by the stockholders and adding to it 5% for working capital, we have $106,736, which figure the Commission believes is the amount that should be adopted as the value of the con - solidated property for the purposes of this application. Deducting from this amount the amount of capital stock already au - thorized by this Commission ($57,975), we have then $48,761 to be au - thorized at this time.

In connection with its application the company has filed its articles of incorporation with the Commission and water rights granted to it by the State Board of Irrigation for the use of water out of the Little Blue ±i river. The applicant has also filed detailed inventories of its properties, to- gether with cost data of its central station equipment and the transmis- sion lines above referred to. It has furnished the Commission with estimated values of certain other properties, which will be noted here- inafter. Under the direction of the Commission, tne engineering department of the Commission has made an inspection, inventories and valuations of the entire properties with the exception of the Carleton and Ruskin transmission lines, which were not completed at the time the inven- tories were made by the department. Mr. U. G. Powell, rate expert, ac- countant and statistician for the Commission, made an examination of the expenditures of the applicant and has filed his report and findings with the Commission. The report made by the accounting department includes the actual expenditure of money which had been made for the purpose of constructing the power plant and the transmission lines to Edgar and Davenport, and also includes certain estimates made on behalf of the applicant at the time the investigation was being made. The report of the accounting department shows the total expenditure of money, which includes certain estimates that the company made at the time the study was made, to be $82,393.60. The report of the engineer- ing department of the Commission shows the reproduction new value to be $60,083.77, and the present or depreciated value to be $59,598.27, in- clusive of the transmission lines to Ruskin and Carleton. A detailed statement filed by the company February 14, 1917, shows the actual ex- penditure made in the erection and construction of the central power plant and transmission lines to be $47,668.83.

            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 219 While the reports above referred to do not agree with the actual expenditures of money, as shown by the reports, the reports warrant the Commission in issuing authority for the sale of the amount of stock ap - plied for by the applicant. The authority, as prayed for, will therefore be granted by the Commission, subject, however, to the terms and con- ditions set out in the order Mr. Ernst Meyer &amp; Sons operate a flouring mill in close proximity to the central power station. The attention of the Commission was directed to this question in the report made by the accounting depart - ment. In said report the Commission's attention was directed to the fact that the mill was being operated by a water wheel located in the flume of the Hydro-Electric company. The Commission is informed that this plan of operation has been discontinued and that the mill company has installed an electric motor and proposes to purchase current for the operation of the same from the Hydro-Electric company. The Commis - sion is of the opinion that this plan of operation should be continued and the mill company pay to the Hydro-Electric company for all current used by said company, and that suitable metering instruments be in - stalled in the power plant of the Hydro-Electric company for the purpose of measuring the current consumed by the mill company. The Commission is further of the opinion that a minimum price of lVfec per kilowatt at the Hydro-Electric switchboard should be established for the sale of current to the mill company and that the price of current to the mill company should be so adjusted as not to rob the Hydro- Electric company of its water for the purpose of operating its central station. While the Commission is not definitely fixing the rate to be charged the mill company, because it does not have jurisdiction of the rates of electric power plants, yet all users of current furnished by the applicant are entitled to know that they are paying just and proper rates based upon the water power. It can be readily seen that if the mill company were to get its power furnished for less than the cost of the same, other users would have to pay a greater rate than they should pay or the securities herein authorized by the Commission would de - preciate in value, which would in time be reflected in the service ren - dered to all patrons of the company for which the plant has been estab - lished. eal Estate: 40 acres @ $50.00 $2,000.00 18.05 acres on which power house is located 1,805.00 60 acres lease with right to overflow 2,500.00 4 acres for mill race 400.00 Total 6,705.01 taking a total of estimated values $40,233.2. it a grand total of 87,902.0 </seg>

On February 1, 1916, it purchased a gas plant at Central City, which at that time had suspended operation, paying therefor the sum of $2,500. The applicant finds it necessary to almost completely rebuild the prop - erty in order to manufacture and distribute gas in a manner satisfactory to its customers. Careful study made by the owners indicates that an expenditure of eighteen or twenty thousand dollars will be necessary to place the plant in the condition desired. Up to December 1, 1916, the company had expended in addition to the purchase price of $2,500, a total of $6,776.30 in betterments and addi - tions, making a total investment as of that date of $9,276.30. The Com - mission's engineering department made a valuation of the property, present and proposed, basing its figures on a study of the property al - ready in place and which is in condition to be retained, and estimating APPLICATION NO. 2730. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 223 the amount necessary to bring the property up to service condition. On this basis the department found a reproduction new value of $29,513.56 and a present value of $20,607.90. At the time of the hearing the plant had not yet been brought to a paying basis. The gas sales for the eight months ending December 1, 1916, totalled 1,333,900 cubic feet. The revenue for the same period was $2,693.34, with operating expenses of $2,927, leaving an operating deficit of $233.66. There are 227 customers at the present time and Mr. Bor - den, an officer of the company, estimates that 300 customers will put the plant on a paying basis. Central City is a town of between 2,600 and 3,000 population and has a municipal electric lighting plant. Mr. Borden, who is an experienced man in the gas business, is of the opinion that the plant at Central City will reach a paying basis if properly managed and improved. It is their purpose to specialize in the production of gas for heating purposes, with lighting as an incidental source of revenue. The Commission is of the opinion that the present showing of the company will not justify an issue of $12,500 of common stock, but will approve an issue of $10,000 at this time. At a subsequent date when the proposed improvements are completed so that the total expenditures can be ascertained, and at a time when the plant has been developed to a paying basis, it will be proper for the company to make another ap - plication for an increase. At that time consideration can be given to the value in the purchased plant over and above the price paid for it, which question at this time the Commission cannot go into because of absence of sufficient data. ORDER. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Central City Gas company be and it hereby is authorized to sell its common stock in the amount of $10,000, said stock to be sold at not less than par and the proceeds thereof, or so much as may be necessary, to be applied to the purposes set forth in the petition and none other. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that said applicant report in detail to the Commission the sale of said securities and the application of the pro - ceeds thereof within thirty days of such time as the unreported amount thereof shall exceed the sum of $5,000. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that said applicant shall at once estab - lish and maintain a method of accounts, which shall accurately and clearly segregate the operating revenues and the operating costs as distributed between direct operation, maintenance, depreciation, new construction and capital investment. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, commencing with the effective date of this order, applicant shall set aside annually out of its operating revenue an amount equal to five per cent of $10,000, to be used for the purpose of defraying expense of maintenance and depreciation and for no other purpose; Provided, that any surplus thus accumulated may be </seg>

Browne, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 2823. In the Matter of the Application of the Kear - ney Telephone Company of Kearney, Ne - braska, for Authority to Readjust its Rate Schedule to Cover Service by a Consoli - dated Exchange: Appearances: For Applicant — E. M. Morsman and Warren Pratt For Protestants — John A. Miller. OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Commissioner: Until July 1, 1916, Kearney was served by two telephone systems. One was operated by the Kearney Telephone company and the other by the Nebraska Telephone company, the former having about 1,100 owned stations and the latter about 700. There was a demand on the part of the public and a desire on the part of the companies for a consolidation and a unified service. This demand finally culminated in a complaint filed with this Commission, upon which a hearing was had and an order issued, directing the companies to effect a consolidation. The Nebraska Telephone company at first proposed to purchase the plant of its com - petitor, but objections to such a merger on the part of the federal gov - ernment made it necessary for the Kearney Telephone company to be - come the purchasing party. The final negotiations were completed on July 1, 1916, at which time the Kearney company became the owner of the exchange property of the Nebraska company, the latter retaining all its toll property and acquiring also a portion of the toll plant of the Kearney company, the plan being for the Nebraska company to main - tain and operate a toll switching station, while the other company was to consolidate the exchanges and operate the consolidated plant. The work of consolidating the two exchanges and making the neces - sary improvements was at once started, and the Kearney company now appears before this Commission with an application for a new schedule of rates to cover the service to be furnished by the merged system. The schedule for which approval is asked is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 225 (a) One party business telephone, $3.75 per month with a dis - count of 25 cents for payment of current month's rental at the com - pany's office on or before the 8th of the month, making a net rate of $3.50 per month. (b) Two-party business telephone, $3.25 per month, with a dis - count of 25 cents for payment of current month's rental at the com - pany's office on or before the 8th of the month, making a net rate of $3.00 per month. (c) One-party residence, $2.00 per month, with same discount, making a net rate of $1.75 per month. (d) Two-party residence, $1.75 per month, with same discount, making a net rate of $1.50 per month. (e) Four-party residence, $1.50 per month, with same discount, making a net rate of $1.25 per month. (f) Farm stations, $1.75 per month, with same discount, mak - ing a net rate of $1.50 per month. Stations not to exceed in number 12 to a circuit. (g) Switching service, 50 cents per month per station, with a minimum of five stations to a line. The price paid by the Kearney company for the exchange plant of the Nebraska company was $57,265.21, which was the present or struc - tural value of the property as determined by a physical valuation. Sub - sequent to the purchase applicant made an inventory of the two plants and its engineers made an exhaustive study of the situation to determine how the consolidation of the physical property could best be effected. After the filing of the application in this case the Commission's engineers took the inventory submitted by applicant and carefully checked it in the field. They also made a careful inspection of the property to ascer - tain its present value and to determine what portion should be In - cluded in the consolidated plant. Whereupon representatives of appli - cant company, engineers of the Nebraska company and the engineers for the Commission, after repeated conferences, agreed upon a valuation of the property as it is to be used in the consolidated plant, their conclu - sions being as. follows: Estimated Value of Consolidated Exchange of Kearney Telephone Company at Kearney, Nebraska. Reproduction Structural Cost Value Kearney exchange purchased from Nebraska Tele- Toll property used by consolidated exchange pro - rated according to proportionate use (Includes use of Nebraska Telephone company and Kearney Telephone company toll property both in and out of city) 5,182.66 3,887.00 Total $143,176.98 $108,474.49 phone company $ ! 70,391.06 ! % 57.265.2 earney exchange of Kearney Telephone com- pany 67,603.26 47,322.2: </seg>
            <seg id="p226">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 226 It will be noted that in the consolidation it is proposed to abandon practically all of the Kearney company plant and utilize all but a small portion of the plant of the Nebraska company. This is regarded as not only the most economical plan, but will make for a better standard of construction and a more efficient plant. It is adopted after a most care - ful study by the engineers of all the factors entering into the problem. By this plan property of the Kearney company of a present value of $30,705.31 will be displaced and of the Nebraska company property to the value of $4,417.34. It is estimated that it will cost $42,787.54 to consoli - date the plants and purchase the necessary new equipment. From the property abandoned $6,560.66 will be realized as salvage, but from this should be deducted $4,537.87, the cost of wrecking the property. This leaves a net salvage of $2,022.79. After making this readjustment the reproduction cost of the consolidated plant is $139,705.24 and the present or structural value $119,045.64. The Commission accepts these figures as fairly representing the value of the exchange property following consoli - dation. In this connection it should be said that the consolidated ex - change will be better than either of the present plants and materially better than the Kearney company plant. The new plant will be metallic with a central energy system. While it is shown by the record that 1,044 out of the 1,276 sub scribers to both exchanges within the city of Kearney have signed con - tracts for the consolidated service at the rates proposed in the applica - tion, and while no one from the city of Kearney appeared to protest against the schedule applied for. it is necessary for this Commission to determine, as nearly as may be possible from the record before it. whether or not the rates proposed are reasonable. Applicant can, of course, only estimate what the revenue and expense for the consolidated plant will be. Studies were made for the purpose of arriving at as ac - curate an estimate as possible. With reference to the revenue to be Estimated cost of new plant necessary for con- solidation (includes new stations to bring number up to 1,680, the estimated total in service within one year from date of con- solidation) 42,787.54 42,787.54 Total $185,964.52 $151,262.03 Property of Kearney Telephone company displaced through consolidation 43,864.73 Property of Nebraska Telephone company dis- placed through consolidation 4,417.34 30,705.31 3,533.87 Total $ 48,282.07 $ 34,239.18 Total value of consolidated exchange $137,682.45 Salvage of displaced Kearney Telephone com- pany and Nebraska Telephone company plant which will be placed in supply account 6,560.66 $117,022.85 6,560.66 Grand total $144,243.11 $123,583.51 123,583.5 </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Applying to the above number of stations the rates as applied for, we have a total gross revenue for the exchange for one year of $34,266. No toll revenue is included in this for the reason that the Nebraska company will handle all such business in the city of Kearney. In arriving at an estimate of the expense for the consolidated ex - change applicant submits the figures for each exchange for the year ending June 30, 1915, and, after a study of them, adopts approximately 70*1- of the sum of the two as a reasonable figure for the merged ex - change. From these figures all of the expense of operating the toll plants has been eliminated. The expense of the Kearney company for the year referred to was I14.46S.24 and for the Nebraska company it was $11.973 .80, or a total of $26,442.04 for both exchanges. The detail of the expense estimated for the consolidated exchange is as follows: ;e of both exchanges) $ 5,793.68 e of both exchanges) 3,669.00 actual expenditures for "maintenance" is supplemented by an arbitrary allowance of 6%&lt;~r on the reproduction cost of the property. It is alto - gether likely that the expenditures for maintenance by the two com - panies in the past included the cost of replacements which should properly have been charged to depreciation. In a number of exchanges similar to this one the Commission has- found 9^ of the reproduction cost of the property to be a reasonable allowance for both maintenance Maintenance (70"^ of the 1915 expen Commercial (70"^ of the 1915 expen .iuuunon.1 a i .-i i l nniunni Luminiooiuii __ i produced it is assumed that at the end of one year after the consolida- tion becomes effective there will be in service 1,680 stations, distributed as follows: Individual business 182 Two-party business 47 One party residence 275 Two-party residence 304 Four-party residence 493 Farm stations 208 Business extensions 40 Residence extensions 29 Private branch exchange. , 102 In addition to the above it is estimated there will be 264 switched farm stations, this being a service where the farmers own their lines and instruments and receive only a switching service from the ex- change.

With respect to the other items as shown in the statement, it would appear that they are reasonable. The total expense compares favorably with other exchanges in the state which the Commission has had the opportunity to more thoroughly analyze. The following statement shows the expense of various exchanges on the basis of the subscriber's sta- tion: Kearney Telephone Co. (consolidated) $15.07 per sub. sta. Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. (Johnson Co.) 19.26 per sub. sta. Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. (Beatrice) 15.81 per sub. sta. Crownover Telephone Co. (Sargent) 15.26 per sub. sta. Valparaiso Telephone Co. (Valparaiso) 15.93 per sub. sta. Nebraska Telephone Co. (Lexington) 16.34 per sub. sta. It should be explained that the figure given for the Kearney com- pany is arrived at after applying 9% per cent for maintenance and de- preciation, as suggested above, eliminating the figures shown in the statement for those items. Readjusting the figures as indicated, we have the following state- ment as to the result from operation after applying the proposed rates: Earning*. Annual rental from 1,680 owned stations and fees from 264 switched stations .'. $34,266.00 Expense*. Commercial $ 3,669.00 Traffic 5,475.77 General 2,345.86 Insurance 175.00 Taxes 550.00 Rent 540.00 Maintenance and depreciation (9% on $139,705).... 12,573.45 Total $25,329.08 25,329.08 Net income $ 8,936.92 The net income remaining for dividends amounts to 7%% on the present value of $119,045. Ordinarily this would not be regarded by the Commission as an excessive earning. There are features of the proposed schedule, however, that require further consideration. In a change of this sort it is impossible to accurately determine the number of sub- scribers there will be in each class of service, and that makes it im- possible to accurately forecast the amount of revenue that will be col- lected. The fixing of the rates for the various classes of service has much to do with the selection of the service by the subscriber. For example, if the rate for individual line service is high the tendency will be for subscribers to take party line service, and vice versa. The ideal schedule is one that secures the largest number of subscribers possible at the lowest rates commensurate with efficient operation and a reason- able earning on the investment Experience has shown that such </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 229 schedules can be approximated if not completely attained. In this con - nection we have in mind the rates asked for by applicant for business service. It is desired to establish a net rate for individual business of $3.50 and for two-party business of $3.00. These rates are higher by 50 cents per month than are in effect in other exchanges in the state giving the same quality and quantity of service. Applicant estimates that there will be 182 individual business subscribers and 47 two-party business. It is possible that actual application of the rates proposed would result in a different number of subscribers in the two classes. If any con - siderable number of the 182 individual business subscribers transferred to the party line service it would result in a material reduction of the revenue. For example, if 82 of the single line subscribers were to take the party line service instead it would reduce the revenue approxi - mately $500 per year. If the rate for individual service were reduced to $3.00 it might result in a number taking that service who otherwise would take only two-party service, the change in the class of service thus resulting in an increase of revenue that would offset the reduction in the rate. As stated, the business rates proposed are higher than for other ex - changes of similar size. The following comparison shows the rates for exchanges of a similar size and also for exchanges having a larger num - ber of subscribers: This comparison discloses that where the rate is $3.50 and $3.00 the exchange furnishes a much wider service than is proposed in this case. The service is even wider than is indicated by the number of iubscriberj for in the case of Hastings, Grand Island, Beatrice and perhaps one or two other exchanges free connection is given to one or more adjoining towns. In the $3.00 and $2.50 class of towns the number of stations varies more, but it is apparent that, based on the amount .of service rendered, Kearney belongs more properly in this class. The Commission is of the opinion that the rates asked for the two classes of business service are too high and should be reduced to the basis of $3.00 for individual and $2.50 for two-party lines. The rates proposed for residence service appear to be in line with standard rates for similar service and we see no reason why they should be modified.

            <seg id="p230">■SM TENTH ANNUAL REPORT line subscribers, the record fails to justify that charge. Emphasis is placed on the fact that applicant meets the farm lines at the city limits and that the average distance covered by each circuit is two and one-half miles. Applicant contends that the maintenance of the wires and poles and other equipment calls for a larger cost than is usually necessary in the furnishing of such service. It is shown that the property devoted to this service is worth $1,862.32 and it is estimated that its maintenance averages 10 cents per switched station per mouth. If we adopt for this purpose the same allowance as for the remainder of the property (9% on $1,862.32) we have, on the basis of 264 switched stations, only a trifle over 5 cents per station. Applicant further shows that the direct cost of operation is 25 cents per month per station. This figure, compared to others ascertained by the Commission, appears to be reasonable. Therefore, the total cost, based on applicant's figures, is but 35 cents per station. Using the Commission's figure for maintenance and depre - ciation, the cost would be but 30 cents per station. To this should be added, of course, sufficient to cover an earning on the property devoted to switching use. Allowing for this, however, the total cost to the switched patron should not be over 35 certs per month. This is the only part of the schedule vigorously protested, the farm lines interested being represented at the hearing. It is urged in their behalf that the 25 cents now charged is ample to cover the cost of the service, and that if it does not do so the fact that the Kearney company gets the benefit of the connection with 264 farm subscribers should wore than com - pensate for the difference. As just shown, the assumption of the Protestants that the cost of furnishing the service does not exceed 25 cents is not well founded. With reference to the second contention it is necessary to bear in mind the fact that the relations of the parties are reciprocal. If the Kearney company had but 264 subscribers, the benefits derived by the one would be balanced by the benefits accruing to the other. In the present case, however, the 264 farmers who pur - chase switching service from the Kearney company get in addition con - nection with the 1,680 subscribers of the latter company, a service of decided value. The point is better illustrated, perhaps, by assuming that the farm lines involved should conclude to install a switchboard at some central point and perform their own switching service. Unless they could establish a free connection with the Kearney exchange they would be limited for service to the members of their own system. The Commission Is of the opinion, therefore, that the rate of 35 cents per month is more equitable to both the telephone company and the switched patrons than the rate of 50 cents asked for by applicant or the rate of 25 cents now in effect. The remainder of the schedule appears to be reasonable and will be approved. The proposal to fix a gross rate and give a discount of 25 cents per month for prompt payment has been adopted by many other companies in the state and has been found to be satisfactory to both company and patron. It is regarded as a reasonable rule by the Commission and will be approved in this instance. </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 231 Readjusting the earnings to the basis of the new schedule as dis - cussed, we have the following showing as to results: Earnings. Annual rental and switching fees $32,416.80 Maintenance and depreciation (97c on $139,705).. 12,573.45 Total $25,329.08 25,329.08 Net income $ 8,936.92 The net income amounts to approximately 6% on the present value of the property. There is reason to believe, judging from experience with other consolidated properties, that in the course of tima there will be a substantial increase in the number of subscribers and a conse - quent increase in the revenue. A certain amount of increased patronage can undoubtedly be handled with the present expense, so that there should be some increase, at least, in the net income to the company. From the patron's standpoint the consolidation is very desirable, both from a service and a rate basis. A unified service, covering the entire community, will now be at the command of every subscriber on the sys - tem. Those subscribers who have been compelled to maintain duplicate telephones in order to secure the service on both systems, of whom there are about 200, will enjoy a substantial reduction in their charges. The loss to the company in revenue from duplicate telephones will be $4,779. While the work of consolidating the two plants is practically com - pleted, it is yet in such condition that first class service cannot be rendered. For that reason the rates authorized herein will not be made effective at once. Their going into effect will be conditioned upon a re - port by the Commission's engineer that the construction of the plant has been completed and that a normal service condition has been effected. In the meantime the present rates now charged to various classes of subscribers on the two exchanges will remain in effect. ORDER.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, for the period of one year com - mencing with the effective date of this order, the Kearney Telephone company shall submit to the Commission monthly full reports of its operation for the Kearney exchange, showing in detail the exchange revenues by classifications, and all operating expenses in detail, giving attention to the expenditures for maintenance and realized depreciation, and showing the unused part of the depreciation fund set aside for the Kearney exchange under this order. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 282 In the Matter of the Application of the Kear - ney Telephone Company, of Kearney, Ne - braska, for Authority to Readjust Its Rate Schedule to Cover Service by a Consoli - dated Exchange. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING. Taylor, Commissioner: Pursuant to the provisions of the original order in this case, the Commission instructed its telephone engineer, Mr. H. B. Couch, to make an inspection of the consolidated plant of the Kearney Telephone com - pany for the purpose of determining whether it is in condition to render efficient telephone service. Mr. Couch visited Kearney on December 30, 1916, made a careful inspection of the physical property with a view to ascertaining its readiness for service and also made a number of tests of the service itself. His report is to the effect that the consolidation of the plant has been effected, except for a small number of telephones remaining on the switchboard of the old independent company, which have been connected to the other exchange by sufficient trunk lines to insure prompt service. The physical condition of the equipment is good and the work of consolidation has been well done. The only feature that will result in inconvenience for a time is the lack of a directory. A new directory, covering the subscribers on the consolidated exchange, is in the hands of the printer, however, and will be ready for distribu - tion within a week or ten days. In the meantime extra operators are employed to furnish the correct numbers when the subscribers are called by name. Mr. Couch's test of the service developed very prompt response on the part of the operators and a much quicker and accurate service than might be expected under the circumstances. In the opinion of Mr. Couch the company is now able to render good commercial service. There will be more or less inconvenience to subscribers for three or four months, caused by the removal of old lines and other equipment, but the interference will not be sufficient to seriously impair the service. In view of this report, therefore, the Commission is at the opinion </seg>

In the Matter of the Application of the Crown - over Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Its Switching Charge to 75 Cents per Month With a Discount of 25 Cents per Month if Paid in Advance. Appearances: For Applicant — A. B. Moon, Attorney. For Protestants — Guy Laverty, Attorney. OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Commissioner Applicant operates a telephone exchange at Sargent, Nebraska, and has 498 patrons, classified as follows: Business, 53; residence, 125; owned farm stations, 156; switched farm stations, 164. The 164 farmers who receive switching service from the company are connected to the switchboard by twelve separate lines. After the usual manner, the farmers on each line are organized into a mutual company, which owns all the equipment up to the city limits of Sargent. This is an application to increase the rate for switching these farm lines from 25 cents per month to 75 cents per month. It is a condi - tion of the new rate asked for that a discount of 25 cents per month be allowed if the bill is paid monthly in advance. . Supporting its petition for an increase in the rate, the company submits the following statement of operating expenses, covering the period of nine months ending September 30, 1916: </seg>
            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 235 Total Fanners Mutual Nine Telephone The above statement purports to give the total direct operating cost of the exchange, with a division of expense to the switched sub - scribers on the basis of the ratio of the number of switched subscribers to the total number of subscribers on the exchange. Before any con - sideration can be given to the figures submitted, it will be necessary to deduct an allowance for the expense of toll operation, which expense is included in the above figures. In previous cases of this character the Commission has deducted 20% as a proper allowance for toll expense In Application No. 2153 we found, however, that the Crownover Tele - phone company enjoys a larger toll revenue than the average company of its size for the reason that it is located at a terminus of the Bur - lington railroad and serves a much wider territory. For that reason it is the opinion of the Commission that a deduction of 25% should be made from the total operating expense. In the above statement there is an item of $65.00 for directory ex - pense. No allowance is made by the company for revenue derived from the sale of advertising in the directory. As held in former cases of this kind, the Commission believes that such allowance should be made. According to the testimony of Mr. Crownover, manager of the com - pany, this revenue usually defrays all of the expense of issuing direc - tory. For that reason the item should be eliminated from the state - ment. There is a duplication of the expense of maintenance and de - preciation on the central office equipment in so far as a charge is made for maintenance and an allowance of 10% in addition for de- Months Operators' wages $ 944.00 Central office stationery and printing 95.74 Interest and depreciation on central office equipment 168.93 Maintenance on central office equipment... 150.00 Interest and depreciation of value of cir- cuits from city limits to central office: 13 wires running west $113.10 5 wires running north 3.63 19 wires running east 60.00 15 wires running north 20.52 197.25 Casualty insurance on operators 45.90 Taxes on central equipment, insurance on switchboard and central office equip- Share $ 320.16 33.80 57.40 50.84 85.75 13.12 ment 78.90 Fuel, lights and janitor 70.00 Directory expenses 65.00 Rent 54.00 Revenue accounting, collecting and com- mercial supervision 1,392.00 26 24 22.96 21.32 18.04 467.40 Total direct operating cost for switching 164 telephones $3,256.72 $1,117.03 Per subscriber per 9 months Per subscriber per month 6.81 .75 </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT preciation. It is tbe policy of the Commission to allow eight or nine per cent for both maintenance and depreciation, and in this instance we be - lieve 9% to be a reasonable allowance for those purposes. The value of the central office equipment, as shown by the books of the com - pany, is $1,325, 9% of which amount will be substituted in the state - ment for these purposes. According to the ordinary custom, the farmers' lines are built to the limits of the city, whefe the company meets them with its own cir - cuits. For interest and depreciation on these circuits the company makes claim for $197.25. Apparently more than the necessary number of circuits to serve the farm lines are included in this claim, there be - ing 52 of such wires listed. As there are only twelve farm line cir - cuits, it would appear that the same number of circuits would be required to furnish the service. In similar cases the Commission has found $1.00 per month per circuit to be a reasonable rental charge, this amount covering maintenance, depreciation and interest on the invest - ment. An allowance on this basis will therefore be substituted for the figure given. The item of "revenue accounting, collecting and commercial super - vision" is so large as to challenge attention. It is given at $1,392 for the nine months, which would be over $1,800 per year, or $150.00 per month. This is more than the total of the general expenses of the company for the year ending June 30, 1916, as shown by its annual report to this Commission. It is obvious that all of the general ex - penses should not be charged against the switching service, a consid - erable portion of the manager's time at least being devoted to mainte - nance and new construction work. In Application No. 255S the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company reported this expense for its Seward exchange to be only $1,877 for the year. This exchange served 93u patrons and is of a higher standard in every way than the one under consideration. The Lincoln company's exchange at Syracuse, which the Commission investigated in Application No. 2596, is practically the same size as applicant's system, it having 529 subscribers. Its expense for accounting, collecting and commercial supervision should correspond very closely to that of the Crownover company. This expense for one year is reported in that case to be $684.75, or approximately 11 cents per subscriber per month. After deducting the toll expense, this would amount to $121.77 as the switched subscriber's share. The Commission is of the opinion that this figure is much more reasonable than the one submitted by the company, and it will be adopted for the purposes of this case. The item of $95.74 for "central office stationery and printing" ap - pears to be excessive in view of the 'fact that the expense reported for all printing for the year ending June 30, 1916, was but $79.67. More - over, this item should be divided on the basis of the ratio of the num - ber of switched lines to the number of owned stations. The switched subscribers occasion but a small portion of the printing cost, as each </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 237 line is treated as but one patron in the records, books, accounting blanks, etc. For this item, therefore, we shall take the figures reported in the annual report as being the more reasonable. Readjusting the figures in the table to correspond to the conclu- sions just outlined, we have the following statement, covering a nine months' period : Total Expense Switched Less Toll Lines' Share Operators % 708.00 $ 233.64 Central office stationery and printing 59.75 1.57 Maintenance and depreciation on circuits 108.00 108.00 Casualty insurance on operators 30.67 10.12 Taxes and insurance on central office equipment 59.18 19.53 Fuel, lights and janitor 52.50 17.33 Rent 40.50 13.37 Revenue accounting, collecting and com- mercial supervision (Syracuse basis) 121.77 Maintenance and depreciation on central office equipment (9% on $1,325) 67.08 22.13 Interest on central office equipment (7% on $1,325) 52.17 17.21 Total expense for nine months Expense per subscriber per month I 564.67 .38 These figures would indicate that a rate of 40 cents per month would not be excessive and that it would reasonably cover the cost of giving service. The attorney for protestants argues vigorously the contention that applicant should take into consideration the advantage it derives from its connection with the 164 farmers who own their lines. This is a familiar argument and is urged in almost every case of this character. Its proponents, however, invariably lose sight of the fact that the rela - tion between the company and the switched farmers is a reciprocal one so far as the service is concerned. If connection with 164 farmers adds value to the service of the Crownover company, correspondingly, con - nection with 334 subscribers of the latter company is of value to the farmers. Indeed, if the value of this service is to be measured at all the balance is decidedly in favor of the company, since it has over twice as many connections as have the farmers. In Application No. 2418 the Humphrey Telephone company sought to include in its charge for switching an allowance for this added service, but Commissioner Hall in his opinion very properly said: 'The Commission is unable to include this item as the costs above set out are for the purpose of furnishing connections with the entire system. There might be an element of cost that should be considered in this item, but the Commission is of the opinion that it is entirely too remote." In other words, any value attached to intercommunication with telephone users in a larger exchange is reflected in the added cost which is required to give switching service to the combined zone. It </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT is measured in a practical and effective way by this cost. When coun - sel contends that applicant should perform the switching service for the protestants in return (or the advantage flowing from the connection, he loses sight of the fact that somebody must perform the important serv - ice of establishing the connection between the subscribers on the sys - tem. That there is an expense for performing such service goes without saying. If we assume, therefore, that the advantages of intercommuni - cation between each group offset each other, it remains only to distribute this expense equally among all the users of the service. As to the other contention of protestants' counsel, that applicant is put to but little if any added expense by reason of the connection of the farm lines, there is little if any merit. It is not shown in the first place that the company is not put to considerable expense in furnishing switching service to the farm lines. On the contrary, it requires but little proof to show that the operating expense of the company would be materially reduced if one-third of its subscribers were cut off, but assuming that the service involved could be furnished without added cost to the company, it would not follow that the farmers affected should get it for nothing. The other patrons could immediately complain that they were being subjected to unjust discrimination and demand that the cost be re-distributed so that they would not have to bear it all. The principle that every user of the service of a public utility should bear his just proportion of the cost of such service is so well estab lished as to need no further discussion here. Five witnesses testified to the poor quality of the service fur - nished by applicant, their principal complaint being that they could not get the "central operator". All admitted, however, that much of the trouble was in their own lines. Their testimony further developed that there is no uniformity in the type of instruments used on the switched lines, a very necessary requirement to satisfactory service. The lines are very long and some are heavily loaded. There was but little testi - mony to show that the company was not prompt and efficient in mak - ing repairs to its portion of the equipment. In fact, it was admitted by nearly all the witnesses that Manager Crownover was quite prompt in his efforts to keep his equipment in good operating condition. The question of service on these lines was discussed by the Commission in Application No. 2153, supra. In that opinion we said: "A large number who criticized the service were farmers lo- cated in switched lines. They assumed that all of the troubles originated at the switchboard and that applicant is responsible for them. It is apparent, however, that where farm lines twenty miles in length and having as high as sixteen subscribers encounter diffi - culty in getting good service, the trouble lies, not alone In the central office, but in the condition of the lines themselves. There is no uniformity in the type of telephone instruments used on these lines, the selection being left to the subscriber, and as a conse - quence the lines are unbalanced and proper service is impossible. It is altogether probable that if these lines were reconstructed so as to reduce the number of subscribers to each circuit, suitable in - struments of the same type installed and more attention given to </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 239 the maintenance of the property, a large portion of the troubles now complained of would disappear. These are matters, however, for the farm companies themselves to attend to and applicant cannot be held responsible if such improvements are not made." In the order made in that case the Commission recommended thai the Crownover company increase its force of operators and make cer - tain improvements in its lines. These recommendations have since been complied with by the company. In the absence of conclusive testimony showing that any faults in the service are directly chargeable to the Crownover company and not to the farm lines, the Commission is com - pelled to find that the charges as to poor service are not sustained. Applicant, in connection with its request for an increase in rate, desires to add the condition that a discount of 25 cents per month will be given from the gross rate for prompt payment. Switching fees are usually paid six months or one year in advance, and by the secretary or treasurer of the mutual company operating the line. For that reason it would appear that a monthly discount is not necessary. Ordinarily the discount is given for payments made one year in advance and the Com - mission is of the opinion that that would be the more practical and effective method in this instance. It would appear that on a total charge of $4.80 for the year a discount of 80 cents would be reasonable. ORDER. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Crownover Telephone com - pany be and the same hereby is authorized to charge and collect a rate of $4.80 per subscriber per year for switching farm lines, from which amount a discount of 80 cents will be allowed for payment one year in advance. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that where the number of subscribers on a switched line is five or less the total charge for switching patrons on that line shall not be less than the charge for five subscribers. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any surplus remaining after all operating expenses have been paid, including an allowance of 9% on the reproduction new value of the property, for maintenance and deprecia - tion, and dividends at the average rate of 7% on the actual investment of the stockholders, shall be kept in reserve until the further order of this Commission, or shall be expended for the improvement of the service or the betterment of the property, and shall not be distributed to the stockholders in the form of dividends. This order shall become effective September 1, 1917. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 6th day of August, 1917. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, T. L. Hall, Chairman Attest: T. A.

In the Matter of the Application of the Crown - over Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Its Switching Charges on Its Ex - change at Sargent, Nebraska. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER. Motion was filed by the Crownover Telephone company on Auguitt 17, 1917, praying for a modification of the order made and entered by the Commission August 6, 1917, in re Application No. 2860, wherein ap - plicant company desired authority to increase switching charges on its exchange at Sargent, Nebraska. In said order of August 6, 1917, applicant company was authorized to charge and collect a rate of $4.80 per subscriber per annum for switching farm lines, from which amount a discount of 80 cents was al - lowed for payment one year in advance. Applicant prayed for the elim - ination of the 80-cent discount when paid in advance, pointing out that the Commission had found a cost of switching of 38 cents per month per subscriber, and that to those taking advantage of the discount service will be rendered at less than cost. The Commission believes, and so finds, that modification of the first paragraph of the order of August 6, 1917, should be made. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Crownover Telephone company be and it hereby is authorized to charge and collect $4.80 per subscriber per year for switch - ing farm lines, subject to a discount of 30 cents per annum if payment is made one year in advance.

APPLICATION NO. 2890 In the Matter of the Application of the Omaha, Lincoln 4. Beatrice Railway Company for Authority to Issue Two Million Five Hun - dred Thousand (92,500,000) Dollars of First Mortgage Five Per Cent Thirty-year Bonds, Five Hundred Thousand ($500,000) Dollars of Six Per Cent Cumulative Pre - ferred Stock and Two Million ($2,000,000) Dollar* of Common Stock. </seg>
            <seg id="p241">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 241 Appearances: For Applicant — Harvey Musser W E. Sharp and J. M. Bramlette. OPINION AND FINDING Clarke, Chairman: Under date of June 24, 1913, this Commission authorized the appli - cant herein, in an amended or supplemental order in Application No. 1651, to issue its five per cent bonds in the sum of two million two hundred fifty thousand ($2,250,000) dollars and its capital stock in the sum of eight hundred fifty thousand ($850,000) dollars, the proceeds of which were to be used in the completion of the construction and equipping of its projected line of interurban railway between the cities of Lincoln and Omaha. The applicant has been unable to finance its project under the con - ditions named in said amended order, and represents to the Commission that it can finance the project and will proceed at once toward the com - pletion of the same if it be allowed to issue its thirty-year five per cent first mortgage bonds in the sum of two million five hundred thousand ($2,500,000) dollars, five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars of six per cent cumulative stock, preferred as to assets and dividends, and two million ($2,000,000) dollars par value of common stock. Applicant, in support of its petition, offered evidence tending to prove that labor and material had increased in price from 20% to 35% since 1913 and that the cost of financing a construction project of this character was inadequate and insufficient. According to the Commission's engineer, the cost of labor has in - creased 25% and the material as a whole which will enter into the con - struction and equipment, 35%. The department's 1916 estimates of the cost as compared with the department's 1013 estimates, exclusive of the present operated property, are as follows: Department's 1913 Estimate Department's 1916 Estimate Applicant's 1916 Estimate $2,634,756 $3,308,803 $3,433,201 The department's figures, which we accept for the basis of this order, include no cost of financing, nor working capital, nor any allow - ance for contractor's profits, its estimate having been built upon the fundamental cost basis. In projects of this character, where a con - struction company furnishes the work to construct and equip the prop - erty, without assuming any financial responsibility, 10% is the usual minimum allowance for compensation. Where the construction company enters into a contract to construct and equip a property and to deliver the same ready for operation at agreed figures, a higher percentage is invariably used to cover contingencies, such as increased cost of ma - terial, etc. Under present conditions, the constant almost daily increase in both material and labor items, together with the uncertainties of prompt delivery, etc., a larger allowance for contingencies is justified than would be under normal conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT In its original application applicant expected, and still proposes, to construct and equip the project through the medium of a construction company. The method to be employed, whether on a percentage basis of the actual cost or on a completed contract basis, is not determined. The Commission, therefore, for the purpose of its conclusion, and for the reason that in a certain degree it has a smaller element of spec - ulation, adopts the percentage basis of 10% on the engineer's estimate of $3,308,803, or $330,880.30, making a total of $3,639,683.33. In its amended order of 1913 the Commission allowed 15% for cost of financing. The applicant insists that this is insufficient and that it cannot place its securities at a price which will net it better than 80 cents on the dollar. We are convinced that applicant's officers have earnestly endeavored to finance the project under the conditions named in the prior order, and that their failure to succeed tends to sustain their contentions in this regard. We therefore find that an allowance of 20% for cost of financing is not unreasonable in this case, and that on this basis to cover this estimated cost of $3,639,683.33 an issue of $4,549,604.16 will be required. No allowance has been made in the above figures for working capital other than that included in stores and supplies, nor has any provision been made for a reserve to take care of fixed charges on the bonds dur - ing the early period of the company's operation. It is unusual, though there are exceptions to the rule, for a project of this character to de - velop a business from the commencement of its operation sufficient to pay a fair return on the investment. We deem it essential that some provision should be made whereby a reasonable cash working capital, or its equivalent, and a reserve to insure the payment of fixed charges on the bonds for at least a year after the property is placed in operation, is provided. One year's fixed charges on the $2,500,000 of five per cent bonds is $125,000. We therefore find that the applicant should be re - quired to hold as a reserve for working capital to meet its fixed charges not less than $185,000 of preferred stock as a condition precedent to the issuance of any securities herein authorized, and file with the Commission an agreement on the part of any trust company, or other responsible parties, to purchase the same at not less than 80 cents on the dollar, as the needs of the company may require. The following increases or additional items included in the estimate of applicant were not included in the estimates of the Commission's engineers: (1) An increase of $13,746 for right-of-way; (2) An item of $75,000 for crossing certain sand pits of the Platte River; (3) An item of $25,000 for additional shop equipment; (4) Working capital in excess of stores and supplies. The Commission's engineer states that the increase of $13,746 for right-of-way is probably just, but that owing to lack of time he used the 1913 figures. </seg>
            <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 243 He further states that he did not include any estimate of the cost of crossing the sand pits at Ashland for the reason that no plans and specifications were submitted and that no such item was included in the 1913 estimate. It is his opinion, however, that the applicant will be confronted with such a contingency and that the expense involved will approximate $75,000 if not more. He further states that in the matter of shop equipment he in - cluded only the items included in the 1913 estimate; that the excess item of $25,000 included in applicant's estimate covers a larger and more complete shop installation, which is a matter of discretion and policy on the part of the company and may be entirely justified considering the size and character of the property. The history of the company, which was organized in 1903, is sufficiently set out in the previous order of the Commission. The outstanding stock of 4200,000, which was sold at par, and current liabilities of $124,834.17 (much if not all of which has been expended in plant) are held or guaranteed by virtually two of the original projectors. No dividends have ever been declared and in fact none have ever been earned. These owners have entered into a contract to cancel or assume all existing liabilities and to deliver the outstanding stock now held by them in exchange for $315,000 of the proposed pre - ferred stock. From its knowledge of the history of the company and the statements of its accountant, this adjustment is approved by the Commission, subject to the applicant's compliance with the conditions hereinafter set forth in the order. The total amount of securities re - quired, if the foregoing estimates, etc., are correct, including items added by the applicant and not disapproved by the Commission's engi - neer, are as follows: For constructing, equipping and financing of uncompleted Increases and additions in the estimates of applicant not included nor disapproved by the Commission's engineer 113,746.00 Allowance for existing property 315,000.00 Reserve for working capital and payment of fixed charges - 185,000.00 Total $5,163,350.16 The increase in the amount of securities hereinafter authorized to be issued over the amount authorized by the 1913 order Is due largely to the increased cost of labor and material and in a lesser degree to an in - creased cost of financing and excess items not considered in the 1913 estimate. These increased costs are due in large measure to economic condi - tions produced by the European war. It is believed by many that at the termination of the war, the probable time of which no one can foretell, there will be a material falling off in prices both for material and labor. For this reason the Commission deems it proper that the Commission reserve the authority, on its own motion, to cancel the order herein un - less the applicant shall within six months from the date of this order portion $4,549,604.16 </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT comply with the requirements set forth in the order, showing that the project has been financed and the contracts for construction and equip - ment entered into. It might be argued that the construction of projects of this kind should not be encouraged during a period of high cost and that applicant should be required to defer same until prices have receded to a lower level. This may or may not be within the discretion of the Commission, but it may be argued with equal force that in the event of the cessation of the war and the resultant falling off of cost there might be such a disturbance in the money market as to preclude the financing of the project. If it be contended that the order entered herein is unduly lib - eral in its allowance, it is sufficient to say that the completion and cosl of the project is of more importance to the people of the state than that an absolutely correct and just issuance of securities be determined. Similar cricitism was made of previous orders, yet the project re - mained uncompleted. In any event the general public will not suffer, neither as an in vestor nor as a user, for the reasons set forth in the 1913 order, to-wit: "First, because the order prohibits the sale of any portion of the securities to the general public until the line of road shall have been completed, at which time its actual cost will be known and published by the Commission "Second, because the capitalization of the company will not be a controlling factor when the question of rates arises. The 'fair value' of the property devoted to the use of the public will be the determining factor, and the actual cost in constructing and equip - ping the line which the Commission will have in its records when completed, will have its proper consideration and full weight in de- termining what the 'fair value" is." The fact that a part of the stock of a corporation outstanding at any time has been issued with the approval of the Commission cannot be held to constitute a guaranty in any way that rates may be charged by such corporation to enable it to pay dividends at any given rate upon its entire capitalization. The Commission therefore finds that the issuance and sale of two million five hundred thousand ($2,500,000) dollars of thirty-year five per cent bonds, five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars of six per cent cumulative preferred stock, and two million ($2,000,000) dollars of com - mon stock is reasonably required for the purposes provided by statute and should be approved, subject to the conditions prescribed in the •rder.

In re Cancellation of a Part of General Order No. 19 and Substituting a Distance Tariff with the Reasonable Rates as Found by the Interstate Commerce Commission. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: These two applications were combined and heard together by the Commission on September 29, 1916. Application No. 2907 asked that the Nebraska Commission approve a schedule of rates from certain Ne - braska jobbing points to stations in Nebraska, which was established by the carriers applicants herein in alleged compliance with an order promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission in opinion No. 3800, in an alleged attempt to remove discrimination found to exist as between certain east-bank Missouri Rirer cities and Nebraska stations. The Nebraska Commission is of the opinion that the rates as pro - mulgated by the carriers do not remove the discrimination found by the Interstate Commerce Commission, but on the other hand increases the difference in the rates that existed under the rafts as promulgated by ths Nebraska Commission in General Order No. 19. The Nebraska Commission is further of the opinion that the orders APPLICATION NOS. 2906 and 2907 </seg>
            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 249 entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission are not justified by the record in the cases heard and considered by the Commission which brought forth opinion No. 3800. In Application No. 2906 the carriers asked the Nebraska Commission to cancel and make void its order issued in General Order No. 19, which became effective September 6, 1914, as applied to all traffic moving on class rates in classification application between all stations in the state of Nebraska. No evidence was submitted before the Commission that would justify the cancellation of the rates promulgated in General Order No. 19 nor the classification provisions as promulgated in Nebraska Classification No. 1 and supplements thereto. The Nebraska Commission is therefore of the opinion that the ap - plications herein considered, viz., Application No. 2906 and Application No. 2907, should be and the same are hereby dismissed.

            <seg id="p252">252 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT REPORT Due notice of the pendency of the application was given to the authorities of the several cities and villages interested and through the public press of Butler county. The matter came on for hearing before the Commission at Lincoln, Nebraska, on January 18, 1917. Protestants appeared representing the city of David City, the Commercial Club of David City and the subscribers to the telephone service purchased of the Surprise company. They objected to the proposed consolidation on the following grounds: First: That the Commission was without jurisdiction to approve of the consolidation. Second: That applicant had not proceeded according to law in the matter. Third: That the consolidation would be detrimental to existing tele - phone service. Remonstrators objected further to any increase of existing rates in case the consolidation should be approved and asked that under a consolidation, the applicant be required to give interchange of service with all of the exchanges in Butler county owned by other telephone companies on the ground that the county was a necessary and practical unit of telephone service. At the beginning of the hearing the Commission overruled the ob jection to the jurisdiction, and extended the issues by taking jurisdic - tion of the purchase by applicant of the Surprise and Octavia properties on the ground that the purchases were invalid without the approval of the Commission. Protestants assigned no reasons and cited no authorities against the jurisdiction of the Commission to approve of the consolidation of exist - ing telephone properties, and statute recognizes the right to consolidate competing telephone plants (Sec. 7415, Revised Statutes of Nebraska). Such consolidation, however, is subject to the approval of the Commission within the reasonable exercise of its powers. The constitutional pro - vision which created the Commission made it the duty of the Commission to regulate the service and exercise general control of common carriers. "Service" and "general control" are very broad terms. Definition is un - necessary to show their application to the consolidation of existing tele - phone service, such an act involving not only a unification of service, but Additional charge to two parties using the same telephone, including extra listing: Business 1200 Residence apartments, boarding houses, etc 6.00 Additional charge for extra listing (tor sub- scribers only) 3.00 Additional charge, extension telephone: Business 12.00 Residence 6.00 Additional charge: Extension bells (2% to 3 inches) 3.00 Extension gong (4 to 6 inches) 6.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 253 also the elimination of competition and the establishment of new rates tor the changed service. Consolidation goes to the very heart of the prin - cipal factors of state control of public service, and if the Commission has no authority in the matter, it is without any power whatsoever. The same considerations apply to the jurisdiction of the Commission over the sale and purchase of the Surprise and Octavia properties as be - tween the parties to the transactions. The Surprise company sold approx - imately forty per cent of its public service property, and the Octavia com - pany all of its property, to applicant. The Surprise company transac - tion severed almost in twain, and along purely arbitrary lines, the service previously furnished by it, and local ownership if both properties gave way to foreign ownership, small holding companies to one giant com - pany. There is little doubt that no substantial part of a property uaed In supplying a public service can be disposed of or purchased without the approval of the state through some of its agencies. The property cannot be installed without the consent of the state, inasmuch as the power of eminent domain or equivalent powers are required. Therefore, it fol - lows necessarily that it cannot be removed without a like consent. Moreover, property devoted to a public use is charged with a trust char - acter in favor of the public. The trust has its foundation in the laws permitting private individuals and companies to conduct a natural monop - oly and, additional in the case of telephone companies, to build their pole lines upon the public highways. The rights and privileges thus granted contain the reciprocal obligation of the grantee to continue to furnish the service after installing the plant, and the grantee may not do anything which will in any substantial measure disable it in discharg - ing the obligation without the consent of the state. A fundamental part of the law of trusts is that the parties cannot be changed without common consent, and this is vital in the case of public service properties. It may be that the purchaser is lacking in means or administrative ability to continue the service, and the result of the transaction is foreseen in reason to be a great deterioration of the service and possibly complete abandonment. Quoting from Pond's work on "Public Utilities" (1913) Section 238: "The power does not inhere in the trustee to defeat the carry - ing out of the trust by disposing of the trust property. The inter - ests of the beneficiaries under the trust are guarded against any loss on this account and conserved by the courts holding that such prop - erty cannot be disposed of by the municipality or other corporation owning it unless under authority conferred especially by statute. The state alone, which attends to the matter of creating these trusts as well as to the selection of the trustees, has the power to provide for their destruction by sale or for their diversion as to trustees by lease or assignment." The parties to the trust in the instant case, insofar as it relates to the property purchased by applicant, are the state on the one hand and the Surprise and Octavia companies on the other. The agency created </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT REPORT by the state to direct and control the administration of the trust is the Commission, and while the Surprise and Octavia companies are not parties to this proceeding, the applicant invoked the jurisdiction of the Commission as to consolidation and rates, and makes no objection to the Commission assuming upon its own motion jurisdiction of the pur - chase. Therefore, while the Commission lacks power in the instant case to annul the purchases by reason of defect of parties, it may impose such conditions to the approval of the purchasers, to the consolidation of the properties purchased with applicant's original plant, and to the fixing of new rates, as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of the Surprise and Octavia companies' trusts. This can doubt - less be done under the Commission's powers of general control of the service and affairs of applicant, also, but inasmuch as the Commission recognizes the existence of the aforementioned trusts, and seeks by its order herein to provide for their fulfillment, a discussion of the sub - ject is considered necessary. The Commission perceives no obstades to carrying out the trusts by the consolidation of the purchased properties with applicant's original property, but rather an extension and betterment of the service lo sub - scribers connected with the exchanges and lines bought of the Surprise and Octavia companies by such consolidation; and at rates little if anv greater than the old rates, taking into consideration the changed service. Telephone service in Butler county, as it existed previous to the purchases in question, and as it still exists awaiting the approval of the Commission to consolidate, is reflected in the rate schedules set out supra, but a study of the county from the position of ths people who use the service is necessary to determine the justice of their demand for an interchange of service between all of the exchanges in the county ?t flat rates, or what is usually termed zone service. Butler county is one of the best agricultural counties in the state. It is approximately twenty - four miles square. It has one large urban center — David City, with a population of about 2,500, situate in almost the exact center of the coun - ty, which is also the county seat. There are ten other towns in the county ranging in population from one to eight hundred, which surround the county seat. Telephone exchanges exist at all of these points con - nected with each otVer in one way and another by trunk lines, the serv - ice over which lines was paid for partly at flat rates and partly toll, or single message rates. These exchanges together with outlying farm lines were owned by five separate companies, but they were operated as two zones so far as the privileges of service were concerned. And these privileges were taken advantage of by a considerable majority of th9 subscribers. The Surprise company was the principal one in the field. It had exchanges at seven of the eleven urban centers of the county, including David City, and its farm lines together with those of the company own - ing the exchange at Ulysses, with which it had interchange of service, covered the western two-thirds of the county. The Lincoln company was next in size. It maintained exchanges at David City ana Brainard, </seg>
            <seg id="p255">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 255 and its farm lines, together with those of the Octavia company and of the companies owning the exchanges at Linwood and Abie with whom it had interchange of service, covered the eastern half of the county mainly. The Surprise and Lincoln companies had competing exchanges at David City and Brainard and their farm lines paralleled each other In the neigh - borhood of these points. There was no interchange of service between these two zones at flat rates, only toll service at fifteen cents per message. The people of David City and Brainard and contiguous farm territory were able to obtain service throughout the whole county by subscrib - ing to both zones. The purchase from the Surprise company split the county almost in twain, as far as the service of that company was concerned. It had about 1600 subscribers in the county and the property which supplied service to 720 of them was sold to the Lincoln company. Thase sub - scribers thus transferred, live in David City, Brainard, Bruno and Garrison and farming territory contiguous thereto, all of it being in the east - ern half of the county, with the exception of about 70 square miles of ter - ritory west and southwest of David City. The Surprise company re - tained the exchanges at Surprise, Rising City, and Bellwood in the west - ern part of the county, with their eight to nine hundred subscribers. The result will be, if no interchange of service is provided under the consolidation, that these subscribers, together with approximately three hundred subscribers to the Ulysses exchange residing in Butler county, will be cut off from interchange, or what is commonly called, free, serv - ice with the political and commercial center of the county — David City, and from hundreds of friends and even neighbors along the new zone boundaries, with whom they formerly had communication at flat rates. Applicant admits that the purchase divides the service in the western half of the county on arbitrary lines, and that, barring the intervention of the Commission, the division is permanent unless the Surprise com - pany should sell the remainder of its plant to applicant. Protestants' chief objection was to this sunderance of the service. The authorities and the commercial club of David City, and leading citi - zens in various parts of the county, protested vigorously, and remon - strances signed by 491 subscribers to the former Surprise service were filed with the Commission. They showed that there was an overwhelm - ing demand from the telephone patrons in the county for more or less complete interchange of service at flat rates by the month, and that this demand was natural and legitimate in view of the commercial and politi - cal unity of the county. There is a condition in the telephone field, and in every other pub lie service field, to which too little consideration is given by those who produce and sell the service, to-wit, the needs and wishes of the pur - chasers. This is doubtless due to the absence of competition, as even the whims and caprices of buyers in the competitive field are catered to. In so far as the service demanded of public utilities is practically capa - ble of production, the public is entitled to it so long as they are willing to pay for it. And this willingness is attested by the highly prosperous </seg>
            <seg id="p256">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT REPORT 256 condition of practically all common carriers that have been honestly and prudently managed. Owners and operators of such plants should bear in mind that they occupy the field through public sufferance, and that the public themselves can produce and supply such service as they desire without delegating the work to others. The Commission, therefore, approves of the purchase of the Surprise and Octavia properties and their consolidation with applicant's original property, only on condition that an interchange of service at flat monthly rates be arranged for between the subscribers connected to its exchanges in Butler county under the consolidation, and the subscribers connected to the Surprise company exchanges in the county, optional with each sub - scriber, and at ths rates to such service, and according to the arrange - ment for the division of the revenue therefrom between the companies, as hereinafter set forth. This interchange of service shall also include the Butler county subscribers connected with the Ulysses exchange, and Butler county subscribers connected with the Abie and Linwood inde - pendent exchanges separately from the Surprise and Ulysses subscribers, due to their location in the northeastern part of the county. It would be impracticable to give an interchange of service between the Surprise and Ulysses subscribers in the western part of the county and the Able and Linwood subscribers in the northeastern part, there being no direct connection between them; and there is practically no demand for it. This interchange must be effected, however, at like rates for lika service, regardless of the company with which the subscriber is con - nected directly. For example, a business subscriber of the Surprise com - pany must pay the same rate for the unified service that a business sub - scriber of the Lincoln company in the same class of exchanges must pay. Otherwise, the company charging a lower rate will gradually encroach upon the legitimate business of the company charging the higher rate, particularly along farm lines, which would be unfair under the circum - stances and amount to unjust discrimination. For this purpose, the ex - changes at Surprise, Rising City, Bellwood, Ulysses, Abie and Linwood are placed in the same class with Brainard, Bruno, Dwight and Garrison of the Lincoln company, and David City Is placed in a class by itself, owing to the larger local service, and the interchange service rates of the Surprise, Ulysses and Abie-Linwood companies shall be the difference between the rates paid them for local service and the rates authorized for unified service. The question of a reasonable charge for interchange of service be - tween subscribers of one telephone company and those of another has been considered by the Commission in one form or another in connec - tion with a number of companies. Switching service is somewhat analo - gous to this interchange of service and is furnished by many exchanges in the state. This service is performed usually for farmers' companies who have no exchange of their own, and the service is for the purpose of effecting communication within the immediate locality of the exchange. The Commission has found charges of from thirty-five cents to sixty cents per month per subscriber to be reasonable for switching service under </seg>
            <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 257 the varying circumstances of the situations presented to the Commission. The interchange of service between subscribers of different companies differs from switching in that all of the calls must come in over one or more trunk lines connecting the exchanges. The calls under interchange of service are very much less in number proportionately than in the case of switching, and the cost of responding to the calls and making connec - tion is also less proportionately. The temporary rates for interchange service are fixed at fifty cents per month for business telephones and twenty-five cents per month for all other telephones, in addition to the regular rates, and separately as to the Surprise company exchanges, the Ulysses exchange, and the Abie and Linwood exchanges considered as a third interchange zone. This ■gives Lincoln company subscribers interchange of service with one or the other of these zones at the additional rates of fifty and twenty-five cents, respectively, with two zones at one dollar and fifty cents and entire county service at one dollar and fifty cents and seventy-five cents respectively, according to the class of service used. And it gives the Surprise, Ulysses and Abie-Linwood zone interchange of service with the Lincoln company subscribers at rates varying with the relation of their local rates to the combined rates. Such interchange of service shall be confined, however, to the subscriber's station, or tele phone, for the purpose of enabling the companies to exclude illicit use. Manifestly, exchange operators cannot become acquainted with the voices of subscribers on other exchanges so as to determine if the calling sub - scriber is entitled to interchange service. These additional rates are believed to be compensatory for the extra service, but will, of course, be made the subject of thorough investiga - tion at a hearing for permanent rates. The creation of separate inter - change zone rates is almost a necessity for accounting reasons, the com - panies affected having to account to each other for equitable proportions of the revenue from this source. The revenue from these interchange rates shall be apportioned in an equitable manner between the com - panies furnishing the service, according to mutual agreement, subject to the approval of the Commission. All subscribers who do not elect to take unified service will be re - quired to pay toll rates for messages destinating on lines other than those with which they have such service, which rates temporarily are fixed ai ten cents between adjoining exchanges and between the David City ex - change and every other exchange in the county, and at fifteen cents be - tween all other exchanges In the county. This applies also to non-sub - scribers. Toll service may be had at any subscriber's station with the consent of such subscriber and upon his approving the charge for the service to his account. Any subscriber permitting thb use of his tele - phone for toll service without approving of the charge to his account shall pay a charge in addition to that for the toll service in question of twenty-five cents. And any subscriber failing for a period of thirty days to pay all charges assessed against him shall be subject to the termina - tion of all telephone service by the company of which he is a subscriber, </seg>
            <seg id="p258">258 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT which service shall not be restored except upon the payment of th« account and a fee of $2.00 to cover the cost of disconnection and re - connection, subject, however, to the action of the Commission upon com plaint as to the correctness of the account. These conditions are necessary by reason of the optional character of the interchange service, and in recognition of the probability that a considerable part of the subscribers will not subscribe for such service. The service privileges will thus be mixed at all of the exchanges, some subscribers having single zone service only, others two, three and four zone service. And the habit, if not the vice, of preying upon the service of public utilities is so considerable in extent that unless it is pro - tected by more or less radical measures, the vast majority of the patrons, who are honest, will be deprived of the service they need and to which they are entitled. Such service as the order herein provides for is impossible unless it is honestly availed of. The cost of it will be con - siderable in the way of additional trunk lines between the exchanges and additional operating and accounting work; and if the revenue from the service fails to meet the cost, including a reasonable return upon the capital invested, it will either have to be abandoned or all of the sub - scribers required to take the unified service without regard for need, which would be an unjustifiable hardship especially if invoked in behalf of a minority who wanted the service. The Commission trusts that the subscribers will co-operate with the companies affected by this order in making the new service completely successful. The decision of the Commission approving of the purchase of ths competing telephone properties and their consolidation with applicant's original property, provided the service is not violently disrupted, is in line with the previous holdings of the Commission and with the holdings of other commissions. In connection with one of the plants involved here - in, this Commission in 1915 denied the application of the Surprise com - pany for leave to require three-fifths of its subscribers to take the unified service of all of its exchanges at an increased rate over their protest. In re application of Antelope County Mutual Telephone company, Second Annual Report, 148, the Commission said: "It is the opinion of the Commission that, in fairness to the pa - trons of a local exchange and particularly those who do not use the county or long distance service, rates should be provided for a serv - ice limited to the local exchange service and an additional blanket charge for added exchange or county service, or a separate charge for each long distance call." In re application of Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, for permission to consolidate exchanges in the Lincoln district, Sixth Annual Report, 183, the Commission approved of the consolidation and said in the course of the opinion: "It can no longer be seriously doubted that with regulation the widest and most efficient telephone service as well as the lowest rates are possible only when one operating company has the entire busi - ness of a community or territory. It is a waste of capital and a dis - advantage to the public to have two such corporations competing </seg>

The Illinois Public Utility Commission, in Husy et al. v. Gibson Home Telephone company, 1916-B P. U. R., 172, involving a similar question, said: "An arbitrary division of rural territory between the telephone companies will not be changed and subscribers transferred to the company which should naturally serve them, although they are re - ceiving inefficient service, where there is free interchange of serv - ice and the Commission can require adequate service." The Michigan Railroad Commission, in re Valley Home Telephone company, et al, 1915-A, P. U. R. 55, authorized the consolidation of tele - phone properties on condition that the previous service be restored, say - ing in the opinion: 'Telephone mergers should provide for extending rather than curtailing the use of telephone facilities The New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners, in the case of Meerbott v.

R. 369, said, apropos of a situation similar to that in the present case: "The subscribers in the given locality are better served by being included as part of a local service area of another community than they would be if set apart in a theoretical area by themselves and compelled to pay toll for outside communication, where it appears that from eighty to eighty-five per cent of their messages terminate in the local service area of the place with which they are connected." Complaint was made during the hearing by some of the stockholders of the Octavia company that the price paid by applicant for the Octavia plant was considerably below its real value and that the sale and consolidation should not be approved for that reason. The Commission considers that it does not have jurisdiction of such a matter. The record shows prima facie that conveyance of the Octavia plant was made to the applicant and it fails to show that the conveyance was not legally made, or that any fraud was practiced by the applicant. At any rate, if there be sufficient ground for the complaint, it is exclusively with - in the jurisdiction of the courts, and any relief due will have to be se - cured through that channel. As said by the Kansas Public Utilities Com - mission, in re Northeast Kansas Telephone company, 1916-B, P. U. R. 927: "The law providing for the approval of a lease by the CominiB - sion, however, does not contemplate that it shall consider the equity of the lease between the parties thereto, but does contemplate that inquiry into the facts as to whether or not the lessee will be able to carry out the franchise obligations of the lessor to the public and whether or not it will be able to furnish the community with effi - cient and sufficient service." </seg>
            <seg id="p260">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 260 FLAT RATES The matter of flat or monthly rates for service within applicant's zone is the most important matter to be determined in so far as the revenues are concerned, and though the application is for temporary rates only, such rates should approximate fair and reasonable rates as near as may be, from the fact that the fixing of permanent rates on a reasonable basis requires an inventory and valuation of the property, and also an ac - counting study by the Commission. The applicant made a prima facie showing of the principal factors that enter into the fixing of such rates, under the present separate opera - tion of the three plants involved, minus however the element of duplicate property, when consolidated. The cost of the properties purchased is shown and claim is made for a definite replacement or reproduction new value of its original property. No present fair value is shown of any of the property, except as it is reflected in the purchase price of the Sur - prise and Octavia properties. The purchase and claimed replacement costs of the properties are as follows: Property of the Surprise company ..$38,000.00 Property of the Octavia company 1,450.00 Replacement cost of the Lincoln company property 96,189.55 Total $135,639.55 According to applicant's testimony it paid full fair value for the Sur - prise property, which is doubtless true. The Octavia property, which comprises pole lines only, was obtained at less than fair value. Accord - ing to the testimony of one of the stockholders of the Octavia company, the plant originally cost $1,775.00, and additions and betterments since the original installation amounted to $1,440.00. However, the piant was over twelve years old and a considerable part of the poles needs to be re - set. Its condition per cent, therefore, cannot be said to be in excess of seventy. The result would be a present fair value of the Octavia prop - erty of about $2,250.00, or $800.00 in excess of the sum paid for it. The character of the value placed by applicant upon its original property does not admit of much consideration in the fixing of rates. All that applicant claims for it is a reproduction new value arrived at arbi - trarily without inventory. Such a value is of little weight in the fixing of rates, inasmuch as it may have little relation to the present fair value of the property. Reproduction value based upon actual inventory and present costs of labor and material is necessary, however, to the ascer - tainment of the revenue required to be raised to maintain the property, inasmuch as the material and labor required for such maintenance must be secured at present prices. The claimed reproduction value herein lacks this foundation and in view of the extraordinary high value per telephone claimed, when compared with corresponding unit costs of tne Surprise and Octavia properties and known reproduction values of other similar properties, the reproduction new value claimed by applicant must be largely disregarded. </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 261 The manner in which applicant's original property was obtained, and applicant's failure to show definitely the cost of additions and better - ments made to the plant since that time, also throws considerable light upon the claimed reproduction value. The record shows as previous^ cited that the property was originally bought by the applicant in 1912, and in conjunction with a large number of other telephone plants, no separate consideration being assigned for the property involved in this proceeding. Payment was made therefor in preferred stock of the ap - plicant of a value not shown. True, the issuance of the stock was ap - proved by the Commission but the approval was nominal only. The Commission made no investigation as to the value of the property taken for the securities, and the approval was under the policy of the Com - mission that securities are not a proper basis for rate-making. The Commission in re application of the O. L. A. B Railway company for authority to issue securities, Sixth Annual Report, 265, quoted the following excerpt from an opinion of the New Hampshire Commission, as expressing the position of the Commission of Nebraska in such mat - ters : "Whenever the Commission is called upon to exercise its rate - making powers, it must be governed by the fair value of the property devoted to public uses in the performance of the service for which a rate is to be fixed. In determining such fair value the amount of stock and bonds outstanding, if entitled to consideration at all, is entitled to very slight consideration, and the question whether the Is - suance of such stock and bonds or any part of the same has been with the approval of any regulatory commission cannot be entitled to any weight at all, because it will not be relevant to the question of the fair value of the property involved." A comparison of the unit cost per telephone of the reproduction value claimed by applicant with the same unit costs of the Surprise and Octavia company purchases, with the purchase of the Seward county plant by applicant at the same time it purchased the Butler county property, and the costs of other similar plants as found by this Commis - sion is as follows: Claimed reproduction value of applicant's plant $131.10 per telephone Cost of Surprise company purchase 44.87 per telephone Cost of Octavia company purchase 11.18 per telephone Cost of Seward county purchase, including toll line 65.32 per telephone 78.80 per telephone Cost of York county system Cost of Nebraska Telephone company's 77.60 per telephone state system Applicant's original property in Butler county is comparable in a de - gree to the property purchased of the Surprise company. Both systems are metallic circuit and the current is individual battery and magneto. The chief difference in the monetary values of the two properties lies in the greater condition per cent of applicant's property and the propor - tionately greater amount of cable in use on it. Applicant placed the condition per cent of its property at eighty and that of the Surprise com- </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT pany at sixty, which is corroborated by testimony as to the comparative efficiency of the plants. Also the grade of poles in place on applicant's property is better than those on the Surprise property. Due considera - tion of the differences between the two properties warrants the assump - tion of a value in applicant's original property of fifty per cent per tele - phone in excess of the value of the Surprise property. This gives a unit value per telephone of applicant's original property of $67.30. That this method of arriving at the present fair value of applicant's original property is fair and reasonable under the circumstances of this case, is evident from applicant's own use of the method in support of the rates asked for herein. It claims that the rates should be in ha« - mony with the rates charged for similar service elsewhere. Manifestly, therefore, in a proceeding wherein no inventory or valuation of the prop - erty is in evidence, it is fair to make temporary values in harmony with known values elsewhere. The duplication of exchanges and pole lines involved in the pur - chases is confined to the Surprise property. The record is deficient as to the value of this duplicate property and, for that reason, and the fact that the rates provided for in the order are temporary only, no deduction will be made on account of duplicate property. The Commission will re - tain jurisdiction of the matter for the purpose of making a valuation and accounting study of its own after the properties have been consoli - dated and due time had for experiment with the temporary rates, at which time duplication will be eliminated and only the property neces - sary to furnish the service will be taken into account. There is a considerable part of applicant's original property in But - ler county which is distinguishable from the ordinary telephone system, to-wit, the heavy long distance lead traversing the county north and south. It is part of the long distance lines leading from Lincoln to Seward, David City and Columbus, at which latter point it connects with the lines of the Nebraska Telephone company to Norfolk and the northwest. The lead carries five copper metallic circuits and is of standard construction. The Commission's engineer reports that the cost of construction of such a lead at the normal market prices of material and labor is $486.43 a mile. It is approximately forty miles long from the point where it enters But - ler county on the south to Columbus. This gives the sum of $23,457. 2u as the reproduction new value of the line and, according to the record, it is in the same condition per cent as the remaining portion of applicant's original property, viz., eighty per cent. The present fair value of the line is, therefore, $18,765.76. The record does not show whether or not any of the line is being used -to carry exchange wires in addition to the long distance wires, but such use can possibly amount to very little, from the fact that it passes through but one of applicant's exchanges, David City. Applicant testified to the necessity for considerable betterments to the purchased properties in order to bring the service upon them up to the standard previaling upon its original property. It estimated the cost of them together with the cost of consolidating the exchanges at $25,000. - 00, and reported to the Commission on July 14, 1917, that $15,000.00 of this </seg>
            <seg id="p263">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 263 amount had already been expended for betterments to the plant. Thi Commission is of the opinion that the cost of consolidating the proper - ties will be covered by the salvage value of duplicate property removed, but that allowance should be made for maintenance and depreciation on these betterments and for return upon investment. The Commission finds for the purpose of the temporary rates that the present fair values of the properties involved herein, including the ex - tra toll line property, and the cost of immediate betterments thereto, is as follows: Applicant's original exchange property, 720 stations at $67.30 each $ 48,455.00 Applicant's toll line property 18,765.00 Property purchased of Surprise company 38,000.00 Property purchased of Octavia company 2,250.00 Cost of betterments 15,000.00 Total $122,470.00 And the following reproduction new values: Applicant's exchange property $48,455 plus 25% $ 60,570.00 Applicant's toll line property $18,765.00 plus 25% 23,455.00 Surprise company property $38,000 plus 25% 47,500.00 Octavia company property $2,250 plus 25 2.810.00 Cost of betterments 15,000.00 Total $149,335. 0w The addition of 25% to present fair value for the purpose of arriving at reproduction new value corresponds to the depreciation in applicant's original property, according to the record, and is in line with the dif - ference that usually prevails between such values in normally main - tained telephone plants. It is considerably less than the depreciation shown to exist in the property purchased of the Surprise company, but a larger allowance than 25% would enable applicant to eventually re - store the Surprise property to the normal standard of efficiency out of the rates, which is not permissible unless the added value is set apart in a trust fund for the benefit of subscribers and upon which no return be given to stockholders. In dstermining upon the rates to be charged for the consolidated serv - ice at applicant's own exchanges, it will be necessary to provide a reve - nue which will pay the operating costs and the cost of a normal upkeep of the system, in addition to a reasonable return upon the fair valus of the property. It is impossible to forecast with any reasonable degree of certainty the revenues that will flow from such service, for the reason, that many readjustments will doubtless follow the consolidation through the changing of subscribers from one class of service to another; also the number of subscribers that will take interchange service is probls - matical. Applicant submits the results of operating its original property and the Surprise property for four months ending November 30, 1916, and the Octavia property for two months ending that date, upon the basis of </seg>
            <seg id="p264">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 264 the old rates. The average .monthly revenue is shown to be $2,944.22, and the average monthly expenditure for all purposes, $1,983.98. Ex - tending these amounts so as to embrace a whole year gives $35,3?u.64 as the estimate of annual revenue, and $23,807.76 as the estimate of annual expenditure. The collections of the several exchanges for toll service were included in the average monthly revenue and in the estimate of an - nual revenue, the amount thus included in the estimate being $7,881.80. Applicant contends that its Butler county exchanges should not be credited with more than 25% of their toll collections, giving as its reason the statutory provision for the division of toll revenues between separate - ly owned companies. The statute provides for the allocation of 25% of such revenues to the originating and destinating exchanges, 15' , and 10% to each respectively and 75% to the companies owning the connecting tele - phone lines and exchanges, substantially according to the distance the message unit is transmitted. Applicant made no showing on the basts of such a division, and admitted that practically all of the business repre - sented by the collections made at its exchanges was dune over its own lines. It did not claim that the statute applied to the instant case and cited it merely as an example. The record shows that all of the expense of operating and maintain- ing applicant's toll property in the county, including taxes and overhead expense, is charged to the exchanges. The wages paid toll operators at the exchanges for the period included in applicant's showing alone amount to 21% of toll collections, conclusively showing that the alloca - tion of that proportion to the exchanges is inequitable. And if all of the expense of furnishing long distance service over applicant's lines in the county is to be charged to the exchanges, manifestly the revenues earned by those lines must be credited to them. If such a division were made, it is a fair surmise, in view of the extent of toll property in the county, that the exchanges would receive more than their gross collec - tions of toll revenues. However, the burden was upon applicant to show that these collections did not belong to the exchanges, and it having failed utterly to do so, credit is given to the exchanges in the estimate based on collections for all such revenues, at the same time including the toll line property with the exchange properties in the fixing of local rates. Analysis of the cost of operating and maintaining the properties dur- ing the period covered by applicant's showing, and extending it to cover a year's time, gives the following: Total $23,806.76 The fact that the cost taken as a basis for the foregoing table cov - ered less than one-third of a year, and was under separate operating of the three properties, makes it somewhat undependable as a basis for cost under consolidation, yet the variations from experiences of other plants are not great. Current maintenance and repairs is 5.4 per cent of the re- [aintenance and repairs peratlng and administration ent and taxes $ 7,214.4i 14.762.H 1,830.2 </seg>
            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 265 production new value exclusive of betterments fixed by the Commission, supra, and the remaining costs average $9.51 per subscriber's station. Corresponding costs in other plants approximate 6% for maintenance and repairs, and $10.50 per station for all other expenses inclusive of toll ex - penses. Actual expenditures during a single year, however, do not usually re - flect the average expenditures during a series of years, especially in the case of telephone plants. Large portions of such plants reach the end of their usefulness during some one year, such as switchboards, poles, wire, cable, etc., and have been replaced in that year. Storms occasion - ally destroy a considerable part of s\ich plants also, and improvements in the service, such as the substitution of a common battery system for the individual magneto, call for the sudden elimination of. much property in which there is little salvage value. Experience, therefore, shows the ne - cessity of setting aside from revenues annually a sum sufficient to make good any extraordinary depletions in the plant when they occur, and the Commission estimates in view of the present abnormally high cost of telephone property material that a sum equal to 3% annually of the reproduction new value is required for this purpose. Time will tell if this allowance is correct and if not it will be readjusted to correspond to the facts. It shall be consolidated with the allowance for current maintenance and repairs, but a detailed statement shall be made to tne Commission of all replacement expenditures, and its approval secured be - fore charges therefor to the maintenance and depreciation fund shall be final. Extensions and betterments made for this fund shall not be added to capital account, nor shall any returns thereon accrue to stock - holders, the better policy being to make such improvements direct from capital account. Any considerable unused portion of this fund shall be invested for the benefit of the fund in the plant, if required, at the same return allowed stockholders, otherwise in such income-bearing securities as may be realized upon readily in case of need for carrying out the purpose of the fund. We have, therefore, the following estimate of fixed charges annually for which revenue must be provided: Operating and general expense, 1571 stations @ $10.50.. ..$16,495. 50 Maintenance and depreciation, 9% of reproduction new value of existing property $149,555 13,440.15 Return to stockholders 7% of present value of existing property $122,470 8,572.90 Total $38,508.5h Comparing the sum of these charges with the previous estimate of collections at the exchanges under separate operation — $35,330.64, it is evi - dent that only a slight increase of rates is necessary in addition to tak - ing care of the loss of revenue caused by the elimination of duplicate stations. There are 174 duplicate stations, mostly business, the annual revenue from which under the Surprise and Octavia company scales is </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT approximately $3,350.00. They were included in the estimate of collec - tions, supra, but are eliminated in the foregoing estimate of cost. The chief thing necessary in the fixing of new rates, therefore, is a relatively fair adjustment as between the several classes of subscribers. Applicant asks for the same rate on eac.h class of subscribers throughout the zone — $36.00 per annum on business subscribers, $24.00 on individual residence subscribers, and $18.00 on two-party and farm residence sub - scribers. A uniform business rate does not justly reflect the use made by - such subscribers in the zone under consideration. The average use of the telephone by subscribers in David City is undoubtedly greater than the cor - responding uses in the other towns for the reason that the comparative populations of these exchange centers are as three or four to one in favor of David City, and use corresponds in a measure to local population. The rates in David City should, therefore, be higher than the correspond - ing rates in the other towns, the exact ratio being impossible of ascer - tainment for lack of any definite measure of the service. The following schedule, containing the numbers of subscribers ac - cording to classes (estimated as between one and two-party residence at the ratio of one to four respectively), the rates applicable to each class, an H :L.c promised revenue from such rates, and from tolls on the statu - tory basis of apportionment, is believed to be fair and reasonable to ap - plicant and subscribers, at least until the properties have been consoli - dated and reasonable time given for trial: $2,118.00 I AVID CITY: 137 business telephones @ $36 per annum $4,932.00 81 individual residence telephones @ $21 per annum 1,701.00 402 two-party residence telephones @ $18 per annum 7,236.00 327 farm residence telephones @ $18 per annum 5,886.00 $19,755.00 RAINARD: 31 business- telephones @ $30 per annum $ 930.00 6 one-party residence telephones @ $18 per annum 108.00 24 two-party residence telephones @ $15 per annum 360.00 162 farm residence telephones @ $18 per annum 2,916.00 • 4,314.00 IRUNO: 17 business telephones @ $30 per annum $ 510.00 3 one-party residence telephones @ $18 per annum '.. 54.00 10 two-party residence telephones @ $15 per annum 150.00 78 farm residence telephones @ $18 per annum 1,404.00 </seg>

The period of one year, or until August 1, 1918, is believed to bt&gt; necessary to a fair trial of the new rates. Within that period the plants should be consolidated and working smoothly, the classification of sub - scribers definitely determined, and the earnings and expenses upon a stable basis.

In the Matter of the Application of the Lin - coln Telephone A Telegraph Company for Authority to Consolidate Exchanges at David City and Brainard and to Establish a Schedule of Rates at Its Exchanges in Butler County. MINORITY OPINION Taylor, Commissioner (dissenting) : While concurring in the findings of the majority with respect to most of the issues involved, I am unable to join in that portion of the order which provides for a continuation and enlargement of county service on a flat rate basis. My views on this question remain the same as they were when I prepared the opinion and order in Application No. 2082. In that case the Surprise Telephone company, a portion of whose property is included in this proceeding, was denied authority to increase its rate so as to provide for unlimited interchange of service between its various exchanges. It is unnecessary to repeat my discus - sion of unlimited "county" service made at that time, except to re - state my position with particular reference to the facts as they are presented in this case. In this connection I might say that my study of telephone service and rates since that case was decided has strength - ened the opinion expressed at that time. I cannot subscribe to the theory expressed by the majority that the county constitutes the natural unit for telephone service. It is upon that assumption that the rather complicated system of rates and rules have been constructed in this case. The fact that the county is a political subdivision, within which certain governmental functions are </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 271 exercised, does not indicate necessarily that it is a unit for commercial, agricultural and social purposes. Civic centers develop without any reference to county lines. These centers are almost invariably served by a telephone exchange which furnishes intercommunication between a majority if not all of the people within its area. Its lines radiate in all directions, crossing county lines as readily as township or school district boundaries, following naturally the currents of business and social activity. The relation of such civic centers to the county seat is more or less incidental. Indeed, it often happens that such a center is connected by commercial and industrial ties with some town or city in another county. There are striking illustrations of this situation in the instant case. The exchange at Linwood, for example, located in the extreme northeast corner of Butler county, doubtless has a number of lines and many subscribers in Saunders, Dodge and OoVfax counties, none of whom are remotely interested in a connection with David City, and much less concerned with an exchange of service with the towns in the southwest part of the county. Rather, their interests lie to the north and east. In order to afford these subscribers connection with Jheir own county seat, it would be necessary to require the Linwood company to interchange service with the exchanges at Wahoo, Fre - mont and Schuyler. At the same time, if those subscribers were to have unlimited communication with their neighbors on near-by ex - changes, it would be necessary to compel the Linwood company to con - nect with Rogers, North Bend, Morse Bluff, Prague and perhaps other towns. Nor is Linwood an exception. The same situation applies in a greater or less degree to the exchanges at Abie, Bruno, Brainard. Ulysses, Dwight, Surprise, Rising City and Bellwood, all of which un - doubtedly serve territory in counties contiguous to Butler. To require the companies serving these towns to provide all their subscribers with such connections and to limit the service to the various classes of sub - scribers thus defined would produce a condition, from a practical operat - ing standpoint, that would be impossible. Operators would have time for but little else than the policing of calls. Moreover, it would produce a chaotic rate condition, so full of discriminations and inconsistencies as to be unsatisfactory both to the patrons and to the companies. How - ever, if one group of subscribers is entitled to connection with the county seat, as the majority points out. It certainly follows that another group of subscribers served by the same exchange can justly demand the same privilege. If connection with a county seat is the factor which is to establish a unit for telephone service, then I am unable to understand how it is possible to extend it to one subscriber and deny it to another, where all other conditions are similar, without producing a serious discrimination. Notwithstanding the demand on the part of the patrons of the company for an extension of the interchange service so as to include all of the exchanges in the county, I am firmly of the belief that they would ultimately be much better served and much better satisfied if a message rate of ten cents for the county was to be estab - lished instead of the flat rate for unlimited service herein provided (or. </seg>
            <seg id="p272">272 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT The message rate which I propose would reduce to the minimum the trivial and social calls that constitute so. large a factor in the conges - tion of trunk lines and interfere to such a serious extent with important messages. It would remove the necessity for the policing of the service by the subscribers themselves, as is proposed in the order, a remedy that promises to be more aggravating to the telephone user than it is effective in preventing contraband messages. It would prevent that unjust discrimination that results from the great use of the service by a few at the expense of those who use it little if any. It would dis - courage the inclination of farm subscribers, because of personal reasons, to demand service from exchanges to which they are not naturally trib - utary, thus reducing to the minimum the construction of superfluous lines and the re-switching of calls. Such a method would result inevit - ably in a greatly improved service, and, what is equally important, would place the cost of the service squarely on the shoulders of those who use it. Where there are overlapping lines between exchanges it is perhaps necessary to make provision for an exchange of service between farmers residing in the same neighborhood. The social and business relations' of farmers in such situation are so close and intimate as to make im - perative communication on an unlimited basis. Such an exchange of service, however, is limited to a small service area and can be policed without great difficulty. At the same time, the number of subscribers affected being limited, the increase in the traffic is not sufficient to im - pair the service. Adjustments of this nature could have been arranged in this case, and had that been done the demand for a county-wide service would have been much less insistent. Fortunately the order in this case provides for a test of approxi - mately one year, so that an opportunity will be given to determine from actual experience whether or not the rates proposed are adequate and whether they are so adjusted as to produce the best service.

            <seg id="p273">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 273 OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Commissioner: The applicant has a small telephone plant serving about fifty-two subscribers and performing switching service for about fifty-five farmers. Its present rates are $1.25 per month for subscribers' service and 25c per month per station for switching service. It is proposed to increase the rate for subscribers' service to $1.75 per month and switching service to 50c per month. In July, 1911, O. Nelson bought the property of the Newport, Ham - mond &amp; Southern Telephone company by assuming the outstanding in - debtedness, amounting to $443.00. It was a part of the agreement that Mr. Nelson was to give service for a period of five years, from January 1, 1912, to January 1, 1917, at the rates which were then in force. Mr. Nelson has since operated the plant. The territory is very sparsely settled and the farm lines of the company are unusually long, making the maintenance expense higher than in the average company. Being unable to realize anything out of the earnings of the plant, Mr. Nelson desired authority to suspend operation, sell the plant, or increase the rates. He finally concluded to make application to increase the rates. A hearing on his application was had on January 9, 1917. On account of illness Mr. Nelson was unable to appear. He had, however, submitted a statement of his income, property investment, map of his lines, and operating expenses for the year 1916. Representatives of the subscribers and of the switched farm lines were present to protest against any increase. At the conclusion of the hearing it was sug - gested that the representatives of the patrons return home and see whether or not the property could be sold to some party better able to give an improved service than Mr. Nelson. As a result of this sug - gestion the plant was sold by Mr. Nelson on January 15, 1917, to Mr. Bert Bogue, the consideration being $1200.00. Since purchasing the plant Mr. Bogue has renewed the application for an increase in rates. The operating statement of the company for 1916 clearly shows the need of more revenue if the service is to be continued. The total revenue for the year 1916 amounted to $1085.00, $780.00 of which came from rental of fifty-two phones at $15.00 per year, $165.00 from switch - ing fees, and $140.00 from commissions on toll business. The expenses for the same year, as submitted by Mr. Nelson, were as follows: Total $1,494.00 Without any allowance for an earning on investment, there is a deficit on this statement of over $400.00. Few figures are needed, how- Operator's salary Hired labor and livery New material Pnel Light and rent Paxes Manager's salary F 360.0' 165.01 100.01 48.01 6O.O1 31.0i 730.0i hi </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT ever, to prove that a telephone plant cannot be operated at a profit when it has a gross revenue of less than $1100.00. The full time of at least two people is required to operate such a plant and their wages alone would consume such meager earnings. The patrons complain of inade - quate service and this is not to be wondered at in view of the conditions. It was suggested on behalf of the patrons that if better service were provided some twenty-five or thirty new subscribers could be obtained. It is apparent, however, that if the number of subscribers were in - creased to one hundred the revenue on the present rates would still be insufficient to maintain a plant and give anything like adequate service. While the Commission is of the opinion that more revenue is im - peratively needed if the owner of the plant is to give anything like adequate service, it believes that the increase should be applied to the subscribers rather than to the switched farm lines. While it is prob - able that a showing as to the actual cost of switching each subscriber would disclose that such cost amounts to at least twenty-five cents per month, the limited service furnished by this company makes it appear undesirable at this time to increase the rate for switching service. If the exchange is to be continued in Newport, it will be necessary to se - cure a larger number of subscribers. If the number is eventually in - creased the added value of the increased connections would be a factor in fixing a greater rate for the switched farm lines. But for the present at least no change will be made in the existing rate. While the appli - cation is for a uniform rate of $1.75 per month for all telephone*) owned by the company, the Commission is of the opinion that a distinc - tion should be made between business telephones and farm and resi - dence telephones. For that reason a schedule will be approved fixing $1.75 per month as the rate on business telephones and $1.50 per month on city residence and faTm telephones. The record is not clear as to just how many business telephones there are on the system. A direc - tory filed with the records in the case, however, indicate that there are about twelve phones in this class. Accepting that number for the purposes of this case, we find that the rates proposed by the Commis - sion, together with the switching fees and toll commissions, would pro - duce a total gross revenue of $1277.00. On the showing made as to the operating cost, this still leaves a deficit of $217.00 without allowing any - thing for an earning on the investment. The Commission is of the opinion, however, that a number of new subscribers will be added to the exchange, in which event the revenue should approach very closely the actual out-of-pocket cost of the owners. The exchange is so small and the territory which it serves so sparsely settled that the rates would practically have to be prohibitive if the earnings were sufficient to pay all operating expenses, maintenance of the plant, and earning on the investment. As at present operated, service is furnished between the hours of 6 a. m. and 12 m.; 1 p. m. and 5 p. m., and 6 p. m. and 9 p. m. The closing of the office and suspension of service between the hours of 12 m. and 1 p. m. and 5 p. m. and 6 p. m. Is unsatisfactory to patrons and </seg>

(SEAL) In the Matter of the Application of the New - port Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Its Rates for Subscribers' Service to $1.75 and Switching Service to 50c Per Month. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER In the original order in this case the Commission found that, while the showing as to the actual cost of switching farm subscribers would probably exceed 25 cents per month, because of the somewhat limited service furnished by the exchange it would not be best at the present time to increase the charge. Upon further consideration, however, and upon statements made by Mr. Bert Bogue, present owner of the plant, as to his Inability to furnish switching service for the rate of 25 eents, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that this rate should be increased. Under all the circumstances of the situation, therefore, the Commission finds that a rate for switching farm patrons of 40 cents per month is reasonable.

It appears that such limited service on Sunday is justified and that it should be approved and the order rendered specific to that end. It is the understanding in this connection that the company will answer emergency calls during the night and during closed hours on Sunday.

In the Matter of the Application of the Palis - ade Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rates for Residence and Farm Telephones. Appearances: For Applicant— Mr. Earl Walbridge OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Commissioner: Applicant is a small telephone exchange with headquarters at Palisade. 258 subscribers are served by the exchange, 20 of which are business subscribers, 57 residence, 47 farm subscribers, and 134 switched farm subscribers. In addition to the service given to all subscribers connected with the exchange at Palisade, free connection is given to the towns of Wauneta, Center, Imperial, Hamlet and Beverly. At the present time service is given from 6 a. m. to 9 p. m. during the summer months, and from 7 a. m. to 8 p. m. during the winter months, with four hours of service on Sunday. The situation with reference to the rates now in effect is rather con - fused. Of the 124 subscribers who pay a flat rate per month for service, 86 own their own telephone instruments, the poles, wires and all other appurtenances being owned by the company. The remaining 38 sub - scribers own no property whatever, but rent the entire equipment from the company. For those farm and residence subscribers who own their own telephone instruments the rate is 50 cents per month. Where the instrument is owned by the company the rate is 75 cents per month. Uncertainty exists as to just what the business rate is. The rate on file </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT with this office is $1.25 per month for business subscribers who own their own instruments. The rate actually charged by the company at the present time is $1.50 per month for subscribers owning their own in - struments and $1.75 per month for subscribers where the company owns the instruments. The rate for switching farm lines is 25 cents per pa - tron per month. It was proposed in the original application filed in this case to make a flat increase of 25 cents per month for all service. At the time of the hearing, however, leave was asked to amend the appli - cation to provide for a uniform increase of 50 cents per month per sub - scriber for all classes of service. The plant is now operated by Mr. Earl Walbridge, who purchased all of the outstanding capital stock and the physical property about one year ago for $4,000. About $3,000 of capital stock had been issued by the original company. At the time of the purchase of the plant by Mr. Walbridge he made an inventory of the same and found the value at that time to be $4,000. He paid this amount in cash for the property. At the time of the hearing on the application Mr. Walbridge was the only one present. No protests have been received concerning the in - crease of the rates for subscribers' service. Vigorous protests have been received, however, from each one of the farm lines switched by the Palisade company. Mr. Walbridge submitted for the record a statement as to the operating cost for the year 1916. This statement is as fol - lows: Operating Statement. The earnings, computed on the number of subscribers now receiving service, were as follows: 57 residence subscribers @ 50c per month $ 28.50 20 business subscribers @ $1.50 per month 30.00 47 farm subscribers @ 50c per month 23.50 134 switched patrons @ 25c per month 33.50 38 instruments rented @ 25c per month 9.50 $125.00 Toll revenue 28.70 Total $153.70 Total for the year $1,844.40 Miscellaneous revenue 75.00 Total _ $1,919.40 [anager's salary $ 900.00 iperators' salaries „ 540.00 :ent and light „ 126.00 [eat ._ 75.00 uto hire 180.00 latteries, stationery, stamps, freight, etc _ 300.00 [aintenance material 268.50 Total $2,389.50 </seg>
            <seg id="p279">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 279 On this showing it is apparent that there is a deficit, without al - lowing anything for an earning on the investment, of $470.10. A study of the operating statement indicates that the expenses included therein are reasonably necessary. In addition to being manager of the com - pany, Mr. Walbridge also does practically all of the line work and alsj sleeps in the central office at night for the purpose of answering emer - gency calls. It would appear therefore that his salary of $75.00 a month is reasonable. He employs two operators, one at $20.00 per month and the other at $25.00 per month. A large portion of the Item of $300 for batteries, stationery, stamps, freight, etc., is occasioned by the con - sumption of batteries. From 50 to 100 of- these are consumed each month and they cost at the present time about 30 cents each. A large number are used to charge the ringing apparatus in the central office, while the remainder are used in the telephone instruments. Mr. Wal - bridge testified that he purchased material at a cost of $268.50, which ■was used exclusively for maintenance purposes. In addition to that he expended about $100 for new construction, building a short line and putting in a piece of cable. It would appear therefore that the expendi - tures for maintenance were necessary. The exact value of the physical property of the plant has not been ascertained, but if we were to ac - cept the figure of $4,000, which Mr. Walbridge paid for the property a year ago, and allow 9% of that amount for maintenance and deprecia - tion, we would have an allowance of $360 for that purpose, which would be somewhat less than the amount actually expended. It is worthy of note that no item appears in this expense account for taxes or insur - ance. On this showing it is apparent that more revenue ia required. The out-of-pocket cost of the plant is not being met at the present time by the gross earnings. If an allowance for dividends were added, the deficit would be materially increased. Mr. Walbridge is desirous of repairing the plant and improving the service. It is obvious that he would be justified in doing neither if he does not have more money. It is his purpose to give a continuous service from 6 in the morning until 9 at night the year round, Sunday included, if he secures an increase in rates. He estimates that it will cost him about $5.00 a month more for operators' wages to give the added service. This would increase the deficit by $60.00 per year. The present practice of permitting a majority of the subscribers to own their own telephone instruments should be discouraged and ulti - mately discontinued. It makes it impossible for the company to stand - ardize its equipment, and without a standardization of the equipment the service will never be as good as it should be. For that reason the Commission recommends that as soon as possible Mr. Walbridge pur - chase from the subscribers all the instruments. The base rate of 50 cents per month for farm and residence service is entirely too low, and discriminatory as compared to the rate charged business subscribers. The Commission finds therefore that a rate of $1.25 for farm and rest- </seg>
            <seg id="p280">280 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT dence subscribers where the company owns the telephone instrument is just and reasonable, and that a rate of $1.00 where the instrument is owned by the subscriber is just and reasonable. The rate of $1.50, as now charged to business men owning their own telephones, and $1.75 to business subscribers for whom the telephone instrument is furnished, appears to be reasonable and will not be disturbed. With respect to the rate for switching farm lines, it is apparent that some increase is necessary. In addition to securing the switching service between the farm lines and the subscribers of the Palisade company", the company at the same time is furnishing free connections with five neighboring towns, a service of undoubted value to the farm lines. The connection to these additional towns at the same time, because of the increased traffic, is the cause of increased cost to the company. The Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that a rate of 35 cents per month is rea - sonable for this service. Applying these rates to the phones in service, we have the following statement as to probable earnings: 57 residence subscribers @ $1.00 per month $ 57.00 20 business subscribers @ $1.50 per month 30.00 Adding the $60.00 for Increased operators' wages on account of addi - tional service, we have a total expense of operation of $2,449.50 without including anything for insurance and taxes. Deducting this from the total revenue of $2704.20, we have left $254.70 for dividends. If we al - low 7% on the $4,000 actually invested in the property, the net income thus shown would fall short of a reasonable return on the investment. It is apparent therefore that the rates approved will not produce more revenue than is required to pay the operating expense, maintain the property and pay a reasonable return on the investment.

By the Commission This case came on for hearing before the Commission on an applica - tion signed by all of the carriers operating lines of railroad in the state of Nebraska, asking the authority of the Commission to allow the mini - mum weight on carload shipments of grain products on Nebraska lntra - state shipments to be increased from a minimum weight of 24,000 pounds to a minimum weight of 40,000 pounds. Examiner W. P. Bartel, representing the Interstate Commerce Com - mission, sat with the Commission in hearing on this application, and took part in the examination of witnesses. Mr. Bartel appeared by invi - tation of the Nebraska Commission to the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion to have a representative sit with the Commission in this case. STATEMENT. In support of their petition applicants introduced testimony tending to show that the interstate minimum weight on carload shipments of grain products is 40,000 pounds; that said minimum weight of 40,000 pounds was established by an order entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in I. &amp; S. Docket 555; that the increased carrying capacity of grain cars has been materially increased since the time when the 24,000-lb. minimum was established; that a large number of state ship - ments of grain products were loaded heavier than the 24,000-lb. mini - mum weight called for by the tariffs; that interstate shipments of grain products were being loaded to a capacity greater than 40,000 pounds. A number of Nebraska millers and associations of millers filed protests before the Nebraska Commission, asking that the minimum weight on grain products on Nebraska intrastate traffic be not increased above the present minimum of 24,000 pounds. In support of their pro - tests numerous exhibits were introduced and witnesses gave testimony tending to show: That the present is a very abnormal period in the milling industry by reason of the unusual high price of grain; that the minimum carload of 24,000 pounds is the maximum car that many car - load buyers of flour in the state of Nebraska can afford to place in their warehouses for two reasons, — first, that their storage capacity Is ar - ranged for the purpose of taking care of a 24,000-lb. car, and, second, because the financial resources of the firms buying flour in carload quantities are not sufficient to allow them to purchase flour in carload lots where the minimum purchase must be 40,000 pounds; that if the minimum weight was increased to 40,000 pounds the number of carload buyers would be materially decreased, thus necessitating the shipment of flour in less than carload lots, which, according to the testimony, was quite unsatisfactory in that the flour was oftentimes damaged in transit, causing inconvenience to the receivers of flour, and resulting in much annoyance in the settlement of claims for damage as between the rail - road company and the shippers; that the tide of traffic in shipments of grain from Nebraska stations was from the west to the east, and that, </seg>
            <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 285 generally speaking, shipments of grain products are from the east to the west and that where if the car was not loaded with grain products the car would have to move as an empty; that some millers located in Ne - braska have undertaken, by reason of the car shortage, to double-load cars of grain products, loading the car with 24,000 pounds to one con - signee at one station and 24,000 pounds in the same car to another con - signee at another station, and that such shipments have proven unsat - isfactory to both the millers and the receivers of grain products. FINDINGS. This application was made on behalf of the carriers to the Ne - braska Commission by reason of complaint now pending before the In - terstate Commerce Commission, known as Kansas City Millers' Club vs. A. T. &amp; S. P. Railway Company, et al. At the hearing held before Ex - aminer Bartel, of the Interstate Commerce Commission, at Kansas City in January of this year, the Nebraska Commission entered an appear - ance in connection with other state commissions, and joined in a petition to the Interstate Commerce Commission asking that further hearings in the Kansas City Millers' Club complaint be deferred until such time as the different state commissions could hold a hearing on the question of the increased minimum weights of grain products. The Interstate Commerce Commission complied with the request of the state commis - sions and postponed further hearings in the above mentioned complaint. In a final determination of the questions presented in this case the Commission has in mind at all times the importance of uniform mini - mum weights on grain products on state and interstate business, in so far as the same can be uniform and still do justice to Nebraska shippers and receivers of grain products in carload lots. Briefly, the history of the minimum of 24,000 pounds of grain prod - ucts in Nebraska intrastate traffic is as follows: At the time the Rail - way Commission Act was established, viz., January 1, 1907, the minimum weight on grain products, Nebraska intrastate shipments, was 24,000 pounds, and on interstate shipments 36,000 pounds. The 24,000-lb. minimum, according to the tariffs filed with the Commission, was in effect as far back as 1892 and probably for a number of years before the date just mentioned. There are in round figures about two hundred mills located in the state of Nebraska, including export, merchant and grist mills. The exact amount of flour consumed and manufactured within the state of Ne - braska is not specifically stated of record. It was indicated, however, that possibly not to exceed 5% of the total is manufactured by millers other than those located in the state of Nebraska. It is therefore ap - parent that any change in the Nebraska intrastate minimum weights on grain products will materially affect the bulk of the shipments of flour sold to the distributors of flour and the people of the state of Nebraska. The record appears to amply justify the conclusion that the mini - mum weight on grain and grain products might properly be different on state and Interstate carload shipments. Mr. Holcomb, general freight </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT agent of the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad company, testifying for and on behalf of that company, gives the following testimony: Q. So as a general rule, on the Burlington lines it is fair to say that the intrastate minimum on grain and grain products was 24,000 pounds at the same time the interstate tariffs provided for 30,000 pounds minimum, is that correct? A. That is generally true. Q. Why was that spread between those two classes of ship - ments, viz., interstate and intrastate, prior to the time you made the application to increase the weight? Have you any knowledge on that? A. No; I presume it was a matter that was controlled by the state commissions largely. They were the minimums that were in effect and were continued in effect in the several states, no attempt perhaps being made to advance them when the interstate minimum was advanced. Q. Don't you think that is true, Mr. Holcomb, that largely be - fore most of the commissions in the states I have named were created these minimums were established by the carriers? A. That is true, and 24,000 pounds at that time may have been a reasonable ruling with the equipment that was then in service. Q And 30,000 pounds might have been a reasonable ruling on the interstate? A. Yes, sir. Q. Do you know whether or not commercial conditions were taken into consideration at the time those minimums were estab - lished? A. It is quite likely they were. The record is clear that flour and mill products are distributed to the public in a materially different manner in Nebraska state traffic as compared to interstate shipments. Several millers, witnesses in this case, testified that in Nebraska intrastate traffic the flour is universally sold to storekeepers, and that usually one dealer in a town would handle one particular brand of flour, while on interstate shipments the flour was generally shipped to a jobber of flour who would have customers in a certain territory and would distribute the flour to storekeepers in a number of different towns in small lots. This fact alone would justify a difference in the minimum weight when considering- the question from a commercial standpoint. There is another question that appeals to the Commission in the consideration of interstate minimums that might properly be mentioned at this time, i. e., that average loading of inter - state flour, where the shipments to flour jobbers and export shipments of flour are all included in one tabulation, tends to show a heavier load - ing on interstate shipments than would be shown if the shipments were divided as between shipments for export and shipments consigned to jobbers or distributors, of flour. The record in this case clearly shows that the loading of Nebraska Intrastate grain products is somewhat greater when the car contains mixed shipments of floor, mill feed and grain, as compared to straight carloads of floor. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 287 In the final disposition of this case, as heretofore mentioned, the Commission is mindful of the minimum weight of 40,000 pounds estab - lished by the Interstate Commerce Commission on interstate shipments. It also takes into consideration the lack of sufficient grain-carrying cars to handle the traffic originating in Nebraska. The car shortage in this state has been exceedingly aggravating for many months. At the time of the writing of this opinion the shortage is not as great as it was at the same time last year. However, this situation is probably brought about by the fact that there was almost a complete failure of the winter wheat in the state of Nebraska in the crop year of 1916-1917. While recognizing that the very abnormal prices at which flour and mill products are selling at the present time should constitute but a minor factor in determining a reasonable minimum weight for the transportation services rendered, the Commission connot but feel that it is a factor that should not be ignored altogether. The dilemma in which the retail dealers in this state now find themselves is actual and serious, and it should not be aggravated unless the necessities of trans - portation make it imperative to do so. From a careful analysis of the testimony and exhibits introduced In this case, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that there might properly be a difference in the minimum weights on straight car - load shipments of flour as compared -to mixed carload shipments of flour and grain products. Considered strictly on the tabulations and loading of cars submitted in the record, the minimum weight on straight carloads of flour should probably not exceed 26,000 pounds, but recognizing the fact that the average carrying capacity of the grain-carrying cars has been ma - terially increased, which capacity, under present car shortage condi - tions, should be utilized to the fullest extent possible, and the further fact that the interstate minimum has been established at 40,000 pounds, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that a reasonable mini - mum for straight carloads of flour should be established at a minimum weight of 28,000 pounds, and that a reasonable minimum weight of mixed carload shipments of flour, grain and grain products should be estab - lished at 32,000 pounds. In the establishment of a different minimum on straight carloads of flour as compared to mixed carloads of flour and grain products, the Commission recognizes that it has laid down a new principle not in use heretofore in Nebraska intrastate shipments. If future investigations should disclose that the spread as between the minimum weights herein established is not just and reasonable to the shippers and receivers of carload shipments of grain products located in the state of Nebraska, the matter will be further considered by the Commission. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings. ORDER. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that, on or before thirty days from the date of this order </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION H. G. Taylor, Vice-Chairman. Attest: T. A. Browne, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3035 In the Matter of the Application of the Omaha, Lincoln A Beatrice Railway Company for Authority to Increase Its Switching Rate from Connection With the Missouri Pa - cific Railway Company to Bethany and University Place. Appearances: For Applicant — J. M. Bramlette and O. J. Shaw For Missouri Pacific Railway Company — D. R. Lincoln, A. G. F. A.; H. T. Guinn, G. F. A. OPINION AND FINDING. Taylor, Commissioner: The applicant herein is an interurban electric line, operating a street and interurban railway between the center of Lincoln, Nebraska, and University Place and Bethany Heights. The Missouri Pacific Rail - way company and the applicant maintain a transfer track for inter - change of traffic, located at Thirtieth and W streets. The application herein is for authority to increase the rate for switching from this transfer 'track so that the net revenue to the Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway company will be $5.00 per car to University Place and $5.50 to Bethany. At the present time the joint rate charged by the Missouri Pacific and the O., L. &amp; B. is $5.00 and $5.50 to these two points, each carrier receiving one-half of these amounts. At the hearing the only objector to the increase was the Missouri Pacific Railway company, and it appeared only for the purpose of protesting against any change that would decrease its present net revenue. </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 291 Cost of operation by applicant is much larger than for other lines. Under present conditions it is necessary to make two complete round trips for practically every car handled. The traffic is not sufficient to justify keeping an engine and crew in service all the time or for any considerable portion of the time. For that reason every time a car is to be moved the crew must be summoned and the engine made ready. The total cost is thus incurred by each car moved, whereas if the traffic were sufficient so that a number of cars could be handled with each movement the cost per car would be materially reduced. Only 228 cars were handled during the year 1916. The traffic at the present time is but a fraction of what it was a few years ago. The Nebraska Hinge Door Silo company, which was formerly located on applicant's line, was destroyed by fire some time ago and was not rebuilt at that location. That concern transacted a large volume of business, all of which was handled by applicant. The company submits a cost study of the movement of two cars from the Missouri Pacific connection to Bethany, involving four handlings. This shows an actual cost of $2.86 per car for the current consumed and for the wages of the crew. It includes noth - ing for the maintenance of the engine and track. While this study is not sufficiently comprehensive to show what the average cost is, it indi - cates that the revenue at the present time is not sufficient to defray the out-of-pocket expense. The O., L. &amp; B., so far as this service is concerned, is only a switch - ing road and does not participate in the line haul as do the other car - riers engaged in switching service in Lincoln. It is because of the rev - enue derived from the road haul that the other carriers are justified in maintaining arrangements whereby they absorb in some instances the entire amount of the switching charge. If applicant does not receive enough money for the switching service which it performs, it has no other revenue from which to recoup its loss. Its unfavorable situation as the terminus of an interurban railroad yet uncompleted probably pre - cludes it from expecting such a profit as it might earn if it had a large traffic, a considerable portion of which originated on its own system, but its disadvantages in this connection do not justify its patrons in ex - pecting it to perform local service of this character at a loss, nor is it now able to recoup the loss sustained from its switching service from other departments of its business. It submits a statement covering the period from October 1, 1916, to April 1, 1917, showing that its cost of operation is considerably in excess of its revenue from all sources. This statement is as follows: Upon consideration of the conditions as they now exist, the Com )ctober Jovember .. )ecember .. anuary February .

The applicant in its petition asked the authorization by the Com - mission for the Issuance of its capital stock in the following sums: "First, That it be permitted to at once issue and sell at par $1,100,000 of its capital stock, the proceeds thereof to be used for the purpose of paying the above mentioned demand notes of said company, amounting to the sum of $1,108,250.00. Second, That the Nebraska Telephone com - pany be authorized and permitted to issue and sell at par $900,000 of its capital stock, from time to time during the year 1917, as said Nebraska Telephone company shall require funds to be used for the purpose of making payments for extensions, betterments and additions to its plant and property." The Commission has caused to be made an investigation of the books and records of the company by the accounting department and are now in possession of the report of Special Examiner U. O.

In the Matter of the Supplemental Application of the Nebraska Telephone Company for Authority to Issue and Sell Capital Stock. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER. On April 3, 1917, the Nebraska Telephone company made application to the Nebraska State Railway Commission for authority to issue and Bell $1,100,000 of common stock for the purpose of cancelling short time indebtedness represented by notes, said indebtedness resulting from con - struction of additions and betterments to the Nebraska system. It also asked authority to issue $900,000 of capital stock from time to time dur - ing 1917 as required for extensions, betterments and additions. This application was thoroughly investigated by the accounting de - partment of the Commission and an order was issued on April 12, 1917, based on the report of the accounting department, in which authority was granted for the issuance and sale of the $1,100,000 prayed for, and wherein the following provision was made concerning the issuance of the $900,000, from the proceeds of which future betterments and addi - tions were to be made: "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Nebraska Telephone com- pany may execute and issue its capital stock in the sum of $900,000, in amounts of $100,000 or any multiple thereof, as the needs of the company may require, and after proper showing and authorization of the Commission has been had in writing; provided, however, that the order herein entered may be considered as authorization for the issuance and sale of $200,000 of the total sum of $900,000 herein approved." Applicant now asks for a supplemental order granting authority to issue $500,000 more of the $900,000 above mentioned, and sets forth in the trial balance of June 30, 1917, the fact that it has incurred a float - ing indebtedness of $315,000 in short time obligations due to improve - ments and betterments of its plant and property. In its application it states further that it has issued and sold the $200,000 provided for in the original order under Application No. 3066 and ha* reduced the short time obligations by that amount </seg>
            <seg id="p298">298 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT The application sets forth that the $500,000 issue prayed for Is to be used for the cancellation of the remaining short time obligations and for the completion of the construction of a central office building at Omaha, Nebraska, now under way. The Commission finds the application is in line with its order of April 12th concerning issues of blocks of stock to make up the total of $900,000 authorized in general at that time, and believes that the issue of $500,000 should be authorized, subject to a careful check by the Com - mission's accounting department of the exhibits set forth by the com - pany in substantiation of the application. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Nebraska Telephone company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell $500,000 of its capital stock under the fol - lowing conditions: Said stock shall be sold for cash and at not less than par; the proceeds of the issue shall be used for the liquidation of short time note obligations and for construction work now under way, and for no other purpose; reports shall be made to the Commission on proper blanks of receipts and expenditures whenever such expendi - tures shall reach the amount of $25,000, until the amount herein author - ized has all been expended for the purposes set forth.

In the Matter of the Application of the Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha, Ltd., for Authority to Make Charge of $1.75 per Bushel for Corn Furnished at Stock Yards. OPINION AND FINDING. By the Commission This application has been considered by the Commission. Inasmuch as the applicants are at the present time, and have been for several months last past, selling corn to feeders in the yards at South Omaha at less than the cost of the grain, in some instances as much as 50 cents less than the cost of the grain, it appears to the Commission that the applicant should be given some immediate relief. </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 299 As a temporary provision the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the applicant herein may charge to the feeders of corn the average purchase price paid for corn by the applicant at its receiving elevator in South Omaha, the average price to be determined as fol - lows: The price shall be revised monthly and the price to be charged for the current month shall be determined by the amount paid for corn per bushel by the applicant at its South Omaha yards for the month preceding the current month for which the price is made up. In addi - tion to the price paid for corn at South Omaha, there is an actual out - of-pocket cost to the applicant for the handling and placing of the corn in the feeding pens, which for the purpose of this temporary arrange - ment the Commission places at ten cents per bushel. The amount just named may be added by the applicant to the price of the corn for the current month. In view of an emergency existing, the Commission finds that the order herein entered may become effective on and after the date of the order. The Commission further finds that the price which may be charged for corn for the balance of the month of April may be based on the average cost of the corn bought by the applicant April 1, 1917, to date. The provisions of this order as entered by the Commission are tem - porary in nature and are meant to protect the applicant from further loss until the petition of the applicant will be set down for hearing on its merits at some future date to be named by the Commission of which the applicant shell be fully advised. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Union Stock Yards com - pany of Omaha, Limited, shall determine the price of corn to be charged to feeders of corn at its yards in South Omaha for the current calendar month, on the average price paid by said Union Stock Yards company for corn received at South Omaha for the calendar month, im - mediately preceding the current month for which the price per bushel of corn Is determined.

In the Matter of the Application of the Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha, Ltd., for Authority to Make Charge of $1.75 per Bushel for Corn Furnished at Stock Yards. Appearances: For Applicant — E. Buckingham, Vice-President; Norris Brown, At - torney. For South Omaha Live Stock Exchange — A. F. Stryker, Attorney. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING. By the Commission: This matter was heard in the office of the Commission on June 18th. Applicant asks the Commission to modify the order made and entered as of date April 19, 1917. In the supplemental petition applicant asks that the Commission increase the price at which the Union Stock Yards company of Omaha, Ltd., might be allowed to sell corn in its yards at South Omaha to a greater price than allowed by the order entered by the Commission on the date above mentioned, for the reason "that the present price of corn authorized to be charged in your petitioner's stock yards is about 50 per cent less than the cost of corn on the market, and this state of case has existed for some time. That your petitioner not only does not derive a profit on the corn furnished patrons in its yards, but is subjected to a loss. To compel your petitioner to furnish corn at a loss, and to compel it to perform the necessary service and to furnish the means and facili - ties for furnishing and delivering the corn, deprives your petitioner of its property without due process of law, and deprives it of the equal protection of the law, and would be in violation of the pro - visions of the Constitution of this state prohibiting class legislation." The petition further states "that in fact the stock yards of this and other states are now charg - ing $1.68 to $2.90 per bushel for corn furnished and fed at the yards. Therefore, your Honorable Commission is without power or juris - diction to fix and impose a rate for the Union Stock Yards company of Omaha, Ltd., below the rate charged at other yards, and below the actual cost to petitioner of corn." In support of the petition Mr. Buckingham, general manager of the </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 company, testified and inlroduced certain exhibits which purported to show the net earnings to the applicant [or corn furnished to patrons on a per hog basis. In view of the fact that no basis has been agreed upon as to what expenses should be included as properly chargeable against the feeding of hogs in applicant's yard, the exhibits are of very little assistance to the Commission and do not tend to support the peti - tion of the applicant. In passing, the Commission notes that Mr. Buck - ingham, in arriving at his cost per hog, has used the total number of hogs received at the yards, with the possible exception of the driven-in hogs, regardless of whether or not all of the hogs which were received at the South Omaha yards were furnished corn while in the yards. From the record it appears that the petitioner proposes to sub - stantiate its claim that "the present price of corn authorized to be charged in your petitioner's stock yards is about 50 per cent less than the cost of corn on the market," on the assumption that the company should receive a profit from the sale of corn in its South Omaha yards in the same ratio as it receives profit from the operation of all of the other departments and earnings-bearing facilities of the company, and wholly disregards the fact that the present high price of corn is ab - normal. The order entered In this case by the Commission, heretofore mentioned, stated that the Commission recognized that the present selling price of corn was abnormally high and that the order ot the Commission undertook to take care of the company's revenue as to sales of corn by a temporary provision as stated in the order, which for con - venience is reproduced here: "As a temporary provision the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the applicant herein may charge to the feeders of corn the average purchase price paid for corn by the applicant at its re - ceiving elevator in South Omaha, the average price to be determined as follows: The price shall be revised monthly and the price to be charged for the current month shall be determined by the amount paid for corn per bushel by the applicant at its South Omaha yards for the month preceding the current month for which the price is made up. In addition to the price paid for corn at South Omaha, there is an actual out-of-pocket cost to the applicant for the handling and placing of the corn in the feeding pens, which for the purpose of temporary arrangement the Commission places at ten cents pur bushel. The amount just named may be added by the applicant to the price of the corn for the current month." In the above quotation from the original order, where the following language appears, "actual out-of-pocket .cost," the Commission had in mind not only the actual money payments for corn and labor, but con - siders that the additional ten cents per bushel will provide a reasonable return to the applicant for the services rendered. The applicant further contends in its petition that the Nebraska Commission is limited to its conclusions as to the reasonable price of corn to be charged by the Stock Yards company by the selling price of corn at other yards located within and without the state of Nebraska. As to the difference in the selling price of corn at other feeding points, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that a mere state- </seg>

At the hearing on this application the carriers proposed that the new schedule be put in for a period of p. year, and asked the ship - pers, in view of the present abnormal conditions due to the war. to ac - cept the same and thus make it unnecessary to enter upon an extended hearing. Various groups of shippers were represented at the hearing and the proposal of the carriers was quite generally agreed to. For that reason but little testimony was offered with respect to the tariffs proposed. As a condition to their acceptance of the new rules, however, the shippers demanded that the carriers comply with the provisions of the so-called Banning Reciprocal Demurrage Act, which provides for the payment by the carrier of $1.00 per car per day for delays in transit to carload shipments. Certain of the shippers also complained of their inability to secure information concerning the arrival of cars which they had ordered for loading, and it was agreed by carriers that upon the arrival of a car or cars ordered by shipper the agent at the station would at once notify the latter, either personally, by telephone or by mail, of the arrival of the car. In consideration of the fact that the rates and rules applied for are now in effect on interstate commerce and have been approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and in view of the further fact that the present emergency due to war conditions calls for prompt and efficient use of all railroad equipment, the Commission is of the opinion. and so finds, that the application should be granted, subject to the con - ditions named and to others that will be set forth in the order.

OPINION AND FINDING. Wilson, Commissioner: Applicant's telephone plant is located largely within the city of Benkelman, Nebraska. It has 136 business and residence subscribers, and performs a switching service for 231 subscribers to independently owned rural lines. Its lines are of the grounded circuit class and its instruments are individual magneto. The plant is considerably below the modern standard of telephone construction, which calls for metallic and common battery service at least, in cities and towns. The early books of account and records are said to have been destroyed. Support is given this claim in the meagerness of the plant investment account compared with the number of subscribers. This account, applied to residence and business subscribers, shows an average investment of $12.39 per telephone only.

            <seg id="p306">308 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT The foregoing summary shows that the average sum of $609.61 has been annually expended for maintenance of the plant during the five years under consideration, which amounts to more than 36% of the present balance in plant account. It is another indication that the plant account does not correctly reflect the amount actually expended for con - structing the plant. The summary also shows that the average divi - dend during the five years has been $113.60 — 5.2% of the capital account. Application is made for increasing the business rates from $3.50 per quarter to $4.50 per quarter; the residence rates from $2.35 per quarter to $3.00 per quarter; and switching rates from $1.00 per quarter to $1.50 per quarter; the revenues realizable from the present and proposed It is manifest that some increase in applicant's revenue is necessary in order to properly maintain the plant and to yield a reasonable return upji the capital invested. The company's present rates are relatively low as to its own subscribers when compared with the rates commonly prevailing in similar plants. Its switching rates, however, are prac - tically in line with such rates elsewhere. The Commission is of the opinion that a considerable proportion of the present plant has been built out of operating revenues, and taking everything into consideration it is advisable to continue this policy in future betterments and addi - tions to the plant, provided the public is Su'.y protected. Applicant's pa - trons are entitled to a better grade of service than is now furnished and the company should be able to give such service in course of time, if the rates applied for as to its own subscribers are granted. An enter - prising town like Benkelman is entitled to metallic circuit and common battery service, and the Commission directs that the surplus revenues of the company be conserved and expended in the future with that end in view.

In the Matter of the Application of the Arling - ton Telephone Company for Authority to Issue and Sell Its Stock In the Amount of $6,515.00. ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE Wilson, Commissioner: This is an application for authority to issue and sell capital stock of the applicant in the amount of $6,515.00 for the alleged purpose of build - ing and operating telephone lines and buying, owning and selling real estate in Nebraska- No formal hearing was requested or held. The only evidence sub - mitted was in the form of written statements and an exhibit. The record thus made shows that the applicant is a corporation existing under the laws of the state of Nebraska, with an authorized capital of $25,000, of which capital $18,485 has been heretofore issued and sold. Applicant has owned and operated a telephone plant at Arlington, Nebraska, since July 1, 1903. In 1915 a heavy sleet storm did consider - able damage to the aerial equipment of the appliicant, necessitating the rebuilding of much of it. Applicant had no available funds with which to pay for this reconstruction, and borrowed $6,515 from its stock - holders for that purpose. The real purpose of the application herein is to raise funds with which to liquidate this indebtedness. </seg>
            <seg id="p308">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 310 At the request of the Commission applicant filed an exhibit showing the amounts of capital stock outstanding and the dividends paid thereon year by year since its organization. This exhibit also contains a claimed inventory value of applicant's property, as of July 3, 1917, in the amount of $26,094.84. The dividends paid by applicant amount in the aggregate to $24,247.14, which is $9,607.27 in excess of T7c per annum. This excess above the customary reasonable return would more than defray the ex - pense applicant was put to in repairing the storm damage. Apparently no depreciation reserve has been set aside by the applicant with which to defray the cost of extraordinary repairs and other deferred deprecia - tion in its plant. Such a reserve fund should have been established from the beginning, and such additions made thereto from time to time as experience shows to be necessary. This obligation must be met be - fore any return can justly accrue to stockholders, and this is partic - ularly true in the case at bar. The rates yielded a large surplus above the costs of operating and maintaining the property currently. Applicant appears also to have violated a second legal obligation in the payment of these dividends. At no time is a public service corpora - tion enjoying a monopoly permitted to charge more than a reasonable rate for its service, or earn more than a fair return upon the value of its property devoted to public use. It necessarily follows that all revenues collected by it in excess of reasonable rates and fair returns do not belong of right to the corporation, but belong rather to the pa - trons who contributed such surplus revenues. The obligation of the patrons of a public service corporation to the corporation is fully dis - charged by the payment of such rates or fares as are necessary to operate and maintain the property in good serviceable condition, and in addition thereto yield a fair return to the corporation. Because of the fluctuations in revenues and expenses from year to year, the rates or fares must be sufficiently large to yield a surplus out of which to take care of extraordinary damages to the property, falling off in public patronage, obsolescence, and the like, but the corporation does not ac - quire absolute title to this surplus so that it may distribute it in divi - dends, or convey it to stockholders in any manner. The corporation may resort to the surplus for dividends only in the event that the net income in any one year is insufficient to pay a reasonable dividend. The relation created by law between such a corporation and its patrons is essentially that of a trust, the corporation holding the surplus as trustee for its stockholders and patrons. It appears from the inventory of applicant's property that in addi - tion to paying large dividends it has invested approximately $7,600 of its surplus in additions to the plant. Applying the law of trusts, the property thus built out of the surplus does not belong to the corpora - tion. One of the settled principles in regard to trusts is that property belonging to the trust may be followed into whatever form it may take, and used or seized for the benefit of the cestui que trust.

The Commission declined to approve the new schedule without a prima facie showing as to the reasonableness of the rates asked for. Complying with this request, the company shows that it proposes to re- build the city and farm plants, placing additional cables in town and making the lines fully metallic; country lines will be rebuilt and re- paired, and reduced to not exceeding ten on a line. It is estimated that the cost of the improvements will be $6,000. A statement as to its oper- ating revenues and expenses for the year ending March 31, 1917, is sub- mitted and is as follows: Book value Talmage exchange, May, 1917 $17,616.33 Number of subscribers, 271 Earnings of exchange $3,579.67 Toll, one-fourth 381.00 Miscellaneous 91.00 Total earnings $4,051.67 Expenses 3,141.81 Balance for interest and depreciation $ 909.86 On the assumption that one-half of the present subscribers will take metallic service at the proposed rates, the increased revenue will amount to $154.80 annually.

In the Matter of the Application of the Chi - cago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company for Authority to Change Certain Train Schedules on Its Lines in Nebraska and to Discontinue Passenger Trains Nos 7 and 8 Between Emerson and Oakland. Appearances: For Applicant — E. C. Blundell, division superintendent. For Protestants — P. P. Murray, traffic manager, Omaha Commercial Club; W. S. Wright, treasurer, Wright &amp; Wilholmy, Omaha; A. W. Carpenter, treasurer, Carpenter Paper Company; E. D. Weg- ton and C. O. Swanson, Lyons; A. J. McDonald, Emerson. OPINION AND ORDER. Taylor, Commissioner On July 3d, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company made application to the Commission for authority to issue its new time table No. 131. In addition to a number of minor changes with reference to the schedule of certain freight and passenger trains, it is proposed to discontinue passenger trains Nos. 7 and 8 between Emerson and Oakland. It is this feature of the application which meets with ob - jection on the part of patrons of the road residing between Emerson and Oakland. A hearing was had in the matter on July 10, 1917. At the present time No. 7, a four-car local passenger train between Emerson and Omaha, leaves Emerson at 6:35 A. M. and reaches Omaha at 9:50 A. M. The companion train, No. 8, leaves Omaha at 5:50 P. M. and reaches Emerson at 9:15 P. M. The proposal of applicant is to stop these trains at Oakland and make that the terminus of the run instead of Emerson. The five towns, including Emerson, Thurston, Pender, Ban - croft and Lyons, would thus be deprived of the service of this train. Vigorous protests were made by representatives of these communities and by representatives of Omaha trade interests. The company admits that the two trains as a whole earn sufficient revenue to make them compensatory. It is contended, however, that the </seg>
            <seg id="p312">314 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT territory between Oakland and Emerson produces a very small portion of the total revenue earned by the trains. The sole contention of the company, however, is that it should be permitted to remove the trains so as to save coal. It is estimated that the reduction of this mileage would result in the saving of from 105 to 107 tons of coal per month. Superintendent Blundell expresses the fear that the coal situation will become very acute during the next few months and that any economy in fuel consumption that can be effected should be brought about. He states that he had expected to have in storage on the Nebraska division by this time at least 50,000 tons of coal, whereas he has but 18,000 tons. He states further that the proposed curtailment of the service is in line with the policy adopted by his company, and that a large number of passenger trains have been discontinued on various parts of the sys - tem, the sum total of the saving in coal thus effected being considerable. In view of the present abnormal conditions brought about by the war, the Commission appreciates to the fullest extent the necessity for a conservation of the fuel supply. We are of the opinion, however, that the saving to be effected by the discontinuance of this train is not suf - ficient to offset the inconvenience and the loss to the public that will be affected. It is unnecessary to review the objections of the protestants, but it is clear from the record that the towns and the territory between Oakland and Emerson would be seriously handicapped by the removal of these trains. While these inconveniences should be borne by the public if the exigencies of the road and the general public welfare demand it, there should be no doubt as to the imperative necessity of the road be - fore the measures are adopted. It is not contended by applicant that it is suffering from any shortage of fuel at the present time, except that it cannot provide as large a surplus for future necessities as it deems desirable. The amount of coal which would be saved by this plan is so small when compared to the total consumption on the division that It cannot be a factor of any importance in the effort to establish a sur - plus. For that reason the Commission is of the opinion that the trains should not be discontinued at this time. If, however, the fuel situa tion becomes acute the Commission will regard with favor a renewal of the application, although it is our opinion that if the train is discon - tinued at all it should be discontinued entirely. That would produce a very considerable saving in fuel and would not result in discrimination between localities, as would follow the removal of the train for only a portion of the distance. Applicant advises that the other changes proposed in the new schedule are of such minor importance that they would not warrant the expense necessary to the issuance of a new time card, and that if the discontinuance of trains Nos. 7 and 8 between Oakland and Emerson is not approved, no changes whatever will be made at this time.

By the Commission Applicant, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, upon August 4th, filed with the Commission certain schedules of rates for common battery telephone service within the exchange areas of its plants at Osceola and Stromsburg, and also schedules for magneto farm line service in connection with the same exchanges. The rates pro- posed for both exchanges were as follows: Osceola. Common battery individual business $30.00 Common battery individual residence 18.00 Common battery 2-party residence 15.00 Magneto 10-party farm residence 18.00 The above rates include service to the Stromsburg and Polk exchanges.

It also appeared advisable that in approving the tariffs the Commis- sion should require the applicant company to make a financial showing as of January 1, 1918, from the time of the accounting study and valua- tion of the property made by the Commission in the complaint of William J. Marquis v. Polk County Telephone company, the tariffs named above to be in force until the further order of the Commission. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com- </seg>

            <seg id="p316">318 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING. Taylor, Commissioner: The applicant herein at one time had outstanding capital stock in the amount of $25,600.00. In an order issued on an application for an increase of rates (App. No. 2153), the Commission found the value of the property for rate purposes to be $20,531.12. Following that order ap - plicant accepted that figure as a basis for dividend payments. Subse - quently an increase of $625.00 was authorized by the Commission so that at the present there is outstanding $21,156.12, which is the authorized capital investment. It is now desired to issue an additional amount of $1,009.08, to cover additions and betterments made to the property from July 1, 1916, to July 1, 1917. Upon the showing made by applicant it is clear that this amount may properly be credited to capital investment. It represents dividends properly credited, but not paid to stockholders, and as such is as much a contribution to the capital account of the company as though paid into the treasury in the customary manner. The accounts of the company are kept in such form as to clearly distinguish between main - tenance and new construction, and the proper adjustments are made between the depreciation and capital accounts. This system of book - keeping was installed under the direct supervision of the Commission. In view of these facts, therefore, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the amount is reasonably required for the purposes of the company and that the desired authority should be granted. ORDER. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, that the Crownover Telephone com - pany be, and the same is hereby, authorized to issue and sell its com - mon stock in the sum of $1,009.08; said stock shall be sold at par and no less, and the proceeds from the sale of same shall be used to pay for the construction of certain additions and betterments as set forth in* the application herein. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that said applicant shall set aside an - nually out of its revenue a sum equal to, and not less than 9% on the reproduction value of its property as of July 1, 1917, which sum shall be used for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation and for no other purpose. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that said applicant shall, within sixty days of the date of this order, report to the Commission the sales of all stock herein authorized, to whom sold, and the amount received for same, together with a report as to the disposition of the proceeds of the same.

            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 319 APPLICATION NO. 3228. Application of the Fairfleld Telephone Com - pany for Authority to Issue Stock. OPINION AND FINDING. Wilton, Commissioner: This is an application of the Falrfield Telephone company of Fair - field, Nebraska, hereinafter called the company, for authority to issue its capital stocks in the amount of $S,600 par value, for the alleged purpose of making the company's capital account correspond with the value of its property. The amount of capital stock now outstanding is $4,300. The company's general account balances are as follows: Assets. Exchange central equipment $ 1,753.33 No protest was filed to the application and a hearing was held at the offices of the Commission, at which the applicant alone was represented. No accounting or engineering study was made of the company's books and plant by the Commission, in view of the showing made at the hear - ing and the Commission's interpretation of the law governing the case. The Commission is satisfied that the value of the company's property is in excess of $12,900, the sum of stock outstanding and that sought to be issued. The plant is located in a thriving town of about 1,000 popula - tion, surrounded by a prosperous farming territory, and it occupies the field exclusively as to telephone service. It is above the standard of construction usually found in similar fields, and supplies fairly good service. It covers the territory of its location quite completely and serves 370 subscribers of its own and performs switch service for 47 patrons of rural companies. The cost of the plant averaged a trifle over $40 per telephone, which is below the average of plants similarly situated. The power of a public service corporation, incorporated under the laws of Nebraska, to issue stocks is limited to the following purposes: "The acquisition of property, the construction, completion, extension or \erial equipment 8,959.69 Subscribers' station 3,481.32 Utility equipment 546.22 Material and supplies : 38.40 Garage building : 38.10 roll line equipment 817.66 Bills receivable .-. 270.33 ?ash on hand 1,809.28 Total $17,714.33 Liabilities.

            <seg id="p318">320 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT • improvement of facilities, or for the improvement or maintenance of Us service, or for the discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations;" and the Commission is obliged to find as a basis for the issuance of a permit that the use of funds to be secured by the proposed issue "is reasonably required for the said purposes of the corporation or one of them" (Ar - ticle XVIII, R. S. Nebr. 1913). The company makes no claim that it needs additional capital for the purchase or construction of any prop - erty, or to improve or maintain, its service in any way. At the hearing it abandoned the claim of right to issue stocks to the full value of its property, but contended that inasmuch as a substantial portion of its property had been built by the labors of its officers and directors for which no compensation had been made, that therefore it was entitled to discharge this obligation by the issuance of stocks. The legal question for determination by the Commission is whether such a claim constitutes an obligation within the meaning of the law. The plant in question was built in the main prior to the enactment of the stocks and bonds law. The company had a precarious existence during the first few years and considerable difficulty was experienced in financing the project. It was a co-operative concern to begin with, comprising 70 stockholders owning from one to four shares of stock each of a par value of $50. $4,200 of capital was contributed at the beginning by stockholders, and notwithstanding the urgent necessity for addi - tional construction funds during the early years, only $100 of additional capital was contributed. Borrowed funds to the extent of $3,300 were used in completing the plant, in addition to the investment of all in - come during the first three years, and it was not until the end of the seventh year that an 8% dividend basis was reached. The officers and directors were obliged to contribute time and labor without remunera - tion during the early years, and all of them, excepting the secretary, continued to serve without compensation until the present time. But notwithstanding the apparently gratuitous character of these services, the officials performed their full duty in the management and conduct of the property. The funds of the company appear to have been wisely ex - pended and complete books of account were kept at all times. The present secretary-manager has filled that position from the beginning. ' He is a business man of considerable ability and has carried on a jewelry and optical business in Fairneld jointly with his management of the telephone company. He testified that he was employed about 16 hours a day on the average in both businesses, one-half to each, and that his wife devoted about six days each month to doing the clerical work of the company. His salary for the first two years was only $200 per annum, which was gradually increased to $700 per annum, its present amount. The average salary paid him during the 13 years of the com - pany's existence is $35.16 per month and nothing was paid to the wife. In addition to this management and conduct of the company he was also obliged in conjunction with other officials to carry the burden of the company's finances. They personally guaranteed the repayment of bor - rowed funds, and in order to maintain the company's credit they pur- </seg>
            <seg id="p319">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 321 chased stock from the stockholders as it was offered for sale. Pur - chases of stock were made to such an extent that the officials now own 138 out of 172 shares of stock in force, and the number of stockholders is reduced in number from 70 to 12. The record shows that the official services above described were made in the belief and hope that their value would return to the con - tributors in the increased values of the company's property, otherwise they would have demanded payment contemporaneously with the serv - ices, and if such payment had been made it would have been necessary for the company to sell stock in order to provide the funds needed in constructing the plant. It is apparent that all the funds used in build - ing the plant came ultimately from the company's revenues, excepting the $4,300 contributed by stockholders. The Commission is of the opinion that it would be inequitable and unfair to deny to the owners of the company all reward for their sacri - fices, in fact the Commission believes that it cannot do so, and is of the opinion that the company is under a legal obligation to make compensa - tion in the premises. The company has partly compensated the contributors of these serv - ices by the payment of dividends above the measure of a reasonable re - turn. In view of the excellent management of the company the Commis - sion adopts a return of 8% per annum as reasonable. The deficit below this return during the first six years of the company amounted to $1,274; the excess above this return in subsequent years amounts to $5,237. Al - lowing a return of 87c on the deferred dividends and discounting divi - dends at the same rate shows that excess dividends in the amount' of $3,866.60 has been paid during the company's history, based upon the capital account. This excess will, therefore, be deducted from the value of the services rendered the company by its officers and for which no compensation was paid. The company made claim to the following values of official services per annum: President, $100; secretary-manager, $1,200; treasurer, $75; directors, $25 each. This is considered excessive in view of the com - parative smallness of the business and the wages paid the company's employees. The highest wages paid in the company's history are $60 per month to the lineman and $28 per month to operators, in return for which full time was given. The Commission finds that the reasonable values of the official services described are as follows: President, $50 per annum; treasurer, $25 per annum; secretary-manager, including services rendered by his wife, $600 per annum for the first three years, and $900 per annum for the ten remaining years; and directors, three in number, $15 each per annum. We also find that inasmuch as the re - sult of these services inured to the benefit of the company's property contemporaneously with their performance, that allowance should be made for return upon the values so found and at the same rate recog - nized as fair upon capital contributions. The present values of these services are as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p320">TENTH ANNUAL, REPORT 322 The Commission, therefore, finds that the amount of $6,650 par value of the company's stock is reasonably required for the purpose of dis - charging the company's obligations to its stockholders, such stock to - gether with the stock now in force to represent at the par value thereof the entire interest of the stockholders in and to the property held by the company. ' The Commission is also of the opinion that the stockholders are entitled to no more than a reasonable return upon the par value of the shares of stock held by them and that a reasonable return at this time and under the circumstances of this c^se is 8% per annum. The total amount of the company's stock in force, including the issue herein authorized, will be $10,950, and the approximate annual return thereon $876, which amounts are well within the present value of the property and the annual net income of the company, respectively. It appears from the record that the amount of revenue set aside for deferred depreciation, $2,300, is insufficient to cover the loss from this source. The secretary estimated existing depreciation of the com - pany's property to be 20% of its cost, which amounts to the sum of $3,126.94. This included nothing for obsolescence. The constant prog - ress under way in the art of telephony must be considered in providing for depreciation, otherwise the utility will be unable to furnish the patrons with modern service, and the company is not doing so in the instant case. Over one-half of the rural lines are of the grounded cir - cuit construction and nine-tenths of its residence lines in town are of the same type. Grounded circuits permit of considerable inductive interference with the talking current during electric storms, and is made unserviceable almost when paralleled by high tension electric transmis - sion lines, in fact leaks in transmission lines have been known to put grounded circuit telephone service out of use for a distance of one hun - dred miles from the location of the leak. The company in the instant case has amassed a considerable surplus from its revenues, in addition to maintaining the plant in good condition and paying a fair- return to stockholders. This surplus should be used for bettering the service. Metallic circuit construction should be substituted for grounded circuit construction as soon as the necessary materials and labor are available.

            <seg id="p322">324 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT APPLICATION NO. 3255 In the Matter of the Application of the Ne - braska Electric Company for Authority to Construct, Operate and Maintain a Trans - mission Line Between Wausa and Bloom - field, Nebraska. Appearances: For Applicant — John A. Reed, Rufus E. Lee, and S. S. Hough. For Protestants — J. E. Baggstrom OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: Applicant herein is a corporation, organized under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Iowa, and, complying with the laws of the state of Nebraska, has filed its articles of incorporation with the secretary of state, appointed an agent residing in the state, and maintains an office at Creighton, Knox county, Nebraska. It is engaged in the business of owning, operating and constructing electric light and power plants, trans - mission and distribution lines. It now owns and operates electric power plants at the cities of Bloomfield and Wausa, Knox county, Nebraska, and now purposes to construct a transmission line upon the public high - ways for the purpose of connecting these power plants. In this applica - tion it asks permission to construct a portion of said line described as follows : The transmission line will follow the highway and route as de- scribed, beginning at a point just north of the railway crossing of the C, St. P., M. &amp; O. railway right-of-way, and on the public high - way along the west side of sections 10 and 3, township 29, in range 2 west, and also on the public highway along the west side of sec- tions 34, 27, 22, 15, and 10, township 30. in range 2, Knox county, Ne- braska. With the application, as required by law, is a map showing the route of the line and also the lines of all other companies upon, across, or contiguous to the highway upon which this line is built, and giving the names of the owners of such other lines. From this it appears that the only interested party in the case is the Dowling Telephone Company No. 2. This company has entered into an agreement with applicant, waiv - ing all objection to the construction of the proposed line, a copy of this agreement being attached to the -application. At the hearing, however, J. E. Baggstrom, general manager of the Union Telephone company, ap - peared to register protest against the location of the transmission line on the proposed route on behalf of the Union Telephone company and also the Dowling Telephone company. The Dowling ' Telephone com - pany is a farm line, which is connected with the switchboard of the Union Telephone company and receives switching service therefrom. Mr. Baggstrom contended that the Dowling Telephone company had en - tered into the agreement under a misunderstanding of the facts, but ad - mitted that he had nothing more than verbal authority to speak for that </seg>
            <seg id="p323">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 325 company. He objected on behalf of hla own company for the reason that he feared any interference, caused by the transmission line, would be carried over the wires of the Dowling Telephone company to the switch - board of his company and thus cause trouble in the operation of his plant. If such should prove to be the case, the Commission will re - serve the right in its order to take such steps as seem necessary and wise to protect the telephone lines from substantial interference. The Commission, after a careful consideration of all the facts, finds that the route chosen by applicant is the most feasible one, consistent with reasonable construction costs, practical and efficient operation and maintenance, and probable expense to existing telephone lines. The application will therefore be granted, subject to conditions as herein - after set forth. ORDER. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Nebraska Electric company be, and the same is hereby authorized to construct, operate, and maintain a transmission line over which to transmit single or three phase electrical energy at a pressure of 13,200 volts along the route shown in its application, to- wit : The transmission line will follow the highway and route as de - scribed, beginning at a point just north of the railway crossing of the C, St. P., M. &amp; O. railway right-of-way, and on the public high - way along the west side of sections 10 and 3, township 29, in range 2 west, and also on the public highway along the west side of sec - tions 34, 27, 22, 15, and 10, township 30, in range 2, Knox county, Ne - braska. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all the material used in said line shall be of good quality and the workmanship to comply with approved standards and that the construction of said line shall be in accordance with the specifications as set forth in the application and marked Ex - hibit "C," subject to the following supplemental amendments: "All wires are to be suspended on poles approximately 125 feet apart and the tension on all wires located on transmission lines will be such that under the most adverse conditions the sag will not ex - ceed an amount permitted under specifications recommended by the National Electric Light association governing the construction of transmission lines carrying a voltage of 13,200, and in no case will any of the transmission lines be permitted to come nearer than six feet of any telephone or telegraph wires.

A. Browne, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3258. In the Matter of the Application of the Ne - braska Electric Company for Authority to Construct, Operate and Maintain a Transmission Line . Between Bloomfleld and Hartington, Nebraska. Appearances: For Applicant — Rufus E. Lee For Protestants — J. H. Gessler, Secretary, and Uri Hill, Manager, Bloomfleld Union Telephone Company. OPINION AND FINDING. Taylor, Commissioner: Applicant herein is a corporation, organized under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Iowa, and, complying with the laws of the state of Nebraska, having filed its articles of incorporation with the Secre - tary of State, appointed an agent residing in the state, and maintains an office at Creighton, Knox county, Nebraska. It is engaged in the business of owning, operating and constructing electric light and power plants, transmission and distribution lines. It now owns and operates electric plants, at the cities of Bloomfleld and Hartington and proposes to con - struct a transmission line upon the proposed highway for the purpose of ror.necting these power plants. The proposed line constitutes part of a system in northeast Ne - braska, a portion of which has already been approved in applications numbered 3255 and 3259. In this application it asks permission to con - struct a line along the following described route: Commencing at the north corporate limits of Bloomfield, Knox county, Nebraska; thence north on the public highway, located ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 327 proximately on the east side of section 3, township 30, north, range 3 west of the 5th P. M.; thence directly east along the south side of the public highway, located on the north side of township 30, through ranges 3, 2 and 1, west of the 5th P. M., and range 1 east of the 5th P. M., to the west line of the right-of-way of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company, running north and south through section 1, township 30, range 1 east of the 5th P. M.; thence north across said highway to the corporate limits of Hartington, Cedar county, Nebraska. The routing thus described is not the same as that originally asked for. At the hearing on applications numbered 3255 and 3259, objecting telephone companies suggested to applicant that the selection of the proposed highway running east and west a mile north of the route then proposed would be just as satisfactory from the standpoint of the Ne - braska Electric company, and would cause much less interference with telephone lines. After investigation, applicant found this to be true and amended its application covering the new route, as above described. This change necessitated the construction of an additional mile to con - nect with the Wausa-Bloomfleld line covered by application number 3255. This mile of line runs south on the proposed highway from a point five miles east of Bloomfield and effects a junction with the Wausa line. At the time of the hearing on this application, the Bloomfield Union Telephone company appeared by its officers to protest against the con - struction of that portion of the line running directly north from Bloom - field to the point where it turns east on the section line. It is stated by Protestants that they have a heavy telephone lead running north from Bloomfield on this highway and they fear that serious interference with their service will be caused by this half or three-quarters of a mile of parallel construction. They suggested that the line running out from Bloomfield be changed so as to follow a private right-of-way on the half section line east through section two. In their opinion adjoining prop - erty owners' consent could be secured for such right-of-way. Applicant, however, objects to such a route as being impractical on account of the presence of a large number of trees, and because of the difficulty that would attend its patrolling and repair. It was then suggested that the half section line running north from Bloomfield through section three might be selected and applicant indicated that an investigation would be made to see whether or not such a route is feasible, and if it is found that a right-of-way can be secured, such a route will be followed. Protestants, however, would not seriously object to the construction of the line on the route proposed by applicant, if the Commission includes in its order the same reservation as was incorporated in the orders made in applications numbered 3255 and 3259. As a condition of those orders the Commission reserved the right, should substantial interference be caused with existing lines, to make such order in relation thereto as it shall deem just, wise and right. In this connection it should be stated that a line of the Cedar County Telephone company occupies a portion of the highway which is to constitute the route of the transmission line. This company has filed no protest and was not present at the hearing. </seg>
            <seg id="p326">328 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT The Bloomfleld Union Telephone company has a single grounded farm line for a distance of about three and one-half miles on the same side of the highway to be occupied by the transmission line. It will be neces - sary to move this line to the opposite side of the road, the expense of which applicant is willing to bear. Subject to the conditions indicated, therefore, the Commission finds that the authority as prayed for should be granted. ORDER. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Nebraska Electric company be, and the same is hereby, authorized to construct, operate and maintain a transmission line over which to transmit single or three-phase electrical energy with a pressure of 13,200 volts at 60 cycles along the route shown in its application and above described. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the material used in said line shall be of good quality and the workmanship shall comply with approved standards; that the construction of said line shall be in accordance with the specifications as set forth in the application and marked Exhibit "C," subject to the following supplemental amendments: "AH wires are to be suspended on poles approximately 125 feet apart and the tension on all wires located on transmission lines will be such that under the most adverse conditions the sag will not ex - ceed an amount permitted under specifications recommended by the National Electric Light association governing the construction of transmission lines carrying a voltage of 13,200, and in no case will any of the transmission lines be permitted to come nearer than six feet of any telephone or telegraph wires. All transmission lines are to be transposed at all points where necessary in order to comply with the requirements of specifications adopted by the National Electric Light association in order to reduce to the minimum the inductive effect on adjacent telephone and telegraph lines. An adequate system of transposition shall be instituted in the power circuit where there is parallelism, and the transpositions in both communicating and power circuits shall be located with due regard to each other and with due regard to the limitation of the parallel in order to form as nearly as practicable a balanced sys - tem;" and such other specifications as may hereafter be prescribed by this Commission. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this permit is granted on the ex - press condition that if, after the line is constructed, substantial inter - ference with a telephone line, built prior to the construction of the trans - mission line, develops, then this Commission can make such order in relation thereto as the Commission shall deem just and right, which ordsr shall have all the force and effect of an order made prior to the build - ing of the transmission line, and as a part of the terms upon which this permit is issued.

Taylor, Commissioner: The applicant herein Is a corporation organized under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Iowa, and, complying with the laws of the state of Nebraska, has filed its articles of incorporation with the Secre - tary of State, has appointed an agent residing in the state, and maintains an office in Creighton, Knoz county, Nebraska. It is engaged in the business of owning, constructing and operating electric light and power plants, transmission and distribution lines. It now owns and operates electric light and power plants located in the towns of Creighton, Winne - toon, Bazile Mills, Wausa and Bloomfield, Nebraska, and it proposes to construct an electric transmission line upon the public highway for the purpose of connecting the distributing systems in the towns referred to. In this application it asks permission to construct transmission lines on a route described as follows: Beginning on the east corporation line of the city of Creighton and upon the west side of the highway along the east side of sec - tions 21, 16 and 9, in township 29 north, range 5 west, to the south corporation line of the town of Bazile Mills.

St. P M &amp; O. Ry. crossing on said highway in section 9; thence along the west line of the right-of-way of said railway to a point approxi - mately five hundred feet north of the north corporation line of the town of Wausa, and on the east side of the highway running north and south between sections 9 and 10 in township 29 north, range 2 west- thence north on the east side of said highway along the west side of section 10 in township 30 north, range 2 west, and crossing over the right-of-way of the Chicago &amp; North Western railway, at which point said line will connect to the transmission line of the Nebraska Electric company. All of the herein described transmis- sion line being located in Knox county, Nebraska. With the application, as required by law, is a map showing the route of the line and also the lines of all other companies upon, across or con - tiguous to the highway upon which this line is built, and giving the names of the owners of such other lines. From this it appears that the interested parties are the Northern Telephone company, the Bloomfleld Telephone company. Farmers Line No. 3 of Wausa, Farmers Line No. 4 of Wausa, Farmers Line No. 5 of Wausa, Union Telephone company and Farmers Union Telephone company. These companies have not waived objection to the construction of the transmission line on the route pro - posed, but were represented at the hearing and made protest against the construction of the line. In addition to these telephone companies, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company is an inter - ested party, for the reason that the proposed line will parallel the right - of-way of said railway company for an approximate distance of one-fourth mile at or near the town of Wausa. The Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company is also interested for the same reason, the proposed line paralleling the said railroad for a distance of approximately one-half mile at or near the town of Winnetoon. No objection is entered on be - half of the C, St. P., M. ft O. to the construction of the line on the route proposed, but the Chicago &amp; North Western objects to the location of the transmission line because it will occupy a private right-of-way con - tiguous to and Joining the right-of-way of the railway company. It is contended by the railway company that the transmission line should be required to secure a right-of-way at a greater distance from the railroad property, so as to reduce the danger of interference with railroad prop - erty during times of storm. In Application No. 3255 the Commission granted the said Nebraska Electric company authority to construct a transmission line between </seg>
            <seg id="p329">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 331 Wausa and Bloomfleld, this line to eventually become a part of the system covered in the present application. In that order the Commission retained jurisdiction of the issues involved, so that in the event that in - terference is caused with existing electric lines complaint can be lodged with the Commission, a hearing had as to the nature and amount of the interference, and the proper remedies be determined. The same pro - vision will be incorporated in the order in this case, and for that reason no finding is made as to the probable interference resulting from the construction of the proposed line. Since the hearing applicant has made an effort to secure agreements with the telephone companies, but with - out success. The Commission, after careful consideration of the record, finds that the authority as prayed for should be granted, subject to conditions as hereinafter set forth. ORDER.

            <seg id="p336">338 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT RESOLVED, by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that it do now proceed upon its own motion to investigate the supply of freight cars on the railroads of the following railroad companies in Nebraska, to- wit: Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, Union Pacific Railroad company, Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company, The Missouri Pacific Railway company, Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company, The St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company, and The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company, and the formulation of a set of rules for the dis - tribution of such freight cars as are now or hereafter may come upon the railroads of said companies, between the several divisions and stations of such railroads, and between the several shippers of such stations. IT IS ORDERED that copies of this resolution be served upon each of the above named railroad companies as if complaint had been made in the usual form and that each of said railroad com - panies and every shipper or other interested party may plead hereto on or before the 1st day of May, 1917, why the Commission shall not make a finding that the supply of freight cars upon all of said rail - roads in Nebraska is inadequate to receive, transport and discharge within a reasonable time the property offered to each of said com - panies for transportation, and why the Commission shall not formu - late and establish the following set of rules for the distribution of freight cars as are now or hereafter come upon each of said rail - roads, to-wit: CAR DISTRIBUTION RULES. Rules promulgated by the Nebraska State Railway Commission for the apportionment and distribution of freight cars upon the railroad in Nebraska: On and after May 20, 1917, and until the further order of the Commission, all freight cars affected hereby shall be apportioned and distributed according to the following rules: Definition*: The cars to be apportioned under these rules shall be all cars available and suitable for the transportation of commodi - ties offered for shipment in Nebraska. A "division" shall be that portion of a railroad under the direct supervision of a division superintendent. A "station" shall include agency and non-agency stations and all other points upon a railroad from which rates are quoted in the official tariffs of the carrier. A "shipper" shall mean any person, firm, company, association or corporation in Nebraska, offering freight in carload lots to be carried over the railroad in accordance with the provisions of the official tariffs of the carrier. Shippers shall be divided into "regular shippers," "new regular shippers" and "miscellaneous shippers." A "regular shipper" is any person, association, firm or corpora - tion established at a station who has made shipments of commodities in carload lots at frequent intervals from such station for one year or more immediately preceding date of his classification. A "new regular shipper" is any person, association, firm, or corporation established at a station for less than one year and the nature of whose business requires shipments of commodities in car - load lots at frequent intervals. A "miscellaneous shipper" shall be every shipper other than a "regular" or "new regular" shipper. </seg>
            <seg id="p337">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 339 RULES AND REGULATIONS. General Rule. Rule No. 1 The apportionment of cars by the railroad company be - tween different divisions, stations and shippers, shall be determined by the relative volume of carload shipments of freight originated by each division, station and shipper. The unit for determining the relative volume of shipments shall be the calendar month. Division. Rule No. 2. Cars shall be apportioned during the current month to each division according to the ratio the carload shipments orig - inated by such division during the corresponding month of the last five preceding years bears to the whole of such shipments originated by the railroad. A — In determining the ratio as provided in this rule, shipments moving in open top, live stock, and specially equipped cars shall be considered separately from ship - ments in other cars. B — Cars moving under reconsignment or cleaning-in-tran - sit privileges shall be included at point of origin only. C — Cars forwarded carrying less than carload shipments from jobbing stations, shall be included in determining the ratio as provided in this rule. Station. Rule No. 3. Cars shall be apportioned during the current month to each station according to the ratio the carload shipment orig - inated by such station during the corresponding month of the five preceding years bears to the whole of such ship - ments for the same period from all stations upon the division. A— Sub-divisions (A), (B) and (C) of Rule No. 2 shall apply to and modify this rule. B — In the case of stations which have not been in ex - istence for five years, the ratio shall be computed upon the actual period during which the station has existed. Shippers. Rule No. 4. Cars shall be apportioned during the current month to ship - pers at a station according to the carload shipments orig - inated by each shipper during the corresponding month of the five preceding years. A — In determining the ratio and apportioning cars, ship - ments moving in open top, live stock, and specially equipped cars shall be considered separately from ship - ments in other cars. B — Cars shall be apportioned to regular and new reg - ular shippers as a class, and to miscellaneous shippers as a class, according to the respective ratio which the num - ber of carload shipments made by each of such classes bears to the number of all carload shipments during the monthly five-year period. C — Cars shall be apportioned to each regular shipper ac - cording to the ratio the carload shipments originated by him bears to the whole of such shipments by regular shippers during the monthly five-year period. In the </seg>
            <seg id="p338">340 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT case of regular shippers who have not been established at the station for five years preceding, the ratio as to all regular shippers at the station shall be computed upon the corresponding monthly period that the junior regular shipper has been in business. The purchaser of an estab - lished industry in the regular and new regular class of shippers shall succeed to the rights of his predecessor. D — Cars shall be apportioned to the new regular shipper according to the ratio which the average number of car - load shipments of like commodities made by regular shippers at all stations on the division on which such station is located during the five-year monthly period, bears to the sum of such average number and the average number of carload shipments made by regular shippers at the station during such period. E — Cars shall be apportioned to each miscellaneous shipper in rotation in the order application is made there - for by miscellaneous shippers in the order book. F — Whenever any shipper declines or fails to accept a car apportioned to him, or fails to begin to load the same within the free period allowed for loading under the official tariffs of the carrier, he shall forfeit all right to such car and the car shall be apportioned to the next shipper en - titled thereto. A car so transferred shall not be counted against the shipper accepting and loading the same in the monthly apportionment. Rule No. 5. Every railroad company shall provide each of its station agents with a book to be known as the car order book, which book shall be open to the inspection of shippers dur - ing regular business hours. Such book shall be properly ruled and with suitable headings, and shall show (a) the name of the applicant, (b) the date of the order, (c) the date car is wanted, (d) the commodity for shipment, (e) the kind and capacity of car desired, (f) the general direction of the shipment, (g) the date car is furnished, (h) the initials and number of car furnished, and (i) the kind and capacity of car furnished. Rule No. 6. Every shipper shall apply for a car or cars in his or its own name only. No shipper shall apply in any one day for cars in excess of his or its capacity to load in one day, and no shipper shall have at any one time unfilled applications for cars in the car order book the capacity of which cars shall be in excess of the volume of commodities owned or pur - chased by him or it and offered for shipment. Rule No. 7.

            <seg id="p339">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 341 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing be had in the above entitled matter at the offices of this Commission in Lincoln, Ne - braska, at 10:00 A. M., May 11, 1917. Due service of the order was made upon each of the carriers named therein, and a hearing was held at the office of the Commission on May 11-12, 1917. Answers were filed by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, the Union Pacific Railroad company and the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company, only. The North Western denied in its answer that any shortage of cars existed on its lines of railroad in Nebraska. The Burlington and Union Pacific companies made no such denial, and the remaining carriers made no denial of shortage at the hearing. Various objections were made by the answering carriers to the nature of the proposed rules, chief among which were: (1) No allow - ance is given to the amount of commodities offered for transportation; (2) the application of the proposed rules is unnecessarily burdensome to the carriers; and (3) the proposed rules are unreasonable, inadequate, ambiguous, inequitable and unworkable. The Burlington company ob - jected to the proposed rules upon the additional ground that they in - cluded cars to be used in interstate commerce in contravention of federal law, and not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. The hearing was devoted principally to a discussion of the nature of the rules. A majority of the shippers present united with the carriers in criticism of the failure to make any allowance for the volume of com - modities offered for shipment, and the Commission is convinced not only of the justness of this criticism, but also of its duty under the law to make such allowance. Section 4 of Article 11 of the Constitution of Nebraska provides: "The liability of railroad corporations as common carriers shall never be limited." The liability or duty of railroads at the time of the adoption of the constitution, in so far as it relates to the furnishing of cars, required railroads to furnish cars within a reason - able time sufficient in number and capacity to transport the goods of - fered to them for carriage. In a case dealing with the distribution of cars among shippers in a time of shortage, the Nebraska Supreme Court held that the relative volume of shipping business done by the shipper in the past, and his facilities for loading cars, should also be taken into consideration. (State ex rel McComb vs. C, B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 71 Neb., 593.) The case presented a track buyer in opposition to elevator buyers and did not contain all of the facts necessary to the determination of general rules. The Commission is unable to find sufficient reason in the record for including loading facilities of shippers as a factor in the distribution of cars. Practically every shipper is able to load a car within the 48 hours of free time allowed by law for loading, and usually loads in the shorter period transpiring between the movement of the trains in which the car is carried. The Commission is of the opinion, however, that, in framing the rules, it may not disregard the amount of goods offered for shipment. The necessities of the shipper correspond to this factor more </seg>
            <seg id="p340">342 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT than to his past volume of business, as a rule, and an equitable appor - tionment of cars cannot be secured without taking it into account. Fortunately, the legislative act under which the Commission is proceed - ing, while it adopts the volume of shipments as the main principle in dis - tributing cars, provides also that the Commission may depart from the act when necessity is found to exist; and such necessity is hereby found to exist to the extent the rules provided in the order herein differ from the act in question. The reasons therefor are to secure a more equit - able distribution of cars in time of shortage, and to comply with the con - stitutional provision referred to. The Commission also believes that it is impracticable at this time to adopt rules applying to all cars, and to their apportionment among all classes of shippers. The Federal Government is regulating the distribu - tion of cars to a considerable extent among some classes of shippers, particularly shippers using open top cars; and no extensive shortage was shown to exist excepting as to cars suitable for grain and mill products loading. For these reasons, and the extreme difficulty of drafting equit - able rules applicable to all classes of shippers, particularly in the absence of all precedent and experience along that line, the Commission believes that the initial effort should be made only in the field of general and most acute shortage, to-wit: among shippers of grain and mill products. Experience may develop some inequality in the rules adopted, and the ensuing injury be greater than that suffered under the carrier's method of distributing cars. It is wise to experiment in a limited way for that reason. The Commission will also forego the adoption of rules at this time for the apportionment of cars between the several divisions and stations of the railroads. The record shows little complaint on this score, and to interfere with the carriers' methods in this field at a time when their equipment is more or less subject to national control, would be hazard - ing their general efficiency, to say the least. At any rate, the Commis - sion prefers to await the results of the limited rules provided herein before entering the larger and more complete field. Pertaining to the Burlington's plea that the Commission is without jurisdiction to regulate the distribution of cars within the state for use in interstate commerce, the Commission is of the opinion that it has such jurisdiction in so far as it does not conflict with any rule or order of the Federal Government in the premises. The mere empowering of some branch of the Federal Government to make rules or orders for the distribution of cars without any exercise of the power, does not disable the state from acting. The United States Supreme Court recognized this distinction in the Minnesota rate cases by refusing to set aside the state rates, although manifestly discriminatory in character, on the ground that the Interstate Commerce Commission had not exercised its au - thority in the matter; citing a number of illustrations of lawful state regulation under these circumstances. Quoting from the opinion: </seg>
            <seg id="p341">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 343 "There are certain subjects having the most obvious and direct relation to interstate commerce, which nevertheless, with the ac - quiescence of Congress, have been controlled by state regulation from the foundation of the Government because of the necessity that they should not rtmain unregulated and thai their regulation should be adapted to varying local exigencies; hence, the absence of regula - tion by Congress in such matters has not imported that there should be no restriction, but rather that the States should continue to sup - ply the needed rules until Congress should decide to supersede them." The Interstate Commerce Commission has been granted authority to establish rules for the distribution of cars for use in interstate commerce, but it has not exercised that authority to date. True, it has made specific distribution of some cars through its Car Service Division, but It has adopted no rule of general and continuous application. This Com - mission recognizes the paramount authority of the Federal Government to the full extent of its exercise, and the order herein will so provide; but it would be remiss in its duty were it to abandon the field because of the possibility only of federal interference. As a matter of fact, this Commission is advised that it is the desire of the Federal Commission that the state commissions undertake local distributions of cars regard - less of destination, for the time being, at least. This position of the national body is doubtless due to the greatness of the undertaking in - volved in this new power, and the tremendous burden under which the Commission is already laboring. It will be recognized that the task of regulating car distribution is not the adoption of rules merely, which is comparatively light. The heavy labor comes in their administration, re - quiring as it does the hearing of individual complaints and the gathering of statistical information in every case. The plea to the jurisdiction is therefore overruled in so far as it does not apply to cars distributed by federal rule or order. The Commission finds from the record, and without prejudice to other and future findings thereon, that the supply of freight cars with which to receive, transport and discharge within a reasonable time the grain and mill products offered for transportation at stations in Ne - braska to the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, the Union Pacific Railroad company, the Missouri Pacific Railroad company, the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company and the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company, and each of them, is inadequate, and that rules be formu'ated and established for the transportation of such prod - ucts and made empty within the state of Nebraska, which are not specifically assigned by the railroad having possession of the same for the purpose of discharging orders of the Federal Government or any of its branches, and which are not required by law for the transportation of other commodities. ORDER. It I* Therefore Ordered by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the following rules be adopted for the apportionment and distribu- </seg>

Rule* promulgated by the Nebraska State Railway Commission for the apportionment and distribution of freight cars to shippers of grain and mill products in Nebraska, effective January 1, 1918. Definitions: The cars to be apportioned under these rules shall be all cars suitable for the transportation of grain and mill products made empty within the state of Nebraska which are not specifically assigned by the railroad having possession of the same for the purpose of dis - charging orders or rules of the Federal Government, or any of its branches, and which are not required by law for the transportation of other commodities. A "shipper" shall mean any person, firm, company, association or corporation in Nebraska offering grain or mill products in carload lots to be carried over the railroad in accordance with the provisions of the official tariffs of the carriers. Shippers shall be divided into "regular shippers" and "miscellaneous shippers". A "regular shipper" is any person, association, firm or corporation established at a station and in possession of an elevator, warehouse or mill in which grain or mill products are stored preparatory to transpor - tation thereof by railroad, who has made shipments of such commodities in carload lots at frequent intervals from such station for one month or more immediately preceding the date of his classification. A "miscellaneous shipper" shall be every shipper of grain or mill products from a station other than a "regular" shipper. Rule No. 1. Cars shall be apportioned between regular shippers as a class and miscellaneous shippers as a class at a station during the cur - rent month according to the respective numbers of carload shipments of grain and mill products originated by such classes of shippers from the station during the preceding calendar year, beginning with the year 1917. Rule No. 2. Cars shall be apportioned to each regular shipper during the current month according to the following factors, equal consideration to be given each of said factors, to-wit: (1) To the percentage as near as may be that the number of carload shipments originated by such shipper during the preceding calendar year, beginning with the year 1917, (or, in the case of shippers not in business at the station for the entire year, the number of carload shipments originated by such shipper during the full calendar months he has been in business, theoretically extended to include an entire year), is of the whole number of carload shipments </seg>

Example: Carload Shipments During Preceding Calendar Year. Shipper "A' 200 cars— his ratio 40% Shipper "B" 150 cars— his ratio 30% Shipper "C 100 cars — his ratio 20% Combined Percentages, Shipper 'A" 40% plus 30% Shipper "B" 30% plus 40% Shipper "C" 20% plus 10% Shipper "D" 10% plus 20% his share of cars 35% -T- 2— his share of cars 35% -5- 2 — his share of cars 15% -T- 2 — his share of cars 15% Total 100% 100% 100% Car capacity shall be given due consideration in the apportionment of tars. Rule No. 3. Cars shall be apportioned to each miscellaneous shipper at the station in the order application is made therefor by miscellaneous shippers in the order book. Rule No. 4. A regular shipper shall not offer for shipment grain or mill products in excess of the amount thereof in his elevator, warehouse or mill designed in good faith for immediate shipment. Written notice of such offer, specifying the commodity and the number of bushels or pounds thereof, shall be made to the resident agent of the railroad, who shall preserve the same in a file kept for that purpose. Regular shippers shall also file with the resident agent, weekly as made, a copy of their report to the National Food Administration of grain and mill products in store. Rule No. 5. Whenever any shipper declines or fails to accept a car apportioned to him, or fails to begin to load the same within the free period allowed for loading under the official tariffs of the carriers, he shall forfeit all right to such car and the car shall be apportioned to the next shipper entitled thereto. A car so transferred shall be counted Shipper "D" 50 cars— his ratio 10% Total 500 cars 100% Volume of Commodities Tendered for Shipment. Shipper "A" 30,000 bushels — his ratio 30% Shipper "B" 40,000 bushels — his ratio 40% Shipper "C" 10,000 bushels — his ratio 10% Shipper "D" 20,000 bushels— his ratio 20% Total 100,000 bushels 100% </seg>

The second section of No. 156 had stopped at the point of the wreck on account of a flaming hot box on a car in the train. Third section of No. 156 ran into the rear end of said second section, causing the stock car loaded with cattle, which was immediately in front of the way car on second section of No. 156, to completely tele - scope the way car, in which were riding thirty-one caretakers of live stock and two railroad employes. The wreck resulted in the death of eleven caretakers and passengers and the injury, more or less seriously, of eleven passengers or caretakers. The wreck occurred on approximately a level piece of track, and the view was unobstructed for a distance of at least two and one-half miles west of the point of the wreck. Representatives of the Interstate Commerce Commission participated In the hearing before this Commission, said representatives being Inspec - tors Walter P. Wagar and Frank F. Ingles. There was a light rain falling more or less intermittently during the night of the accident. The facts leading up to the wreck, as developed by the records, might briefly be summarized as follows: CAUSES OF WRECK October 14th, 1916, fell on a Saturday. The wreck therefore oc - curred on Sunday morning. It is common for the Burlington to have large runs of live stock off of the so-called High Line to primary mar - kets on Saturday and Sunday of each week. In order to take care of a somewhat unusually heavy run of stock of October 14th, the Burling - ton Railroad Company through its operating officials ran three trains between Curtis and Holdrege, with running orders as 1st, 2nd and 3d No. 156. First No. 156 left Curtis, a train terminal point on the above mentioned line of road, at 11:05 P. H. October 14th, and picked up the stock originating at stations Curtis to Holdrege. Second No. 166 left Curtis at 12:50 A. M. October 16th and consisted of forty-four cars of stock which arrived at Curtis from the west at 12:30 A. M. October 16th in extra 1232 east. Two engines were used in hauling train Second No. 156 from Curtis to Elwood. There were thirty-one passengers in the way car of Second No. 156 leaving Curtis. Third No. 156 left Curtis at </seg>
            <seg id="p349">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 351 1:01 A. M. October 15th, as shown by the train sheet submitted in evi - dence in this case. The Third section No. 156 consisted of twenty-one cars of stock mostly loaded at Grant, Nebraska, a station west of Curtis. The Burlington does not maintain any night offices between Curtis and Holdrege, a distance of seventy-three miles. The running orders of the three sections of train No. 156 were, as stated by the dispatcher when on the stand, 'Engines 1227, 1232 and 1226 run as 1st, 2d and 3d Nos. 156, Curtis to Holdrege." The third section of No. 156 was allowed to proceed from Curtis on a "permissive card" stating that "the second section No. 156 was in block between Curtis and Holdrege." Second section No. 156 was bothered with hot boxes on certain cars in their train after leaving Curtis. At Eustis and Elwood the train crew on this section worked with hot boxes. The engines of Second and Third No. 156 were equipped with electric headlights. The third section had approached the rear end of the sec - ond section before the second section had proceeded more than four or five miles from Curtis, and at this point the rear brakeman of the second section testified that he lit and exposed a fusee from the rear end of the way car platform in order to warn the third section of the location of the second section. At a point approximately three miles east of Smithfield, a station fifty miles east of Curtis, the head brakeman of Second No. 156 noticed a blazing hot box on a car some fifteen or twenty cars back of the engine on the north or left side of the train. Said head brakeman notified the engineer that there was a blazing hot box, and that they had better stop. The engineer applied the air brakes and stopped his train. About the time or a little before the train came to a standstill, he is said to have blown a signal for the flagman to be sent back to protect the rear of tne train. About the time that the train stopped, the conductor, Geo. W. Sawyer, who was in charge of the train, and the rear brakeman, R. G. Talbott, got down out of the cupola of the way car. Rear Brakeman Talbott, after stepping over two or three of the passengers, secured his white lantern from a point near the stove, and proceeded towards the front or east end of the way car and on to the platform of same. Immediately following him was Conductor Sawyer. Brakeman Talbott, before leav - ing the cupola, after he had seen that the train was going to stop, claims to have looked back through the window of the cupola to see whether or not the third section of No. 156 was in sight. He got off of the front end platform of the way car on the north or left side. Conductor Sawyer got off on the right or south side of the platform and started on a dog trot towards the head end of the train. Brakeman Talbott is said to have looked back again, after having stepped to the ground on the north side of the train, to see whether he could see the headlight of the third section No. 156, and then turned and looked towards the head end t&gt;f the train and saw that there was a blazing hot box on a car located, as he estimated, about the middle of the train. As soon as he noticed the b'az- </seg>
            <seg id="p350">352 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT ing box he called across to Conductor Sawyer, who by this time had pro - ceeded several cars towards the front end. Brakeman Talbott, appear - ing to realize that Sawyer did not hear him, started to run towards the front end. After proceeding a short distance he again called to Conduc - tor Sawyer, who crossed from the south or right-hand side of the train to the left-hand side, some eight or nine cars (the exact number of cars is not definitely fixed in the record) from the way car. Brakeman Tal - bott, after having notified Conductor Sawyer of the blazing box, started towards the rear end of the train for the purpose, according to his testi - mony, of getting his red light. When he had proceeded a little way past the front or east end of the way car he noticed a small white light; al - most immediately he realized that the third section of No. 156 was a short distance back of the way car. He testified that he could see the fire flying from the brakes of the cars on third section No. 156 and be - fore he could reach the rear end of the way car the wreck occurred. Brakeman Talbott testified that he knew that the rules of the com - pany provided that he should have immediately started back to flag his train as soon as his train stopped. He testified that as long as he could not see the headlight of Third No. 156 before leaving the cupola he de - termined that he would have time to assist in finding what caused the train to stop and then proceed to protect the rear end. He testified thai according to his best judgment the wreck happened a minute and a half or two minutes after his train had stopped. The testimony does not agree as to the actual lapse of time after the second section stopped bsfore the wreck occurred. The train men on the second section fixed the time from one and one-half minutes to four or five minutes. Some of the pas - sengers placed the time from five to ten minutes. A summary of the testimony as to this point might be said to establish the fact that the wreck occurred within three or four minutes after the second section came to a full stop. Brakeman Talbott flagged Third Section No. 156 by lighting a fusee between Curtis and Moorefleld and again at Eustis. He testified that the headlight of Third No. 156 was burning brightly at both times. Con - ductor on Second No. 156 testified that his train stopped within less than the length of the train after it started to slow down; that there were fusees in the cupola but that he did not attempt to light one, nor did ha directly instruct Brakeman Talbott to immediately protect the rear end of his train. Mr. Patten, engineer on the third section, testified that he had a good headlight when he left Curtis; that he had some trouble with his light on the run west of Curtis; that he lost his electric headlight at Eustis; that he had tried but was unable to make it light, and at the above mentioned station he put a white light in the headlight; that his dynamo was working satisfactorily, but that he could not get the arc - light, to start; that he saw the tail-lights on the back of the way car on Second No. 156 between Curtis and Moorefield; that he was flagged by a fusee in the west yards at Eustis; that he did not see the rear lights </seg>
            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 353 of Second No. 156 after leaving Eustis until within twenty or twenty - five car lengths of the way car; that the first lights he saw were the two rear end markers; that he instantly applied a service application of the air to his train; that at first he thought the second section was still mov - ing, but in an instant more he realized that the train had stopped and that he applied an emergency application to the air brakes; that he re - versed his engine before he struck the rear end. From the testimony it appears to the Commission that the direct cause of the wreck was the failure of the electric headlight on Third sec - tion No. 156. In arriving at this conclusion the Commission takes into account the fact that train men operating trains on the so-called High line of the Burlington seldom have occasion to handle trains in sections, or, in other words, men operating trains on this division do not real.ze the urgent responsibility of protecting their trains if anything goes wrong, which makes it necessary to stop between stations, like train crews oper - ating on the main line where there is a large number of trains. Primarily it was the duty of the conductor of Second No. 156 to immediately see that the rear end of his train was protected when he realized that his train was stopping. Directly it was the duty of Brakeman Talbott to pro - ect he rear end of the train. No doubt Conductor Sawyer and Brakeman Talbott relied entirely upon the fact that the headlight of Third section No. 156 was not in sight, therefore the urgency for immediate protection was not apparent. The engineer on Second No. 156 was in a measure at fault for not keeping his train in slow motion until he was sure the rear end of his train was protected against Third No. 156, which he had every reason to believe might be following closely behind. The officers of the company are not blameless for running a light train of twenty-one cars out of the terminal station behind a heavily loaded train of forty-four cars within ten minutes of the leaving time of the heavy train. It is manifestly impossible for a heavy train to keep out of the way of a light train. This Commission is further of the opinion that the officers of the company are at fault for not providing a caretakers' way car for the ac - commodation of the stockmen riding on Second section No. 156. The statute of Nebraska provides that stock trains with the number of care - takers that were riding in Second No. 156 should have a "drovers' " way car with passenger coach seats and complying with the other provisions of the statute. The law is (Chapter 67, Section No. 84, 1913 Compiled Statutes at Nebraska) : "CARS FOR SHIPPERS— CARETAKERS.— Every individual, company or corporation owning, managing or operating, or Who may hereafter own, manage or operate any railroad or part of a railroad in this state, which carries passengers or whose duty it is to trans - port live stock as a common carrier, is heraby required to furnish for the use of such passenger, shipper of live stock, or to those having CONCLUSION. </seg>

The officers of the company were thoroughly advised many hours before Second No. 156 left Curtis of the number of cars of stock there would be in said Second No. 156 out of Curtis on the date herein con - sidered. The train dispatcher's train sheet of Saturday, October 14, 1916, shows that stock was to be loaded at stations between Sterling, Colo - rado, and Holdrege, Nebraska, as follows: Number Cars iaxtum, Colo iolyoke, Colo /enango, Nebr 3randon, Nebr Irant, Nebr Hadrid, Nebr Slale, Nebr iVallace, Nebr Dickens, Nebr Somerset, Nebr Kaywood, Nebr 4 2 7 2 19 2 3 13 5 5 5 Total 67 n </seg>
            <seg id="p353">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 355 The above tabulation shows that all but six of the ninety-three cars of stock reported to the dispatcher to be loaded within the next twenty - four hours originated at Nebraska stations. The attention of the officers of the company was forcibly called to the fact that the way car on Second No. 156 was wholly inadequate to accommodatp the caretakers of live stock. The crowded condition of the way car is emphasized several times in the record. Mr. Knapp a live stock shipper, testified as follows (page No. 128): Q. Why were you riding in the cupola? A. There was no room any place else to find a seat. The seats were all taken. Q. Was that the reason the men were riding on the platform? A. I couldn't tell you as to that, but the seats were all taken when we got on the way car, so I got up in the cupola and found a place there and stayed there. Q. You mean to say the seats all along the wall and the floor space in between were filled with passengers and baggage? A. The seats were all taken. There was nothing left but stand - ing room when I got on it, and I found that seat up there and stayed there the rest of the time. Q. Did you hear the conductor testify? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you hear him speak of the crowded condition of the car? Was the alleyway crowded so as to make it inconvenient for the conductor to .get off the train and get back on again? A. I have an idea it would be, a part of the time at least. Q. The way car was the ordinary way car, side seats parallel with the car? A. Yes, sir. Mr. Sawyer, conductor of the Ill-fated train, testified as to the crowd - ed condition of his way car as follows, (page No. 87) : Q. How many stockmen were in your way car leaving Elwood? A. Thirty-one men. Q. And where were they located in the car? A. Some of them were on the side seats; two or three in the alleyway between the closets, I suppose you would call it, under the cupola seats. Q. Just standing in the alleyway? A. Sitting on boxes or something, any convenience that we could find for them.

            <seg id="p354">356 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT Q. The car was badly crowded? A. Yes, sir; there were two or three in the cupola and some on the way car steps of the way car or platform. Q. Sitting on something on the platform, the back platform? A. Standing around the door and hanging on the grab-irons around there, and now I wouldn't be positive that there were any in the cupola. Q. Did any of the stockmen complain to you about the crowded condition of the way car? A. They told me they asked for a coach at Curtis From the testimony and from viewing the wrecked way car, the Com - mission is of the opinion that the loss of life would have been materially reduced had the officers of the company complied with the Nebraska statute and had furnished a caretakers' way car as provided by law. The wreck might not have occurred at all had the officers of the company provided a coach for the passengers on Second No. 156. The fearful loss of life was primarily caused by reason of the fact that Jhe wrecked way car was light and short. The back end of the way car skidded up the engine pilot frame braces, thereby lowering the front end of the way car, so that the drawbar went under the back drawbar of the stock car and thereby allowed the hind end of the stock car to ride over the front platform of the way car. The superstructure of the way car of - fered very little resistance to the floor frame of the stock car, and it was here that the heavy loss of life happened. If there had been a coach provided for the stockmen the drawbars and frame of the car might have taken the entire shock of the collision. Engineer Patten, of the third section, testified that he did not think he was moving more than eight or ten miles per hour when he hit the way car of the second section. During the hearing counsel for the Burlington appeared to question the application of the Nebraska statute as to the furnishing of other than an ordinary way car for the accommodation of live stock caretakers on Second No. 156. It appears to the Commission that the law is clear. The records of ths company showed that there would be eighty-seven cars of stock loaded at Nebraska stations, Venango to Holdrege. This record was made many hours before the trains were started from Ster - ling or Curtis, the train division points where suitable coaches for the care of live stock caretakers should have been provided. The Commission herein finds that the direct cause of the wreck was on account of the failure of the headlight on the engine of the third section; however, the failure of the company to furnish a "drovers" way car for the second section passengers is a subject that must have most careful consideration in the final disposition of this case. In the order the Commission will call specific attention to this question. From the testimony submitted by the officers and employes of the company as to the care and inspection given electric headlights, the Commission is of the opinion that an order should be entered requiring </seg>
            <seg id="p355">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 357 the Burlington company to give more attention to the electric headlights of engines so equipped than was evidenced by the record in this case. As heretofore noted, the Commission is of the opinion that the direct cause of the wreck and the attendant loss of life considered in this case was due to the failure of the electric headlight on engine No. 1226, which was pulling the third section of No. 156. If the headlight had been in operation the conductor and brakeman of the second section would have realized the necessity of protecting the rear end of their train before they undertook to find out what had caused the train to stop; again, if the headlight had been burning properly the engineer on the third section would have been able to distinguish the tail end of the second section a sufficient distance away to have stopped his train in time to prevent the wreck. The testimony shows that the white lantern in the headlight was of no assistance whatever in distinguishing objects on the track ahead of the engine. Engineer Patten testified as follows: Q. How long after they left Eustis did you think it was be - fore you left there? A. I should judge about thirty minutes Q. Do you think it was that long? A. I think it was; I am not positive of that fact, I don't know the exact time they left. Q. And that is where you put your white light in your head - light? A. Yes, sir; I put it in when the engine was standing at the coal shed. Q. Did you see any of the lights or any sign of Second No. 156 from that time until you seen their lights just before you went into the train? A. No, sir. Q. Did you have any idea of where they were ahead of you? A. Not after they left Eustis, I didn't. Q. How far ahead of you did they get any rays from the lan - tern light in your headlight? A. It would just show barely enough to throw rays on the track. I couldn't see practically anything on the track ahead of i»* at all. From the above testimony it is self-evident that the white lantern in the headlight would in no measure answer the requirements for which the headlight is placed on a locomotive. The operating train rules of the company as to the "Manual Block System" appear to be ample for the safe protection of trains; where open telegraph offices are maintained at sufficiently close intervals, but where the "permissive card" is used to clear trains over an entire tr*un division, as was used in this case, there is no added protection to trains by reason of the "Manual Block." However, the Commission recog - nizes that where a limited number of trains are operated at night over the line of road Curtis to Holdrege, it would be impracticable to require the company to maintain night offices at all stations for the purpose of </seg>
            <seg id="p356">358 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT operating the "Manual Block" and thereby know that the train had reached the preceding station before the train was allowed to use the track between two given stations. It was shown in the record that the company had used due dili - gence in the instructions of its train employes in order to see that all understand the book of rules governing the movement of trains. It is the opinion of the Commission, and we so find, that Burling - ton Railroad company should be required to amend its rules relative to the operation of trains so as to provide that where trains are allowed to enter a block under the "permissive card" rule, and the headlight on the engine should become inoperative, that the train should immediately be stopped, and the same not allowed to proceed except by the flagman walking ahead of the engine until the next station is reached. The Com - mission further finds that an engine with a defective headlight should not be allowed to depart from a station until receiving notice from the super - intendent, or his duly authorized representative, giving advice that there are no trains preceding said engine between that station and the station where the track is known to be clear of all trains. For the purpose that an order may be entered which will have the advantage of the experience and consultation of the company, the Com - mission will fix a date in the order entered in this case at which time evidence may be given tending to show to the Commission what rules might properly be enforced as to the inspection and care that should be given headlights operated electrically, or by any method other than the common signal oil lamp. The question of furnishing way cars as re - quired by law will also be considered by the Commission. An order will be entered according to these findings. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company shall appear at the offices of the Commission at 10:00 A. M. Tuesday, July 17th, 1917, and show cause why the following rules as to train operation should not be ordered by the Commission: IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that: A. — An engine in road' service should not leave a station without a headlight of sufficient power to clearly discern an object of the size of a man, located six hundred (600) feet from said headlight; provided, however, that where it becomes neces - sary by reason of serious delay or other reasonable causes to operate a road engine with a headlight of less power than indi - cated above, that said engine shall not be allowed to leave a station when there are trains between the point at which the engine is located and the next open telegraph station. B. — In case the headlight on a road engine should become inoperative between stations and not be of sufficient power to clearly define objects on the track six hundred (600) feet from the headlight, the train shall be stopped, and shall proceed to the next station by the flagman walking ahead of the engine a proper distance, until the next station is reached. If said sta- </seg>

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company shall amend its Operating Book of Rules so as to prov.de that where a freight train is allowed to enter a bock as provided in Rule No. 318-B, as provided in "Book of Rules, C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co.", effective December 1st, 1900, the train shall pro - ceed under lull control at all points where a clear vision of the track cannot be had for a distance of more than two thousand feet. Said company shall further provide that where freight trains are run in sections and any of said sections, except the last section, shall have unusual causes for delay, the section so delayed shall leave a flag - man at a station, or between stations where said de'ay occurs, with instructions that said flagman shall flag the following section and notify the engineer of said following section that his train is being delayed by reason of hot boxes or other causes, and the leaving time of said flagman's train from said station or from said point of stop - ping between stations, and that said following section shall proceed under full control, expecting to find the preceding section at any point where the track has not been cleared by the "Manual Block."

Browne, Secretary (SEAL) In the Matter of Investigation of the Bertrand Railroad Wreck Which Occurred on the C. B. &amp; Q. Between Smithfield and Bertrand on the Morning of October 15, 1916. FINAL ORDER On the date set in the supplemental order in this case it was satis - factorily shown to the Commission by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company that certain portions of the tentative original order en - tered by the Commission had been acted upon favorably by the railroad company of its own motion. Those paragraphs which had been adjusted in general form, as recommended by the Commission in its findings and order in this case are as follows, to-wit: (a) "To show you (the Commission) what is being done to eliminate headlight failures, we are removing the arc light and plac - ing an incandescent light in our headlight of 313 candle power. This change was made after very careful test made in our shops </seg>
            <seg id="p358">360 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT at Aurora, (Illinois). Of the 238 engines on the Nebraska District 166 have been equipped with the incandescent bulb, or seventy per cent of the engines. The work of equipping same has been held up somewhat owing to cur inability to secure the focusing apparatus which is necessary in the change. We hope with.n a very short time to have all engines changed, which will practically eliminate failures. During the month of June, 1916, we had six headlight failures, same month this year three (Nebraska district)." (b) "The question of furnishing drovers' car, or coach for caretakers, is being handled strictly in accordance with the statutes and you (the Commission) can be assured that the law will be lived up to." (c) "In case a headlight on a road engine becomes inoperative between terminals, the train crew notifies the dispatcher from the first station; the dispatcher gives this information to other trains on the road and the train moving with the defective headlight is given the preference." As to the change in the flagging rules, the Commission is of the opinion that the showing made by the company was sufficient to justify it in not ordering at this time the flagging rule as provided in the original order in this case. In view of the showing made by the company as to the change in the equipment of the headlight, thereby making it very much less liable to become inoperative, the strict compliance with the law in regard to furnishing of caretakers' coaches, and in providing a rule whereby en - gines with deficient headlight apparatus will not be allowed to run in road service until trains on the same train district have notice that the train has a defective headlight, it is the opinion of the Commission, and it so finds, that this case may properly be dismissed as satisfied. Tha Commission will provide that the Burlington Railroad company shall monthly report to the Commission the number of engines that have been equipped with the incandescent bulb in lieu of electric arc light. These reports should be continued by the company until all of the engines operating in the state of Nebraska have been converted into incandescent bulb headlights. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Con. mission that these proceedings be and the same are hereby dismissed as satisfied. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company shall on the first day of October, 1917, and on the last day of each month thereafter, report to the Commission the number of road locomotives operating in the state of Nebraska that have been equipped with incandescent bulb headlights during the current month, and the number of engines operating in road service in the state of Ne - braska that are equipped with electric arc light headlights, and the num - ber of road locomotives that are equipped with lights other than electric. </seg>

Attest: T. A. Browne, Secretary. (SEAL) In the Matter of Investigation of the Cause* for and Circumstances Surrounding the Wreck on the Union Pacific Railroad' at Bushnell, Nebraska, on the 23d day of Oc - tober, 1916. REPORT AND FINDING Commissioner Hall held a hearing in the superintendent's office of the. Union Pacific Railroad company at Cheyenne, Wyoming, on Octo - ber 27, 1916. The Commission's official stenographer reported the testimony. Com - missioner Hall was assisted by Rate Expert Powell. A brief summary of how the wreck occurred might be stated, as follows: Westbound freight train, running as the sixth section of No. 255, headed in at Bushnell to clear the time of westbound passenger train No. 7 about 10:32 p. m. of October 23d. The engineer of said sixth No. 255, without the knowledge and consent of his conductor, cut off his engine from the train and passed from the passing track onto the east bound running track for the purpose of taking water on the eastbound track at Bushnell in order, as stated by said engineer, to save time. After water had been taken and before the engine on sixth No. 255 had cleared the east bound passing track, it was run into by eastbound freight train running as first section of No. 254. The train last stated was being pulled by two engines coupled together. The collision hap - pened about twenty feet from the point of the switch on the passing track at 10:42 p. m. Both engines of the eastbound freight train first No. 254 and about eighteen cars spread out on both tracks, viz., east and west running tracks. Within one or two minutes after the collision just mentioned occurred westbound passenger train No. 7 ran into the wreckage of the eastbound freight train. The engine and five of the seven cars in train No. 7 left the track. The casualties resulting from the two wrecks were: Fireman John Crawford, of train No. 7; Head Brakeman W. B. Moore, of eastbound freight train. The injured were: Passenger Engineer Ulrich and Freight Fireman Nielsen. No serious accident occurred to the passengers on train No. 7, although three of the five cars derailed were passenger carrying cars. All of the pas - senger train cars derailed were of steel construction, which is the reason why loss of life did not occur among the passengers in train No. 7. </seg>
            <seg id="p360">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 362 Causes of the Wreck It appears from the record that the engineer on westbound freight train sixth No. 255 understood there was no water at Pine Bluff, a sta - tion eleven miles west of Bushneil; that in order to be sure of being able to take his train to the next water station beyond Pine Bluff he decided, after stopping his train on the passing track at Bushnell, to take water at that station and for this purpose directed the head brake - man to let him out on the main line on the eastbound running track so that he could take water and get back onto his train before westbound passenger train No. 7 passed Bushnell. He did not take water on the westbound track for the reason that train No. 7 was almost due and he would not have time to take water on that track. The flagman was sent west from Bushnell to flag trains on the eastbound track. It might oe proper to mention at this point that the rules of the company provide that where for any reason engines or cars must make use of an oppos - ing main line, protection must be had in both directions. The engineer on sixth No. 255 admits having disregarded this rule. After taking water on the eastbound track, which was approximately 1,000 feet east of the passing track switch where said engine went on the eastbound running track, the engine went west so as to back in on the passim track, and before the engine cleared the main line and before the switch couM be thrown, eastbound freight train first No. 254 struck the engine of sixth No. 255. The weather at the time of the accident was partly cloudy with signals plainly visible at normal distances. First No. 254 left Cheyenne with two engines coupled together. At Archer, a station twelve or fourteen miles east of Cheyenne, the engineers on this train changed engines because the engineer that was on the first engine leaving Cheyenne was making his first trip over the fourth district, which con - sists of the track from Cheyenne to Sidney. Engineer Chas P. Richard - son, who took the place of Engineer Ross as head engineer of train first No. 254, disregarded the distance signal, which was set at red about 4.200 feet west of the point of the accident, disregarded the stop s'gnal given him by the flagman of sixth No. 255. and paid no attention to the home signal, which was set at red some three or four hundred feet west of the point of the accident. Under the rules of the company, Engineer Richardson was responsible for the speed and operation of train first No. 254 by reason of his being the engineer on the first engine. The rec - ord clearly shows that the air brakes and retarding apparatus on train first 254 had been working satisfactorily between Cheyenne and the point of the collision. Engineer Richardson' gave as a partial reason why he failed to stop his train as directed by the signals so to do, the glare of a headlight which he took to be the headlight of passenger train No. 7, but which probably actually was the headlight of the engine of sixth No. 255, which was occupying the eastbound running track at Bushnell. There is a slight curvature to the right as you approach the town of Bushnell from the west and from the record it would not appear possible that the glare of the headlight could possibly have interfered with the vision of Engineer Richardson, although it would appear quite </seg>
            <seg id="p361">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 363 probable that the headlight of the engine on sixth No. 255 was being mistaken for the engine on No. 7. The record shows that train first No. 254 was running about thirty miles an hour when the head engine passed the flagman of sixth No. 255, which was approximately twelve or fourteen hundred feet from the point of the collision of the two freight trains. The wreck of passenger train No. 7 was caused exclusively from running into the wreckage of the two freight trains which was spread out on the westbound track, and the time between when the collision happened and No. 7, which was running at a high rate of speed, entered the yard limits of Bushnell, did not leave it possible lor any signals to be given train No. 7 in order that the wreck to this train might be averted. CONCLUSION. The Commission makes investigation oi wrecks occurring within the state of Nebraska for the purpose of being able to place the blame on the proper persons at taut and to carefully scrutinize the rules of the carrier so as to be able to determine whether or not the conditions under which the trains are operated might be improved by the Commission entering an order providing for specific rules as to train operation, in the instant case it appears that the company's signalling apparatus and train equipment, together with the rules for the operation of trains, are not in the slightest degree responsible for the wrecks herein cons d r i. There does appear to be a slackness on the part of iha train and engine men in the interpretation of the company's rules of operation. Mr. Moyer, head brakeman on sixth No. 255, testified (R. page 42) as fol - lows, when questioned as to the requirements of an engineer as to the protection of the movement on the eastbound track for the purpose of getting water: Q. The engineer didn't say anything to you about going out ana protecting his movement? A. No, he didn't whistle out any flag. Q. And he didn't say anything to you about flagging before he went out on the main line? A. No, sir. Q. You could have got out and flagged this train and the fire - man could have let him out on the main line as well as to let him in on the siding, couldn't he? A. Sure. Q. What is the practice as to the trains in this district as to that kind of movements? Do you govern that by the distance you can see or is it quite a common thing for you to immediately cut off the engine and let them on to and flag? the opposite main line and then go A. Yes, sir. Q. That is the usual way this district, is it? of your operation of trains here on A. Yes, sir. Q. Didn't you know then the duty of the fireman to open as well as you do now that it was the switch? A. Yes, sir. </seg>
            <seg id="p362">364 TENTH ANNUAL, REPORT Q. And you undertook to assume the responsibility of two men, that is, of opening the switch and after you opened the switch to let the engine out, go back and flag? A. It looks as though I took the responsibility on myself. I always have done it In view of the fact that the rules of the company were violated by the engineer of sixth No. 255 occupying the eastbound running track without properly protecting his train, and for the further reason that we are informed that Engineer Richardson, head engineer on first No. 254, has been dismissed from the company's service, it appears that there is no necessity for the Commission entering an order in this matter. The record and circumstances surrounding the wreck will be considered by the Commission if at some future time similar accidents should happen. Dated at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 22d day of June, 1917. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, T. L. Hall, Chairman. Attest: T. A. Browne, Secretary. (SEAL) In the Matter of the Valuation of the Ashland Bridge. Lincoln, Nebraska, October 8, 191 Mr. George E. Johnson, Secretary. State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Bridges. Dear Sir: Pursuant to Section 4, Chapter 57, Session Laws of Nebraska, 19io, and your letter of August 3, 1917, the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion submits herein its report and findings as to the value of the steel bridge across the Platte River in the line of the O. L. &amp; D. Highway, known as the "Ashland Bridge." Hearings were held by the Commission, at which testimony was taken as to the value of said bridge, on the 4th and 24th days of September, 1917. Previous to said hearings the engineering department of the Com - mission made an inventory and valuation of the bridge and submitted its report to the Commission, which will be found in the transcript, marked Exhibit No. 4. The bridge company also submitted an engineer - ing valuation as to the value of the bridge, which will be found in the transcript, marked Exhibit No. 8. The bridge under consideration was constructed in 1911 by the Omaha Structural Steel Works for the Ash - land-Platte River Bridge company, the owner of the bridge. The bridge was put into operation in January, 1912. The unit costs used by the engineers for the bridge company wer« costs based upon present war prices, as near as could be ascertained by those engineers. They find the reproduction value new to be $56,369.35, and a statement will be found on page 16 of the transcript that the present or depreciated value is $47,913.95. The Commission, in valuing </seg>
            <seg id="p363">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 365 other public utilities for capitalization and rate-making purposes is not undertaking to find the reproduction new less depreciation value based on the present extremely high and fluctuating prices, but is attempting to ascertain the normal unit costs which would represent the average for a term of years. The engineering department of the Commission has made its valuation in accordance with such instructions. Mr. Forbes, the chief engineer (or the Commission, stated that the unit costs for material and labor used by the engineering department were based on normal conditions on or about the time the bridge was built, and that the quantities of material were furnished the Commission by Mi. George E. Johnson, secretary of your honorable board. The physical condition was determined by actual inspection of the bridge by the de - partment. The reproduction new value shown by the engineering de - partment of the Commission^ based on such unit cost, is $22,573.94 and the present or depreciated value is $19,481.30, or 86.3% condition. The value as found by the engineering department of the Commission is upon the bridge proper, including the piling and wooden approaches to the steel structure, but does not include the dirt approaches to the bridge. As you perhaps know, it is hard to determine just what duty devolves upon the Commission, in accordance with the statute referred to, when considering the value of the bridge for sale purposes. There are many elements that enter into the proposition which do not seem to be contem - plated in the least by the statute. The Ashland-Platte River Bridge com - pany sold stock to its members in the amount of $20,000, for which money was paid in full into the treasury of the company. It entered into a contract with the Omaha Structural Steel Works for the construc - tion of a bridge and wooden approaches thereto for $18,200. They then paid Sarpy county for right-of-way and grading $750. The company paid for festoon work, or riprapping on the west bank of the river, $500. It paid Mr. Adna Dobson, superintending engineer, $250. It built a toll house at the west end of the bridge, which cost, according to the testi - mony, between $1,200 and $1,500. The company then acquired certain right-of-way leading from the west end of the bridge in a southwesterly direction to the public highway, and assisted in grading the same up to its present condition, all of which expenditures amounted to, according to the testimony, something over $22,000. The bridge went into use, as stated above, in January, 1912, and has had a very prosperous business since that lime. The operating revenues of the bridge from January 1. 1912, to September 1, 1917, have been sufficient to amply maintain the bridge and all bridge facilities, to keep the roadways and approaches well graded, and to pay off all outstanding current indebtedness above the $20,000 of stock outstanding and at the same time create a net surplus of over $23,000, or dividends at a rate of approximately 20% per annum on the outstanding capitalization for a period of five years and a half. The operating revenues and the disbursements of the same were shown by the company for the purpose of enabling the Commission to deter - mine the value of the bridge as a going proposition. This the Commis - sion does not accept for that purpose, because if the operating revenue! </seg>
            <seg id="p364">366 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT and the disbursements of the same were accepted in order to determine the going value of the bridge all other surrounding contingencies would also have to be considered. For instance, if a free bridge were con - structed and put into operation at Ashland, or any other near-by point on the river between Lincoln and Omaha, the going va'ue of the present bridge would certainly be greatly depreciated. The Commission is of the opinion that your honorable body will readily see that the question 01 going value could hardly be considered by the Commission. If tne bridge company were at the present time out of pocket any money for right-of-way and grading the public road leading to the bridge and for the grounds at the west end of the bridge, and the toll house located thereon, it would be a matter to be considered by the counties of Saun - ders and Sarpy, in which the state under the statute would probably not be interested, but as the company has been reimbursed from the opera - ting revenues for all moneys spent for these purposes it would hardly seem fair to the public to pay for these items again, especially in view of the fact that the company has made a net return of approximately 20% per annum. The Commission is therefore of the opinion, and so finds, that, in justice to the public on the one hand and to the owners of the bridge on the other, $20,000 is a reasonable present value of the bridge, approaches, grounds and toll house, and is of the opinion that the great amount of traffic passing over that highway amply warrants the purchase of the bridge, especially in view of the fact that the government, as shown by the record, will not give government aid in the developing of highways in the line of which there is a toll bridge. It will be noted that the figure of $19,481.30, which represents the present value of the bridge, does not include any grading up to the ends of the bridge, which should properly be taken into consideration. Tills grading was done In conjunction with the grading across the bottoms on both sides of the river, the cost of which could only be estimated. This value does not include the grounds at the west end of the bridge up - on which the toll house is located, nor does it include the toll house it - self. In arriving at the $20,000 the Commission has simply placed a value of $518.70 on the toll house, the grounds and the grades at the end of the bridge, and added it to the $19,481.30. This does not represent the cost of those items, but the Commission has taken the item of $20,000 as the fair purchase price, because all of the money above the $20,000 expended on the properties came from the operating revenues. In other words, if the bridge company is reimbursed for the amount of money it is actually out of pocket, which is the $20,000 represented by the outstand.ng stock, it has received back its original investment, upon which it has earned an annual profit of about 20 per cent. Most respectfully submitted, NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, T. L. Hall, Chairman. Attest: T. A. Browne, Secretary, (SEAL) </seg>
            <seg id="p365">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 367 Circular No. 44 Lincoln, Nebraska, Sept. 6, 1917 To the Shipper* and Railroad* of Nebraska: This circular is issued to call attention to the great need for intelli - gent co-operation between shippers and railroads in the handling of the country's freight this fall and winter. Unless this is done serious incon - venience and much loss will result to producer, consumer, carrier and middleman. The nation is right now laboring with the car shortage problem. That shortage would now be as severe in Nebraska as last year had the wheat crop been normal. War needs must be met first. Railroad equipment must be used intelligently to offset this unusual demand and to continue to care for the demands of commerce. The Commission presents most seriously to the attention of all the gravity of this growing stringency, which can only be averted by much conscious effort— by shipper and by carrier. TO SHIPPERS: Load the raw product to permissible capacity; as a war measure, disregard established minimums and load to capacity where commercial conditions will warrant such loading; combine ship - ments when possible; load and unload quickly, without regard to free time; order only cars that can be used at once; do your bit to keep cars moving. TO CARRIERS: Move cars promptly after billing is received; set cars for unloading promptly; do not hold train for train tonnage; move local freights so as not to delay loads on industry tracks and empties in terminals; repair foreign bad-order cars from your materials on hand whenever possible; do your bit to keep cars moving. The carriers are requested to post this notice in a conspicuous p!ace in depots and instruct agents to call shippers' attention to it. Co-operation is the watchword and if it is secured voluntarily no com - pulsory changes in tariffs should be necessary. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION. T. L. Hall, Chairman. Attest: T. A.

            <seg id="p366">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 368 PART IV Court Decisions, Attorney General's Opinions, and Opinions of Commission's Legal Department. COURT DECISIONS State of Nebraska ex re I Nebraska State Rail - way Commission, Appellee, vs. Missouri Pacific Railway Company, Appellant HISTORY This case was filed by citizens of Panama October 18, 1909. Hearing was had and order was issued January 25, 1910, under the provisions of Senate File No. 143, approved April 2, 1909, requiring said company to install telephone in the depot at Panama. Appeal was taken to the district court of Lancaster county on July 13, 1914. A peremptory writ of mandamus was issued against the respondent, commanding it to forth - with furnish telephone connection between the depot and the public tele - phone exchange operated in that town. The case was carried to the su - preme court of the state of Nebraska. A decision was rendered, ui. holding the order of the Commission, December 29, 1916. SYLLABUS 1. A statute susceptible of a reasonable construction avoiding a con - flict with the constitution should be so construed. 2. The statute requiring common carriers to furnish adequate tele - phone connections between their offices, buildings and grounds and the local telephone exchange, provides for a notice and a hearing before the State Railway Commission as to the reasonableness of such requirement and Is not unconstitutional as depriving the carrier of its property without due process of law or as denying it the equal protection of the laws. Rev. St. 1913, sees. 5988-5990; Laws 1909, Ch. 106, sees. 1-3. 3. On application for mandamus to enforce an order of the State Railway Commission, jurisdiction having been acquired and no appeal having been taken, it will be presumed that the findings of the com - mission were sustained by the evidence. 4. "The failure of the presiding officer of the senate to sign a bill, which was afterwards approved by the governor, and which the journal of the senate shows passed the senate by the constitutional majority, does not affect the validity of the act." Taylor v. Wilson, 17 Neb. 88. Rose, J. The Nebraska State Railway Commission, relator, applied to the district court for a peremptory writ of mandamus requiring the Missouri </seg>
            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 369 Pacific Railway Company, respondent, to provide telephone service In the station at Panama in compliance with an order made by relator under a statute providing: "Every railway company, express company or telegraph company doing business in this state shall furnish reasonably adequate telephone connections between its offices, buildings and grounds, and the public telephone exchanges operated in the towns where the same are located. "The State Railway Commission is hereby authorized and empowered to require and compel the furnishing of such service. Upon complaint to the Railway Commission of Nebraska that any telephonic service with any railroad, telegraph or express company's buildings, offices or ground* is inadequate or in any respect unreasonably or unjustly discriminatory or that such service cannot be had, it shall be the duty of the Commis - sion to investigate the same, and if upon investigation the Commission shall find that any telephonic service is inadequate or unreasonably or un - justly discriminatory or that such service cannot be had, it shall de - termine and by order fix a reasonable regulation, practice or service to be installed, imposed, observed and operated in the future." Rev. St. 1913, 5988, 5989; Laws 1909, Ch. 106, Sees. 1, 2. Respondent resisted the application for the writ on the ground that the act is unconstitutional as denying respondent the equal protection of the laws and as depriving it of property without due process of law. The trial court upheld the act and allowed the writ. Respondent has appealed. It is argued that respondent is required by the act to furnish tele - phone connections between its offices, buildings and grounds and the local telephone exchange without regard to necessity or expense, and Missouri P. R. Co. v. State of Nebraska, 217 IT. S. 196, is cited to sustain the position thus taken. The reasons for condemning the act assailed in that case are not applicable to the legislation now under consideration. Respondent's construction of the enactment relating to telephones is not the only one of which the act is susceptible. There is a reasonable in - terpretation which will avoid a conflict with the constitution and it should be adopted. State v. Howard, 96 Neb. 278, 291; Gaiter v. Gaiter. 92 Neb. 6, 10; State v. Smith, 35 Neb. 13, 24. The legislation authorizes the State Railway Commission to exact the service described in the act. There is no penalty prescribed except for failure to perform a service ordered by the State Railway Commission. The act seems to contem - plate the right to be heard before that body and the determination by it of the reasonableness of the service. This interpretation is a reasonable one and avoids a conflict with the constitution. Under the act thus con - strued respondent had a hearing before the State Railway Commission and was ordered to install a telephone at Panama. Does the order deprive respondent of its property without due pro - cess of law or deny it the equal protection of the laws? Respondent contends that the service required is not essential to the proper opera - tion of the railroad as a common carrier of persons and property and that </seg>
            <seg id="p368">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 370 the use of a telephone would be a mere accommodation to the Inhabi - tants of the village at the expense of respondent without benefit to It. The duties of a common carrier are not limited to the actual transporta - tion of persons and property. There are other obligations incidental to the principal duties. The furnishing of adequate facilities for the trans - action of public business is a function of a common carrier. It may be required to establish stations at proper places. Minneapolis 4. St. L. R. Co. v. State of Minnesota, 193 U. S. 53. The duty to provide adequate facilities is not performed by supplying a minimum of service. The state may, within proper limits, require a carrier to furnish facilities for the convenience and comfort of the traveling public. Missouri P. R. w v. State of Kansas, 216 IT. S. 262, 280; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corporation Commission, 206 U. S. 1. The telephone is in gen - eral use as a factor in the transaction of public business and a statute requiring a railroad company to connect a station with a local telephone exchange for the convenience of shippers and passengers does not go beyond the incidental duties of a common carrier. Atchison, T. A S. F. R. Co. v. State, 23 Okla. 210. The evidence in the present case tends to show that the telephone is a necessary facility for the proper per - formance of respondent's duties as a common carrier. While the ele - ment of expense should be considered in determining the reasonable - ness of the requirement, it is not necessarily controlling. Missouri P. R. Co. v. State of Kansas, 216 U. S. 262; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corporation Commission, 206 V. S. 1, 26. In the case last cited it was said: "As the primal duty of a carrier is to furnish adequate facilities to the public, that duty may be compelled, although by doing so as an in - cident some pecuniary loss from rendering such service may result." The statute under which the State Railway Commission acted is not unconstitutional. That body had jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties affected by the order. The statute not only gave respon - dent the right to be heard, but authorized an appeal to the district court. Laws 1907, Ch. 90, sec. 7. The proof does not show that an appeal was taken. Under such circumstances it will be presumed, in an action for mandamus to enforce the order, that the findings of the State Railway Commission were sustained by the evidence. In resisting the applica - tion for the writ respondent has not shown that the requirement was un - reasonable or conflscatory. The conclusion is that the order is not unconstitutional as depriving respondent of its property without due process of law or as denying It the equal protection of the'laws. Missouri P. R. Co. v. State of Nebraska, 217 U. S. 196, relied upon by respondent, is not controlling here. It was there held that an act requiring every railroad company to conscnict switch tracks to elevators adjacent to the right-of-way was unconstitu - tional, because it required the carrier to construct a switch at its own expense, upon demand of an elevator owner, without a preliminary hearing as to reasonableness of necessity, under a severe penalty for non-compli - ance with the demand. Moreover, the supreme court of the United States </seg>
            <seg id="p369">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 371 indicated that the service required by the elevator statute was not inci - dental to the duties of a common carrier, but was a service for the benefit of a private individual or a corporation and not for the general public. Respondent also contends that the act now under consideration is unconstitutional because the enrolled bill was not s gned by the pre - siding officer of the senate. Const., Art. III., Sec. 11. This question is settled adversely to respondent by former decisions. It has been held: "The failure of the presiding officer of the senate to sign a bill, whicn was afterwards approved by the governor, and which the journal of the senate shows passed the senate by the constitutional majority, does not affect the validity of the act." Cottrell v. State, 9 Neb. 125; Taylor v. Wilson, 17 Neb. 88. The judgment is therefore affirmed. MANDATE # IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA Sitting at Lincoln, September Term, 1917.

Lincoln, November 29, 1916. Hon. Willis E. Reed, Attorney General, State of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Under the provisions of House Roll No. 217, an act of the legislature of 1915, copy of which is hereto attached, it is provided that "The Nebraska State Railway Commission shall have general supervision over any and all wires transmitting electric current, or any other wire whatsoever crossing under or over any track of a rail- road in this state at public highway crossings." The Commission would be pleased to secure your interpretation on the expression "public highway crossing." Does that expression include the streets of a village, town or city of Nebraska? As specific instance of the reason the Commission wishes light on this subject, the village of North Bend is building an electric transmis - sion line to supply current to the village of Morse Bluff. This line will cross the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway tracks witlTin the village limits of Morse Bluff. Does House Roll 217, enacted by the legislature of 1915, confer on the Nebraska State Railway Commission the general supervision over the manner in which said electric transmission line shall </seg>
            <seg id="p371">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 373 cross the tracks of said C. &amp; N. W. Railway company within the village limits of Morse Bluff? Yours truly, T. A. BROWNE, Secretary. L. December 1, 1916. Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: In response to your inquiry of the 29th ult., in which you inquire, "Does House Roll 217, enacted by the legislature of 1915, confer on the Nebraska State Railway Commission the general supervision over the manner in which electric transmission lines shall cross tracks of railway companies within cities and villages," and you make special reference to your Morse Bluff situation. Answering, will say the Act referred to, among other things, says: "The Nebraska State Railway Commission shall have general supervision over any and all wires transmitting electric current, or any other wire whatsoever, crossing under or over any track of a railroad in this state at public highway crossings.'' From a careful reading of House Roll No. 217, it is very evident tht_ the legislature intended and thereby did confer upon the Nebraska State Railway Commission, such additional powers, if any, required in addition to the constitution creating your body, as may be necessary for the public welfare and safety of the people; and where any wire trans - mitting electric current or any other wire whatsoever, crossing under or over any track of railroad in this state, at a public highway crossing, it is incumbent upon you to cause the party, company or corporation seek - ing to cross such railroad track, to so place or locate their wires for the best interest of the public, and this is to apply within the cities and vil - lages as well as outside thereof.

            <seg id="p372">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 374 No. 79. Lincoln, March 30, 1917. Hon. Willis E. Reed Attorney General, State of Nebraska Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The new organization of the Missouri Pacific Railway company has been before the Commission in an informal conference for the purpose of ascertaining the necessary steps to be taken before the Nebraska State Railway Commission in order to get the authority of the Commission to issue $383,000,000 in securities, said securities to be issued for the pur - pose of taking up all of the securities of the Iron Mountain and Missouri Pacific railway companies and all of the properties of the companies referred to to be merged into the new organization. The new company is organized under and by virtue of .the laws of the state of Missouri and proposes to domesticate in the state of Nebraska. The Commission is desirous of having your opinion on the following questions : . First: If the reorganization plan is consummated by the corpora - tion which is organized under and by virtue of the laws of Missouri, will the Nebraska Slate Railway Commission have any jurisdiction what - ever over the issuance of securities by that corporation. Allow me to call your attention to the wording of the Stock and Bonds Act of the state of Nebraska: "Sec. 1. A common carrier or public service corporation or - ganized, incorporated or hereafter incorporated under or by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, may issue stocks, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness • • • •; provided and not otherwise, that there shall have been secured from the Nebraska State Railway Commission an order authorizing such issue and the amount there - of, and stating that in the opinion of the Commission the use of the capital to be secured by the issue of such stock, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness is reasonably required for said pur - poses of the corporation. •••••• The new corporation referred to is not organized under and by vir - tue of the laws of Nebraska, and, as you perhaps know, many corpora - tions are now incorporating under the laws of other states and are not coming under the jurisdiction of the Commission for the authority to issue their securities. If the Missouri corporation should consummate its reorganization plan and issue all of the securities necessary to take up the outstanding securities of the old corporation before it drm s c 'o- in the state of Nebraska, would not those securities be legal although the company did not have the authority of the Nebraska State Railway Commission? Then, if the company were to domesticate after they is - sue the securities, would not the whole plan be consummated and the securities issued without authority of the Commission?

            <seg id="p373">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 375 virtue of the laws of another state, although being an interstate carrier and part of its lines or properties extending into the state of Nebraska, to have the authority and approval of the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission to issue its securities? Allow me to refer you to the opinion of the special attorney to the Georgia Railroad Commission in the matter of the jurisdiction of that Com - mission over bonds issued by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad company, found in the Fortieth Annual Report of that Commission, for the year 1912, page 222; also the opinion and finding of the Georgia Railroad Commission in re the same matter, found in Commission Leaflets for January, 1912-1913, Sec. 8, page 87. For your information as to the specific facts and circumstances calling for your opinion in these matters, we submit herewith copy of letter written by Mr. J. A. C. Kennedy, attorney for the Missouri Pacific Railway company, in which he asks the Commission for specific findings as to its jurisdiction over the issuance of the securities referred to. Because of the urgency of the matter, the Commission would like your opinion at your earliest convenience. Very truly yours. T. L. Hall, Chairman. Omaha, Nebr., March 27, 1917. Honorable Thomas L. Hall, Chairman, State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In order to be sure there is no misunderstanding concerning certain phases of the reorganization of the Missouri Pacific Railroad company as same has been presented for your attention, we thought It proper to address this communication to your honorable body. Our idea of the tentative informal consideration of the reorganiza - tion matter in your office on March 15th and 16th was that, before we could present our matter for formal consideration, the Nebraska statutes first required our formal domestication in the state, and, incident to our domestication the payment of a filing fee of some $150,000 would be re - quired according to the construction by the state officials having to do with that particular matter. For these reasons we naturaMy wished a general informal exchange of views to the end that no important steps might be taken without ultimate avail. We furthermore wished a conference with your honorable body so that full co-operation would be had, but in this connection we wish to respectfully call the attention of your honorable body to the question of your jurisdiction over the issuance of stocks and bonds by the new Missouri Pacific Railroad company, which is a corporation organized un- </seg>
            <seg id="p374">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 376 der and pursuant to the laws of Missouri. The only authority dealing with this subject which we have been able to find is an unqualified and exhaustive opinion by the Railway Commission of Georgia to the effect that, under a statute stronger in words in its intendment of jurisdiction in the local Commission, that the Railroad Commission of Georgia did not have jurisdiction over the issuance of stocks and bonds by a for - eign corporation. This opinion was rendered June 4th, 1912, "In re Is - suing of Corporate Mortgage Bonds By the Atlantic Coast Line Railway Company." This opinion may be found in 8th Commission Leaflets, page 87. We do not wish to question the jurisdiction of your honorable body over the the issuance of stocks and bonds by the new Missouri Pacific Railroad company, corporation of Missouri, with any disposition to avoid co-operation and relation with the Nebraska Commission, but as the right to supervise the issuance of stocks and bonds by the Missouri corpora - tion might be claimed by other states also, our position is such that we would like very much to have your views on the jurisdietional question. In. short, we wish the fullest understanding and best possible feeling on both sides in accomplishing the solution of this very important propo - sition. We would greatly appreciate hearing from your honorable body at your earliest convenience, particularly on the question of your juris - diction over the issuance of stocks and bonds by the new company which, as aforestated, has been organized under and pursuant to the laws of the state of Missouri. If perchance you are entertaining the view that you have jurisdic - tion in the premises, we would also respectfully inquire what further showing in the premises is desired, if any. Yours very truly, J. A. C. KENNEDY, General Attorn**. Lincoln, Nebraska, March 31, 1917. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: In your favor of the 30th instant you say "The new organization of the Missouri Pacific Railway company has been before the Commission in an informal conference for the purpose of ascertaining the necessary steps to be taken before the Nebraska State Railway Commission in order to get the authority of the Commission to issue $383,000,000 in securities, said securities to be issued for the purpose of taking up all of the securities of the Iron Mountain and Missouri Pacific Railway companies and all of the properties of the companies referred to to be merged into the new organization.

            <seg id="p375">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 377 "The Commission is desirous of having your opinion on the following questions: "First, it the reorganization plan is consummated by the cor - poration which is organized under and by virtue of the laws 01 Mis - souri, will the Nebraska State Railway Commission have any juris - diction whatever over the issuance of securities by that eorporauou. Allow me to call your attention to the wording of the stock and bonus act of the state of Nebraska: " 'Sec. 1. A common carrier or public service corporation or - ganized, incorporated or hereafter Incorporated under or by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, may issue stocks, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness • * •; provided and not other - wise, that there shall have been secured from the Nebraska State Railway Commission an order authorizing such issue and the amount thereof, and stating that in the opinion of the Commission the use of the capital to be secured by the issue of such stock, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness is reasonably required for said pur - poses of the corporation * * *' "The new corporation referred to is not organized under and by virtue of the laws of Nebraska, and, as you perhaps know, many corporations are now incorporating under the laws of other states and are not coming under the jurisdiction of the Commission for the authorily to issue their securities. If the Missouri corporation should consummate its reorganization plan and issue all of the securities necessary to take up the outstanding securities of the old corpora - tion before it domesticates in the state of Nebraska, would not those securities be legal although the company did not have the authority of the Nebraska State Railway Commission? Then it the company were to domesticate after they issue the securities, would not the whole plan be consummated, and the securities issued without au - thority of the Commission? "Second, under the stock and bonds act of the state of Nebraska, is it necessary for a corporation organized and incorporated under and by virtue of the laws of another state, although being an inter - state carrier and part of its lines or properties extending into the state of Nebraska, to have the authority and approval of tne Ne - braska State Railway Commission to issue its securities?" It being admitted that the Missouri Pacific Railway company is du y and legally incorporated within another state for the specific purpose, among other things, of carrying on an interstate commerce business, it is necessary to determine whether, under the federal constitution, one state is permitted or allowed to exercise other or greater powers than those possessed by each of the other states in the Union, because in ad - dition to the provision of section one of the stock and bonds act of the state of Nebraska, quoted in your communication, section 5, article 11, Constitution of Nebraska, is as follows: "No railroad corporation shall issue any stock or bonds, except for money, labor or property actually received and applied to the purposes for which such corporation was created; and all stock, divi - dends, and other fictitious increase of the capital stock or indebted - ness of any such corporation shall be void. The capital stock of rail - road corporations shall not be increased for any purpose, except After public notice for sixty days, in such manner as may be provided by law." </seg>
            <seg id="p376">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 378 Section 1, Article 11, Constitution of Nebraska, among other things, provides that: "Every railroad corporation organized or doing business in thiB state, under the laws or authority thereof, or of any other state, or of the United States, shall have and maintain a public office or place in this state for the transaction of its business * *." Section 8, article 11, Constitution of Nebraska, provides: "No railroad corporation organized under the laws of any oiher state, or of the United States and doing business in this state shall be entitled to exercise the right of eminent domain or have power to acquire the Fight-of-way, or real estate for depot or other uses, until it shall have become a body corporate pursuant to aud in ac - cordance with the laws of this state." In Southern Railway Co. v. Allison, 190 U. S., 326, 332, it is said: "It early became material to inquire into the nature of the status of corporations with regard to the jurisdiction of the federal courts under the constitution and laws of the United States. A recent state - ment of the law on that subject is contained in the case of St. Louit &lt;&amp;. San Francisco Railway Company v. James, 161 U. S. 545. It was said by Mr. Justice Shiras, in delivering the opinion of the court in that case, that after considerable contention in the courts, it was final'. y determined by this court that the citizenship of a corporation was that of the state originally creating it, and that it was a pre - sumption of law that the members of the corporation were citizens of the same state." The rule above stated has not been modified nor overruled by the court of last resort, and must be regarded now as the settled law of the United States. The facts upon which the decision of the court in case of St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railway Co. v. James, supra, was based, were these: "The St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railway company was a cor poration originally created under the laws of the state of Missoun, and it operated a railroad from Monett in the state of Missouri to the southern border of that state. Subsequently, and under provisions of the laws of Arkansas, it entered that state for the purpose of operating its road therein from the southern boundary of the state of Missouri to Fort Smith in the state of Arkansas ; the portion of the railroad in Arkansas was operated by the leasing of a railroad a'.ready or partly built in that state. The state of Arkansas had pro - vided by its legislation that before any railroad corporation of any other state or territory should be permitted to avail itself of the benefits of the act allowing the purchasing or leasing of any road within that state, the foreign corporation should 'file with the secre - tary of state of this state a certified copy of its articles of incorpora - tion, if incorporated under a general law of such state or territory, or a certified copy of the statute lawg of such state or territory incorporat - ing such company, where the charter of such railroad corporation was granted by special statute of such state; and upon the filing of such articles of incorporation or such charter with a map and profile of the proposed line, and paying the fess prescribed by law for railroad charters, such railroad company shall, to all intents and purposes, become a railroad corporation of this state, subject to all of the laws of the state now in force or hereafter enacted, the same as if for - merly incorporated in this state, anything in its articles of incorpora - tion or charter to the contrary notwithstanding, and such acts on the part of such corporation shall be conclusive evidence of the intent </seg>
            <seg id="p377">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 379 of such corporation to create, and become a domestic corporation; And provided further, that every railroad corporation of any other state, which has heretofore leased or purchased any railroad in this state, shall, within sixty days from the passage of this act, file a duly certified copy of its articles of incorporation or charter with the secretary of state of this state, and shall, thereupon, become a corporation of this state, anything in its articles of incorporation or charter to the contrary notwithstanding, and in all suits or proceed - ings instituted against any such corporation process may be served upon tha agent or agents of such corporation or corporations in this state, in the same manner that process is authorized by law to be served upon the agents of railroad corporations in this state or - ganized and existing under the laws of this state'." (Southern Rail - way Co. v. James, 190 U. S. 333.) In Crutcher V. Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47, the court said: "The act of the legislature of Kentucky of March 2, 1860, 'to regulate agencies of foreign express companies,' which provides that the agent of an express company not incorporated by the laws of that state shall not carry on business there without first obtain - ing a license from the state, and that, preliminary thereto, he shall satisfy the auditor of the state that the company he represents is pos - sessed of an actual capital of at least $150,000, and that if he engages in such business without license he shall be subject to fine, is a regulation of interstate commerce so far as applied to a corporation of another state engaged in that business, and is, to that extent, repugnant to the Constitution of the United States." In the body of the opinion in Crutcher v. Kentucky, supra, the court said: "The court seems now, however, to have settled that Congress alone has the power to 'regulate commerce' in matters susceptible of general and uniform regulation; but that in matters which are affected by local considerations the power to 'regulate commerce' is possessed by both the federal and state legislatures, subject, how - ever, to the modification that whenever Congress speaks on the sub - ject that is the supreme law. Philadelphia Steamship Co. v. Penn - sylvania, 122 TT. S. 326; Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District. 120 V. S. 489, 492, 493. In other words, in matters best susceptible of local regu - lation the states have concurrent power with Congress to pass laws that are directly and unquestionably regulations of interstate com - merce, and are intended as such; but. as to matters susceptible of uniform regulation, the power to pass laws, the object of which is to regulate interstate commerce, Is in Congress alone." The authorities cited in the opinion of the Railroad Commission of Georgia, In re Issue of Corporation Mortgage Bonds by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, to which you refer, found in Commission Leaflets for January 1912-1913, sec. 8, page 87, seem to sustain the opinion of that Commission and is expressive of the fundamental princi - ples upon which all state government must necessarily rest. No state should have any greater power than that of her sister state, and when - ever any law is passed which places an undue burden upon interstate commerce it is always stricken down by the federal or supreme court of the United States when It finally reaches such courts for determination. The act of the Georgia code which was under consideration by the </seg>
            <seg id="p378">TENTH ANNUAL REPORT 380 Railroad Commission of that state, and found in their code 1910, section 2204, is as follows: "No foreign corporation shall exercise within this state any cor - porate powers or privileges which, by the constitution or laws of Georgia, are denied or prohibited to corporations created by this state, or the exercise of which is contrary to the public policy of this state, anything in the charter or corporate powers of the foreign corpora - tions to the contrary notwithstanding." Our statute is no broader, and I can do no better than to quote from the opinion of the Georgia Railroad Commission, found in Commission Leaflets for January 1912-1913, sec. 8, page 96: "This Commission cannot escape from the conviction that its jurisdiction, as also the visitorial power 6T this state over foreign cor - porations, ends with the conduct of their general business and the ex - ercise of the corporate powers within this state, and that it does not nor can it extend over their internal affairs, or over the exercise of corporate powers or the conduct of any business beyond our terri - torial limits. This is in accordance with the unvarying line of de - cisions of the courts that, 'it is considered best that such matters should fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of that state under thtj laws of which such foreign corporations were organized and where they are resident'." Prom the foregoing It Is quite evident that: 1. The Nebraska State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction or authority over the issuance of securities by the Missouri Pacific Rail - way company. 2. That such securities, if in conformity to the law of the state of Missouri, would be valid without any approval whatever, from the Ne - braska State Railway Commission, and the fact that the Missouri Pacific Railway company should in the future become domesticated the validity of the bonds issued by such corporation would not be, in any manner, affected by the omission, failure, or refusal of your Commission to ap - prove the same, it being beyond the power and authority of your Com - mission to act, and likewise of the legislature to authorize you so to do. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General No. 80 Lincoln, Nebraska, October 4, 1917. Hon. Willis E. Reed, Attorney General, State of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I am directed by the Nebraska State Railway Commission to call your attention to the fact that the Union Stock Yards company of South Omaha has recently increased the charges for hay sold at those yards in South Omaha from $20.00 per ton to $30.00 per ton without first har- </seg>
            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 381 ing secured the authority of the Nebraska State Railway . Commission therefor. The Commission respectfully asks that you take such steps as the law provides in matters of this kind to uphold the provisions of the Ne - braska statute, which provides that charges for feed, etc., at certain stock yards in the state shall be regulated by the Nebraska State Railway Commission. I am directed also to say that all assistance possible will be rendered you by all departments of this Commission in whatever way may seem advisable to you. Permit me to call your attention briefly to the history of this mat - ter. On April 16th the Union Stock Yards company made application to the Commission for authority to increase the price of corn at its yards, and on April 19th an order was entered granting an increase under cer - tain conditions, and on July 6th a supplemental order was issued. On July 9th notice of appeal was filed from the order of the Commission and a supersedeas bond of $30,000 was put up. The price of hay was not involved in this order nor in the application. Subsequently Louis B. Clark, a stockholder of the Union Stock Yards company, residing in Chicago, brought suit in the United States District Court at Omaha against the Union Stock Yards company and the Ne - braska State Railway Commission, asking injunction against the com - pany to restrain* it from further obeying the order of the Nebraska Com - mission and the provisions of the law, setting forth that the Commission had fixed the price of hay at $20.00, which price was non-compensatory. On September 10, 1917, notice of application for temporary injunc - tion was served on the Commission and on your office, this application to be argued on September 15th. The matter came on for hearing before the circuit judge and two district judges of the federal court. The Com - mission filed affidavits to the effect that it never had issued an order fixing the price of hay, but that the price then being charged was the price in effect at the time the law became operative. The court denied the temporary injunction, ruling, at least temporari - ly, against applicants on each point. The main petition of Louis B. Clark has not yet been set down for hearing in the court. These matters are respectfully submitted to you in connection with the request set out above. Yours very truly, T. A. BROWNE, Secretary. r Lincoln, Nebraska, October 6, 1917. Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen : In yours of the 4th instant you say "The Union Stock Yards company, of South Omaha, has recently </seg>
            <seg id="p380">382 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT increased the charges for hay sold at those yards in South Omaha from $20 per ton to $30 per ton without first having secured the authority of the Nebraska Commission therefor. The Commission respectfully asks that you take such steps as the law provides in matters of this kind to uphold the provisions of the Nebraska statute, which provides that charges for feed, etc., at cer - tain stock yards in the state shall be regulated by the Nebraska State Railway Commission." You call my attention to the case recently before the United States District Court, for the district of Omaha, in which Louis B. Clark was plaintiff and your Commission was defendant. Being familiar with that case, with the issues involved, and with the affidavits by you filed, it is conclusive that up to the present time the Nebraska State Railway Commission has not made any order fixing the price of hay which the Union Stock Yards company is permitted to charge. The law defining stock yards and placing the same under con - trol of the State Railway Commission was enacted by our legislature in 1911, was introduced by Mr. Ollis, and that part of the law which gives you power to regulate charges of all kinds at stock yards is section 2, be - ing section 135 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, and is as follows: "The State Railway Commission shall have power to issue or - ders regulating service and charges of all kinds at all stock yards, and the same shall be enforced in the same manner and under the same penalties as orders regulating common carriers; Provided, where no other penalty is provided by law for a violation of any such order, it shall be punishable by a penalty of not less than one hundred dollars, nor more than five hundred dollars, and where the violation is a continuing one, each day thereof shall constitute a separate offense." This law became effective in July, 1911. Since no order has been made by your body "regulating service and charges of aH kinds at all stock yards" in the state of Nebraska, the suit must necessarily fall. You should immediately give due and reasonable notice to the Union Stock Yards company that upon a day certain you will make such an order, that it may appear before your body and make a showing, if it desires to do so, respecting the reasonableness of the charges which the company desires to make. Then, upon the hearing and after you have made your order, if any violation shall occur I shall be pleased to prosecute, but upon the facts by you stated, and which appear of public record, a prosecution at this time must necessarily fail, for the reason that as yet you have made no order as required by law. Very respectfully. WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p381">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 383 OPINIONS OF COMMISSION'S LEGAL DEPARTMENT Lincoln, July 14, 1917 Honorable T. L. Hall Chairman, State Railway Commission. Dear Sir: I have examined the record in the matter of the application of the C. St P. M. &amp; O. Railway company for authority to guarantee certain bonds of the St. Paul Union Depot company. In answer to your question as to the power of the State Railway Commission to grant the prayer of the applicant, I have to say: There is a defect of parts; before granting an order authorizing tno guaranty of the bonds the other, railway companies interested should appear. The application is lacking in several particulars; among these are: The articles of incorporation of the depot company; a statement of va'ue of the present depot; a showing as to the depot facilities required at St. Paul; a showing that the proposed depot is reasonably necessary; its plans, specifications and estimates of cost (certain plans and diagrams are referred to in the application, but they are not attached); a deninite statement as to the amount to be borrowed in excess of the sum to be .guaranteed by the railroad companies. The foregoing are all matters which could doubtless be supplied. There are, however, obstacles to granting the permission requested, which seem to be insuperable. These are: First, The proposed obliga - tion of the corporation is called a guaranty, but it is, in fact, an original obligation and is properly so considered by the legal department of the applicant. Regarded as a guaranty, it cannot be authorized, for unless a corporation's charter, either by its express terms or by necessary im - plication, permit it to become a guarantor, it has no such power. The conditions in the present application do not bring it within the pro - visions of Sec. 40, Chap. 67, Statutes of 1913 (Gen. Sec. No. 5966). Second, — considered as an original obligation, the contract is governed by Sec. 210, Chap. 14, Art. 18, Statutes of 1913 (Gen. Sec. No. 758), Stock and Bonds Act, and by the Constitution, Art. 11, Sec. 5. The evident intention of the Stock and Bonds Act is that a Nebraska public service corporation may issue obligations for the acquisition of property, etc., when necessary for the promotion of its own objects or the refunding of its outstanding obligations, when the Commission deems such issue re - quired for the purposes of the corporation. The words "other evidences of indebtedness" do not mean that evidences of indebtedness may issue for or on behalf of other corporations. The constitutional provision above referred to sweepingly prohibits all issues of stock or bonds except for money, labor or property actually received and applied to the purposes for which such issuing corporation was created. The proposed guaranty by the applicant cannot be allowed either under the statute or under the constitutional provision. There is neither constitutional nor statutory power vested in the Commission to control the building of a railway station by a foreign </seg>
            <seg id="p382">384 TENTH ANNUAL REPORT corporation in another state. If the Commission have the power to ap - prove the proposed bond issue, it must also have the correlative powei to control the money derived from such bond issue, at least to the extent of requiring it to be applied to the construction of the proposed facility. It is apparent that the exercise of such a power would involve enormous expense and difficulty and perhaps the carrying on of expensive litiga - tion in a distant state. The Commission has no such extra-territorial power. I think the application should be denied. Very truly yours, HUGH LAMASTER, Attorney. Lincoln, July 23, 1917. Mr. Hugh La master, Counsel, State Railway Commission. Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I am directed by the Commission to submit to you a communication from the Glenwood Telephone company, a copy of which is herewith enclosed, and ask for your opinion on the points raised therein, with particular reference to the question as to whether or not the company can, under its articles of incorporation and by-laws, as at present con - stituted, declare dividends in accordance with the various suggestions of the Commission. And further, as to whether or not it would be proper legally for the company in each district to refund to the stockholders at some stated period the difference between the rate charged to renters and the assessments levied upon the stockholders for service. Yours truly, D. M. TAYLOR, Assistant Secretary. Lincoln, July 25, 1917. Miss D. M. Taylor, Assistant Secretary, State Railway Commission Dear Miss: I am in receipt of yours of the 23d, written at the direction of the Commission, enclosing a letter from the Glenwood Telephone compan&gt; and submitting the following questions: 1. Can the company, under its articles of incorporation and by-laws as at present constituted, lawfully declare dividends in accord - ance with the previous suggestions of the Commission, that Is, declare dividends by districts? 2. Would it be proper for the company, in each district, to refund to its stockholders, at stated periods, the difference between the rate charged to renters and the assessments levied upon stock - holders for service? 3. Can the by-laws be amended by a vote of 60% of the stock - holders and thereby authorize the declaration of dividends by districts? </seg>
            <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 385 Answering these questions in their order, I have to say: 1. The company cannot, under its present articles of incorporation and by-laws, lawfully declare dividends by districts, as the stock issued and now outstanding is not dependent upon districts, but covers the whole property. 2. It would not be proper for the company to make the refund sug - gested. Such a course would be an evasion of the Commission's order requiring uniform rates, and would cause unjust discrimination. 3. The stock issued and now outstanding covers the property of all the various districts; the right to participate in dividends of the whole company is vested in the holders of stock. It is a property right that cannot be taken from them by a change in the by-laws. Yours very truly, HUGH LAMASTER, Counsel. Lincoln, September 1, 1917. Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission. Dear Sir: I have taken up with the Commission the questions presented by Honorable L. D. Steiner, of Hastings. Nebraska, to- wit: Is a corporation organized to hold the property of a purely fraternal society, not in any way making a profit, required to comply with the Blue Sky law? Such a society is deemed by the Commission not within the pur - view of the law and no permit will be required. Kindly advise Mr. Steiner accordingly. Yours truly. HUGH LAMASTER, Counsel.

            <seg id="p385">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 387 PART V Blue Sky Department TO THE COMMISSION: At the close of 1916 and the beginning of 1917, there was quite a widespread doubt concerning the Blue Sky laws of the several states, for the federal courts had held as unconstitutional such laws passed by South Dakota, Michigan and Ohio, and the attorney general of this state had expressed doubt of the constitutionality of the Nebraska iaw. Under the circumstances about all the Nebraska State Railway Commission could do was to work along quietly, heading off such fraudulent sales of stock as it could, but not forcing the issue or going into the court*. However, late in January, 1917, the Supreme Court of the United States, speaking through Justice McKenna, handed down opinions in the cases of Hall v. Geiger-Jones Company, Merrick v. Halsey and Caltfwell v. Sioux Falls Stock Yards Company, whereby the constitutionality of the Blue Sky laws of Ohio, Michigan and South Dakota were upheld in a sweeping and far-reaching manner. The laws of these states are not identical with our own, but they contain many of the same provisions appearing in the Nebraska statute, so the decisions named leave little question that the Nebraska law in the main would be upheld in federal courts, even should some parts of it be held unconstitutional. With the filing of the opinions mentioned, there appeared an im - mediate interest in the terms of the Nebraska law on the part of or - ganizations selling stock in the state, and the number of applications for permits to sell stock immediately increased, and it soon became evident that there was going to be such an increase in the work of the depart - ment as to take too much of the time of Mr. B. E. Forbes, chief engineer of the Commission, who had been directing the Blue Sky work. So on the first day of June, 1917, the writer was appointed examiner of securities by the Commission and the work of the department has continued to grow until the department has had to increase its working force, and now finds itself considerably behind in its work. Some five salesmen have been arrested for selling stock without a permit, and have been fined $100.00 and costs each. One case is now pending in the District Court of Lancaster county, and one is on its way to the Supreme Court of the state, where it is hoped rulings will be had upon certain features of the law. In the case of State v. DeBow, brought by the county attorney of Douglas county, the law has been tested by proceedings in habeas corpus, and on demurrer, and found con - stitutional as a whole, although some minor details were suggested in which it might be unconstitutional. DeBow was released on the ground that the particular sale complained of was made to a dealer in such securities and therefore within the exemption of the law, but the law itself was upheld. The above mentioned arrests and the cases cited have caused a ntir among stock salesmen and caused them to be much more careful how they sold stock, which had not received a permit, and has greatly cut down </seg>

Of course, with so large a state, and with so limited an office force, only a start has been possible, but we believe one well worth while. UAs always, the past year, the greatest good that has been accom - hed by the department in the enforcement of the Blue Sky law, has been the diverting from the state of many companies whose officers had in mind selling stock here, but who, upon conference with the depart - ment at once changed their minds and concluded that other states, and particularly those without Blue Sky laws, were better places for the sale of their offerings. A good part of the time of the department has been taken up going over various propositions with people wanting to sell, and telling them whether or not such schemes could possibly receive a permit from the department. A good many of the propositions pre - sented could not possibly be passed by the department, and those pre - rting them have quietly passed on to states where stock selling is not hedged about by law. The Blue Sky department collected fees in the sum of $2,174.00, and turned same over to the State Treasurer, during the year 1917. The following permits were issued during the year 1917: </seg>

            <seg id="p390">392 PART VI Engineering Department Lincoln, Nebraska, December 31, 191 Nebraska State Railway Commission, L Lincoln, Nebraska. Mem en: — LThe following list of applications and complaints, showing the char - r of the report by this department in each case, will give you an idea of the extent of the work during the past year. The notation "Val - uation and report" means that the department has made a careful and detailed inventory and appraisement of the physical property of the ap - plicant company; these reports are frequently called for when applica - tions for authority to increase rates are filed with the Commission. The same kind of an inventory and valuation is required in many cases in connection with an application to issue new securities. Under "Transmission lines" I have shown the applicants who have been authorized to construct high voltage lines on the public highways of the state. This involves the necessity of checking the details of con - struction of the proposed lines and the further necessity of securing agreements with the conflicting wire interests in order to avoid the necessity of a formal hearing. The number of applications filed under this law indicates considerable activity among the power interests of the state, and when the prices of construction materials become normal I anticipate that extensive construction will follow rapidly. Complaints on account of poor telephone service and dangerous rail - road crossings have also called for a detailed investigation by this de - partment and report to the Commission. The telephone service com - plaints are shown separately while the crossing complaints are included under "Miscellaneous." The latter class of reports includes a variety of complaints which have been referred to this department for investiga - tion and report. Telephone Companies — Rates.
