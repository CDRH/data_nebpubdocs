            <seg id="p007">FORTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT This report covers the investigations, expenditures, and publications of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Sta - tion during its forty-second year. The Agricultural Experi - ment Station was organized to seek out and develop new and helpful information. It is recognized that such work can be done much more cheaply and efficiently by such an organiza - tion than thru individual effort., New problems are constantly arising m the agricultural development of the state. These cannot always be taken care of promptly. The Experiment Station attempts to give precedence to those problems m most urgent need of solution. Manyresearch problems are of a long-time nature. As prob - lems are completed new ones are added, but it is not possible to undertake work along all of the lines requested of the Ex - periment Station. It seems to be good station policy to con - centrate on a few problems rather than to undertake too many at one time. New lines of investigation planned and got under way dur - ing the past year include a study of the causes of the failure of alfalfa stands thruout the state. This study involves hardiness, winter injury, and diseases. Another major line of investigation undertaken is the relation of environmental conditions to the losses of poultry thru various diseases. For several years there has been an increased amount of routine work coming to the .Experiment Station which does not .contribute to our research ! program. A wide range of specimens, mainly plant and animal, are sent to the Station for analysis, diagnosis, and. general information. The Ex - periment Station is not organized to take care of all these requests. It attempts to. do so when they seem to have a general community interest, but to whatever extent this class of work is carried on the research program suffers. During the past year investigations along several lines were con - cluded. The results soon will be available to the public thru the publications of the Station. INVESTIGATIONAL WORK The work of the Experiment Station is grouped around subject-matter departments. This arrangement makes for greater efficiency m the solution of the problems undertaken. In the following report the various projects are grouped m a : corresponding manner, regardless of the particular class of investigation into which they properly fall. The investigational work of the Experiment Station is sup - ported by both Federal and State funds. In this report no </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station attempt is made to classify the investigations according to the different funds. A financial statement is included which shows the expenditures of the various funds allotted to the Experiment Station. In this report only a brief summary of the projects is given Upon the conclusion of any investigation, the findings are assembled and published. These publications are available to anyone interested in them upon application to the Director of the Experiment Station. AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING Tractor Testing.— The work done under this project is carried on according to the Nebraska Tractor Testing Law This work is creating a great deal of interest, especially among the manufacturers. In the spring of 1928 the tractor testing rules were changed to provide for one carburetor setting for all tests, in order to make the results of the Ne - braska tests correspond more nearly to results obtained in field use with the average operator, and to bring about a more uniform handling of each tractor on test. During the vear 14 tractors were tested. Poultry House Ventilation and Construction Further work was done on this project during the year. Some pre - vious work was rechecked and some new features were studied An excellent opportunity was afforded during the past season to observe the various units during extremely cold weather kgg laying again dropped off less in the heated than in the unheated houses during these cold periods. A study of the results from year to year indicates clearly that conclusions cannot be based on any one year's results, but the data so far obtained indicate the following: (a) There is apparently no correlation between humidity and winter production of eggs in Nebraska. xnl L Egg P rocluction can b e increased by artificial heat. Whether or not the increase is sufficient to warrant the ex - pense is still a question and is somewhat dependent upon the type ot heating installation used and the temperatures main - tained. (c) Air change in a unit with four square feet of floor space per bird has apparently no relation to egg production (d) Large egg production seems to go with small tempera - ture fluctuation. (e) The value of the ventilating system is as yet unde - termined. Combine Harvester Studies.— The work under this project during the year consisted of visits to farms where combines were being used. Data were obtained on the use of the com - bine in various phases, and samples of grain were obtained </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Forty-second Annual Eeport for the determination of moisture content. The use of the combine has increased rapidly during the past two years in the western part of the state, and work under this project will be continued. - Wind-driven Electric Plants for Farm Use. — The third con - secutive year's record was obtained with a commercial unit, installed in 1923. This unit has a 10-foot, 2-blade propeller. Service was interrupted during 48 nights of 1928 on account of discharged batteries. Thirteen of these were in July and 24 in August. During the year a total of 500 kilowatt hours of electrical energy was produced and 265 kilo - watt hours utilized thru load. The original batteries installed in 1923 had to be replaced in October, 1927. The results ob - tained during the entire "period with this plant are being assembled for publication. Pump Irrigation. — This project was undertaken in order to secure data relative to the construction of irrigation wells, cost of operating same, method and cost of distributing water, and effect on crop yield. During this season data were se - cured from 41 wells. Plants operated by three different types of power plants were observed, namely, stationary gasoline engines) tractors, and electric motors. A wide variation in cost of pumping and distributing the water was noted among these three types, ranging from an estimated cost per crop acre per season as low as $1.00 to as high as $13.00, exclusive of investment expense. The higher cost has generally been found where an attendant was kept constantly at the plant. The expense of pumping was found to be from 2.9 to 30.16 cents per acre foot per foot of lift, not including investment expense. Pump irrigation has been receiving a great deal of attention by the farmers of the state and this project is being continued and if possible will be expanded to include other phases. Tractor Lug Efficiency Test— This project was undertaken for the purpose of studying the basic principles involved in lug action of a tractor wheel and the effect of these principles on the efficiency of tractor wheel equipment. The study in- - eludes the various soil conditions that would be most likely to affect lug action and also the shape and kind of lug, its " penetration; and the weight of the traction wheel. Consider - able preliminary work has already been done in working out apparatus for recording the various measurements desired. Study of the Use of Electric Power on Nebraska Farms. — The work under this project has been carried on in four sub - projects: </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station (a) Adaptation of small electric motors to farm use. Several elevators of different types were studied during the past year and one silage cutter. The determination of the amount of electricity per unit of effort was made. Laboratory work with hammer and bur grinders has been carried on, but conclusions have not yet been drawn. Work will be continued under this sub-project. (b) Automatic water systems. A study has been made of deep-well automatic water systems. Data so far show a cur - rent consumption varying from 0.083 to 2.012 kilowatt hours per 1,000 gallons per foot of lift. With shallow-well auto - matic water system the current consumed shows .024 kilowatt hour per 1,000 gallons per foot of total maximum head. (c) A study of small unit plants for farm use. A study of the reports of 450 users of farm electric light plants re - veals that all use electricity for lights, approximately 75 per cent for washing machines and irons, approximately one-half for radio, one-third use electricity for pumping water and one-fifth for separating milk. In all 28 different uses are made of current from these plants. The information obtained indicates that the life of the battery is not shortened if the cur - rent is used for a number of different things rather than for light only. Using the year from March 1, 1927, to March 1, 1928, as a basis, in which close cost accounts were kept the average fuel cost was 19.3 cents per kilowatt hour and the average consumption 746 kilowatt hours for the year. (d) Electrically operated refrigerators for farm use The study of electrically operated refrigerators has been confined to date to the domestic sizes. Recording thermometers show the range of temperatures within the food space to be very nearly the same for the loaded box as for the same box empty of food. Outside variable influences seem to be as important factors as the style and insulation of different refrigerators. Our observations on several installations show a range of l r0T 2eh f 1 1 ., kllowa t t hour per da y P er cubic fo °t of food space to .3846 kilowatt hour per day per cubic foot, depending on the time of year, location, usage, etc. Practically all the re - ingerators under our observation have a May 1 to November 1 service season. ANIMAL DISEASES Fmvl Cholera (Hemorrhagic Septicemia) .—Further work was done in order to get more information on the possible immunizing value of aggressins. The amount of work done on this line, however, was limited by the demand from other lines of investigations. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Forty-second Annual Report An Inquiry into the Part Played by Avian Tubercvlosis Infection in Farm Animals and in Man. — -This project is be - ing pursued with all possible energy. Because of the help received from the National Tuberculosis Association in the collection of additional human material, it seems possible that this project may be concluded in the course of the current fiscal year.' The following is a tabulation of results thus far obtained. '-'. The distribution of avian tuberculosis infection in mammals. Progress report on results obtained prior to August 25, 1928.

Especial attention was given to the pathology of the disorder and com - parison was made with the organs of animals which had suc - cumbed to a similar disease in Washington (state) , Colorado, Nova Scotia, England, New Zealand, and Africa. Feeding experiments were continued, and while it has thus far not been possible to reproduce the disease in fatal form, evidence has been obtained which strongly indicates that, as in other parts of the world, certain species of Senecio may be implicated as an etiologic factor. It seems probable that with this season's work the investi - gation may be closed, as further progress would be possible only thru the establishment of a more or less expensive field station in the region involved. The epizoological development of the disease during the last two years does .not indicate that such an expenditure would be warranted. ' </seg>
            <seg id="p012">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station An Inquiry into the Influence of Environment upon Poultry Morbidity. — Work under this project has not yet been started. Rather extensive equipment is necessary and this is now under construction. It is planned to start the experimental work as soon as the equipment is ready. Current Laboratory Examinations. — During the past year 6,771 specimens of various kinds were sent to this laboratory for purposes of diagnosis. This large amount of routine work materially detracted from the research program. DAIRY HUSBANDRY A Study of the Principles of Ice Cream Making. — Work under this project has been continued during the past year. Studies of the causes and remedies for sherbet crustation and of modified Babcock tests for butterfat in ice cream have been carried on. Crystallization of sugar at the surface of frozen sherbet has caused considerable trouble to manufac - turers of ice cream. In the study of this phase of the project it was found that sealing the containers prevented the forma - tion of crust ; parchment covers alone were better than leaving the surface exposed. Higher concentration of sugar caused quicker and deeper crustation. Invert sugar and corn sugar as a part of the sweetening material retarded crustation and in some cases entirely prevented it. Gum tragacanth and gum arabic are undesirable as stabil - izers because of the objectionable flavor when incorporated in the mix. In a study of the several recommended processes for de - termining butterfat in ice cream, the results obtained indi - cated that none of the present recommended procedures is satisfactory for all samples of ice cream. Modification of the glacial acetic-sulphuric acid or ethyl alcohol-sulphuric acid methods appears most likely to give satisfactory results. Studies of Fat Soluble A and Other Milk Vitamines Present in the Milk of the Four Principal Dairy Breeds. — The study of the vitamine A content of Holstein, Ayrshire, Jersey, and. Guernsey milk has been continued. Methods recommended for assay of vitamine A by the United States Pharmacopoeia have been used with slight modifications. The milk obtained from a group of cows of the different breeds has been fed in graded amounts. The milk was held in cold storage thruout the feeding period. While a considerable number of series have been run, sufficient data are not available at this time to draw definite conclusions as to the comparative value of the milks of the different breeds. A Study of Growth in Dairy Cattle.— Additional data have been obtained under this project along the lines previously </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Forty-second .Annual Report outlined. Weights and measurements are taken of the calves at birth and in weekly periods thereafter until 26 weeks of age. Following the 26-weeks period the calves are weighed and measured monthly as long as they remain in the herd. Photographs of the calves against a background divided into . six-inch squares are taken when the calves are a few days old and each month thereafter. The number of Holsteins - now studied is sufficient to give uniformity to the growth curve. Female Holstein calves gained 1.57 pounds per day to 26 weeks, while the male Holstein calves gained 1.74 pounds per day. In Jerseys the female calves have an average daily gain of 1.15 for the same period and the males 1.25. Factors Affecting the Quality of Milk as Shown by the Fat Test, Sediment Test, and Bacterial Count. — This work was continued as in previous years. Fat tests were made daily; sediment tests weekly; bacterial counts were made by the direct microscopical. method. It has been found that tempera - ture is the largest factor affecting the bacterial flora of milk. Not always was the milk properly cooled, even tho the equip - ment for cooling was at hand. The Control and Economic Effect of Contagious Abortion in the Dairy Herd. — Work under this project is primarily a study of the records of the College daily herd as kept during the past 30 years. The study includes the production loss in milk and butterfat, as well as the injurious effect upon the animals, and the entire period has been divided into six-year periods in order to show better the different phases of the study. This division also takes into account the steady growth in number of the dairy herd. Another phase of the work is the attempt to obtain an abortion-free herd by the use of the agglutination test and isolation for positive animals. The test, is being run in 4 different dilutions. A separate group of buildings and yards is provided for animals that it is thought necessary to keep in quarantine, and the entire herd is tested every 4 months. The negative herd is tested each month. FIELD CROPS AND SOILS Corn Improvement. — Work under this project has been continued largely in further study of the principles of corn improvement thru, inbreeding and hybridization. This ap - pears to be the most promising method of corn improvement. The immediate problem appears to be the production of self ed lines which may be recombined into superior F! single or double crosses, or of restored synthetic varieties suitable for commercial planting. During the past year some 800 selfed lines of. various degrees of reduction were grown. Some of </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station the hybrids have indicated superiority in yield over standard varieties ; others have fallen below. Tho marked superiority in yield has been obtained in a number of cases, further test - ing is considered desirable before distribution of seed for farmers' use. A cytological, histological, and morphological study is being carried on of the reproduction, mode of inheritance, embryol - ogy, and growth of corn. Attempts will be made to correlate the findings from this study with the genetic behavior of the crop. Normally developed material has been collected at stages in order to show the progressive development of the male and female flowers, the gametes, the fertilization pro - cesses, and the embryo and endosperm. A comparative study of corn tillage practices has been con - tinued. During the past year corn yields. approximating 50 bushels per acre were secured. During the last six years 13 methods of seed-bed preparation and 10 methods of inter - tillage have been compared in duplicate field plats. The re - sults to date are being published in Bulletin 232, which is now in press. During the past season studies were continued of seed-corn treatment, rate of planting, date of planting, uniformity of seed distribution, age of seed, and relative merits of single and multiple row test plats. In the study of seed treatment, corn from many farmers has been grown here at the Station in duplicate plats and treated with Uspulum, Bayer Dust, Semesan Jr., and Merko. As in previous years, this treat - ment was not found to have any material effect on either stand or yield of representative farm-selected "planter-box" seed. Seed that was carefully selected for heavy infection with Diplodia dry-rot disease responded with a somewhat im - proved stand and grain yield. In the various other cultural practices the results correlated closely with those of previous years. Much more reliable yield determinations may be made thru the use of multiple- rather than single-row plats, whenever materially dissimilar varieties or hybrids are being compared. The following publications were issued during the past year: Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin No. 218, entitled "Field Experiments with Seed Treatment," and these articles: "The Mechanical Procedure of Field Ex - perimentation," Journal of the American. Society of Agron - omy, Vol. 20, No. 5, and "The Improvement, Distribution, and Maintenance of Farm Crops," Journal of the American So - ciety of Agronomy, Vol. 20, No. 1.

Winter Wheat. — Nebraska No. 60 has continued to show superior, qualities on farms thruout the State and is now the most extensively grown variety. During the past year 100 strains of Crimean 1435 were grown in nursery plats, repli - cated 10 times. A number indicate considerable promise. Fifteen of these strains were grown for the first time in field plats. In an attempt to obtain bunt-resistant strains of wheat, a number of promising Turkey Red selections have been ob - tained. Approximately 300 hybrid strains have been de - veloped from crosses of Nebraska 6 and Kanred with recog - nized smut-resistant varieties. Some of these offer consider - able promise. . . , . :■ Some 600 hybrids representing about 30 variety combina - tions are being tested for hardiness and other agronomic factors. Some 40 varieties and strains developed for the hard red winter territory of the United States have been assembled from various sources and are being tested. In extensive tests of smut control bothT-fiopper carbonate and formaldehyde were found effective. In the case of heavy infection this year, untreated seed showed 70 per cent of the heads smutted, as compared with 1 per cent for either of the treatments men - tioned above. Cultural studies, including the harvesting at various stages of maturity, were continued. During the past year Nebraska Experiment Station Bul - letin 223, entitled "The Seedbed Factor in Winter Wheat Pro - duction," was published. In this bulletin 22 different methods of seedbed preparation are discussed, the value of early seed - bed preparation being clearly .shown. Oafs.— Work with oats quitle similar to that with wheat is being carried on, except that no extensive work -with hybridi - zation is in progress. Nebraska 21 and Burt 293 are being widely grown and have shown superior yielding ability. Seventy strains of the Burt variety are being grown in nursery blocks, and a collection of 25 varieties from various states are being tested in field plats. Barley.— Most of the work with barley has been in variety testing. Among the 25 varieties, including 9 smooth-awned strains, Comfort and Glabron are best. Comfort barley has already been distributed thruout the state. In a 5-year test it averaged 7 bushels above the Common 6-row variety. In a 2-year test Glabron has given a slightly higher yield than Comfort and is especially desirable from the standpoint of lodge resistance. </seg>

The increases in yield varied from — 2.44 to 15.92 bushels per acre in the case of . sodium nitrate and from 0.75 to 5.05 bushels in the case of ammonium sulphate. The response to sodium nitrate was quite consistent with the nitrate content of the soil at the time of application and with the ability of the soil to produce nitrates during the growth of the crop. Experimental work at the Agronomy Farm on the nitrate factor in wheat production, work that has extended over a 4-year period, has been brought to a conclusion during the - year. Sodium nitrate applied at one date in the fall, and at three dates in the spring, gave results indicating the im - portance of- a high soil-nitrate content in early April. Am - monium sulphate applied in April had little effect. Manure applied in the fall hastened nitrate production and led to in-, creased yields. The work has included analysis of soil for nitrate nitrogen and of crop for total nitrogen at weekly or bi-weekly intervals, from early April till harvest. The course of nitrogen absorption by wheat is clearly shown. Over three - fourths of the nitrogen required by the crop appears to be absorbed before the middle of May. ■ Soil Tilth. — Work on this project has been confined to a study of soil consistency and its evaluation. This study has included subsoils as well as the surface soils. An attempt has been made to clarify the ideas concerning the meaning of consistency, and to evaluate consistency by means of the : Atterberg constants. Three articles bearing on this subject have been published during the year: "The Report of the Sub-committee on Soil Structure and Consistency," in the- Report of the Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Soil Survey Association, pp. 10-22, 1928; "Variations in the B Horizon" in the Report of the Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Soil Survey Association, pp. 100-112, 1928 ; and "The Atterberg Consistency Constants," in Journal of the American Society of Agronomy, Vol. 20, pp. 354-372, 1928. Soil Organic Matter. — Analysis of soils from farms of known history have heen continued to determine the extent of depletion of organic matter under different systems of man - agement, and also the rate of depletion when land is cultivated without particular attention to return of crop residues, use of manure, or growing of legumes. In a group of 68 fields, 9 that have been under cultivation from 5 to 7 years show an average loss of 6.5 per cent of organic matter ; 9 that have been under cultivation from 8 to 15 years show an average loss of 14.5 per cent; 12 that have been under cultivation from 17 to 30 years show an average loss of 25.6 per cent; 25 that have been under cultivation from </seg>

New plantings of strawberries, raspberries, goose - berries, currants, apples, pears, and grapes were made during the fiscal year just closed. Another line of investigation under this project is con - templated, namely, the testing of varieties for sterility It is hoped to accomplish this by hand pollination and bagging of blossoms. This work is especially desirable with apples and hybrid varieties of plums, and where fruit is obtained the seed can be used for the propagation and breeding of new varieties with known parentage. Orchard Culture.— Work has been continued under this project as previously outlined. The set of fruit during the past year was very light, due to low temperatures in April Where weeds were allowed to grow oh the clean cultural plats to prevent soil erosion, considerable damage was done to the trees thru girdling by mice. ., iT he - ef^ct°f. mulching^ grapes is showing considerable re - sults in the growth of the vines. The 'total new growth of mulched, per vine, was 350.7 feet as compared with 259 4 teet per vine on cultivated plats.

Orcliard Spraying for the Codling Moth. — This project is being carried on in co-operation with Mr. Hoppert of the Agricultural Extension Service. Work has been continued and unsatisfactory results from the use of dust in 1927 led to its being dropped for the current growing year. The same is true for the fungicides, Bordeaux and lime sulphur. Dur - ing the growing season of 1928 a thoro test of various in - secticidal sprays was made. During the spring of 1928 extremely high temperatures in March were followed by extremely low temperatures in April. This reduced the set of apples to approximately 20 per cent of a normal crop. Codling moths were evidently weakened by these extreme conditions. The first brood of worms was so weak that only a few were able to get into the fruit even in unsprayed orchards. This condition will probably materially interfere with the results obtained during the present year. Circular No. 36, "Spraying Tree Fruits," was published dur - ing the current year. HOME ECONOMICS Water Carried for Household Purposes. — Two hundred and eighty-six records have been secured under this project, giving general information as to the ownership or tenancy of the farm, size of farm and house, number in the family, conven - iences, etc. There is also included such information as the location of the well in reference to distance from the house, in relation to outbuildings, the method of pumping, and the time consumed in obtaining water for household purposes. The data from these records are being tabulated and as - sembled for publication, after which the project will be closed. Lighting with Portable Lamps. — During the past year the records previously procured under this project were as - sembled and the results published as Experiment Station Bul - letin 225. The data gathered show the number of lamps per household and per person, and the cost of upkeep of the lamps and the location of the lamps within the room. The conclu - sion is drawn that improvement might be brought about by using greater candle power lamps or a greater number of lamps per room, by putting the lamps at the proper level, and by shading. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">Forty-second Annual Report The Nebraska Rural Kitchen. — The work under this project has been completed and the results published as Experiment Station Bulletin 226. The data obtained bring out the fact that the kitchens in rural homes are less satisfactorily ar - ranged and equipped than kitchens in city homes. There has been less study of both lighting arrangement and household equipment. Routine and Seasonal Work of Housekeeper.— Under this project 179 records covering a 12-months period have been obtained. This work is now being tabulated and the data analyzed with the view of publication. . The records obtained . show not only the work performed each month by the house - wife, but also the type of equipment with which she works, and the amount and kind of help she receives. It is hoped that these records may furnish information from, which to suggest changes which will bring about a better distribution of the work thru the year as well as reduce the actual amount of labor required. A Study of Kerosene Cooking Stoves. — Considerable prog - ress has been made on this project during the past year. As a preliminary step different burners were tried under varying conditions such as the housewife encounters, the purpose being to learn more about the operation of the burners, to develop technique for the study, and to attempt to find what conditions should be controlled. The burners so far compared are the long burner wick, short burner wick, 'short burner asbestos lighting ring, and the short burner wickless. Studies of boil - ing speed and thermal efficiency have been made, the work being done with the openings closed to prevent draft. Fuel kerosene was tested by the Engineering Department to de - termine the thermal units. The boiling speed and thermal efficiency tests were made by heating definite amounts of water under measured conditions, comparing the burners as to both speed and fuel consumption. The cooking efficiency of the various burners was determined by preparation of definite menus. INSECT CONTROL Control of Injurious Insects, Mammals, and Birds — Durinir the past year some work was done in assembling the data obtained m former years on the Hessian fly. There having - been, but few Hessian flies during 1926 and 1927, little new data were obtained. The indications are that the Hessian fly is again appearing in the state in numbers and probably active work will be resumed during the coming year This project includes studies of several other pests con - cerning which data are being accumulated from time to time </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station The Life History of Several Common Cutworms. This project continues, but progress has been slow. This has been partly due to the fact that greater emphasis is now being placed on other projects, and partly to the fact that a season of severe cutworm abundance and damage is necessary for progress under this project. A portion of the work giving keys and descriptions of the various kinds of cutworms known to attack field crops is well toward completion. , Life History and Control of Potato Flea Beetles in Western Nebraska.— Extensive damage to the seed potato industry by flea beetles, especially in certain sections of Nebraska, led to the inauguration of this project. The plan is to determine the life history of the potato flea beetle and other injurious species of flea beetles in the seed potato district. This will form a basis for control studies and recommendations Ar - rangements were made for carrying on the work on certain farms in the western part of the state. During the summer a man was placed in the field to conduct the studies, and con - siderable data were obtained. A Brood Studi/ of the Codling Moth in Southeastern Ne - braska.—The purpose of this project is to determine the period ot development of the broods of eggs, larvae pupae and moths of each generation of the codling moth in Nebraska ' also to study the yearly life cycle of the insect in the apple - growing regions of Nebraska as a basis of proper control methods. The plans for the present season are being carried forward, the work being under way at the Agricultural Col - lege, the Lnion Fruit Farm, and in orchards near Nebraska City and Shubert. LIVESTOCK FEEDING CATTLE Fattening Cattle.— In this experiment 4 lots of yearling steers were fed for a period of 165 days. They were well - bred Hereford steers which had been used the previous winter in a test on wintering range calves at the Valentine Substation During this test the steers in Lot 1 had been wintered as calves on prairie hay and had gained only 25 pounds during a 150-day period. Lot 2 had received prairie hay and one pound of cottonseed cake daily and had gained 175 pounds each during the feeding period. These two lots received the same ration during the period of this test. Lot 3 received prairie hay and V/* pounds of cottonseed meal, and Lot 4 mixed hay (prairie 75 and clover 25 per cent) during the winter feeding as calves. All steers had been uniformly sum - mer ranged at the Valentine Substation, and records of gains kept. The rations were as follows : </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Forty-second Annual Report Lot 1. — Corn, cottonseed meal, silage, alfalfa. Lot 2. — Corn, cottonseed meal, silage, alfalfa. Lot 3. — Corn, linseed meal, silage, alfalfa. Lot 4. — Corn, silage, alfalfa. The feeding of one pound of cottonseed cake daily to the calves in Lot 2 had the following results: As calves they gained 150 pounds more during the winter season. They made 61 pounds less gain dui'ing the pasturing season and 11 pounds less gain when fed as yearlings than the calves which did not receive cottonseed cake. At the close of the last feeding test the calves which had received cottonseed cake averaged 78 pounds per steer heavier and dressed 1 per cent higher, and, at the same price per 100 pounds, made greater profit. In Lots 2 and 4 the addition of 1.38 pounds of cottonseed meal daily to a corn, alfalfa, and silage ration resulted in 27 pounds of additional gain per steer, 25 cents per 100 pounds increased selling price, and $3.45 per head greater profit. One hundred pounds of gain cost 7 cents more in the lot where the cottonseed meal was fed. In Lots 3 and 4 the addition of 1.38 pounds of linseed meal to a daily ration of corn, alfalfa, and silage, resulted in 31 pounds per steer additional gain at 24 cents per 100 pounds lower cost of production. It also caused the cattle to sell for i 25 cents per 100 pounds more and resulted in a $2.84 greater profit per head. From the above it is apparent that the addition of either supplement to a corn, alfalfa, and silage ration produced re - sults which justified the practice. Cottonseed meal gave slightly better results than did linseed meal. The Effect of Age uyon the Quality and Palatability of Heifer Carcasses. — Calves used in this trial were high-grade Hereford calves produced at the Experiment Station from Nebraska sand-hill cows of known age and history. During the winter these cows had received a ration of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and one pound of cottonseed cake. The cows and calves were weighed every 14 days. Calves were slaughtered at 28-day intervals, giving a complete series of carcasses from birth to 196 days. Samples for chemical analysis were obtained from each carcass. The analyses have not been completed. Cooking and palatability tests of some of the cuts were carried on thru co-operation with the Home Economics Department. These studies likewise have not been completed. LAMB FEEDING Rations for Fattening Lambs. — During the past year 8 lots of 25 lambs each were fed for a period of 80 days, from </seg>

The objects were to compare self -feeding of tankage with hand feeding, using a full feed of corn, and to compare different amounts of tankage with a shelled corn ration. The rations used were: Lot 1. — Shelled corn and tankage self -fed, free choice. Lot 2. — Shelled corn self-fed and tankage hand-fed once daily at the rate of .33 pound per head daily. Lot 3. — Shelled corn self-fed and tankage hand-fed once daily at the rate of .22 pound per head daily.

The cost of 100 pounds of gain increased as the tankage consumption decreased, with the exception of Lot 1, where the tankage was self-fed. The amount of corn consumed daily decreased with the lowering of the tankage allowance. Hence, the value of tank - age as an appetizer was quite marked. Rations for Fattening Pigs. — Under this project 4 lots of 92-pound pigs were fed in dry lot for a period of 70 days. There were 10 pigs per lot. The purpose was to determine the merits of adding linseed meal and alfalfa meal, and cotton - seed meal and alfalfa meal, to a ration of corn and tankage. The rations used were: . Lot 1.— Shelled corn and tankage. Lot 2. — Shelled corn and Mixture No. 1 (tankage 1 part, cottonseed meal 1 part).

Lot 4. — Shelled corn and Modified Trinity Mixture (tank - age 2 parts, cottonseed meal 1 part, and alfalfa meal 1 part). The feeding of equal parts of tankage and cottonseed meal as a protein supplement to corn resulted in .31 pound greater </seg>
            <seg id="p026">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station daily gain per pig than where straight tankage was fed There was an increased consumption of both corn and supplement where the mixture was used; however, 100 pounds of gain was produced for 66 cents less cost. The use of protein supplement consisting of tankage 2 narts linseed meal 1 part, alfalfa meal 1 part, produced 21 pound greater daily gain per pig than straight tankage. The cost of producing 100 pounds of gain was lowered 8 cents A protein supplement mixture of tankage 2 parts,' cotton - seed meal 1 part, and alfalfa meal 1 part, increased the daily gain per pig .22 pound and decreased the cost of 100 pounds of gain 54 cents, as compared to tankage alone. The substitution of alfalfa meal for one-half of the cotton - seed meal in a tankage-cottonseed meal mixture resulted in a .09 pound lower daily gain and a 12 cents per 100-pounds higher cost of gain. MILLING AND BAKING The Relation of Certain Chemical and Physical-Chemical Characteristics of Nebraska Wheat to Its Milling and Baking Quality.— During the past year further work has been done in an attempt at the standardization of laboratory baking Left lo. Many samples of Nebraska wheat from the 1927 cron have been tested. The results show that the standard hard winter wheat varieties in Nebraska are equal to similar varieties tiom other localities when compared on an equal protein basis. The protein content may be regarded as the critical factor with standard Nebraska wheats as it is with wheats ot other localities. The important feature of recent tests in this laboratory has been the definite establishment of certain consistent dif - ferences between flours milled from small lots of wheat on an experimental mill, and flours milled commercially from the same, altho tremendously larger, lots of wheat. This work clearly indicates the extent to which these factors must be taken into account if one attempts to interpret quality tests with experimentally milled flours in terms of 'commercial utility. Commercially milled and treated flours differ ma - terially from flours milled experimentally from the same wheats, respectively, in two important aspects First the former are higher in diastatic power, which manifests itself in their greater ability to sustain yeast fermentation. Second commercia flour frequently has its gluten characteristics more or less altered by certain oxidizing agents used iov bleaching purposes. Both of these factors may be readily </seg>
            <seg id="p027">Forty-second Annual Report taken into account in the laboratory testing of experimentally milled flours. Work on this project will be continued. Standardization of Methods in Experimental Baking Pro - cedure.—-During the past year special emphasis has been given to the development of a standard method for the laboratory baking tests. The lack of such a method is responsible for much confusion, uncertainty, and controversy in the wheat industry, as well as in the research work in the field of cereal chemistry. Mr. Blish has served for the past three years as Chairman of the Committee on Standardization of the Experi - mental Baking Tests in the American Association of Cereal Chemists. A definite and specific procedure for baking tests has been agreed upon by the Committee and accepted by the Association. The proposed method was published in the July issue of Cereal Chemistry. NUTRITION A Study of the Comparative Efficiency of Various Proteins in Poultry Feeding.— The work previously reported on the effect of molting on the endogenous nitrogen excretion of mature hens has been extended to include a total of 129 non - molting and 68 molting hens. The mean excretion of nitro - gen of the non-molting group was found to be 349 milligrams with a probable error of 10.55. These figures represent the mean total nitrogen in milligrams excreted per day on a nitrogen-free diet. The difference between these means is £71 milligrams, with a probable error of 11.43, which shows that the nitrogen excretion of mature hens is greatly increased during the molting season. Molting is therefore a factor which must be taken seriously into account in nitrogen-met - abolism studies with poultry. Assuming that the endogenous nitrogen excretion of mature hens is an index to the demand of the body for nitrogen the maintenance requirement can be calculated from the above, values as being about 900 grams of crude protein annually 1 his figure does not take into consideration the fact that crude protein of the feed is seldom capable of replacing bodv oro - tem, unit for unit. v A study of the cystine requirement of molting hens was carried out with 41 S. C. White Leghorn hens. No beneficial effect was noted on feeding 112 milligrams of pure cystine daily to each of 21 hens as compared with 20 hens which re - °Z y l %Tn ne -A The d f^ On this study a PP ear in Paltry science, VII, No. 4, page 170.

            <seg id="p028">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station could be determined. These data form the basis of a report on "The Rate of Wing Molt of Hens," which appeared in Poultry Science, VII, No. 4, page 177. In previous attempts to determine the biological value of cereal proteins, the interpretation of results has often been complicated by the variation in endogenous nitrogen from one period to another. To avoid the necessity of depending upon the individual determinations of the endogenous nitro - gen, a series of trials were conducted wherein oats, wheat, and corn were fed at different levels of nitrogen intake. By this means a comparison of the values of these grains can be made on the basis of the economy with- which the nitrogen furnished was handled by the bird. These trials show that there are slight but perceptible differences in the utilization of the proteins of these cereals, and that their biological value increases as the plane of nitrogen intake is lowered. Preparation and Study of the Cereal Glutelins. — Work on this project, which was neglected for a time on account of temporary need for special emphasis upon Project 148, has now been actively resumed. A further series of these proteins has been prepared, and they are being studied from the standpoints of their chemical identity, individuality, and properties as affected by various modifications in methods of preparation. Certain phases of the project will shortly be ready for publication. PLANT DISEASES Ail Inquiry into the Pathological and Physiological Aspects of Alfalfa Failures in Nebraska. — The first year's work, mainly of a survey nature, and the collection of material indi - cate that a number of diverse factors, partly agronomic, partly pathological, are responsible for alfalfa failures. Of these, winter injury and wilt are probably most important. Wilt has been found in most sections of the state, but most abundantly in the river valley counties. Winter injury, prob - ably due to non-hardiness of seed stock, is prevalent over the state. A rather large number of alfalfa fields of various ages, from 2 to 20 years, have been carefully observed. By means of quadrat studies and plat examinations their percentages of wilt have been determined. It appears that wilt infection takes place primarily while the spring wood is being laid clown, altho some 0 infection occurs later in the season. Most of the spread of the organism takes place during the period when alternating thawing and freez - ing occur in the spring, after the plants have stalled to grow. The fluctuating temperatures are responsible for the cracking and splitting of the bark at the collar of the plant and below, </seg>
            <seg id="p029">Forty-second Annual Report allowing the organism to be released from the tissues and spread thru the medium of surface water to healthy plants, entering at the points where the bark is split. This type of winter injury has been very serious during April and the effects of this condition are readily observed, with the in - cidence of wilt rapidly increasing in the fields in the Platte Valley. Observations indicate that the less hardy strains are generally more susceptible to wilt, due largely to more ex - tensive winter injury and not to varietal differences of re - sistance. Grimm, while very hardy, is extremely susceptible to wilt. Some fields where exceptionally good stands of alfalfa have been found emphasize the advantage of good seed. These fields, now old, indicate their superiority in that they are hardy and intolerant to wilt and attempts are being made to obtain seed from such fields, as well as cuttings for further propagation. One thousand plants have been started from such cuttings and are being grown in different parts of the state. In the laboratory all attempts to isolate the organism from seed taken from diseased plants and artificially inoculated plants have failed. Likewise all attempts to recover the organism from soil thru special media or from old crowns plowed up in the fall and allowed to overwinter have been negative. A number of miscellaneous experiments on the physiology of the organism have been carried out. To date, healthy plants growing under normal conditions in the green - house and inoculated thru cut stems have not been killed. Several secondary invaders following both winter injury and wilt have been isolated from enough plants to show that they are contributing factors in the destruction of stands. Three distinct species of Fusarium have been isolated, causing respectively a stub rot, a crown rot, and a surface rot. A Fusarium has also been recovered from seedling plants. Khizoctonia has been repeatedly isolated from roots showing scurf and depressed lesions. As time permits, these organ - isms will be identified and tested for their pathogenicity on healthy plants, on winter-injured plants, and on plants having some wilt. A considerable number of plants have been started for work on winter injury. Greenhouse equipment for this work is being installed and the work will be carried during the coming fiscal year. The Control of Seed-borne Diseases of the Potato. — Experi - ments for the control of scab and Rhizoctonia were repeated again at Lincoln, North Platte, and Alliance. Hot formalde- </seg>
            <seg id="p030">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station hyde was again found to be the most effective control method for both scab and Rhizoctonia. In a study of scab control, mercuric chloride was ineffective at North Platte and Alliance, but gave considerable control at Lincoln. Most of the organic mercury treatments, includ - ing Semesan Bel and Bayer Dip-Dust, were sufficiently effec - tive to warrant recommendation. Sulphur applied in the soil failed to control scab. The hot formaldehyde method was found most effective, and its use seems warranted. None of the treatments resulted in a stimulation, nor did they affect the total yield of No. 1 size potatoes. In experiments to control Rhizoctonia on potatoes grown at Lincoln, both hot formaldehyde and mercuric chloride were successful, and the organic mercuries gave better control than they did of scab. In a study of control of Fusarium wilt and stem-end rot the results checked up very well with those made in previous years. The work has been discontinued and the results pub - lished in Phytopathology. The Irish Cobbler and Early Ohio varieties were both found to be much more susceptible to the disease than Triumphs, and they should not be planted on many of the heavily infected soils in western Nebraska The organic mercury seed treatment did not have any consistent effect upon the amount of infection and its use" is not con - sidered practical for the control of this disease. A Stud)/ of Scab and Fiisarium Wilt of Potatoes in Relation to Infection from the Soil— Work under this project is just being started, some experimental plantings having been made. A Study of Potato Spindle-tuber and Combinations of bpindle-tuber with Other Degeneration Diseases. Work has been continued on several phases of this project, both at Lin - coln and at the Scottsbluff Substation. The work of the past season is further evidence that what was previously considered as severe spindle-tuber is a distinct but somewhat similar disease known as unmottled curly dwarf This disease occurs in commercial fields and causes a total loss of yield in infected plants. The symptoms found do not entirely agree with published descriptions of the dis - ease, which may be due to varietal or other modifications or to amount of time of applying the inoculum. Large mis - shapen, slightly cracked tubers often with severe internal necrosis were produced by inoculation of the top when 6 to 8 inches high Such tubers when planted produced typical un - mottled curly dwarf plants. The second generation or the inoculation of seed pieces at time of planting resulted in an extremely dwarfed plant bearing no marketable potatoes </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Forty-second Annual Report The relative effect of the environmental factors tested has been found to be the same for both diseases. It has been found more difficult to distinguish the two diseases in the greenhouse than in the field. The necrotic symptoms of un - mottled curly dwarf did not occur in the greenhouse. A study of the symptoms of several other degeneration dis - eases of importance in this state is being made. Chief among these are giant hill, super-mild mosaic, and haywire. The last-named disease is carried in the seed tuber without the appearance of any disease symptoms on the tubers. The effect on the plant is very severe. In transmission studies the inoculation of green tops with the juice of infected plants resulted in successful transmission of both spindle-tuber and unmottled curly dwarf, the latter being more easily transmitted, as indicated by the percentage of infection. Preliminary experiments with diluted juice in - dicated that the unmottled. curly dwarf virus was infective at high dilution and could be separated from spindle-tuber in this way. It has been found that grasshoppers can transmit spindle - tuber, the percentage of infection increasing with the number of insects used in the tests. The results of this phase of the work have been published in Phytopathology, Vol. 18, No. 5. The experimental work in reference to the natural spread of spindle-tuber, rugose, mild mosaic, and leaf roll has been discontinued, and the data are being prepared for publication. POTATOES A Study of the Factors Affecting Quality of Seed Potatoes. — Less effort was put forth on this project during the past year; largely due to the elimination of the work on the spindle - tuber phase. Considerable work has been carried on in con - nection with the effect of maturity upon seed stock free from virus disease. In western Nebraska, tubers from early plant - ings have commonly been of inferior type and more scabby than those from later plantings. Cutting off vines before maturity and thus storing the potatoes in the ground seems to offer some promise as a method of securing some of the advantages derived from immature or early harvested seed, especially in the central portions of the state. Straw mulching at Lincoln was temporarily discontinued in 1927, insofar as the seed potato phase is concerned. Results indicate that with healthy seed straw mulching does not exert any significant influence and that "run-out" lots (run-out due to spindle-tuber) could not be rejuvenated by growing them under a straw mulch. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Seed potato lots containing a few mosaic plants became generally infected in two years when grown at Lincoln, less so at North Platte, while at Alliance there was very little spread of the disease. A tuber unit test of seed potatoes from high and low parts of a western Nebraska dry land field containing about 4 per cent of spindle-tuber exhibited a very much greater spread of the disease in the low lying parts of the field than in the higher parts. This was undoubtedly due to better conditions lor insect life and consequent spread of disease as well as thp masking of symptoms in the low parts of the field. Non-irri - gated seed stock may be of questionable merit when produced under such conditions, if any spindle-tuber is present in the seed stock. In studying the question of dormancy of seed potatoes varv - ing in maturity, biweekly plantings were made in the green - house beginning early in October. The cut seed pieces were treated for 1 minute in a 5 per cent solution of ethylene ti%A y t m and AnTf then Cl °f ed Up in an * ir - ti * ht chamb «- K, hou "; All lots responded to this treatment as late as February 16. The more mature lots exhibited the greatest response Several other methods were tried and some gave lair results, but none was equal to the method described Potato Selection for Seed Purposes.— Several phases of this work were continued during the past year. In a study of variations between the individuals of a variety, several hun - dred Triumph tubers were planted for study.

The indications are that in these stocks mosaic .has, been almost absolutely eliminated by this system and that Spindle-tuber and other diseases have been reduced to a low minimum. A study of seed size and planting distance is being con - tinued both on dry land and under irrigation. The indications are that piantings of 12 to 15 bushels per acre are most de - sirable, but this again depends upon conditions. Tests arc being made with Thiourea to determine its prac - tical application in seed potato production. Some of the tests this year are being made under field conditions. The spraying tests with Bordeaux are being continued, _as well as time-of-roguing experiments. Cultural practices, in - cluding planting depth and methods of cultivation, are being carried on at Alliance and Lincoln. POULTRY Nutrient Requirements of Growing Chicks. — In a study of the vitamine feed content of cod liver meal containing 40 per cent fat, 40 per cent protein, and 5 per cent ash, it was found to contain some vitamine D, but less than cod liver oil does. Cod liver meal fed at a 5 per cent level, thus contributing 2 per cent of cod liver fat, did not prevent rickets as effectively as did 2 per cent cod liver oil. In a study of the calcium-phosphorus ratio it was found that when the ratio was complete in all other essential factors, including vitamine D, and when ultra-violet radiation was provided, the chicks were able to adapt themselves to a wide variation in the CaP ratio. The ratio tolerated ranged from 1:1 to 1:6. In a study of the utilization of calcium an attempt was made to determine the effect of the form in which calcium was contributed to the ration. To a basic ration known to be complete in all other factors but deficient in calcium, 1 per cent of additional calcium was added in each of the following forms : calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, tri-calcium phos - phate, calcium sulphate, and calcium lactate. This experi - ment was repeated 3 times with consistent results. Using the growth rate as an indication of efficiency, calcium is best utilized when furnished as tri-calcium phosphate. Next in order of utilization are calcium lactate, calcium carbonate, calcium sulphate, and calcium chloride. In a succeeding experiment an equivalent amount of calcium was added in the respective forms of tri-basic, di-basic, and mono-basic calcium phosphate. Growth curve data show that </seg>

Preliminary observations of the laying ability of turkey hens indicate the pi-obability of as great a variation in egg production as has been noted with chicken hens. A trap - nest for use with turkeys has been devised and it is planned to obtain further data on variations in egg production. RURAL ECONOMICS Cost and Standards of Living on Nebraska Farms. — Work on this project is based largely on a survey made in the sum - mer of 1924. Station Bulletin No. 219, "Cost of Feeding the Nebraska Farm Family," has already been issued. A second phase of the subject is in manuscript form, dealing with the use of time in the farm home. A third manuscript entitled "Clothing the Farm Family" is being prepared. Tabulations on other phases of the study are being made. Cost of Producing Farm Crops. — Work under this project is carried in co-operation with farmers. During the past year 406 records were completed. These contain records of the cost of producing oats, wheat, and corn, and furnish a record of the hours of man labor, horse labor, and machine labor, as well -as other production costs. This work is very popular with the farmer and is being continued. Nebraska Farm Land Prices.— Progress has been made in the obtaining of further data on land transfer by warranty deed. The work is complete for 11 counties and includes the number of transfers, the total acreage, the average acreage, the total value, and the average value per acre. The inter - relation between these various factors will be studied. Market Costs. — Further work was done in summarizing price, production, and other pertinent data to determine cyclical and seasonal movements, their extent and frequency of occurrence, together with causes for such trends. Data previously assembled have been brought up to date and are used, in connection with current market information, as the background for material presented in a pamphlet, "The Ne - braska Economic Situation." . The study of shrinkage of corn in cribs, which was started in a small w,ay last year, was concluded. Loss of moisture was the only determinable factor. Definite conclusions are not warranted but it appeared that moisture loss was slow from November to March and most rapid in May and June. Regardless of the percentage of moisture in the fall, the moisture content was practically identical for all samples by </seg>
            <seg id="p036">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station the following summer. A manuscript involving moisture, grade, and price data is contemplated. Nebraska Bulletin No. 221, entitled "Protein as a Wheat Price Factor," was published during the year. This was based on information secured from flour millers of the state and gives their views on the reliability of protein content as an indicator of baking quality. Operating Problems of Country Grain Elevators. — Copies of financial and operating statements of about 150 country elevators, mainly co-operative organizations, were secured from audit companies during the year. Farm Organization and Farm Costs. — This project is an attempt to determine from the record books kept by the farmers the relative costs that obtain from different systems of farm organizations, as well as to determine the cost of producing the products under the different farming systems. During the past year 469 records, distributed thruout 15 counties, were obtained. Approximately 800 farm records are now available for study. Some phases of the work, for example the summarization of the agricultural statistics obtained by assessors, have been started. Cost of Producing Range Cattle. — A three-year survey of typical cattle ranches in the state has been made. A bulletin, No. 215, "A Survey of the Cattle Industry in the Nebraska Sand Hills," has been published. The data for the entire three years are now being assembled for publication. Economic Studies in Price, Volume of Production, and Pur - chasing Power of Farm Products. — Some work has been done during the past year in assembling and analyzing the data on beef-cattle prices. No new surveys have been made. It is planned after the present study is completed to take up the study of butterfat and wool. Co-operative Agricultural Organizations. — This project has been actively carried on during the past year. The data ob - tained have been assembled and have been used in answering questions asked by farmers. The only material published during the year was a mimeographed departmental circular entitled, "Facts Concerning Wheat Pools." SERUM PRODUCTION There appeared to be considerable cholera in the states to the north and east of Nebraska during August and September, but it did not become epidemic in this state. Cholera was re - ported from several sections, but the disease was more or less localized; the northeast and southwest sections suffered the heaviest loss.

This plant did not experience any unusual demand for serum and virus at any time during the year, but kept in reserve a liberal supply for an emergency, should it have arisen. It was able to fill all orders promptly, and at no time did it have occasion to become alarmed over a serum shortage. li Y^l re P° rted to this office &gt; however, from reliable sources] that there was some alarm about the serum supply among the commercial concerns during the months of August and Sep - tember. * The State Serum Plant has continued the policy of buying its serum supply subject to retest, and manufacturing its own virus. The retail price of "blood" serum from January 1 to March 1 was 75 cents per hundred c.c. On March 1 the price was reduced to 70 cents per hundred c.c, where it remained for the rest of the year. The price of concentrated clear serum remained steady thruout the year at $1.00 per 100 c.c. Virus sold at $1.50 per 100 c.c.

The rainfall was sufficient and well distributed, and wind velocity comparatively low. All of the usual lines of work were carried, and satisfactory progress made. AGRONOMY Much of the experimental work in agronomy is done in co - operation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture thru the offices of Dry Land Agriculture and Cereal Crops and Dis - eases. A portion of the crop rotation and tillage work has now 22 years' records. The data from these plats become of increasing- value year by year in supplying farmers of western Nebraska with accurate information upon the rotation of crops, seedbed preparation, conservation of moisture and re - lated problems. The past season completed five years of crop improvement work, including the testing of varieties of corn, sorghum, winter and spring wheat, oats, and barley, and the develop - ment of new strains by selection and hybridization. A num - ber of new pure lines of wheat, barley, and oats in preliminary tests have proved superior to the older varieties in both yield and quality. These will be more thoroly tested before being increased for distribution. Special studies are being made of disease resistance and winter hardiness of winter wheat. With potatoes, comparisons are being made under irrigation of seed harvested at different dates, and of- seed subjected to various treatments. On dry land, studies are being made of the time it is possible in this locality to maintain seed stocks sufficiently free from disease to make their use commercially practical.

Results for the seasons 1925, 1926, and 1927 are summarized and published in Bulletin No. 227, "Pump Irrigation Results." LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION Beef Cattle. — Two purebred herds of beef cattle are main - tained, one Hereford and one Shorthorn. The Hereford herd on July 1 consisted of 68 animals of all ages, including 29 females three years old or over, 12 two years old, and eight yearling heifer calves, the rest being bulls of various ages. The Shorthorn herd contains 49 animals, of which 21 are females over four years old. These herds have been main - tained mainly for demonstration purposes, and have now reached the point where individuals will be sold for breeding purposes. The completion during the past year of barns, sheds, and feed-lot equipment makes possible the carrying on ' of some experimental work with beef cattle which is con - templated in the near future. Dairying. — The dairy herd has continued to make splendid progress. It now contains 63 head of Holstein cattle, 25 of which are cows 5 years or more of age. This herd has received very favorable publicity in the state and breed press and is having a marked influence in estab - lishing in the popular mind the fact that there is a wide difference between the producing ability of the ordinary cow and the well-bred dairy cow. During the 12i/&gt; months, March 14, 1927, to March 31, 1928, including a preferential report dated April 12, 1928, Advanced Registry Certificates were issued to this herd as follows": twenty 365-day, one 30-day, and eleven 7-day cer - tificates. Of the 365-day certificates, 3 were for full-age cows, 2 for senior four, 2 for junior four, 3 for senior three, 3 for senior two, and 7 for junior two-year-olds. The highest records in each class respectively were, of butter, 1380.68, 1337.4, 1018.16, 1155.75, 958.575, 817.66. Of the 20 records, 7 were above 1,000 pounds of butter and 8 above 20,000 pounds of milk. Two of these butter records stand as state records; a third was a state record when made. The one 30-day record, a senior three, stands as a state record. Two of the 11 seven - . day records are above 35 pounds of butter, 6 above 30 pounds, and all above 22 pounds. Hogs.— There were at the close of the fiscal year, July 1, 1927, 269 animals in the Duroc herd. Shortly after that date, 144 head of spring shoats averaging 90 pounds each in weight were divided into 8 uniform lots of ,18 pigs each and put on the following tests. </seg>

This is repeating former tests designed to secure data on the relative values of protein supplements, particularly cot - tonseed meal, both with and without alfalfa pasture The several tests already conducted indicate that in ordinary practice it is quite safe to self-feed cottonseed meal where corn is also self-fed on alfalfa pasture, and that cottonseed meal may be used profitably in replacing a part of the tank - age in the corn-tankage ration. The percentage of tankage that may be replaced by cottonseed meal is one of the prob - lems under test. *»-vu iQOT Cep ;n A fl .° C . k °o ra u ge ewes was Purchased in the fall of 118 il"! 1 I Ramb 1 ° 1 u ! 1 / let rams - The 110 ewes raised 118 lambs and sheared 111/, pounds each of wool that sold for 38 cents per pound. The plan is to develop a practical farm herd from this foundation and to collect data that may be of value to the farmer who keeps a farm flock. Later more extensive experimental work may be undertaken. Horses.— A small herd of Percheron horses has been estab - hshed and will be maintained and developed as a purebred heid The usual number of work horses is being kept as nlatnf III f ot P raCtical T the several hundred experimental plats ot one-tenth acre or less in area. Poultry.— During the fiscal year of 1927 there were kent Red the an a dR agei ?? White Leghorn rVoTisS Red and Barred Rock breeds. The average number of eggs gathered per hen was 124; a comparable figure for 1926 was 114 Records for other years show a steady increase in egg production per hen Many setting eggs and well-bred cock - erels have been sold for breeding stock Turkeys have proved quite profitable. In 1927 the average production was 75 eggs per hen. In 1928 to July 1 the average was 61 eggs per hen. The turkeys marketed for Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons have returned a profit </seg>
            <seg id="p041">Forty-second Annual Report In carefully conducted tests the offspring of the large well - bred torn outweighed the offspring of the common torn enough to repay the additional cost of the better torn and to leave an additional profit. Good sires pay in raising turkeys as in raising cattle or hogs. HORTICULTURE AND FORESTRY Tests of all kinds of trees, shrubs, and flowering plants that promise to be of value in home building in western Ne - braska are being made as they come to our notice. About ten thousand seedlings of Chinese and Turkestan elms have been produced and were distributed thruout Nebraska by the Agri - cultural Extension Service in the spring of 1928. These will be of much value if they prove in the final test to be as hardy as the native elm and hackberry. They have the ad - vantage of growing quickly. Several thousand pines, spruces, and cedars are being grown " from seed each year, some from seed produced on this farm. When they have reached the proper age, they are set in the rough canyon land. Several thousand other pines from the United States Nursery have been set each year for the past several years. They are already adding a touch of beauty to the landscape. The trees, shrubs, and flowering plants being grown on the substation show conclusively that there is an abundance of these to make the landscape planting about the farm home as attractive as in the states to the east or to the west. SCOTTSBLUFF SUBSTATION The weather conditions affecting crop growth during 1927 were abnormal. Considerably more snow fell during the winter than usual and the rainfall during the summer was very much above normal, being 17.68 inches from April to September 30, and 20.98 inches for the year. The spring was backward and the whole summer was rather cool. The late severe snowstorms of April and May caused con - siderable death loss among calves and lambs in western Ne - braska and in Wyoming and adjacent states. These same storms held up field work so that crops were not planted until rather late. Wind, rain, and hail caused considerable damage to crops during the spring and summer. The financial returns from crops for the season of 1927 were less than those of previous years due partially to lower yields and partially to lower prices. . Crop Rotations. — The rotation work with crops under irri - gation was continued as in previous years, there being 34 such rotations. The results obtained coincided with those of </seg>

            <seg id="p043">Forty-second Annual Report valentine substation The past year, so far as public interest is concerned, has been the best year in the history of this substation. An in - creasing interest in the projects under way is manifested by the number of inquiries for information and by the personal visits. From the standpoint of weather the past year was quite unfavorable, it being the third successive year of subnormal rainfall. The winter was such that most of the fall wheat and some of the rye winterkilled. The prairie hay crop was below normal. The only improvement to the physical plant was the ex - tending of a four-inch water main from the town of Valen - tine to the farm. Cereal Crops. — Twenty-four varieties of small grain were grown for comparative yield tests. The past five-year aver - age number of bushels per acre for the principal crops on the station table-land are : winter wheat 9.7, rye 9.8, spring rye 7.1, spring wheat 6.6, emmer 7.8, barley 9.8, oats 16.4, and corn 15. On heavier soil north of the substation the above yields were almost doubled. The smooth-awned barley looks very promising for this region. Forage Crops.— Due to unfavorable weather conditions all annual forage crops were so poor that no yield data were col - lected. On the upland only one cutting of alfalfa was ob - tained. Fertilizers.— In a soil fertility study nitrate fertilizers and barnyard manure produced the most noticeable results, the latter giving a 3-bushel increase of rye and 4 of corn. No commercial fertilizer gave* sufficient increase to pay for the application. Meadow Investigations. — The substation is co-operating with the Agronomy Department in placing a man during the summer in the Elkhorn Valley and hay flats of the sand hills to make some detailed studies on meadow hay composition and the relation of clover and tame grass invasion to yield of hay. Seedings were made to determine the relation of clover production to water table in the wet meadows. Due to the dry spring, seedings failed except on meadow where free water was within two feet of the surface. Disking the meadow materially aided in obtaining a good stand of clover and tame grasses. Beef Cattle. — The project on wintering range calves has created unusual interest thruout the beef cattle region. The project has been increased to 6 lots of 10 calves each. Two lots were added the past winter, one receiving one-half pound </seg>
            <seg id="p044">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station of cottonseed cake per head daily, and one prairie hay and bone meal ad libitum. The results from the tests that were repeated show a close correlation with the preceding winter's results and the gains to date are quite consistent. The total gains for the winter feeding period and summer pasturing are shown below, also the feed given each lot. The gains shown are per head. Lot 1.— Prairie hay, 277 pounds. Lot 2.— Prairie hay and 1 pound cottonseed cake, 382 pounds. Lot 3.— Prairie hay and II 3 pounds cottonseed cake, 373 pounds. Lot 4.— Mixed hay, :?62 pounds. These tests show the folly of underfeeding as well as over - teeding tor most economical beef production, and also the value of good quality mixed clover and native hay. Bone meal has tailed to make much of a showing and indicates that there is probably no deficiency of calcium or phosphorus in the prairie-hay ration. Indications point to the conclusion that the shortcomings ot prairie nay are primarily due to its low protein content and this may be supplied thru legumes as well as concentrates. Dairying.— The purebred Holstein herd is composed of 54 females, of which 15 are milking. Very noticeable improve - ment has been made in type and production. On two-time milking the 5 two-year-old heifers averaged 542 pounds of butter and 11.082 pounds of milk, and the cows averaged 633 pounds of butter and 13,044 pounds of milk. This is the highest herd average on two-time milking in the state (he project with the grade Shorthorn milk cows will be continued for another year. Five cows produced an average of 400 pounds ot butter and 7,854 pounds of milk. The feed cost per 100 pounds of milk was 10 cents greater than for the Ho stems, and the fat cost 3 cents more per pound. Dairying in this locality has increased 25 per cent a year for the past 4 years, as indicated by the butterfat shipments from Valentine a number of co-operative creameries have been built in this territory during the past biennium. There is a strong demand tor dairy cattle. Poultry.— Artificial hatching and brooding of turkeys has proved very desirable and profitable in this locality.

            <seg id="p045">Forty-second Annual Report Trees. — Some new windbreak plantings have been made with Elm, Russian Olive, and Buffalo Berry. The Russian Olive has made the most extensive growth. In the old wind - break block a number of Honey Locusts winterkilled back to the trunk. A small orchard consisting of three varieties each of cherry and plum trees has been planted and is making good progress. ADDITIONAL LANDS, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT During the past fiscal year there have been completed the • following buildings: A herdsman's cottage at the Experimental Farms near Lincoln, costing §5,000. A series of greenhouses, consisting of two houses 28 x 100, a unit 12 x 100, and a head house for all. These greenhouses, together with the special equipment for temperature control, cost approximately $28,000. At the North Platte Station, an experimental feeding shed and lots, costing approximately $5,000. Plans have also been developed for the building of a poultry sanitation unit consisting of 12 lots and houses for studying poultry diseases. NEEDS OF THE EXPERIMENT STATION Among the most urgent needs for the Experiment Station are sheep feeding barns and sheds at the main station, an additional herdsman's cottage and a hog house at the Experi - mental Farms near Lincoln, and additional land. The scarcity of land at the main experiment station makes it impossible to carry on properly many of the lines of work undertaken. In all livestock departments, the concentration of livestock is far greater than it should be. This concentra - tion greatly increases the danger from various diseases and makes it almost impossible to get rid of this factor. The purchase of additional land would materially contribute to the efficiency of the work.
