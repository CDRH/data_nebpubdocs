            <seg id="p005">STATE OF NEBRASKA OFFICE OF THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Lincoln, Nebraska, June 1, 1931. To the Governor of the State of Nebraska: The Nebraska State Railway Commission herein submits its report for the year ending December 31st, 1930, m accordance with Section 75-302 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929. Statistical data required by the above statute and the nature and scope of the work of this Commission are described by said report. A study of same will show a steady increase m the work of this Com - mission under the original plan. Furthermore, since its inception, other duties have been placed upon this Commission. At the present time, m addition to the work of a "railway commission", this Com - mission has jurisdiction over the following: Street railways and busses; Telephone companies; Stocks and Bonds of common carriers and public utilities; Express com - panies; Telegraph companies; Pullman companies; Tractor sales; Electric transmission lines; Consolidation of any competing public utilities; Semi-public rural electric districts; Railroads; Aircraft; Irrigation companies; Bridge appraisals; Grain warehouses; Pipe lines; Toll bridges; Bus operations and Taxicab companies. Added to the above, this Commission represents Nebraska inter - ests, m rate matters of state-wide importance before the Interstate Commerce Commission. Protection of Nebraska industries and the welfare of Nebraska citizens requires that unjust interstate freight and express rates be prevented from discriminating against our state. This Commission is constantly at work preparing and presenting these cases, as this is the only state body prepared to protect Nebraska inter - ests m these matters which affect the economic welfare of our whole community vitally. ■ The Commission refers specifically to its work m connection with Interstate Commerce cases. On the last day of the year this Com-' ( mission was representing Nebraska shippers m thirty-seven cases, among which were the more important cases relating to rates on grain, | class, live stock, potatoes, hay, salt, petroleum products and coal. All of the corporations with which the Commission comes m con - tact are well equipped with expert employees. I If Nebraska interests are going to be protected, it goes without saying that this Commission, charged as it is with protecting said interests, [must have the services of experts able to cope with each situation and to compete with the </seg>
            <seg id="p006">experts employed by the large corporations. This Commission must have experts m sufficient number to allow them ample time on every case. There are so many cases m the process of preparation or being tried before the Interstate Commerce Commission and the courts, that the Commission requires full time counsel. Hugh LaMaster, assistant attorney general, has served the Railway Commission well, and the Commission urges and recommends that it be afforded his full time In view of the foregoing, the Nebraska State Railway Commission respectfully suggests that a careful inquiry into the actual needs of this department will lead rather to increases m appropriation than to curtailment. To the end that Nebraska will be adequately rep - resented m interstate matters, and that intrastate regulatory matters before this Commission will be expeditiously and accurately determin - ed, this Commission humbly calls your attention to its annual report for the year 1930. ..

The figures for the year l!)30, as compared with those of 1029, would seem to indicate that the bus industry in Nebraska is reaching a settled con - dition. The year 3 929 was a peak year as regards the bus industry in this state; it was during that year that several of the larger bus companies began their operations and made considerable .expansion. (See Twenty-second Annual Report, page 12. et seq.) During the year 1930, however, it was found that some of the lines established </seg>
            <seg id="p015">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION during the preceding year were not profitable and these were con - sequently either abandoned or the service ) being rendered over them was materially decreased. In other words, the figures for the year 1930 seem to Indicate that this was a year of reconstruction as regards the bus industry m this state and at the end o£ the year the industry seems to have reached its natural level. From now on the industry will doubtless show a regular trend of increase with but few so-called boom periods. A brief summary of the bus situation m Nebraska for the year 1930 is given below. On December 31, 1930, there were twenty-four motor transporta - tion companies operating bus lines m the' state of Nebraska. Two of these companies were engaged m a purely interstate business. Three of the companies were operated by steam railway companies, or their subsidiaries, and the remaining wore operated by individual companies. The twenty-two companies engaged m both interstate and intrastate business operated 123 buses and 11 touring cars. These buses and cars had an approximate seating capacity ot 2,863. The two companies engaged m purely interstate business operated one bus and one touring car. These had an japproximate total seating capacity of 22. The miles of route one way covered by the 22 com - panies doing both interstate and intrastate [business, was 4,771. During 1930 there were 18 original applications by various com - panies and individuals desiring to be given Ipermission to operate bus lines m this state. Ten original orders were issued approving new bus routes and service schedules, and eight of the original applications were dismissed for lack of prosecution. There were 62 supplemental orders issued on the applications which hadj been previously approved by the Commission. In practically all instances these supplemental applications were for the purpose of increasing or decreasing the amount of service that was already being furnished by the company. I A short study of the bus operations m Nebraska for 1930, as com - pared with 1929, is as follows: The estimated bus miles daily m Nebraska for 1930 is 20,379, and for 1929, 21,674. Bus miles made onj December 31, 1930, was 17,288. The estimated bus miles for the year, m Nebraska, for 1930, was 7 ; 438,336, and for 1929, 7,943,860. The decrease m bus mileage for 1930 over 1929, is 6.363%. The number of buses operated m Nebraska for 1930 was'l34, and for 1929, 134. i - ■ TAXICABS The 1929 session of the Nebraska State I Legislature passed a law known as H. R. 306, which m substance required all those engaged m the business of renting or letting cars or those engaged m the 15 </seg>
            <seg id="p016">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT business of furnishing taxi service to file with the Nebraska State Railway Commission either insurance policies, bonds or other negoti - able securities m such amounts as the Commission might require. This law was passed for the purpose of giving to the. public a certain amount of protection m the event of any accidents occasioned by the operation of the above mentioned types of transportation. Before this luw became effective, however, the Nebraska Commission, together with various other state officials, was enjoined from enforcing this law. This matter was litigated m the District Court of Douglas County and for various reasons there was a great, deal of delay m this litigation; the matter was finally decided m the District Court and was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Nebraska where the matter is still pending. During all this time the Nebraska Commis - sion has been enjoined from enforcing either all or parts of this law. For these above reasons the Commission, therefore, has .not taken active steps to enforce the same; however, if any company engaged m either the rent-a-car business or the taxi business desired to file an insurance policy or surety bond the Commission has accepted the same and placed it on file m its offices. A short summary of the in - surance policies and bonds so filed is given below. ■.■".• ■ • On December 31, 1930, ninety-six companies had. filed insurance with the Commission, pursuant to the law passed by the 1929 legisla - ture. This insurance covered the operation of. various taxi-cabs and rent-a-car companies located m this state. These companies! were located m twenty-three different towns. The total insurance rep - resented by these policies is as follows: Insurance covering injury to one person $480,000 Insurance covering injury to more than one person, one accident ........:... $960,000 Insurance covering property damage, one accident... $96,000 AIIM'RAKT, PILOTS AXI) MECHANICS The 1929 session of the Nebraska State Legislature gave to the Railway Commission certain jurisdiction over aircraft, and pilots and mechanics operating m this state. This law m substance required that all those engaged m carrying passengers m aircraft should file with the Commission certified copies of their federal aircraft and air ■ pilots licenses. On December 31, 1930, there had' been filed with the Commission certified copies of federal licenses on 71 different aircraft operating m Nebraska. The owners of these aircraft were located m 1 5 towns m Nebraska and four of the owners were from outside the state. Ninety-nine persons had filed certified copies of their federal pilots licenses on December 31, 1930, and 28 had filed copies of their 16 </seg>
            <seg id="p017">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION federal airplane mechanics licenses. The classes of pilots' licenses filed with the Commission were divided is follows: 60 transport pilots' licenses, 12 limited commercial pilots' licenses and 27 private pilots' licenses. r CASKS BEFORE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION IX WHICH THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION REPRESENTS NEBRASKA. 11)30 POULTRY, BUTTER, EGGS, ETC. | Docket Xo. 10750 This docket is pending before the Interstate Commerce Commission.

COMMISSIONER MILLER PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: These formal complaints bring into review the question of refunds of overcharges on certain carload shipments of mixed grain and grain products, moving through the mills of the above named complainants. Pursuant to proper notice, these matters came on for hearing before the Commission on the 17th day of December, 1928, at which 135 </seg>
            <seg id="p144">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT time the complainants and defendant appeared and presented their testimony relative to the questions involved m the complaints.- The complainants contended that the proper basis applicable upon shipments of grain and grain products moving through their mills should be the carload rate applicable upon each commodity contained m the car and that the rates and charges 'previous to October 22, 1925, were assessed and collected by .the defendant on this basis. In support of their contention, complainants took the position that there was a conflict m the various items of C. B. &amp; Q. tariffs 5400 series and 4202-H series; 5400 series carrying the rates applicable on shipments of grain and grain products and 4202-H being the transit tariff gov - erning transit movements. Complainants presented testimony show - ing that on shipments to certain portions of the state mixed carload shipments were permitted at the carload rate applicable upon each commodity m the car, with a provision that where the' weight was less than the minimum weight, the charges for the balance of the weight to make up the minimum weight would be assessed on the lowest rated article contained m the car. Complainants also showed that on mixed shipments of grain and grain products containing alfalfa feed the shippers would be entitled to the carload rate on each com - modity contained m the car. .Complainants also brought out the fact - that on February 1, 1928, the defendant by tariff provision specifically provided for the application of the carload rate on each commodity contained m a mixed carload shipment of grain and grain products and that since that date there have been no controversies with the defendant regarding the proper rates to be assessed on any such shipments. . i . During the course of the hearing, the fact was developed that the defendant had filed application, known as Application No. 7193, dated February 14, 1928, asking authority to waive the collection of under - charges on certain shipments that had moved from the mills of Black Brothers, located at Beatrice, Nebraska. This application covered some of the movements upon which the carrier had originally assessed the individual carload rating on each commodity contained . m. the car and later the auditor of the .Burlington had set the charges up to the basis of the highest rate on any commodity contained m the ship - ment. These charges were protested by Black Brothers with the re - sult that the above mentioned application was filed asking authority to waive the collection of undercharges and to refund the overcharges on the shipments involved, citing as the reason the fact that there was a conflict m the provisions of their tariff 5400 series, as against certain items contained m their tariff 4202-H. On March 15, 1928, the application was granted and the applicant was authorized to waive 136 </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the collection of undercharges on some shipments and to refund the overcharges on others. Mr. J. B. Drlggs, assistant general freight agent of the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad company, defendant, testified a3 to the history surround - ing the transit provisions and why they had been adopted and on cross examination by Mr. Becquet, m connection with one question, made the following statement: "Well I am not familiar with the t -ansactions Mr. Ross cited. (Application No. 7193 for authority to waive collection of under - charges as mentioned above). After we had applied to this Com - mission for authority to reparate, and that authority has been granted and we have reparated on transactions exactly similar to these, I would say there was no reason why reparation should not be granted on these other cases. I don't understand how we could on one breath say; we waiit to reparate and m the next say, we don't want to." Note: Quotation m parenthesis ours. • And as a concluding statement, Mr. Drijgs stated— "Let the record show that the case is continued for thirty days m order to investigate the records and present additional testimony if. necessary. After thirty days it not adjusted prop - erly they can submit their briefs and Have thirty days from that time for filing briefs." In connection with the last statement by Mr. Drlggs, a representa - tive of the defendant Mr. W. E. Blowney. from the general offices at Omaha, called upon the Commission and dent over its records very carefully. From our flies Mr. Blowney learned that Mr. Holzbach, " general auditor of the Burlington, had made' refunds to Black Brothers j of Beatrice, Nebraska, and the Crete Mills of Crete, Nebraska, on cer - tain shipments that involved the same questions that had caused the filing of these formal complaints, and after checking the list of freight bills submitted by the complainants, he agreed to take the matter up with his office and advise them that he could see no logical reason why the refunds should not be made. :■"■■• ■ I - After due consideration, the defendant agreed to check m the proper rates and make the refunds, same; to be handled as direct overcharges. With this condition existing, the complainants were advised that it would not be necessary to! file briefs covering these complaints as the carriers had agreed to make the refund of over - charges. A period of over a year has elapsed and to date the refunds have not as yet been made. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that an order should be entered directing the defendant to make re - funds, on all shipments of grain and grain products moving under 137 </seg>

FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 638 Greeley Community Club, Complainant, v - Continental Telephone Company ana Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, Defendants. OPINION AND FINDING MILLER, Commissioner: A formal complaint was filed by the Greeley Community Club against the service being rendered by the Continental Telephone Com - .pany and the Northwestern Bell Telephone'! Company, on April 15, Hearing was set by this Commission for' September 18, 1929 at Greeley, Nebraska, due notices having been sent to all interested parties. Place of hearing was at Greeley, Nebraska, m order that all concerned m the Greeley territory could be present and put m testimony. ... After the filing of the formal complaint by the Greeley Community Club, the Continental Telephone company and the Northwestern Bel] Telephone company, who serve m that locality, filed answers admitting the poor service and asking for authority to discontinue same pro - posing as a cure -for their poor service, building a new toll line with direct connections between the two towns I affected, Spaldlng and Greeley. After the filing of the two answers and cross-petitions on May 18, 1929, on June 3rd the Greeley Community Club withdrew their complaint and claimed that the services had been restored to a ' satisfactory nature. The evidence develops that subscribers at Spalding are charged an additional monthly charge for district service which includes ser - vice to Greeley and Primrose, the extra cost to these subscribers being as follows: Business 75&lt;( per month; residence 50# per month and 139 </seg>
            <seg id="p148">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT rural 25&lt;? per month. Greeley subscribers at present are . receiving free service to Scotia and Wolbach, m addition to Spalding, at the basic exchange rate, the district service being 'an integral .part of por - tions of their regular exchange service. Their arrangement of dis - trict service was made on account of Greeley being the county seat and no doubt was made years ago. Evidence submitted by the Continental and Northwestern Bell telephone companies shows tratfic studies 'which, are as follows: In the Spalding exchange of 300 regular subscribers, there are only 33 who take advantage of the extra charge, or district service. A four-day peg count study at Spalding showed 65 calls by 16 of its subscribers, and 107 calls by 55 subscribers of the Greeley exchange. The present toll service is rendered m a very roundabout manner, m that they have to go through Fullerton, Silver Creek, Central City and St. Paul, a distance of approximately 166 miles. A 30-day check on the commercial toll service showed 45 calls Spalding to Greeley, and 10 calls Greeley to Spalding. The survey further showed that practically all these non-commercial toll calls over the line m ques - tion were of a social nature. ■ The telephone companies propose building a new toll line, at an estimated cost of about $7,000. The present survey shows an average of 43 calls per day over the free service and less than two calls per day over the toll circuit. The telephone companies estimate that after new toll line was erected, calls would' average 10 to 11 per day. ■ - ■ ■ "::■..•' ' ' The evidence fails to show at present, any complaint from the subscribers, all witnesses for the complainant stressing the tact, at the time of the hearing, that the service had been remedied and at the same time they did not now want it changed. In other words, the service now is of a very satisfactory natuTe. Testimony fails- to show any serious objections on the part of any of the subscribers located on the now connecting line. ■ The Greeley Community Club, as complainants, having dismissed their cause of action immediately after the service had been restored to normal, the case was tried upon the merits of the cross-petitions of the two telephone companies. Testimony does not .disclose any evidence of cost studies or insuffi - ciency of revenues, but it does disclose and offers or proposes that of building a new toll line which would eliminate, free service to Greeley subscribers which Greeley subscribers have enjoyed for years, by pay - ing an extra charge for same. This would eliminate' the free service to Spalding. The Commission must take into consideration that under the pro - posed rates, an estimated toll revenue of 10 calls per day at 15 cents 140 </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION per call, would amount to *45 per month or $540 per year One - fourth of this. must be allocated to traffic expense, leaving approxi- ■ mately |400 per year, which is less than six! per cent on the estimated cost of the toll line, for maintenance and depreciation. There would not be anything left to pay a return on the investment. Taking into consideration the number of calls shown by the traffic survey, there is no doubt but that the estimated number of calls per day is con - siderably high. The fact that the social calls shown by the survey JOBU be eliminated entirely is self evidence that the proposed to,, Hne would not pay a sufficient revenue to properly maintain same. The discontinuance of the present service Would change the district ZTt ™? SPaldi " g&gt; Wh ' Ch W ° Uld r&lt; 4 U ln decreased "™»« at that exchange. This might eventually result m an application for increased rates for the Spalding exchange area.

M. &amp; 0., Missouri Pac, St. J. &amp; G. 1., and Union Pacific Railroad Companies, Defendants. CHAIRMAN CURTISS PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: . Pursuant to notice previously given, this matter came on for hear - ing July 14, 1930, before Chairman Curtiss, at the offices of the Com - mission at Lincoln, Nebraska. Complainant is the Nebraska . Brick and Tile Manufacturing Association, a voluntary association, not or - ganized for profit, existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, with its principal offices and place of business at Lincoln, Nebraska. Members of this association are persons, firms and cor - porations which own and operate manufacturing plants engaged m the production and sale of brick, tile and other clay or shale prod - ucts, such plants being located at Beatrice, Columbus, David City, Endlcott, Hastings, Humboldt, Lincoln, Nebraska City, Seward and York, Nebraska. All of these points are m the eastern and south - eastern part of the state. It- alleges that the present schedule of rates, local and joint, and the rule carrying the list of articles taking brick rates, which will not permit shale or ground clay to move m cars con - taining common brick at the common brick rate, are unjust, unreason - able and excessive, and m violation of the provisions of the Railway Commission Act as amended. The prayer is for. a single scale of rates 146 </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION for single and joint line hauls, for an extension of the scale on com - mon brick for distances beyond 150 miles and for a rule permitting the movement of ground shale and/or clay with carload shipments of common brick, at the common brick rata, with no change In the pres - ent minimums. Briefs, at the request of the Commission, were submitted. j Mr. J. A. Little, on behalf of the complainant, testified as follows: T.hat on October 10, 1921, as a result of an agreement between the carriers, the shippers and the Nebraska 'state Railway Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission ordered m the first of the single line scale of brick rates m this Nebraska-lowa-Kansas territory; that later the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribed a brick scale m the Ballou case, 77 I. C. C. 4, tor single line movements, which somewhat modified the Nebraska scale and at the same time provided for a one cent arbitrary for joint line hauls; that under Resolution No. 80, effective July 16, 1923, (16 Neb. StJ Ry. Com. Report, 404-410) the Nebraska Commission authorized the application of this scale between Nebraska points with a one-cent arbitrary for joint line hauls; that effective June 7, 1926, m the Mason City case, 107 I. C. C. 702, the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribed a brick scale which was the same for both single and joint line hauls and which, m his opinion, was a modification of the Nebraska scale prescribed m I. C. C. Docket 11829 that the bulk of the 1 business m Nebraska now moves under single line rates and that generally the single line rates determine rates to practically all important consuming points m Ne - braska; that there are 71 brick producing and shipping points m Illinois, 40 m lowa, which are fairly well j distributed over the entire state, whereas, m Nebraska there are only 10 producing points lo - cated m one section of the -state; that m his opinion, the location of the plants m Illinois and lowa enables them to reach the main con - suming markets within a radius of 150 miles from any one plant and that that was the main reason why the common brick scale was not extended beyond that zone; while, on the other hand, there are a large number of consuming points m Nebraska, which are beyond the 150 mile zone of any plant. Mr. Little also stated that m his opinion, as a matter of classification or rate making principle, there was no ■factor that would justify the 80% provision on common brick up to 150 miles and. a higher scale for hauls beyond that distance. In support of that position, Mr. Little referred to the coarse grain rates which are, generally speaking, 90% of the wheat rates and that this relationship is constant throughout the territory and not arbitrarily cut off with respect to the principal producing territory. Mr. Little also showed that ground shale or ground clay is now included m the list of articles taking the brick rates when moving on the regular 147 </seg>
            <seg id="p156">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT . brick scale, but that ground shale or ground clay is not permitted to take the common brick rates, yet the common brick represents a manufactured product from this clay or shale; that the ground shale or clay proposed to be moved with the common brick is used lor the purpose of preparing the mortar and to some extent is a substitute tor lime. Witness also submitted numerous exhibits showing rate com - parisons. Mr. H. E. Fail-child, on behalf of complainant, testified that he is a manufacturer and shipper of clay products with a plant at Endicott; that he produces ground shale or clay. Witness testified as to the moTement of this clay by truck; that on movements of brick he has never filed any damage claims; that the competition between the brick, cement and sand producers is very keen; that sand and gravel can be moved on rates lower than brick; that the producers of sand, m particular, have a very small investment, as compared with the brick producer; that brick plants are being dismantled all over the state; that there are now about 10 plants m operation; whereas ten years ago there were 30 plants operating; that he ships some brick into the western part of the state and would be able to move com - mon brick into that section m competition with sand and cement it the common brick scale were extended. Mr. Robert L. Ferguson, on behalf of the complainant, offered the following testimony: He is a manufacturer and shipper of all kinds of bricks; also manufactureres and ships ground shale or clay, that this ground shale or clay is really an unfinished product with com - mon brick as one of the finished products; that the brick business has been falling off since the war; that a number of plants have dis - continued their operations m the last ten years; that cement and sand is his worst competition; that cost of production is one of the controlling factors m determining whether or not cement and sand will be used m preference to brick; that he has filed no -damage claims m a good many years; that brick does not damage the rolling equip - ment like sand, where, for instance, a clam shell is used to unload it; that he is m competition with brick and tile producing plants m other states. Mr. J. H. Johnson, manager of the Western Brick &amp; Supply com - pany, testified that he handles clay products both wholesale and re - tail; that his company owns and operates plants at Nebraska City and Hastings; that he has some competition on common brick and considerable competition on face brick from points outside of the state; that competition is quite keen between clay products, on the one hand, and concrete, cement, sand, lumber and' steel, on the other; that he moves considerable quantity. of common brick beyond the 150 148 </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION mile zone; that, m his opinion, a reduction of the common brick rates beyond the 150 mile zone, would be passed on to the consumer on account of the competition of cheaper competing materials, such as sand and gravel, which commodities are available at a low freight rate, one reason being because of their proximity to a point of destin - ation. Mr. A. W. Bushboom testified that he is a manufacturer of brick and is m close competition with manufacturers of other low grade commodities and is also shut out of considerable business by reason of the fact that on a large number of shipments he is forced to pay the one cent arbitrary for a two line haul; that he shipped out about 200 cars m 1929; that m his opinion, the reduction m the common brick scale would enlarge his territory. Mr. J. W. Lanning, sales manager for the Yankee Hill Brick com - pany agrees with the testimony offered by previous witnesses. Testi - fied that m 1913 and 1914 there were 50 plants operating m this state; that a number ot the plants now 1 operating make practically nothing but common brick, which, -in his opinion, is a very desirable form of building material; that extension': of the common brick scale would enable his company to reach out to a more distant territory m competition with other building materials. All of the witnesses, on behalf of the complainant, indicated that the movement of common brick would be increased if the common brick scale were extended beyond the 150 mile zone; that it would enable them to meet competition with the producers of sand, gravel cement and other building materials; that a reduction m this scale would be of direct benefit to the consumer! Mr. G. A. Hoffelder, assistant general freight agent of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., m charge of the commerce section of the traffic de - partment, testified on behalf of all Nebraska carriers. Mr. Hoffelder gave a brief history of the brick rate adjustment, both as to Nebraska and as to interstate traffic. He said that when the common brick scale was applied on interstate traffic, the carrier filed an application with the Nebraska Commission to apply the same adjustment on Ne - braska traffic m order that uniformity might be obtained on both state and interstate traffic. Mr. Hoffelder 1 also testified that he knew of no cases before the Interstate Commence Commission where the extension of the common brick scale was being sought; that the brick people generally, guarded the 80% basis Very carefully for fear that it might be wiped out entirely and the old basis re-established; that the paving brick manufacturers have sougjit to obtain this 80% scale for the movement of paving brick, giving as their reasons for the re - quested changes, the fact that the, sand and gravel producers were ■ ■ ■■ • ■ i 149 </seg>
            <seg id="p158">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT making in-roads into their business and that this competition was very keen. Mr. Hoffelder also offered a good many rate comparisons . together with tabulations showing the number of cars of various ' kinds of brick moving for certain periods, which comparisons tend to show that more cars of common brick moved m 1929 than m 1928; he also gave a careful analysis of the cement scale situation. Mr. Hoffelder indicated that the Nebraska lines had no objections to the application of the Mason City scale m its entirety for Nebraska but that it was not fair to take that scale as a maximum and where the present Nebraska scale was lower to apply the Nebraska scale; con - ceded that as a general rule rates on raw materials should not exceed the rates on a finished product made from that raw material; that he knew of no transportation conditions that would indicate that the line on common brick should be drawn at 150 miles. Mr. J. E. Plansburg, on behalf of the Chicago and North Western Railway company and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company, introduced some exhibits and testified along the same Hne and agreed with Mr. Hoffeldev respecting his testimony. Was willing to apply the Mason City scale both as to single and Joint line application on Nebraska intrastate traffic; knew of no trans - portation conditions that would justify or indicate that the zone for the common brick scale should be limited to 150 miles. Mr. Charles Frankenburger, on behalf of the Union Pacific Rail - road company, adopted the testimony of both Mr. Hoffelder and Mr. Flansburg. He also submitted rate comparisons and statements show - ing brick shipments. Mr. Frankenburger knew of no traffic condi - tions that would Indicate that the common brick scale should be stop - ped at 150 miles. . ..'.-•'■. .. ■ Mr. R. O. Youngerman, representing the Mason Brick &amp; Tile com - pany, intervenor, made a short statement relative to this case. It was his thought that the complainants should go before the Interstate Commerce Commission m order to secure whatever level they were seeking. He was considerably disturbed by the thought that any action taken by this Commission might develop into a "Shreveport" case, or m other words, that Nebraska might become involved m a thirteen section controversy. Witness testified that he had no objec - tions to the common brick scale being extended beyond 150 miles; that the present scale applicable on interstate traffic, both as to brick and common brick, is too high; that if the complainants m this case would go to the Interstate Commerce Commission his company would be willing to help m trying to secure a reduction m this scale, which, In his opinion, if it were reduced, would increase their business. He. Is not m favor of having ground clay and/or shale placed m the com- 150 </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION mon brick list for fear that paving brick, If or instance, might m some manner also be placed m that common brick list. Mr. Youngerman did not indicate that the existing Nebraska rates, which are somewhat lower than the interstate scale tor distances up to 100 miles, had caused any undue preference of Nebraska shippers or undue prejudice to the Mason City Brick and Tile company. In spite of this position, Mr. Youngerman, on cross examination stated that if the complainants had gone before the Interstate Commerce Commission and asked to have this scale extended on movements within Nebraska that the com - plaint would have been given no consideration by that body due to the fact that the complainant was not m the proper court. CONCLUSIONS In addition to the synopsis of testimony set forth above, the rec - ord contains much other testimony, as well as exhibits, referring to various phases of this case, which will not be referred to directly m connection with this order. The testimony and exhibits contained m this record, have been given careful consideration and the fol - lowing conclusions have been reached, namely: I. That the common brick scale, based on the 80% of the regular brick scale, should be extended beyond 150 mile zone to take m any shipment or movement of common brick within the state of Nebraska With brick manufacturing plants restricted to eastern Nebraska, ii Is a fact that movements of common brick to western parts ol the state would require a movement m excess of 150 miles. Hastings now marks the western boundary of the (industry within the state lhere appears to be no transportation conditions within the state that would justify the stopping of this common brick scale at 150 miles. In connection with this conclusion, we wish to refer briefly to a decision of the Interstate Commerce! Commission, entered m I &amp; S Docket No.- 1885. 155 1. C. C. 730. page 736, wherein the Com - mission said, m connection with the Mason City Brick &amp; Tile com - pany v. Director General, 107 I. C. C. 702: ' on J' In thls case&gt; however . it should be remembered that the 80% rates were limited to distances of 150 miles and less m central and western trunk line territory solely because the rec - rwp* IT™ ! n- the general brick case and m tne Mason city Brick and Tile Company v.. Director General, supra, reveal no In I. C. C. Docket No. 22806, 168 I. C. C. 270, the Interstate Com - merce Commission prescribed a common! brick scale on the 80% relationship for interstate movements from Weldon, North Carolina 151 </seg>
            <seg id="p160">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT to points m Virginia on the basis of the scale set forth m I. &amp; S Docket No. 1885. In the case just mentioned, it is interesting to note that the Inter - state Commerce Commission found that the present rates on common brick, which moved on the regular brick scale, on interstate traffic, were unreasonable and ordered a reduction m the interstate rates down to the basis of the scale of rates applicable on Virginia intra - state trafiic. The Nebraska Commission also said, m Resolution No. 80, supra, — ■ ■ ! i -. "The Nebraska- Commission has been and is now of the opin - ion that freight rates oh the higher grade expensive brick and hollow building tile should be higher than on common brick. Failure to preserve a spread ignores one of the original factors m the making of rates." 11. That ground clay and/or shale should be permitted to move m mixed carloads with common brick at the common brick rates. The present rule provfdes for the movement of this low grade ground clay or shale m mixed carloads with brick and other higher rated commodities^ and m view of the fact that it is an unfinished product, we can see no logical reason why, as an unfinished product, it should not move m mixed carloads with a finished product, whether that finished product be a low grade commodity, such as common brick, or a high grade commodity, such as face brick. That the request of the complainant for a scale applying on single and joint line hauls, whereby it is proposed to take the lowest rates indicated by two or three scales and apply those lower rates on intra - state traffic, is not justified. In other words, we are of the opinion and so find that the complainants have not justified their request for the elimination of the. one cent arbitrary on joint ! hauls or the re - vision of the present scale and that the prayer of the complainant, in - sofar as it relates to this proposed scale of rates should' be denied. OUDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Rail-way Commission that the Chicago and North Western Railway company, Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad company, Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway company, Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation m Nebraska, St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway com- 152 </seg>

Complainant is the Platte Sand &amp; Gravel company, a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, with offices at Fre - mont, Nebraska, and operating a sand and gravel pit at Manska, Ne - braska, a point located on the rails of the; C.

R. to Omaha, Nebraska, for ultimate delivery to the County Commissioners of Douglas County on the Omaha Country Club siding at Deßolt Place, a point located m the sub - urbs of the city of Omaha and within the switching district of that city; that on some of the shipments complainant actually paid freight Charges based on a rate of 5% cents per 100 pounds and that on the ■\■ ■ ■ 153 </seg>
            <seg id="p162">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT balance of the shipments, which moved on a 3-cent rate, the defendant is now seeking additional payment on the 5%-cent basis; that the freight charges and freight rates so assessed, collected and exacted by the defendant are unjust, unreasonable and extortionate being m excess of the rates and charges lawfully established and m effect with prior approval of the Nebraska State Railway Commission; that at the time shipments moved defendant has established and was main - taining a freight rate of three cents per 100 pounds, carload, on sand and gravel from Manska to Omaha, Nebraska. Complainant prays that reparation equivalent to the differences between the charges originally paid and what they would be under the three-cent rate, be awarded. Briefs and reply briefs have been submitted. In support of their position,. the complainant relies upon the fol - lowing facts: that at the time the shipments moved there was m effect a rate of three cents per 100 pounds on sand and gravel from the pit of the Platte Sand &amp; Gravel company at Manska, Nebraska, to Omaha, Nebraska, as shown m C. B. &amp; Q. tariff GFO 11677-Z or reissues thereof, by reason of the fact that the above named point is intermediate between Fremont and Omaha; Fremont having a three cent rate; that on movements to connecting lines at Omaha, the switching tariff of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. provides for the absorption of connecting line switching charges when the freight charges amount to $18.60 or more per car; if the total charge is not sufficient to per - mit the absorption of all of the connecting line switching charge, the difference between the amount absorbed and the actual switching charge assessed will be passed back to the shipper. In no instance must the net revenue to the inbound carrier be less than $18.50 per car; that the shipments m question moved to a point on the C. &amp; N. W. railway near and Intermediate to the Omaha Country Club. (De- Bolt Place) ; that the switching tariff of the C. &amp;N. W. Ry. Co. In - dicates that the Omaha Country Club (shown m parenthesis as Deßolt Place) is m the fourth district of the Omaha switching limit; that a charge of $12.00 per car is assessed for the switching movement to that point; that under the long and short haul clause this rate could not be exceeded on shipments to a point intermediate to that location; that as a matter of fact, the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., thru its traffic officers, agreed to protect this $12.00 per car charge on sand and. gravel to the team track located on the Omaha. Country Club track and direct - ly Intermediate to that point; that the track on which the Country Club is located is a main line altho not connected at one end, yet represents main line construction and was actually built and used for main line operation and that no part of the right of way is owned by the Omaha Country Club. The record indicates that no part of 154 </seg>
            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION this right ot way was ever legally abandoned or sold; that on July 8 1930, the Nebraska lines, thru P.

W. railway switching charges on tnrfflc; to this point and other points located m the same district to $4 95 per car, charging that the present switching rates shown m that district were exorbitant. Complainant also showed that other points such as Ralston on the C. B. &amp; Q. R. 8 .l and Seymour Park on M.P R.

            <seg id="p164">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT CONCLUSIONS Based on the evidence of record m this case, we are of the opin - ion that the only question involved is a matter of tariff interpretation. The position of the defendant that the charges authorized m the switching arrangement at Deßolt Place and the Omaha Country Club are not legally m effect and binding on them by reason of the fact that defendant was not notified as to the contemplated change by the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., is unsound. It has never been the policy of this Commission to notify other carriers as to changes proposed by one line, nor, if we understand their position, do the carriers at this time desire to have the Commission advise the defendant, for instance, concerning changes requested by other roads; that is, as a general rule. For years the general freight agent of the .C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., the defendant, has acted as chairman for all Nebraska lines relating to matters before this Commission and should be m a position to know what is going on with irelation to rate .changes as well as other matters, involving traffic arrangements of various lines In Nebraska. The tariff carrying the switching rates of the C. &amp;N. W. Ry. Co., to the Omaha Country Club (Deßolt Place) has been m effect for a number of years and defendant takes the position that under their tariffs they would have to absorb the $12.00 per car switching charge on shipments consigned to the Omaha Country Club (Deßolt Place), a point located beyond Deßolt Place proper and yet they insist that joint rates should apply on movements' to Deßolt Place, which would very materially increase the cost of service to the shipper moving traffic to Deßolt Place, as against traffic moving to Omaha Country Club (Deßolt Place). The Omaha Country Club (De- Bolt Place) does not have an industry on the .rails of the C &amp; N. W. Ry. Material for that point must be unloaded on the right of way the same as were the shipments moving m this case. When the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., established the rate to the Omaha Country. Club (Deßolt Place), the defendant did not raise any objection nor claim that they should not be required to absorb the switching charge be - cause they had not been notified as to the change proposed by the C. &amp; N. W. They, apparently, were willing to do this. Now when the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. is -willing to protect this same rate to an unloading point directly intermediate to Omaha Country Club (Deßolt Place) where the same unloading conditions prevail, they object to the ob - sorption ofthis switching charge. We believe that a $12.00 switch - ing charge, which must be absorbed, and especially on a low grade commodity yielding but a small per car revenue to the Inbound car - rier, is unreasonably high. However, we are of the opinion and so find that the tariffs of the carrier clearly provide for a rate of three cents per 100 pounds on sand and gravel to points within the Omaha 156 </seg>

            <seg id="p166">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT service is rendered, praying for necessary orders requiring defendant to provide such service as Is reasonable and necessary. The defendant by its owner and manager filed a general denial as to the complaints m general, and alleges he has done all within his power to furnish good and adequate service to his patrons and that the complaint is based upon personal grievances. Hearing was held at Wolbach, Nebraska, on November 21, 1930, after proper notices to the patrons. There were about seventy-five people present, most of whom were patrons on the rural lines. There had been a sleet storm during the previous thirty-six hours', otherwise it is probable that there would have been many more rural patrons Seven representative rural patrons testified as to the service and physical condition of the telephone property. The testimony of these witnesses disclosed the facts that the physical condition of the rural lines was very poor; that many poles were down and lying on the ground; that most of the batteries were very poor and had not been replaced or tested at the proper time; that many insulators were miss - ing; that some of the lines were at least twenty-eight years old; that they did not remember when any new poles had ever been put m; that all rural lines were one wire circuits and m some cases batteries had not been replaced for four years; that on some lines, service was rendered about half of the time;- that service had been better since this complaint was filed. They testified that poor service could be laid In many instances to the instruments; that In one place the wire had been allowed to grow into a tree several inches; that m many cases the patrons could get central, but if central could not for some reason make the desired connection at that time, that the patrons could not get central again within a few minutes and would sometimes have to wait for halt an hour. One witness testified that m one place poles had been down for two years. Another witness testified that he had been a subscriber for six years, and when he went m to complain to the manager about the service, that he was insulted and finally choked and kicked out of the office, even though his rent was paid up to January 1, 1931, but, that he was receiving better service since that argument. This witness further testified that he had observed the setting of poles, and m his opinion said poles were not set deep enough; that they were only set about the same depth as ordinary fence posts; that many insulators were not on the pins and the wire had too much slack. Another witness who had been a subscriber for three years testified that three poles had been down all summer and that the wire was strung on fence posts, but that service had been slightly better since the filing of this complaint. Another witness 158 </seg>

This witness testified that he 1 had been working for this company for four years and his previous 'experience had been with the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company as lineman and manager of small exchanges; that he was qualified | and competent to handle all ordinary work necessary to be performed at an exchange of this size; that he knew the proper method of construction for rural lines and city lines m a town the size of Wolbach; that he knew the proper method of testing, and repairing instruments and central office equip - ment, and m general appeared to be a very competent mechanic and knew how to keep a plant ot this size In workable condition. . ■ ■'" • 159 </seg>
            <seg id="p168">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT This witness however, on cross examination testified that on a grounded line, the touching of the wire to trees and posts, and the fact that insulators were missing, would have no appreciable effect on the service; that farmers would not give permission for tree trimming, which was the reason why the trees had not been trimmed; that the poles on rural grounded lines should be not over two hundred feet apart, with twenty loot poles set three- feet deep and sixteen foot poles set from two to two and a halt feet deep; that he had rebuilt a stub line and tested the line, but not the instrument, at the home of the patron who had continually, complained about the service; that there were thirty-one rural lines but that it was not the practice of the company to make periodical tests on any of these lines and m fact they never tested them except upon complaint; that it was his opin - ion that one competent lineman could take care of this property. He further testified that there were very few complaints from the - town subscribers; that it he could have the time to reset poles and put insulators m place (m other words, rebuild the lines), that good service could be given; that the reason for rural, patrons being de - layed m getting central the second time was that on a rural line, m order to get central, the line must be clear, and m most cases when a patron wants the central office, the line is usually cleared by other rural patrons, but if for some good reason the central could not get the desired connection, such as that number being busy, the original patron would hang up for a few minutes and- then re-call central,, but when he again tried to get central, he could not do so because there would be one or more of the patrons on his own line with their receiv - ers off the hooks "listening m", and that therefore central could not be reached until these "listeners" again hung up. He stated that liis experience over many years with these rural lines was that there was practically always one or more "listeners" to these conversations, and it always took considerable time to again clear the line for calls to the central office. The manager, Ole Christensen, appeared as. a witness and denied there was much ground for complaint, but admitted that he would rebuild the lines and put the entire plant m first-class condition, but could not do so because he did not have the money, stating further that he had loaned considerable money to the company. He testified that there was due from customers over $2800.00, part of which was for toll services. He admitted that the financial condition was. due to his own neglect and failure to adopt modern accounting practices and good business management. The manager testified (hat monthly reports to this Commission had not been filed since March, 1930. 160 </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION CONCLUSIONS I ■ . ■ ■■ r ■'. ■;,•■' The testimony clearly shows that the I physical condition of the property Is very poor; that all lines must: be rebuilt and a different system of management installed. It is admitted that If the subscribers would pay the total amount due that the rural lines could be put m serviceable condition. The testimony of all witnesses, Including both defense witnesses, shows that the personal relations are not very good; that a new system of management is necessary, and that prompt col- " lections of all moneys must be made at orice on order to relieve the chaotic situation. The Commission is of the opinion and | so finds that the physical condition of the telephone property is not good and proper telephone service is impossible; that the present relations between rural patrons and the management is poor, due principally to the fact that the management has allowed the patrons to pay when they pleased; that the rural lines must be rebuilt and reconditioned; that the rules and regulations of this Commission with reference to proper annual and monthly reports have not been followed; that the gross and net rate rules should be established, and prompt payments of all bills be en - forced; and that an emergency exists.

CHAIRMAN CURTISS PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on for hearing before Chairman Curtiss, August 13, 1930, on the formal complaint of the Omaha Ice and Cold Storage Company and M. L. Rawlings Ice Company, against the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Company, attacking the published rate of nine cents per 100 pounds on ice, carloads, moving from Wymore to' Omaha, and asking that a rate of $1.08 per ton be established and that reparation be awarded on shipments that have moved. ■ 162 </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION. Mr: Rueth, on behalf ot the complainants, testified as to the ice business and conditions surrounding the handling of the commodity, as well as the acute shortage of ice at Omaha and the necessity of going outside of Omaha m order to fill ice orders for the various packers. Mr. Humpert, testified as to the ice conditions existing at Omaha. Mr. Humpert introduced exhibits showing that the rate on ice, car - loads, was, prior to April 1, 1930, six and one-half cents per 100 pounds, and that after April 1, 1930, the published rate was nine cents per 100 pounds. Mr. Smith testified as. to . rates on ice from Wymore to various destinations and also indicated the distances from Wymore to those various points. Various witnesses testified as to the number of cars shipped from Wymore to Omaha, also as to the number of cars ordered that could not be shipped. Mr. Driggs, assistant general freight agent of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., testified as to the reason for making certain ice rates referred to by Mr. Smith. He also gave as his reason i for the advancement ot the Wymore-Omaha. rate from' six and pne-half cents to nine cents per 100 pounds, our Application No. 789 G. "(22 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Report 399-403.) There is also a considerable amount of testimony as to production of ice at various points, the cost ot ice at Wymore, who the purchasers and sellers of the Wymore ice are, why certain parties desired to purchase the ice, .who. was to eventually pay for the ice, as well as the freight charges thereon, and other things relating to certain con - tracts. In our opinion, these economic questions are not involved. The question before us is what is the present legal rate on ice from Wymore to Omaha and. what would be a reasonable rate for future movements and whether or not shippers are entitled to reparation. CONCLUSIONS From th" evidence submitted, we are of; the opinion and so find that our order entered m Application No. 7896, supra, specifically prohibited the changing of any. commodity rate on ice between ice producing points and live stock packing plants. 1 We further find that Wymore is ah ice producing point and that there are packing house plants located at Omaha.

L. Rawlings Ice company, a wholesale and retail dealer m natural and artificial ice against the C. B. &amp; Q. r. r. company. The complainant attacks the seven cent rate now charged on car - load shipments of ice from Wymore to Lincoln, and takes the position that the 5-cent rate established m Formal! Complaint No. 527 de - cided July 11, 1925, (18 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Report, 169-174) has never been set aside by this Commission and that that rate is the only legal rate m effect.

            <seg id="p174">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL.. REPORT CONCLUSIONS 1. That the order entered m Application No. 7896, supra, was tor the purpose of establishing a distance scale of rates on ice when there was only an occasional movement involved and where the movement was not between ice-producing points and live stock packing plants. 2. That the rates established m Formal Complaint No. 612 and 527 were not involved m Application No. 7896— (a) By reason of the fact that complainants m these two formal complaints were not notified of the hearing on Application No. 7896; (b) That by order entered m Supplement B to the original order, we specifically stated that rates provided m our order m Formal Complaint No. 612 were not to be cancelled by Application No, 7896.

We further find that refund of the overcharges should be made on shipments that have moved since the defendant made the changes m the tariffs by publishing the rate of seven cents per 100 pounds, such refunds to be made on the basis of the five cent per 100 pound i rate.

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: This action originates upon application j of the Gothenburg Light &amp; Power company, for authority to publish, and collect a revised , schedule of charges from water users, the charge proposed being '. $1.50 per acre, the service furnished therefor to include mainten - ance of all laterals. The present rate schedule is as follows: (Quot - ing from application) ■ . "A— Land that can be and is watered from such point on the ditch that no laterals need to be cleaned by the water user, shall pay $1.00 per acre. '■■■■'■' I "B- — Land taking water from laterals that must be cleaned by the water user, shall pay 85$ per acre." ' Extra water, when available, has been sold at $2.00 per acre. 167 </seg>
            <seg id="p176">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT The application is prompted by the fact that this Commission m its order m Formal Complaint No. 605, entered under date of- April IG, 1929, (22 Neb. St. Ry. Co. Report, 158-175) required applicant, under certain prescribed conditions, to serve certain additional water users, m the main, located on the lower end of the canal, it being found therein that such users were within the appropriation and entitled toithe service they demanded under the company's common carrier obligations. Most of these new users had formerly been users of extra water from season to season. Generally speaking, such new users are now standing on- their legal right, that water shall be de - livered to the land and that the company shall maintain all laterals. Accordingly, this involves a maintenance of laterals, which obligation the company has not formerly assumed under the present rate struc - ture. Mr. Jaquet, manager, stated that applicant was entirely willing to continue under the present, schedule of rates, viz: 85£ .and $1.00 per acre, if maintenance of the laterals by the company was not nec - essary. Hearing upon the .application was held at Cozad,. December 12, 1929. In addition to its irrigation facilities, applicant operates a light and power plant at Gothenburg, serving Gothenburg and vicinity with electric current. Current is generated by water power and oil engine plant. The record indicates that the irrigation properties were construct - ed over a six or seven year period, beginning m 1895. Some of the work was done by the company and some by the farmers themselves, working under the supervision of company engineers. There is some conflict m the testimony respecting whether the farmers were paid by the company for the work they performed. For the purposes of this case, that is unimportant. The company furnishing irrigation ser - vice was known as the Gothenburg Irrigation" company. The power company was known as Gothenburg Light &amp; Power company. From the time of construction until 1913, it appears that mainten - ance of all irrigation facilities was a responsibility of the company. In 1913 an action was brought m the district court of Dawson county, by certain of the water users, complaining of the unsatisfactory con - dition of the canal, ditches and laterals, and praying that an order be entered requiring that the same be placed m serviceable condition. The decree of the court required first, that Gothenburg Irrigation com - pany and Gothenburg Light &amp; Power company, "be consolidated and operated as one individual company"; second, that, "it is m the inter - est of both plaintiffs and' defendants that the laterals mentioned m the pleadings from the section next to the main canal, should be main- 168 </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY I COMMISSION tamed by the plaintiffs who take water for; irrigation purposes from said lateral, but that m so doing, there should be a reduction to such of the plaintiffs as are hereby required to maintain said laterals, m the anual maintenance fee"; third, applicant company was ordered to- make certain major repairs on the main canal and ditches. The^ rates prescribed by the court at that time are the rates which are now m effect, and have been set forth. above. This arrangement respecting the maintenance of laterals by the water i users, under the rate prescribed by the court m 1913, has beenl m effect from that date until now. The irrigation system consists first of a main canal leading from the Platte river to Lake Helen. This canal is approximately ten miles long and carries water used for both irrigation and power, it is nec - essary for both irrigation and power, that the company may get the proper fall for power, and that the waterj may be high enough to irrigate the lands served to the east ot Lake Helen. Applicant pointed out that the water normally is approximately forty-five feet higher at Lake Helen than at the river a mile south of the point where the water enters the lake. The capacity of the canal is four hundred second feet, but this is to be enlarged to four hundred and fifty second feet. Witness Jaqu.et testified that the enlargement of the canal is necessary that applicant may properly serve new water users, as re - quired by Commission order above referred to. ;'■'■.'■■: - I ' The water is diverted into the canal about a mile and a half out m the river at a point about six miles southwest of the village of Brady Island. There is no irrigation between the; river and Lake Helen. The main ditch extends approximately twenty miles m an easterly direction from Lake Helen, arid empties into Buffalo Creek. There are twenty-four main . laterals. Following the completion ot the^ nec - essary laterals to serve its water users, the testimony indicates there will be about eighty to ninety. miles of main laterals. In addition to the main canal and main ditch, the company has m the past been re - sponsible for construction and maintenance of the necessary head - gates, checks, division boxes, bridges, measuring devices and such other similar facilities necessary to the furnishing of this service. Applicant has recently replaced some of these structures with now, well constructed, and modern devices. ■.■. . • ■ Applicant, m its Exhibit "A", sets forth' a summary of its irriga - tion revenues and expenses by years, for a five year period, covering the years 1925 to 1929, inclusive. The revenues are actual. Expense items m the main are actual, though m instances allocations aa be - tween irrigation and power have been necessary. 169 </seg>

In other words, applicant has taken m during this five year period $1,355 less than actual costs of operat - ing the ditch, giving no consideration to any return upon possible fair value of the properties. Applicant stresses the fact that, under present rate schedules, the revenue for 1930 will be less than the average revenue of the previous five years, m that many of those who have purchased extra water formerly at two dollars per acre, will be regular users m the future at a lesser rate per acre. It is also pointed out that actual expenses will be markedly increased it applicant is required to maintain all, or any portion of. the laterals. Consideration will be given to the principal items of expense. Under the sub-head, Irrigation Ditches, the major item of expense m each of the five years is Operation and Maintenance. This is an item 170 </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY i COMMISSION carried on the books of the company entirely separate and distinct from power and relates only to the ditchesj east of Lake Helen and involves no estimates or allocations. It has to do with the actual cost of maintaining the ditches, and structures appurtenant thereto. During the five year period this expense has averaged a little more than $4,500 per year. Other expense items 1 under Irrigation Ditches are. relatively unimportant. Any adjustments which might be re - quired would m no wise affect the rate base. ■ • I In connection with Canal and Lake Expense, applicant sets forth m its study, total expenses resulting from operation of the canal and lake. As has been mentioned previously, the canal and lake would Btill.be necessary if either the power' project or the irrigation project were abandoned. Applicant uses water for power about eleven months every year. It uses water for irrigation about six months every year. The maximum amount of water used at any time for power is approximately two hundred five second feet. The maximum amount used for irrigation m the past hasl also been approximately two hundred second feet. With the additional water users, it will approach two hundred and fifty second feet. I Prior to 1929, applicant Placed all items of expense which had to do with canal and lake m one account, totaled it, and m allocating it between power and irriga - tion, charged an equal amount to each. In 'the year 1929, applicant attempted a more intelligent allocation, charging to power those items which were distinctly necessary for power alone; to irrigation, those Hems distinctly necessary for irrigation alone, dividing all other ' expense items between power and irrigation.! Attorney Halligan, of counsel for protestants, took the position that canal and lake expense should be prorated to| power and irrigation on a basis of the, relationship between the amount of water carried for power' 0 total Volume o£ water carried! for both irrigation and Attorney Cook, of counsel for applicant, 1 contended that this ex - pense should be allocated on a basis of the 1 maximum requirements made upon the canal, for power and irrigation, i. c., a ratio of 205 which is maximum second feet of water usedifor power, to 250 which is maximum second feet of water used for irrigation. Cross exam - ination of Witness Jaquet, developed the fact that constant main - tenance on the canal is necessary, as witness: (By Attorney Halligan) "Q. Your canal, constructed on a grade of a foot to the mile will scour pretty well, will it not? A. It does not, no. 171 </seg>
            <seg id="p180">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Q. You have to keep machinery there dragging it? A. Yes, through the period pi 10 years, the excavator has spent a little less than two-thirds ot the time on the main canal. Q. At what grade should the ditch have been constructed, so that it would scour? A. Ido not know, but if we would take more fall m the main canal, we couldn't water the lands that we water now. Q. Now, I will ask you if the additional 40 second feet that you want to carry on the canal, through the main canal, would endanger the canal? . . A. It will." (Transcript Record Pages 104 and 105). In answer to a question he also insisted that irrigation was ad - vantaged by having water run m the canal the year around. In this connection he said: "A. Yes, there is quite a bit of advantage to the canal. to have water run m it as long as possible. In the first place, a canal that is kept wet and soaked with water, will have less seepage, when it is needed, it is kept m good condition. I have found that where water is taken out of a canal or reservoir, and same permitted to dry out thoroughly, there is always more or less trouble, when water is run again. Possibly the greatest benefit is due to the fact that m keep - ing water m the canal all the year around, the rodents, muskrats, gophers, etc., do not drill holes m it that will cause trouble. The main canal goes through a sandy part of the country — very. sandy. If water goes through a hole, it only takes two or three hours to wash out a large section. We found that, as a result of running water all the year, these rodents will make their holes higher m. the bank, rather than getting down towards the bottom, and result is when we do find a gopher hole, it is more easily repaired and causes less damage than if they had gone through clear to the bottom of the ditch. Those- are the two chief ad - vantages of the keeping the water m the canal as long as possible." (Transcript Record Pages 54 and 55). If the Commission is to adopt Counsel Halligan's proposal, respect - ing the division of expense, the ratio would be slightly less than 40% of canal and lake expense charged to irrigation, and si ghtly more than 60% to power. If it adopts the proposal of Counsel Cook, the ratio would be 44% of these expenses charged to power find 56% to irrigation. The Commission concludes that the policy of tne company 172 </seg>
            <seg id="p181">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION used m allocating expenses for 1929, is as equitable as any rule which can be adopted. All expense items relating to canal and lake which are distinctly irrigation, or power, are charged separately to the one or the other. All other expense items which relate to general main - tenance of the canal and lake, are prorated equally as between irriga - tion and power. While certain of company books are kept at St. Louis, and others at Deadwood, and checks m payment of claims issued therefrom, expense vouchers are O. K'd. and allocation made at the Gothenburg office by local officials. ■ . ■ ■ .;■•;.■ The other item of expense is that listed as General Expense. This relates to salaries paid the manager, cashier, stenographers, book - keepers, office expenses including rent, water, heat etc. During the four year period 1925 to 1928,- inclusive,; applicant allocated these expenses to irrigation and power on a basis' of the relationship which the total gross revenue realized from irrigation, and from power, bore to the total gross income from both sources. In 1925, 20.3% of the gross income was irrigation income. In 1926, 24.187&lt;&gt;; m 1927, 21.95%; m 1928, 16.2%. Accordingly, these percentage figures rep - resent the portion of general expense which was allocated to irrigation during these four years. In 1929 these charges were made direct, with the exception of rent. One-fourth of total rent, or $25 per month, was! charged to . • irrigation. All other charges were made on a basis of time actually devoted to irrigation and power, employees noting on work sheets, m a rather detailed manner, the hours of the day devoted to work prop - erly charged to irrigation, and to power. No objection was made on behalf of protestants respecting this expense item, or the method of allocation. Because of the great detail involved, it would appear to the Commission that possibly the basis of allocation followed m the four year period, 1925 to 1928, would be perhaps as equitable and much more practical,. than the practice followed m J929. However, this is a matter of management, and the Commission offers no critic - .'. ism of the method of allocation employed m 1929. Other items cjf expense not discussed heretofore, relate principally to depreciation charges on excavators, automobiles and sand pumps. These charges have been allocated as between irrigation and power, on a basis of the relationship of their actual use m irrigation and power. The company is entitled to list as an operating expense, ' normal depreciation charges on machinery i devoted to the industry. The allocation of these charges seems to be as equitable as is possible. The Commission concludes that the company's experience with re - spect to operating expenses, during this five! year period, is quite in - dicative of what might be anticipated for the future, it operating con- 173 </seg>
            <seg id="p182">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT ditions and maintenance responsibilities were to continue m the future as m the past, but such is not the case. The Commission has required additional water users to be served. This involves enlarge - ment of the main canal and ditches, more substantial structures along the canal and ditches, and ■ additional policing of the entire struc - ture. Certain of the. necessary construction work has already been completed, but additional construction is required. Water rights have been sold at $25 per acre, and all capital charges covering construc - tion work will be provided from the revenue realized from the sale of these rights. However, it is certain that operating expenses would be increased even if applicant were not confronted with the necessity of maintaining at least some laterals— an added task which It has not assumed since 1913. Giving consideration to certain expense Items not involved m past operations, particularly maintenance of laterals for the ! future, ap - plicant sets forth the following additional estimated annual expenses: Emergency construction fund $ 500.00 Emergency legal fund 500.00 Additional superintendence . .....1 i...- 552.00 Additional ditch rider, part time .....: 825.00 Additional pumping at headgates 360.00 Lateral cleaning • . . 30 days with tractor outfit @ 25.00 750.00 40 days, 3 men @ 4.00 per day per man 480.00 Auto, 1500 miles @ .09 per mile i : 135.00 Depreciation tractor outfit :■: '. 700.00 Interest on tractor outfit 490.00 1 team 4 months @ $156.00 per mo. C 24.00 1 man, single handed 5 months @ J104.00 per mo. 520.00 Auto, 5 months @ 20.00 mo. „.........,..[... 100.00 To the total of these items, applicant adds an average annual ex - pense item, based upon the past five years of operation, of ?11, 936. 17, as reflected by figures discussed above, and arrives at ja figure of $18,472.17, which it represents as the probable annual operating ex - pense, with Increased acreage, and contemplating responsibility of maintaining all, or a considerable portion, of the laterals. The above Items will be considered. The Emergency Construction fund is contemplated to cover costs of emergency constriction work, made necessary by unusual storms or other emergency situations not possible to anticipate In advance. It is proposed to accum llalte a fund' 174 </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION around $6,000 for this purpose. While it is termed a construction fund, the major portion of charges against it will no doubt be m the nature of maintenance and depreciation charges. Charges agafrinst this fund would' only be made if emergency construction was necessary. With the permanent structures which applicant is erecting, there is less likelihood of regular charges against the fund being made annually m the future, than m the past. Nevertheless, certain unusual con - struction work will no doubt be necessary from time to time. Charges for water rights contemplate only cost of construction necessary m furnishing service at the time water is demanded. The item seems proper as an operating expense, having m mind the fact that applicant makes no demand for any return upon any value of the properties. It is highly important that applicant be m a position at any moment to make repairs, major or otherwise, that the service rendered may be constant and certain. The item of $500, for Emergency Legal fund, is to cover any legal expenses. Respecting.it Witness Jaquet said: "The next item — emergency legal fund — we have no special fund and if we have some heavy legal expense — I believe there also we should accumulate a fund for troubles which might come up. If we would have a case of a damage suit, as we have had m the past, if we continue trying to fight with other ditches for our rights, we will need a fund. Some years it may amount to quite a bit. Other years, it may be small." Counsel Halligan for respondents, objected to the establishment of such a fund through 'the medium of an annual charge to operating expenses. He contended that this was an item of expense which should be borne by the stockholders. The Commission cannot agree with this conclusion. Legal expenses' have been generally regarded by courts and Commissions as a proper charge against operating ex - penses. In this case, stockholders are receiving, personally, no rev - enue from any source through the operation of this irrigation system. They have made no claim for any return m the past! have received none insofar as the record discloses, and are not now asking for a rate which will allow them a return for the future. The company's operations are important, particularly to the water user. It is rea - sonable to assume that from time to time, m the future, they will be confronted with legal problems, and actions m court which necessitate the employment of capable legal talent. The Commission finds that the estimate is reasonable, and that it is a proper charge against op - erating expenses. ' • The item, Additional Superintendence — $552— is occasioned by the fact that m the future applicant will be responsible for getting water to aproximately 2,000 additional acres of land, together with the main- 175 </seg>
            <seg id="p184">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT tenance of certain laterals. The company's estimate appears reason - able. The item, Additional Ditch Rider, part time — $825 — is occasioned I)}' the same circumstances. In the past but one ditch rider has been employed. Respecting this, Witness Jaquet, said: "I feel that we have not given the farmers — that we will not be able to give the water users m the future the service to which they are entitled with just one man. With the area; which he covers he cannot do justice to his work and I expect to add an additional ditch rider during part of the season. I have figured' that that additional ditch rider will cost about $825 per year In - cluding his time and automobile expense." The additional amount appears to be necessary, that the company may put on at least one additional rider for a portion of the year, having m mind the policing which will be necessary, and the territory.', over which it extends. The estimate is found to be reasonable. The item, Additional Pumping at Headgates- — $360 — is occasioned entirely by the necessity for carrying more water m the luture, than m the past, to serve additional users. Respecting this item, Witness Jaquet said: "I said a while ago that we go out into the riv&lt;&gt;r and take water from one and one-half to two miles above the actual point of diversion. To do that we must pump sand dams which are washed out, and must be washed out, when the river rises. Otherwise we would have the same condition that ex sts on some parts of the river where permanent dams are fornifed that are harmful to other people. The more water we run, the more demand for water we have, the earlier, we must go out m the river and pump these sand dams, and 1 have estimated that additional pumping to run the additional 50 or 60 second feet, will be about $360.00." The Commission feels that it should accept the judgment of' the manager m this matter. It is of tremendous importance to the water users that they have water when they want it. The explanation offered seems to justify the estimate. . The remaining items, sub-divided under the head, Lateral Clean - ing, are all the direct result of company maintenance of laterals. Since the company, for the past' seventeen years, has had no respon - sibility m maintenance of laterals, the items are estimates and reflect the management's best judgment as to what its future experience may be. Before discussing these items, it seems proper to discuss applicant's responsibility respecting maintenance of laterals.- As has been in - dicated above, Manager Jaquet indicated a number of times m the 176 </seg>
            <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION record that he was entirely willing to do that which the water users themselves desired, i. c., he was entirely willing to continue his op - eration m the future as m the past, permitting water users to main - tain their own laterals and collect the rate which has been collected during the past seventeen years, or' he was entirely willing to main - tain the laterals under the charge ol $1.50 j per acre, proposed m this application. The farmers themselves are m entire disagreement as to the policy which should be followed. ! Generally speaking, the group which might be termed the old water users, i. c., those who purchased water rights years ago, and have been constant users of the service, desire the present practice continued — prefer to maintain their own laterals and pay the rates for service which have been col - lected since the decree m the Dawson County district court, above referred to. The new water users, i. c., that, group of water users who have been privileged to purchase water rights under order of the Commission m Formal Complaint 605, supra, above referred to, de - sire m the main that applicant shall be [ required to maintain all laterals. A considerable number of water [users appeared m person and offered testimony. Many of those who have been maintaining their own laterals for years insisted that farmers' maintenance was the proper method; that the farmer could do ithis particular task more efficiently and with much more satisfaction ;to himself, than could the Company. - They pointed out that acting under this scheme of things, they have equipped themselves with the necessary machinery to main - tain their own laterals; have had no misunderstandings as between themselves or the- company m the past, and insisted that they should have the privilege of continued maintenance of their own laterals for the future. Others, largely new users of service, insisted that they were not equipped to maintain their laterals, and that a more certain and satisfactory maintenance of the laterals would be had if the com - pany assumed this responsibility. Considerable testimony was offered respecting what is known as the Taylor lateral. It is a long lateral and an. unusually large one. Manager Jaquet i stated that the company would regard it as its obligation to maintain this lateral, exclusive of the cutting of weeds, because of the unusual conditions surround - ing its maintenance, even though the water users might choose main - tenance of laterals on their own part at the present rates. Three briefs have, been filed m this case, each of which gives at - tention to this particular question. Counsel Halligan, representing certain prbtestants — m the main the new i users — insisted that it is the company's obligation to maintain all laterals and that the Com - mission's order should direct company maintainance of all laterals, even though m instances there were farmers on laterals, all of whom on. a particular lateral, desired to maintain their own laterals. Coun - sel Cook, for applicant, concluded that it was legally possible for the 177 </seg>
            <seg id="p186">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT company, and water users, to reach an agreement ■whereby water users might be privileged to maintain their, own laterals at a lesser rate than where the company maintains the laterals. A committee ' rep- . resenting what is known as the Water Users Association, whose mem - bers constitute the group known as the old users, filed a memorandum statement insisting that an arrangement which had been m effect for many years, should not be disturbed and that they should be priv - ileged, m the future, to maintain their own laterals. Section 8418, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, reads as follows: ■ ■ "Irrigation works — repair. Every person managing, owning or controlling any irrigation works for the storage, carriage or diversion of water, except irrigation districts, shall keep its headgates, diversion dams, canals and laterals m reasonable and proper repair for the delivery and diversion of 'water to the ap - propriators under its canal, and the regulation thereof shall , be under the control and direction of the state railway com - mission." Section 8477, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, reads as "State Railway Commission fix rates for water: Irrigation works constructed under the laws of this state are hereby de - clared to be common carriers. The owner or operator of any works for the storage, carriage or diversion of water, except Irrigation districts, shall deliver all water legally appropriated to the parties entitled thereto, at a reasonable rate, to be fixed by the state railway commission." A reading of these sections seems to definitely indicate that where the water user demands, an irrigation company can be' compelled to deliver water to the land and maintain the necessary laterals to do so. The conclusion must be reached that any water user on ditches ot applicant, can legally compel' maintenance of the lateral by appli - cant company. The question which confronts the Commission 1s as to whether it is legally obliged to compel the company to maintain each and every lateral, even though there may be laterals where all ot the farmers served by the particular laterals are able tind willing to maintain their own lateral, at a lesser rate. Counsel Halligan, m his brief, places much stress on the holding of the Supreme Court of Ne - braska m State ex rel Clarke, v. Gering Irrigation District, 109 Neb. 642. The action m that matter involved- the question of whether an irrigation district was obliged to maintain, laterals and deliver water' to the water users at their land, or whether its obligation was merely to maintain the canal and deliver water to the users at the bank ot the canal. The holding of the court was to the effect that it is the ob - ligation of the irrigation district to maintain laterals and deliver water 178 </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY jCOMMISSION to the land where the water users demand it. The court did say, however: ■ ' ■ ' I "Of course land owners may provide their own laterals if they desire, but where there is more than one water user taking water from the same lateral, and any dispute arises between the users, the District Board should regulate the supply as m the case of other users of water". The case is not on all fours with the action before this Commis - sion, m that defendant was an irrigation distirct. Applicant herein is an irrigation company, and Nebraska legislatures m the passage of laws respecting irrigation, have recognized a difference between an irrigation district and an irrigation company. The conclusion is reached, first, that it is the obligation of ap - plicant herein to maintain laterals where demand is made by water users. • It would be a highly impractical thing for the company to be obliged to maintain only portions of laterals, with other portions of the same lateral maintained by water users. Such a situation would only result m confusion, misunderstanding and certain trouble. Ac - cordingly, the Commission m its order will require that the company shall maintain any and all laterals on which there are one or more water users who demand company maintenance of such laterals. However, where there are laterals on which jail p£ the farmers desire to maintain such laterals themselves, the Commission will permit such farmer maintenance under the schedule o£ rates prescribed by the district court of Dawson county. The Commission feels that an ar - . rangement which has existed for seventeen years, should not be dis - turbed at this time. The experience of the company and the water user has been a happy one under this arrangement. Insofar as the Com - mission is advised, a spirit of harmony has prevailed between the water user and the company. Farmers have organized themselves by laterals, and have equipped themselves with i the necessary machinery to maintain such laterals. The Commission: cannot find that it is m violation of any statutory requirements to permit this arrangement to continue m the future. If this were an irrigation company just organized, and the Commission were directing a schedule of rates, it is quite probable that it would require the company to maintain all the laterals. We now return to the question of the justification of the expense, items listed above under the head Lateral Cleaning. Some objection was offered to certain of these items by Engineer Nosky, who ap - peared on behalf of certain protesting water users. He stated that he was thoroughly familiar with the canal and expressed serious doubt as to whether the equipment which the company contemplated pur - chasing was necessary m the maintenance of laterals. He suggested 179 </seg>
            <seg id="p188">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT that it might be more advisable for the company to depend on hiring county tractor, or tractors owned by the farmers served along the laterals. He doubted whether it would be necessary to clean out the laterals each year. Testimony of the farmers respecting the matter of cleaning of the laterals each year, was m conflict. Several of the water users indicated very definitely that m their opinion the laterals should be cleaned out not less than once a year, and that further at - tention during the irrigating season should be given. Other of the water users felt that if the laterals were cleaned out once every two or three years, it would be entirely sufficient. Manager Jaquet m- ; slsted that it the company maintain the laterals it was his purpose to keep them m a condition to give the best of service constantly during the irrigation season. He expressed the thought that they. should be cleaned out once each year and that additional maintenance would be necessary during the year. C. A. Edwards, civil engineer, who was with applicant company for a period of around fourteen , years, respecting the maintenance of laterals, stated: "It takes one good cleaning each season. In years gone ■■ by, we had to use teams entirely and scraper, then we had a ditcher, sable and tractor: "Q. (By Mr. Harper) What is the reason they, need that cleaning each year? A. The rains wash the dirt m from the sides and then there are places where there is a heavy grade and some wash, and a flat grade, and it silts up and those silted places have to be cleaned out and the weeds have to be taken out. Q. In caring for 80 or 90 miles of laterals, as there are on this system, what equipment would you consider necessary? A. Anything that you can start m and keep going steady, and that takes considerable power, and an ordinary farm tractor will not be able to pull a grader heavy enough to clean the laterals. Q. How much of a tractor would you say it would take? A. I would consider GO horsepower tractor sufficient." Mr. Edwards did agree that there were possibly some laterals that would not require cleaning each and every year. The Commission concludes that the question of just what equip - ment and man- power is necessary to maintain the laterals m a high grade condition constantly during irrigation season, is one for the man - agement to determine, so long as it stays within the realm of the reasonableness. A review of company, estimates does not disclose any 180 </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY ;COMMISSION items which appear unreasonable. The Commission is not impressed with the proposal of Engineer Nosky, and; certain ot the farmers that applicant should depend upon the hiring ot equipment either from the county or individual farmers, for the maintenance of these laterals. The work on the laterals must be done during a seasonal period highly restricted. It cannot be done during the months of winter, when the ground is frozen, nor can it be done during the six or seven spring, summer and falls months, when water is demanded m the laterals. It must be crowded into a brief period ot time during a period m the fall and a period m the spring! On those laterals which the company will be required to maintain, j the water users have a right to place complete reliance on the laterals being m the proper condition to furnish water at such time during the irrigation season as there Is a demand for it. The raising of a bountiful crop might easily be dependent upon securing water at|a particular time during the season. Certainly the water user will not accept an explanation from the company that it was unable to rent' the necessary equipment to place the laterals m condition during that limited period when the work could be done. The company is absolutely responsible for get - ting water to the water user. The Commission finds no fault with the proposals which it makes to supply itself with the necessary equip - ment and man power to maintain these laterals m the high grade con - dition which the water user will demand. As has been pointed out above, certain of the items ot expense are of necessity estimates. They represent the management's best judgment as to what its experience will be. Total items of expense are somewhat m excess of $18,000. - The Commission now, turns to the probable revenue which will be realized under the proposed scale of rates, (i. c., $1.50 per acre to water users who demand company maintenance of the laterals- $1 00 per acre to water users who have land that is so located, with respect to the canal, that no laterals need be cleaned; 85&lt;f per acre to water users of land taking water from laterals maintained by the water users themselves. At the close of the. hearing the Commission requested Counsel Halligan and Manager Jaquet to circulate petitions amongst the dif - ferent groups of water users, to determine individual wishes respect - ing the maintenance of laterals. Such solicitation has been made The results reflect a total of 75 water users, representing water rights on 4,954 acres of land, who prefer to maintain laterals themselves - -42 water users, representing water rights on 2,020 acres of land who prefer company maintenance of lateral's; 10 water users rep - resenting water rights on 773 acres signed both petitions, being both 181 </seg>
            <seg id="p190">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT for and against company maintenance; 2 water users, representing 62.5 acres ot land, refused to sign either petition, and 5 water users, representing IGO acres of land were not reached. The Commission holding which provides that applicant shall main - tain the entire lateral, where any one water user desires company maintenance, will vary these totals somewhat, since there are some laterals where water users thereon are m disagreement. This will result m reducing the number of laterals maintained by water users, and increasing the number to be maintained by the company. Inso - far as the Commission can determine from the record, applying this rule, there are approximately 1,295 acres of land served by laterals which will be maintained by water users, and there are approximately 5,600 acres of land served by laterals which will be maintained by the company. The latter figure gives consideration , to the fact that subsequent to the hearing and prior to the 1930 irrigation season, there will undoubtedly be some additional water rights sold, the number being estimated at approximately 200 acres. In addition to these sources of revenue, the company serves cer - tain water users who require no laterals, but take water direct from the main ditch. Since the Commission .is making a distinction be - tween classes of users, it seems that this type of user should pay a rate higher than that paid by the farmer who maintains his own laterals and lesser than that paid by the farmer whose laterals are maintained by the company. The Commission concludes that a charge of $1.25 per acre for this class of users is a fair and reasonable charge. There are approximately 1,314 acres served through, this medium. ■ Furthermore, additional revenue is realized t&gt;y the company from the sale of extra water. It is extremely difficult to estimate the.ap - proximate revenue which will be realized from this source, since its use is entirely dependent upon seasonal rain fall, and the necessity for extra water. Applicant has adopted the rule which provides that under no cirmustances will extra water be sold to others than those holding water rights, and then only to water right holders who have not less than 25% of their irrigable land covered by water rights. Manager Jaquet stated that he regarded it as the obligation of the company to serve water right owners first. If extra water be then avail - able, it would be furnished m accordance with the rule above men - tioned. The Commission offers no objection to this rule. It appears to be the company's definite obligation to serve holders of water rights prior to serving others. The question of what is a reasonable charge for extra water arises. Counsel Halligan insisted that the present charge of $2.00 per acre for extra water is too low. He pointed out that water users are required to purchase a water right at an expense 182 </seg>
            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION of ?25 per acre. If Interest be computed at 6% on this investment, a figure of $1.50 per annum is reached. Applicant then proposed a ' rate of $1.50 per acre per year, making a total of $3.00 per acre per year for regular users. There is merit m this contention. However, having m mind the new rule of the company that extra water will be sold to holders of water rights only, the burden of an Increased rate for this service will fall entirely on these water users who have more than 25% and less than 100% of their irrigable land covered by water rights. It is the Commission's thought that a charge of $2.50 per acre for extra water is reasonable and m line with the other charges which will be authorized herein. Based upon the com - pany's past operations, and having m mind the fact that many former users of extra water have considerable proportions of their land now transferred to water right acreage, the Commission estimates that m the neighborhood of 2,000 acres of land per annum will be served through the medium of extra water. The above figures give consideration to' all sources of revenue Arranging them m tabular form, we find the following: Farmer maintenance of laterals, 1,295 acres @ Ss£ per acre i $ 1,073.75 Company maintenance of laterals, 5,600 acres @ $1.50 per acre 1 8,400.00 Served directly from main ditch, 1,314 acres &lt;g&gt; $1.25 per acre { 1,642.50 Extra water, 2,000 acres @ $2.50 per acre 5,000.00 Total revenue from all sources [ $16,116.25 The above figure of total revenue is predicated upon certain esti - mates which necessarily must be made m order to reach any conclu - sion as to what the approximate gross revenue may be. If we now consider estimated gross revenue m the above amount, with estimated gross operating expenses m! amount of $18,000 per annum, the company falls slightly less than) $2,000 per annum short of realizing actual gross, operating expenses. As has been pointed out above, applicant does not request a rate 1 which will pay anything m the. nature of any return upon fair value of the property. Man - ager Jaquet stated emphatically that all revenue realized from the sale of water rights would be used for the improvement of the ditch, and for that purpose only. He stated that if more revenue was realized from the sale of water rights than was necessary at the mom - ent for the construction of additional ditches and laterals, the same would be held m a suspense account and devoted solely to charges involving construction on the ditch. Under no circumstances, he 183 </seg>

APPLICATION NO. 8049 In the matter of the application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, for authority to provide automatic telephone service at its Seward exchange and to. publish a revised schedule of rates for such service. OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Chairman: This action arises upon application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, requesting authority to establish automatic tele - phone service at its Seward exchange, both rural and city, and to publish and collect a revised schedule of rates for such service. Pursuant to general notices given, hearings were held at Seward, on January 9, 1930, and at the Commission's offices, Lincoln, on March 13, 1930, the appearances being as above noted. Present rates, rates proposed for automatic service, and the num - ber of subscribers using the different classes of service as. of January 1, 1930, are set forth as follows: Present Present Proposed Class of Service No. of Monthly Monthly Stations Rate Rate Business— one party 14G . $3.75 $5 00 Business — two party , 4 nn Business — one party company „ 6 D H Business — one party pay station.. 10 D.

For some time prior to 1912, Seward and territory tributary there - to, was served by two telephone companies, viz: Nebraska Bell and Seward County Telephone companies. In 1912, applicant herein pur - chased the properties of both companies, 'the same being consoli - dated m 1913. Since that time, applicant has served this territory continuously. During this period, city service has been common bat - tery and rural service magneto. As noted aWe, if the request be granted, both city and rural service will be full automatic. The application is not entirely definite respecting the class of automatic service furnished on rural lines. It is the thought of the Commission that when the change to automatic is made, rural lines, m addition to being automatic, should also pro - vide for full selective ringing, i. c., service should be such that only the bell of the rural subscriber called rings.} This is the most mod - ern and up-to-date rural party service now provided m the telephone world. . . Applicant states that the. request is prompted by a number of cir - cumstances. First, it is alleged that the present rates are inadequate and confiscatory. Applicant alleges that over a period of the past ten years, the average earnings have been less than 3%. Accordingly, an application for authority to revise this schedule of rates at this exchange would be necessary, even though the proposal to change to automatic service had not been made at this time. Second, housing facilities of applicant at this exchange are highly unsatisfactory. Present quarters are rented and are undesirably located m up-stajrs rooms. The application contemplates the construction of a modern up-to-date telephone building, desirably located on the main street of the city. Such building will be a splendid addition to the down town district. 187 </seg>
            <seg id="p196">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Respondents m argument insisted that m consideration of what are fair and reasonable rates for applicant, the entire properties of appli - cant should be considered at one time, and rates made therefor, rather than establishing rates for the local exchange as a unit. A number of years ago, applicants proposed such procedure, their purpose being to file an application involving exchange rates at all of their prop - erties. The Commission frowned upon such procedure, and indicated very definitely that the matter could be handled more intelligently if applications, when found necessary, should be filed affecting the local exchange as the unit, rather than the entire properties. The Com - mission is still of that opinion. With telephone properties located throughout the entire south Platte territory m Nebraska, the Com - mission is of the opinion that the determination of what is a fair and reasonable rate can be more intelligently reached and justice more nearly administered, as between the rate payer and the utility, where the problem involves only one exchange. Under those circumstances, the Commission can give detailed consideration to the kind of service rendered and its value to a particular locality. In consideration of the application, two problems arise: First, should the change from common battery to automatic service be authorized and if so, second, what is a fair and reasonable rate for such service. The Commission will discuss first the question of whether applicant should be authorized to provide automatic service at this exchange. With one exception, viz: Waverly exchange which now enjoys full automatic service, secures Lincoln's zone service, and pays the Lincoln schedule of rates, there' is no exchange m Nebraska as small as Seward exchange, which has full automatic service. In determining whether the company should be permitted to make this change at Seward, it seems proper that consideration be given the attitude of the affected subscribers. Prior to the filing of the application, petitions were circulated by applicant among affected sub - scribers, reading as follows: "In order to improve the telephone service, we, the undersigned subscribers of the Seward, Nebraska, exchange, request the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company to change the type of service from common battery to automatic. ■ "A new fireproof central office building will be erected on the north side of Seward street, between Third and Fourth. This building will house the new automatic central office equipment. "When this change m service is made we understand that it will be necessary for you to charge the rates which are listed below and we agree to the payment of these rates: 188 </seg>

            <seg id="p198">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Commission might find fair and reasonable, -were of the opinion that the preponderance of sentiment was favorable to the change. In other words, testimony presented at the hearing is m direct conflict respecting the desires of the subscribers themselves. The Chamber of Commerce of Seward has also given this matter attention from time to time. A number of motions were passed re - specting the same, the final action of the Chamber being reflected by the following motion, which was adopted at a regular meeting held on the evening ol January 14, 19.30: "Moved by J. J. Thomas and seconded by C. T. Joern, that it is the sense of this meeting that we want a new telephone build - ing, equipped with an automatic system; that on the matter of rates, we have confidence that the State Railway- Commission will treat us fairly; that we believe that the automatic equip - ment can be installed and operated as cheaply as the manual control equipment, and that there should not be a higher rate by reason of the automatic equipment. The motion prevailed." These conflicting expressions on the part of interested subscribers make it highly difficult to definitely gauge public opinion. It' seems very apparent that there is a large group of subscribers who are vigor - ously opposed to increased telephone rates and accordingly, are op- . posed to automatic service, if it involves increased rates; furthermore, it is also apparent that there is a large group of subscribers who enthusiastiaclly favor the change to automatic and are willing to pay a rate which this Commission finds fair and reasonable for such service. Under these circumstances, it. seems desirable to give consideration to certain other factors. At the request of respondents, applicant pre - pared a study showing the estimated cost of furnishing common bat - tery service following the construction of a new telephone building at Seward. The study necessarily involved many estimates. The re - sults showed a cost of common battery seryice, per annum, dt ?3, - -755.00 m excess of the cost of automatic service. While some criticism was directed at some of applicant's estimates m this study, by re - spondents, the study does seem to indicate very definitely that there would be no marked difference m the rate base under automatic and common battery service, where either service involved the construction of a new telephone building. As has been pointed out above, the present housing facilities of applicant are unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. No objection was voiced by anyone to the company's proposal to construct a new tele - phone building. Applicant pointed out that if a new building were to be constructed, it would be confronted with the necessity of in - stalling new switchboard equipment whether the service be automatic 190 </seg>

It would be impractical to attempt to move the present switchboard, which has been m service lor many years and restore it to service m a new location, j " ' • ' The standard of service established at this time willno doubt mark the type of service to be rendered at this exchange for a period of many years. Automatic service has passed the experimental stage It has proven itself through actual use m many sections of the United States, and is now being generally established throughout the country It to now regarded as the highest type of telephone service rendered It is speedier, more certain, more secret and m every respect more satisfactory. Having m mind the circumstances and conditions surrounding this application, the Commission concludes that it should not deny the management of this company the opportunity for development at this exchange, as contemplated. It is apparent that there are a large group of subscribers who are demanding the improved service The judgment of the management is that this service should be instituted at this time. The Commission will not arbitrarily interfere with the judgment of the management respecting the type of service which should be furnished, and the wishes of at least a considerable number of the subscribers.

            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION If these figures are approximately correct, and are significant ot the company s average net earnings per annum, the exchange would pay an average return of 6% on the alleged book cost of the property after the conversion to automatic. These figures will be further con- KKIGrCu. s«W^ ° £ EXCHANGE service revenue, m amount of $35,942.11. Is arrived at by multiplying the monthly per subscriber rate proposed by the number ot subscribers m the different clasaes, with one exception. Applicant provides a proposed rate for two party business, such rate not now being available at such exchange. It" is estimated that 36 of the present individual business subscribers will choose the two party service, the proposed rate being but 25* over the present individual business rate. The estimate of total revenue from this source is undoubtedly approximately correct. The item TOLL SERVICE REVENUE, of $3,982.27 Is the equiva - lent of 25% of the estimated total outward toll charges of the ex - change. This estimate gives consideration to a constant increase m the amount of total toll revenue realized from the exchange, the esti - mate of increase being based upon company's past experience m the Z^ ng H ' , N * braska statutes ca "y the provision that the exchange originating the toll call shall receive 15% of the total toll charge the exchange terminating the same shall receive 10%, the remainder of the total charge shall be prorated between the companies owning the toll lines. For the sake of accounting convenience and economy, the above practice has been followed by applicant, the final result being approximately the same as though the statutory allocation were used Respondents object vigorously to this ! allocation to the Seward exchange, contending that the Seward exchange should be credited with a greater amount than 25% of the total. Their objections are m the main made upon two bases, viz: First, that if this revenue were to be allocated on a basis of property investment and cost of service as between exchange and toll, the] amount would be greater than 25 per centum, and again, since Seward is a toll center and supervises calls from a number of the small tributary exchanges, it 25% is proper for the smaller exchange, 1 it is inadequate for the Seward exchange. Respecting the first objection, m a number of Instances, this Commission has required telephone companies appear - ing before it In rate cases, to make most careful separations of ex - change revenue and expenses from toll revenue and expenses pri - marily that it might be determined as to whether 25% credit to the local exchange of total outward toll charges, was proper and fair to the local, exchanges. These studies, of necessity, involve major re - finements and estimates m the separation (if toll and exchange prop - erties, and to the proper allocation of expenses as between toll and 193 </seg>
            <seg id="p202">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT exchange service. The formula used is apparently as accurately worked out as is possible. Such studies were recently made by applicant herein m rate cases involving its Fairbury and Beatrice exchanges. In each of these cases the results of the studies very closely approached the results obtained m using the twenty-five per centum figure. In the supervision of toll calls from tributary exchanges, the Fairbury and Beatrice exchanges are very similar to the Seward exchange. The Com - mission knows ot no peculiar condition at Seward which might make the result at this exchange different from the results at those ex - changes where the studies have been made, nor have respondents pointed to any differences between the Seward exchange and other exchanges. The conclusion is reached that there are no circumstances or conditions at Seward markedly different from exchanges where these studies are made, and that the result at this exchange would be quite similar to the results at other exchanges where the studies have been made. Respondents' second objection goes to the question of toll sup - ervision made at the Seward exchange. Toll calls originating at a number ot smal er adjacent exchanges are handled through the Seward switchboard, and are then passed on to the next toll center. For this reason, it is alleged that percentage allowance proper for the smaller tributary exchange, is inadequate for the Seward exchange. The result of the logic would of course work to the advantage of the Seward exchange, and to the disadvantage of the tributary exchange, unless, perchance, such logic were carried to its ultimate conclusion and the monetary advantage realized by Seward, were lost to the still larger exchange, which not only supervises the calls placed from the tributary exchange, but also those placed from the Seward exchange itself. To be specific, the Lincoln exchange supervises many of the calls which are handled through the Seward exchange. In addition, it handles many calls placed from other toll centers tributary to Lin - coln, other than Seward. It might be argued that for this reason the Lincoln exchange should receive credit for an even larger percentage of toll revenue than the Seward exchange is credited with. Again, other important centers, through which toll calls pass, such as Kansas City or Chicago, supervise and police the calls originating m a wide territory m all directions from those cities, including the Lincoln territory. Again, it might be contended that for this reason, any monetary advantage realized by the Lincoln exchange m the super - vision ot calls tributary to Lincoln, should be passed on to these larger exchanges, m that they supervise an even greater territory than the 194 </seg>

Certainly ho sound reasoning can justify crediting the Seward exchange with so large a proportion of toll revenues as respondents contend for m brief and m argument. Such an allocation would provide for no compensation to other exchanges policing the same calls, giving no consideration to the other costs involved m handling the toll calls, including maintenance of toll properties and ■ return thereon. Studies involving this question have not been made either by the Commission's accounting department or by 1 the accounting depart - ment of telephone companies appearing before this Commission m rate cases. Such studies would be highly involved and of necessity would require complicated estimates. It Is quite probable that the statement made by Counsel Thomas m argument, that it would be absolutely impossible to make intelligent studies which would be of any real value m determining this question lis entirely correct. The Commission believes that if such studies were to be required, the re - rults which might flow from them would not be of sufficient value and importance to m any wise. change the rate base for exchange service. It seems quite apparent that if such studies were to be mado, they could not result m monetary advantage to the Seward exchange. For the purposes of this case, the Commission will adhere to the gen - eral practice heretofore followed by it m all rate cases and will credit the Seward exchange with 25% of total revenue resulting from - originating toll calls. Respecting. MISCELLANEOUS REVENUE m amount of $451.40, applicant gives consideration to revenues realized from this source over a period of years, and reaches this figure. In the main, the •source of the revenue is directory advertising. The item has not varied greatly during the last four years m ithis exchange. The item, LICENSEE REVENUE, is actually an expense item. It represents payment m amount of 1 % % of gross revenue to the Am - erican Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for 'services and benefits re - ceived by applicant under contractual relationship with the A. T. &amp; T. Company. It seems unnecessary to discuss' this item m great drtail at this time, m that it has had careful consideration of the Commis - sion m former rate matters. The con-lupion is reached that the company's estimate of $39, - -788 is undoubtedly as close an estimate of actual revenues which will be realized, per annum, under the proposed j schedule of rates, as it is possible to make.

Its policy to constantly maintain its properties m such condition as to render prompt, efficient service should not be. disturbed. No criticism was directed by respondents to this estimate. The Commission believes it is approximately correct. The expense items of DEPRECIATION }s one recognized by all regulatory bodies and courts. Applicant estimates an annual amount of $8,756.00 necessary. This is the equivalent of 5%% per annum ot book costs of properties after conversion. Since 1919 applicant has followed the policy, generally, of setting up its depreciation reserve on a basis of 6% of the costof all property. Prior to 1919 an amount less than 6% was set up, m that company's revenues were inadequate to permit of a 6% set up. It was stated that 6% represents the management's best judgment as to what ia "a necessary amount to properly maintain an adequate depreciation reserve. However, m this case, 5%% has been used, m that this Commission lias, on a number of occasions recently, refused to recognize the necessity lor a greater amount annually than 5%%. The company's books dis - close the fact that during the period of its ownership of this exchange, i. c., from 1913 to 1929 inclusive, there has been credited to deprecia - tion reserve, a total m amount of $82,504. During that same period, charges have been made against this reserve m amount ot $62,000 plus, leaving a balance to the credit of the reserve of approximately ?20,000. Furthermore, if the change m plant equipment, takes place as proposed, additional immediate charges to the reserve will be made m amount approximating $14,600, leaving only approximately $6,000 credit to the reserve. There is no occasion for entering into an extended discussion of the propriety ot a depreciation reserve fund. This has been fully dis - cussed m recent orders of this Commission, wherein an allowance of approximately 5% % ot the cost of all properties was allowed. The Commission regards the amount which applicant proposes, m this case, as reasonable and proper. '.'■'-.-' 196 </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA. STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION There remains for consideration the item of TRAFFIC, m amount $4, 988.15. It consists largely of wages paid operators. It is noted that the estimate for the future, under automatic operation, is ap - proximately ?5,000 less per annum than under common Battery op - eration. This is due to the reduction m jthe number of operators . made possible by the installation of automatic equipment. It rep - resents the company's best estimate of actual annual wages which will be paid the operators who will be necessary, after the installation of automatic equipment. Respondents pointed to the reduced op - erators pay-roll m Seward as one of the unfortunate incidents m the change from common battery to automatic. However, no criticism was voiced respecting the probable annual j charges to traffic if and when the change is made. Careful consideration which has been given by the Commission to proposed revenues and expenses, following the change to auto - matic, causes the Commission to conclude that the estimates are as exact and accurate as it is possible to make them. There is, of course, no known way to reduce these figures to anything more than esti - mates. The Commission believes that the estimates which have been made, will closely approach the .company's j actual experience under automatic operation. Such being the case, net earnings m amount of $9,639 are available for fair return. Consideration will now be given to the ! fair values of the prop - erties, upon which applicant is entitled to earn. As a guide m reach - ing conclusions respecting this value, the Commission has before it a number of figures, viz: the alleged book cost of properties now m place, the alleged book cost of properties alter conversion to auto - matic, reproduction new less deterioration of present properties as reflected by engineering studies of applicant, and reproduction new less deterioration of properties after conversion to automatic. These will be discussed. ' Applicant's books of account disclose an investment, or book cost, m amount of ?108,282, inclusive of all exchange properties both urban and rural. This figure includes no toll properties, except m so much of central office equipment and office building as should be charged to toll, the use for which is compensated by the credit of toll revenue to the exchange. All poles carrying toll wires, even though carrying exchange wire also, are charged entirely to toll. The above book cost figure had its inception m an &lt;tern of $111,000 plus, at which amount the consolidated properties of the Nebraska Bell and the Seward Telephone companies were placed on the booka of ap - plicant m 1913. The figure apparently was the result of an inventory and appraisal of the properties of the Seward exchange, and as test!-' ■ i ■ 197 </seg>

Immediately, thereafter, un - usual charges for a short period of time were made against deprecia - tion reserve to cover the cost of duplicate properties removed from plant. Applicant's books of account are kept' m accordance with the accounting rules of the Interstate Commerce Commission. There - fore, from 1913 to date, company recqrds undoubtedly reflect actual Applicant also sets forth its estimate of probable book cost after conversion to automatic, this figure being $159,215. This gives con - sideration to additions to property m amount of $87,229 and removals m amount of $3G,296, resulting m net additions to property m amount of $50,923. The principal items involved m additions are buildings, $20,000, which covers the estimated cost' of the new building to be erected m Seward, Central Office Operating Equipment, $32,572, which covers the estimated cost of the automatic switchboard, and Station Apparatus, $21,248, which covers the cost of the new instru- • ments necessary to be installed as a result of change from common battery to automatic. Principal items involved m removals are cen - tral office operating equipment $10,155, which covers the alleged cost of the switchboard to be removed, and Station Apparatus, $15,782, which covers the alleged cost of instruments to be abandoned. In addition to the above figures, and as stated by applicant m corroboration of them only and not that they shall be used as a basis for earnings, apnjicant submits, through its Engineering Department, inventory and appraisal of all units making up the present Seward exchange, showing reproduction new deterioration. This study, made as of February 1, 1929, shows reproduction value new of the physical properties m amount $149,153; alleges them to be m 87% condition, with the resultant reproduction value new less deterioration of $131, - -764. In this figure, applicant's chief engineer adds Working Capital ill amount $C,OOO and Going Concern Value m amount $13,655. Accordingly as of September 1, 1929, it is alleged that the total re - production value new less deterioration of the Seward exchange, is $151,419. Using this inventory and appraisal as a basis for the estimate, and giving consideration to the properties after conversion, to auto - matic, a reproduction value new less deterioration of $202,352 is claimed by applicant. • This Commission has m previous discussions, expressed its dis - approval of the use of what applicant's chief engineer chooses to call Deterioration, as representing what regulatory bodies and courts refer to as Depreciation. This Commission is familar, however, with the 198 </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY (COMMISSION •■'■••••■ well recognized principle m regulation, -which requires that m de - termining fair value, consideration must be given to reproduction new less depreciation. . It has-been held by the Supreme Court ot the United States many times that important consideration must be given by regulatory bodies to reproduction new depreciated, m reaching con - clusions as to fair value, and that failure so to do involves confiscation. In McCardie v. Indianapolis Water Company, 272 U. S. 400, this court said: • I ;/■-■. "Undoubtedly the reasonable cost of a system of water works, well-planned and efficient tor the public service, is good evidence - of its value at the time of construction, and such actual cost will continue fairly well to measure the amount to be attributed to the physical elements of the property, so long as there is no change m the level of applicable prices, And it is true that if the tendency or trend of prices is not definitely upward or downward and it does not appear probable that there will be a substantial change of prices, then the present value ot lands plus the present cost of constructing the plant, less depreciation, if any, is a fair measure ot the value of the physical elements of the property." In a very recent case known as the O'Fallon case, St. Louis &amp; O'Fallon R. R. Co. v. United States, 73 L. Ed. U. S. Rep. (Ad. Sheets) 457, Involving a valuation of certain railroad properties by the Inter - state Commerce Commission,, the Interstate! Commission's fair value figure was set aside by the United States Supreme Court, because con - sideration had not been given to reproduction value new. Respecting the action at hand, it is observed that as reflected by applicant exhibits, additions to property, m amount of $87,000 plua are to be made. Unit costs involved m this figure have been carefully checked by the Commission's Engineering Department and found to be m line with prevailing costs. To this extent, cost and reproduction new, depreciated, becomes one and the same figure. The Commission concludes that no injustice will be done the rate . payers if the alleged book cost figure of $159,000 be taken as a rate basis. Applicant indicated that it was not demanding that reproduc - tion new depreciated be given serious consideration m determining fair value, but that rather, as pointed out above, reproduction new figures were presented as corroborative- of book cost figures. If net earnings m amount of $9,600 be applied to 1 fair return, a return of 6.1 % will be realized on the above named rate base figure of $159,000. Having m mind recent decisions of the courts of the country, this re - turn is conservative. Furthermore, it is predicated upon a rate base value which gives no consideration to reproduction new depreciated; Reference should perhaps be made to so-called free service en - joyed by Seward subscribers.

OPINION' AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner: - .... The Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company have ap - plied to this Commission to discontinue the Angus exchange and serve ■ their subscribers from the Nelson, Davenport, Oak and Edgar Ex - changes, m the following words and language, to wit: "For a number of years our company has operated a small exchange at Angus, Nuckolls County, Nebraska. This exchange has not at any time served more than ninety - five to one hundred subscribers and the expense of operating it has been more than the revenues received. We have furnished the Angus subscribers with grounded magneto service. During the past few months we have found it necessary to rebuild the lines, converting them to metallic service. This greatly increased the cost of operation and as subscribers have expressed a willingness to receive service from the adjoining exchanges, we have cut them over a line at a time until now all of the subscribers formerly served from the Angus Exchange of this Company are now being served from other exchanges. We therefore, respectfully ask that the Commission hear ■ this matter and approve the abandonment of the telephone ex - change at Angus and the furnishing of telephone service from neighboring exchanges." ■ . : ..... - 201 </seg>
            <seg id="p210">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Previous to filing this application with the Commission the man - ager of the Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company had interviewed all of the patrons on the Angus exchange lines and with but few exceptions all of the subscribers were willing to be trans - ferred to the above mentioned exchanges, and without obtaining per - mission from the Commission to discontinue service at this exchange, the manager of the company had gone ahead and cut these subscribers over on to the various exchanges they desired to go on, m place of the Angus exchange. After this had been done, some of the subscribers entered serious objection to the Railway Commission, and the Com- . mission made investigation and found this had been done without the knowledge or consent of the Commission, which under the law is nec - essary before such action can be taken and the Commission at once notified the manager of the company that this action had been illegal, and that if the parties desired they should be put back on the Angus Exchange and application made to the Commission to abandon the exchange and such other action as the Commission found was nec - essary m the premises. As a good many of these subscribers that had been transferred were satisfied with the service they were receiving m lieu of the Angus service, the manager of the company was not able to restore service at the Angus exchange to any considerable extent. On November 21st, the Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company made application to the Commission to do with the author - ity of the Commission just what they had already done without au - thority, and the case was set down for hearing m the court room of the county court house at Nelson, at 10:30 o'clpck A. M., on the 27th day of December, 1929, at which time interested parties had been notified to be present and testify m regard to the matter. Mr. Ivan King of Angus, was one of the leading objectors to the abandonment of the exchange at Angus and was present at the hear - ing and testified m part as follows: That the population of Angus is between 50 and 75, there is one store, the garage and no other busi - ness house m the town; there are two churches and one school house with one teacher and eight grades. Also one elevator and a lumber yard. The town is located on a branch of the Burlington railroad. They have a post office, but no rural deliveries leading out from the town. Angus is located ten miles from Nelson, about seven miles from Edgar, eight or nine miles from Oak and eleven miles from Daven - port. Mr. King further testified that his principal objection was that they had party line phones and the ringing of the bells m his place ot business was somewhat confusing, as he could not keep track of when they were calling him, or someone else on the line, there being 202 </seg>

That he had several engines running which caused considerable noise and he was unable to hear well over the phone. That there was no toll line out of the town and business calls had to be transacted over parity lines, but if they had a toll line and booth they could do their long distance talking and that would be more satisfactory. Mr. Gerlach, a lumber dealer, testified that the telephone service as proposed by the company would be as satisfactory to him, it the company would construct a toll line and install a booth so that con - versation could be private over the toll line. .Mr. Judy, the proprietor of the store, testified that the service was better when the exchange was at Angus, owing to the fact that there was some interference with conversation lover the wires between Nelson and Angus at the present time. That perhaps it was caused by imperfect connections, but he thought that if the lines were put m first class condition they would get better service, and it would not seriously interfere with the transaction of his business. He thought, however, that if the Angus exchange was discontinued, a large number of the subscribers at Angus would have their phones taken out and he would lose the opportunity to phone to them at all. The company produced an exhibit showing that their total in - vestment m the exchange at Angus was $12,002.45. The total revenue for the year with the toll, and miscellaneous revenues added was $1, - -711.24. That the expense of maintaining the exchange was ?2, - -936.75, leaving a deficit of $1,226.51. There were 98 subscribers on the Angus 'exchange previous to the change, and on that basis the company produced an exhibit showing what rates would have to be charged the various classes of service m case the exchange was continued at Angus. The present rates at Angus are business $2.00, residence one party $1.30, farm line $1.25. In case the exchange was continued it would be necessary to charge $5.00 for business, and residence and farm rates of $2.25, if the 98 subscribers would stay on the line, making a revenue to the com - pany of $2,752.80. If the expenses aa shown m Exhibit No. 3 would remain the same, if these rates were charged, there would still be a loss of $138.9 b! It is probable that a good many of the subscribers that had been transferred to other lines would not come ; back on the Angus ex - change, so there would undoubtedly not be over 75 subscribers on that exchange, and with the expense of operation the same as shown m Exhibit No. 3, the loss to the company m maintaining the station at the present rates would be $1,442.18. In order to maintain the • ■ ■ ■ ■ i - 203 </seg>
            <seg id="p212">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT exchange without incurring such a heavy loss, it would be necessary to charge rates that would be unreasonable and practically prohibitive. Service that had been rendered at the Angus exchange was what is commonly known as limited service, that is to say, the hours all told were but 15 hours out of the 24, while at Nelson the service iscon - tinuous for the entire 24 hours, and the other stations offered to the subscribers by the company carry increased hours as well as more efficient service. • . The Nuckolls County Independent' Telephone company have a very complete, and up to date building and exchange apparatus at Nelson, and the Commission has made personal inspection of it and pronounces it one of the finest of its size they have examined m the state. The Commission has no personal knowledge of the condition of the ex - changes at Oak, Davenport and Edgar, but not having received any complaints from the subscribers of those exchanges for service rendered, and having the assurance of the manager of the company that those exchanges are m good condition, and rendering good ser - vice, consider that the subscribers of the Angus line who have been cut over to either one of these exchanges, m accordance with, their wishes, will receive better service than they have been receiving at the Angus exchange and longer hours of service. The service that has been rendered to the subscribers of the Angus exchange has been furnished over a grounded line. The company has rebuilt this line and it is now metallic. This change m construction was necessary owing to the inductive interference from electric trans - mission line m close proximity to the line, or would, be constructed m the near future. The rates proposed to be charged by the com - pany tor service furnished from Nelson and other exchanges on which the patrons of the Angus line would be connected, would be somewhat higher than they had been on the grounded line to Angus, but they would be metallic lines and furnish better and longer hours of service. Owing to the increased investment required to construct and maintain a metallic circuit, the company would be- entitled to charge the sub - scribers the rates prescribed for each of the four 'exchanges to which the former subscribers of the Angus exchange had been or would be transferred. An exchange with only 9S subscribers can not possibly be main - tained without entailing a loss, unless high rates are charged, even though only grounded service is furnished and when the system is changed to metallic, the investment and maintenance is much larger, which makes the loss correspondingly greater. If rates were made high enough to yield a reasonable return, they would be so high that a good many of the present subscribers would either discontinue the 204 </seg>
            <seg id="p213">- NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY ; COMMISSION use of their phones, or make application to be connected to some of the stations that the company proposes to connect them to, which would entail a further loss to the telephone company on that line. Furthermore, it is not fair to subscribers on the lines of the com - pany to charge higher rates on the other exchanges owned by them m order to obtain the money with which to meet the loss entailed by maintaining the smaller exchanges. " &gt;s the most serious objectidn raised by! the subscribers would be lack of adequate toll service, if the Angus exchange was discontinued, the telephone company agreed to construct and maintain a toll line and install a booth, provided a suitable location for the booth could be -obtained. This arrangement m the judgment of the Commission ' would cure this objection.

CHAIRMAN CURTISS PRESIDING OPIXIOX AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein is a Nebraska corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska. It is engaged m the business of owning and operating telephone properties which supply service to the public at several exchanges m this state. Petitioner has applied to this Commission for a permit to change the present telephone equipment for city local exchange service at Columbus from common battery to automatic equipment and to convert the present magneto telephone equipment for rural multi - party line service at Columbus, including Its Duncan exchange, to modern mechanical switching equipment commonly called semi-auto - matic. The net rates proposed for the new service if and when the new equipment has been installed, and the necessary changes m plant and additions have been made are as follows: For Columbus — Individual business $5.50 Two-party business 4.50 Individual residence 3.00 Two-party residence 2.50 Four-party residence 2.00 Rural 2.00 Individual business : $3.00 Individual residence 2.00 10 party, rural, metallic ;.. 2.00 206 </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION As of September 1, 1929, there were 1,705 city business and resi - dence stations at the Columbus exchange and 473 rural subscribers or a total of 2.178. Of this number 94.6 per cent of the business subscribers and 73.7 per cent of the city residence subscribers or an average of 77.8 per cent of the total number of city patrons signed petitions indicating their approval on cards presented to each sub - scriber. The rural subscribers and those on the Duncan portion of the exchange also indicated their approval m the same manner, by a large majority, on the condition that lines would be made full metallic and provided with semi-automatic equipment. Resolution was also presented by the Chamber of Commerce of Columbus, voicing approval of the charges; which applicant proposed for service at the Columbus exchange. Subsequent to the hearing, the original resolution endorsing, m a general ; way, the proposition, was amended to read: "Providing that the State j ßailway Commission finds said rates just and equitable". Attorney C. N. McElfresh appeared at jthe hearing m opposition to the proposal. Three or four witnesses were presented by him, voicing opposition m varying degrees, to j the change to automatic service. Otherwise no one appeared on behalf of subscribers m op - position to the change from present service to automatic. In addi - tion Mr. McElfresh, who has been familiar with the properties for many years, rendered further assistance through the medium of cross - examination of applicant witnesses. . ■ ' "'■■'.■ If this application be granted, Columbus will be the smallest city m the state enjoying automatic telephone service, there being only three other cities m Nebraska which now have this type of service, viz: Omaha. Lincoln and Kearney. Automatic service is recognized as the very latest development m the telephone world. It is regarded as speedier, more certain and all m all more satisfactory. Having m mind the overwhelming demand on the part of the subscribers of the exchanges involved, for this improved service, and the willing - ness of applicant to furnish same, the Commission concludes that applicant should be privileged to render the service which its sub - scribers demand, and will proceed to a determination of what are fair and reasonable rates. ■ The telephone property of the Columbus and Duncan exchanges, the lines of the Duncan exchange being connected with the central office at Columbus, were owned and operated under the same man - agement for many years m the name of the Platte County Independ - ent Telephone company. Certain individuals acquired the common stock of this company m about 1922, changed the management and some six or seven years later, sold the assets of the Platte County 207 </seg>
            <seg id="p216">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT company to the Nebraska Continental Telephone company which has made this application. When the Nebraska Continental Telephone company was organized it acquired the physical property of the Platte County company and twenty additional exchanges which were paid for with the stock of the new company, although some cash was used. The properties were ■ acquired on the basis of an inventory and appraisal as of December 15, 1927, plus additions and betterments to February 28, 1929, in - clusive of construction work m progress. The fixed investment m the company's application for securities shows that the values assigned at that time were $224,130 as the estimated cost new, with accrued depreciation m the amount of $29,070.76. In connection with the authorization of securities a slight adjustment was made m the amount of the fixed investment and the physical property was set up on the books as of September 1, 1929, including additions and better - ments to date, m the amount of $206,828.57 with a depreciation reserve of $26,250.81. The latter is the price on which the physical property was purchased and securities were issued, not including working capital and prepaid operating expenses. It necessarily in - cludes all intangible values such as going concern, as these were in - cluded m the purchase price. In this instance, the appraisal and the book cost being the same, having been made for the purpose of pur - chase and sale, the book cost is an important figure m the determin - ation of value for rate-making purposes to follow, although this is not a cash transaction as payment was made with the stock of the purchasing company. On April 10, 1922, the Commission found the historical cost new of the property of the Platte County Independent Telephone company to be $132,965. The cost new of the property as found by the Com - mission, was used on setting up the accounts of the company m 1922 and a careful record of net additions and betterments was kept as provided under the Commission's rules of accounting, until August 31, 1929, when the hook cost new of the physical property was found to be $174,027.34. 'On September 1, 1929, the books of the Continental Company were opened with the property of the Columbus and Duncan exchanges set up m the amount of- $206,828.57, not including working capital and prepaid operating expenses, or an apparent increase on account ot the appraisal of ' approximately $31,000. The Commission's finding of historical cost with additions and betterments to September 1, 1929, might easily become $206,828.57 on the appraisal basis, by reason of the appreciation m some of the property still m plant, which had been placed m a period of lower price levels. This would also apply to the 208 </seg>
            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION I net additions that were made m the first lew years alter the finding of the Commission, as the prices of telephone materials and equipment including labor have risen quite considerable since 1922, with the ex - ception of the last few years. Therefore,! the old book value as ol August 31, 1929, appears to confirm the appraisal made December 15, 1927, with additions and betterments to September 1, 1929. At the time of the hearing m Columbus, January 21, 1930, ap - plicant presented what it called a "spot appraisal" of the property of the Columbus and Duncan exchanges as of i September 1, 1929, which shows an estimated cost new m the sum of $319,665.47 and the same less depreciation m the amount of $272,019. Excluding working capital and going concern the cost new of the physical property as shown by the spot appraisal is $283,916.46 and less depreciation, m the sum of $236,271. The $283,000 figure is comparable with the $206,828. These figures disclose a wide range of value between the appraisal of December 15, 1927, with additions and betterments to date, and the spot appraisal of September 1, 1929. No decided change In price levels has occurred m this period. JAn appraisal tor purposes of sale or purchase should not differ widely from an appraisal made to find the fair" value for rate making purposes, with the exception that the property not used and useful by; the public should be ex - cluded when rates are m view. Property of this character does not appear to he involved. The unit costs applied to the existing plant - in the spot appraisal appear to exceed normal costs m this territory. C. J. Garlow, former owner of the properties, was called by At - torney McElfresh and testified that the owners of the stock m the ' old Platte County company received $65,000 at the time of the sale. This figure is of little assistance to the Commission m finding fair " value for rate-making purposes, as the stock was sold and certain liabilities were assumed by the new owners, which ran against the assets of the company. The proposed changes m plant consist of a new office building m Columbus, new automatic central office equipment, new telephones and the necessary changes m outside city plant required to bring the circuits to the new office building; also the additional sum required. • to make all the rural lines full metallic, including the Duncan ex - change and such additional equipment as may be required to provide semi-automatic service outside of the city. Giving effect to these changes and exclusive of working assets the cost new- becomes $452, - -540 as determined from the spot appraisal] The value of the prop - erty removed m the above changes was deducted at its appraised value and the property added was estimated at current prices. ■ 209 </seg>
            <seg id="p218">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT The record also shows that when the above changes are made m the book figure of September 1, 1929, as brought down from the appraisal of December 15, 1927, the cost new will be $411,025. The estimated historical cost new figure when subjected to the same treat - ment becomes $392,487. The inspection method was used m finding the physical condition of the property. This does not include all the elements of depreciation m the items of plant that come about through age m service, nor does it provide for inadequacy and obsolescence where it has occurred. Much of the property will be new, after the changes have been made, m fact a large part of the value will be represented by the new build - ing, lot and new central office equipment, also the telephones will be replaced. Therefore, the. Commission believes and so finds that the condition of the entire property after the changes have been made will be 90 percentum of its value new. Having m mind that the fixed investment m the exchanges in - volved is not cost, but originated from an appraisal with additions and betterments to September 1, 1929, m the sum of $206,828 plus, and giving effect to the approximate estimate of the proposed change m plant required for automatic and semi-automatic service, exclusive of working capital, we find that the value of the property new is the sum of $491,727 and less depreciation m the sum of $352,990. This figure Includes intangibles as well as going concern and the Commis - sion will add $5,000 for working capital which results for the purpose of this case, m a total of $360,000. The historical cost figure is im - portant as it reflects the dollars invested, but does not disclose the value of the property at current prices. However, it does serve to test and measure to some extent the values found when estimated costs are applied. • ■ Operating revenues for the period of September 1, 1928, to August 31. 1929. were $56,238.55. Gross revenues under the proposed schedule will be $77,742.19 and operating expenses including de - preciation were estimated to be $60,985.69, providing a remainder of $16,756.50 available for return on the value of the property. In these expenses applicant has included $3,382.35 to amortize the sudden depreciation created by removal of plant m connection with the changes m property and from which the full wearing value will not be obtained. In this instance applicant has appraised the old property on a very liberal basis, knowing that it was about to be re - moved from plant, and after deducting its salvage value has found a net loss of $38,823.50, which it represents should be charged to op - erating expenses and amortized m equal annual amounts over the next ten years. 210 </seg>
            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION If the public had demanded this change m service and caused the sudden depreciation, or if it had come about through municipal reg - ulation, such as placing lines In conduits underground, or relocating pole lines from streets to alleys, and the like, It might he a proper charge to expenses, but •when the applicart solicited its subscribers to secure their consent to the proposed changes m service and plant, equity demands that the burden of this expense falls on petitioner and not on the public. The duty of the subscriber is to pay an amount included In the rate for service which will pay the cost of plant re - tired. This item will be excluded from expenses and included m the amount available as a return on the investment which becomes $20,630.85. Additional items of expense, such as taxes and deprecia - tion when reduced to conform with the value found by the Commis - sion result m raising the net income to approximately $21,000. The amount available for return on the value of the property as found by the Commission points to six per cent under the schedule of rates as proposed by the applicant. This is conservative m view of the court decisions of the country where a fair rate of return has been found to be from, seven to eight per cent. • .

COMMISSIONER MILLER PRESIDING 212 </seg>
            <seg id="p221">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION OPINION AND FINDING I ■ BY THE COMMISSION: _ The applicant, Central West Public Service Company of Nebraska, is a corporation organized and incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware and doing business exclusively m the state of Ne - braska. It owns and operates several utility properties m this state and has recently purchased a natural ice property located near Crystal Lake, Dakota county, Nebraska. Among its properties are a gas plant at Norfolk, a gas plant at Columbus, an electric property at Albion, a telephone property at Jackson and an electric transmission line from whfch current is furnished to the town of Dakota City, at wholesale, and to the town of Jackson, at retail. It has an authorized capital stock of $300,000 divided into 3,000 shares of the par value of $100 each. It has heretofore been authorized by this Commission to issue stock m the amount of $90,000 and bondsjin the amount of $465,000. . None of the securities is m the hands of the public but all of them are held by the Central West Public Service Company, a Delaware corporation, of which the applicant is a subsidiary. By its articles of incorporation the applicant is authorized to own and operate public service properties, ice plants and various other forms of property. It is conceded that the ice plant is not a public utility. . .';■■• -The applicant now desires to issue, upon the basis of such ex - penditures, its thirty-year six per cent first mortgage bonds, series "A", dated November 1, 1926, of the par value of $159,000 for the . purpose of pledging the same as collateral under the provisions of the first lien collateral indenture of the Central West Public Service com-' pany. Applicant has made net additions and improvements to its utility properties, which have not yet been capitalized, to the amount of ?52,458.48. it has also acquired the ice plant, above mentioned, at. a cost of $159,132.09, making a total of $211,620.57. The $159, - -000 bond issue asked for is approximately seventy-five per cent of the total, that per cent being the limit under the terms of the lien indenture. The question now arises as to whether or not the non - utility property may be used as a basis for the issuance of securities, thus making them a lien on all its property, both utility and non - utility. ".'•■■. ■ The stock and bonds act Sections-676— 678, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, under which this Commission proceeds when acting upon applications for security issues, is designed to relate only to the common carrier and public service corporations. . • 213 </seg>
            <seg id="p222">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Section 676 of the act, as amended, Session Laws 1925, Chap. 141, so far as material to the present proceeding, reads as follows: "A common carrier or public service corporation doing business m the State of Nebraska, may issue stocks, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness payable at periods of more then twelve (12) months after the date thereof, when necessary for the acquisition of property, the construction, completion, extension or improvement of facilities, or for the Improvement or maintenance of its service, or for the discharge or lawful refunding of its obligation: Provided, and not otherwise, there shall have been secured from the Nebraska State Railway Commission an order authorizing such issue and the amount thereof, and stating that m the opinion of the commission, the use of the capital to be secured by the issue of such stock, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness is reasonably required for the said purposes of the corporation." The provisions of the statute must be considered m view of the constitutional requirements that common carriers and public utility corporations shall make reports to this Commission (Art. X, Sec. 1) that their capital stock shall not be increased for any purpose except after notice (Art. X, Sec. 5) and that no dividend shall be declared except out of net earnings after' paying all operating expense includ - ing a proper depreciation reserve sufficient to keep the investment intact (Art. X, Sec. 5). These requirements indicate strongly that public service corporations and common carriers are m a class by themselves and that only public utility properties are to be dealt with m their regulation. Applicant insists that the expression "acquisition of property", as used m the statute, may mean any form of property, non-utility as well as utility property. No direct authority is cited to sustain such position. In the matter of the application of the Custer Electric com - pany for authority to issue stock and bonds, 7 N. S. R. C. Rep. 302, is cited, however, as sustaining the applicant's view. In that case the applicant desired to expend $12,700 m the construction of an artificial ice plant. The ice plant was to be built as part of the electric light plant. It was proposed to use the exhaust steam, which was a waste product of the electric plant, m the manufacture of ice. It developed at the hearing that the applicant was not giving any day service; that there was a demand for. such service, but that under existing condi - tions the consumption m current during the day would be insufficient to pay operating cost; that to furnish such service without developing an additional load would be uneconomical; and that the operation of an artificial ice plant m conjunction with the electric light plant would furnish the additional load necessary to justify giving day service. It also appeared that but little additional help would be required! and that the result of the installation of an ice. plant would reduce the cost of generating current. 214 </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The circumstances of that case are not comparable with the cir - cumstances of the present application. I In discussing the subject, Commissioner Clark said: . • "As a general principle, where the control of the capitaliza - tion of public service corporations is vested m Commissions, such corporations are not permitted to issue and sell their securities . for the purpose of using the proceeds thereof m any other busi - ness than that which is commonly termed 'public service.' At the present time the manufacture and distribution of ice is not re - garded as a public service." The case of People v. Stevens, 203 N. Y. 7, 96 N. E. Rep. 114, appears to be opposed to applicant's view. l It is there said: ■ "It is said by the relator that the public service commissions law as it existed m 1909 did not make any distinction between expendi - tures for operating purposes and expenditures for permanent improve - ments, but provided generally for the issue of stocks, bonds, notes, or other evidence of indebtedness payable at periods of more than ' 12 months after the date thereof 'when necessary for the acquisition of property, the construction, completion, extension or improvement of its plant or distributing system, or for the improvement or mainten - ance of its service or for the discharge or lawful refunding of Its ob - ligation.' "Omitting from that part of the statute jußt quoted the words m italics (blackface) it would then clearly refer to the permanent im - provement of the plant or distributing system, and not to mere re - newals or replacements. The words m italics, (blackface) although of broader meaning than those not m italics; should be construed m con - nection with them; and m view of one of the paramount purposes of the Legislature m establishing the commissions, which was to protect and enforce the rights of the public. The contention of the relator would enable any corporation to pay for labor, fuel, and other sup - plies constituting the most ordinary oti all operating expenses by obligations extending less than 12 months and then apply from time to time to the commission for authority ! to issue stock or bonds for the payment of such obligations and insist upon the same as a matter of right, without limit." : . . . The ice plant is not connected with the other properties of the applicant and is not auxiliary to them or any of them; nor is it op - erated to utilize an otherwise useless by-product of any of them. Under the terms of its first mortgage bonds, issued by the com - pany to reimburse it for expenditures made for the ice property would •be secured by the company's utility properties as well as by its ice property. The Commission finds that it | should deny applicant's au - thority to issue bonds with respect to the acquisition of the non - utility ice property since its operation is not connected with the utility properties, and because such bonds, if applicant were per - mitted to issue the same, might become a burden on the utility prop - erty or might hinder the utility service as the bonds would be a lien 215 </seg>
            <seg id="p224">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT on applicant's utility properties as well as its non-utility property. Only bonds covering 75% of the $52,488.48, expended for utility property, or $40,000.00, should be authorized. The bonds are not to be sold to the public but will be taken by the parent company, and pledged as hereinafter stated, and will be issued to the extent of only 75% of the capital actually invested (which is the limit nxed m the mortgage) and considering the large excess m property value of the company over its total securities and m view of the agreement of the applicant, entered into at the time of the hearing, that each bond should bear a statement on its face that it is issued for the sole purpose of being pledged with" the First Union Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Illinois, as collateral security to the first Hen collateral indenture of the Central West Public Ser - vice company, we shall permit bonds m the amount of $40,000 to be issued.

CHAIRMAN CURTISS PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This is an application by the Nebraska Natural Gas Company, a Nebraska corporation, for authority to issue five thousand shares of common stock, ten thousand shares of 7% preferred stock, and 7%, fifteen year bonds m the amount of $1,000,000.00. The application shows that applicant is the owner of a natural gas pipe line, and rights of way therefor, commencing at a point about a half mile east of Chester, Thayer county^ and running thence north-westward across portions of Thayer, Clay, Hamilton and Hall counties, to Grand Island, and that there will be several branch lines running into other coun - ties. All the lines will be within Nebraska. Some of the towns along the lines have. been served with gas since January 6, 1930, and . others are being added from time to time. The following towns and cities: Chester, Hebron, Deshler, Davenport, Edgar, Clay Center, Har - vard, Hastings, York, Aurora, Grand Island, Kearney, and a number of others will be served. The applicant states that it is' organized as a subsidiary of the North American Light &amp; Power Company, which has advanced the funds for rights of way, materials, supplies and expenses of construc - tion of lines. It is also alleged that the applicant is incorported under and conformably to the provisions of Section 5081, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and that it is a public service cor - poration and common carrier, and is subject to the jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway Commission. A copy of the amended articles of incorporation accompanies the application. The authorized capital stock of applicant is $1,500,000, divided into shares of the par value of $100 each. It is the intention of the applicant to deliver to the North American Light &amp; Power Company all of the preferred stock- and all of the bonds, on the basis 'of 90 ■•. . I 217 </seg>
            <seg id="p226">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT cents on the dollar, and all of the common stock at par, m payment of the advances made by the latter company for the construction of the lines. It is the thought of the applicant, as expressed by its of - ficers at the hearing, that none of the securities will be sold to the general public. . The applicant company will receive its supply of gas from the Kansas Pipe Line &amp; Gas Company, also .a subsidary of the North American Light &amp; Power Company. It has entered into a contract with the Kansas Pipe Line &amp; Gas Company, for sufficient gas to supply its needs for a period of fifteen years. The Kansas Pipe Line &amp; Gas Company, as the contract recites, has acquired a supply of natural gas m fields m central and southern Kansas, which will supply an adequate amount for its own requirements, and for the requirements of applicant company under its present" plan. The consulting engineer of the North American Light &amp; Power Company testified as to what might be called the "visible supply" of gas m the Kansas field. The associated companies control about seventy thousand acres of gas land m McPherson County, Kansas; they also have a contract with the Barber Oil Company m Barber County, Kansas, covering approxi - mately twenty-five thousand acres; they also control about twelve thousand acres m Stephens County and fourteen thousand acres m Rush County. In addition they also control about twenty thousand acres m the Panhandle region of Texas. The relations of the sub - sidiary companies to each other, and to the parent company, with, re - gard to the use of the gas to be taken from these fields, are not set out with particularity, but it is understood that all of these fields will be available for the use of the lines m Nebraska. It is the opinion of the engineer that there is sufficient gas to supply the lines m Kansas, and the lines, m Nebraska, now being constructed, for a period of about fifty years. It is realized by this Commission that the dura - tion of the supply m any field is purely speculative, but m view of the large gas areas controlled by these companies, it is probable that there will not be miscalculations with reference to all of them, and that there is an adequate supply for many years, at least for the period of the life of the bonds, which is fifteen years. The evidence shows that the applicant has already secured rights of way for its main line, and is securing such rights for its branch lines. The line from the place of beginning near Chester most of the -way to Grand Island, about 57 miles, is laid with 16-inch pipe. The branch line to Hastings, 17% miles, will be laid with 12-inch pipe. The extension from Grand Island to Kearney, 65 miles, will be laid with 8-inch pipe. The remainder of the pipe, which is for laterals, will run from 2 to 4 inches m diameter. Short laterals from the main lines to towns nearby are provided for. During the pendency 218 </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION - ; I . ■ : - I of this proceeding, it has been suggested that the engineers might. reroute some of the lines, but if such changes should be made, they would increase rather than diminish the mileage and the size of the pipe. The estimate of cost, prepared by the applicant's engineers, shows a probable outlay for the physical i property, including all ma - terials and labor, together with engineering services, legal services, interest during construction, etc., of $2, 311 ,019.81. The cost of financing, being the discount upon the preferred stock and bonds, is placed at $200,000.00, making a total expenditure for the project of $2,511,019.84. This is for the entire mileage, of all sizes of pipes, which is 175 miles. There will be no financing expense m connection with the common stock. Up to December 23, 1929, the total amount advanced by the North American Light &amp; Power Company was $1, - -987,545.63. Judging from the amount of work already done and the cost thereof, and the probable cost of the work yet to be done, the estimate of two and a half million dollars as the total cost of the project appears to be conservative. ■ . An estimate of the probable earnings of the applicant was also supplied. It shows that the company will have customers for an annual consumption of 3,300,000 thousand cubic feet of gas at 34.5 . cents per thousand cubic feet, returning a gross revenue of $1,138, - -500; annual expenditures for the purchase of gas, $727,650; for oper - ation and maintenance, $36, 000, for insurance, taxes, amortization and miscellaneous expenses, $40,000, and for, depreciation (7% on $2, - -150,000), $150,500; making the total operating expenses $953,150; leaving net earnings of $185,350. This is the equivalent of more than .two and One-half times bond interest. Deducting interest on bonds and on preferred stock of $140,000 - from the net earnings leaves a balance of $45,350 for dividends on the, common stock. It these figures are correct, the common stock will yield 9.07%. The appli - cant does not think such a return as that indicated above will be realized at once. It will take time to attach the business, and under the company's estimate, will require three years before the figures stated will be attained. Naturally the estimate can be only general as the level of the rates has not yet been; determined. ■ It is to be clearly understood that none of the statements m .this opinion with regard either to earnings or to expenses, is to be taken . as reflecting m any way the judgment of the proper rate-malting body . as to a proper level of rates to be charged by the applicant. It a . proceeding should be instituted for the j fixing of rates, such rate - making body shall consider it .without reference to these figures. Judging from the estimate, it seems probable that the consumption of gas will be sufficient to make the investment a profitable one. 219 </seg>
            <seg id="p228">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT It js the purpose of the company to sell gas to municipalities, and to other distributing agencies, at wholesale, and not to operate dis - tributing systems, except where there is no other way to handle the business. A separate distributing company is yet. to be organized which will handle the distribution m such places. The details of dis - tribution have not been completed. In addition to supplying muni - cipalities, the applicant company expects to supply some very large consumers. A contract has already been entered into with the lowa- Nebraska Light &amp; Power Company to supply Aurora, York, Fairmont, Geneva and other towns with natural gas. ' Contracts are being . negotiated to supply the Riverside power plant near Grand Island, the beet sugar factory at Grand Island, the State Asylum at Hastings, the brickyards and other institutions outside of that city, and the Boys' Industrial Home and other institutions at Kearney. Some of . these will consume immense amounts of gas. In addition to furnishing the towns and large factories and other industrial concerns with gas, it is the purpose of the company to supply rural customers. The company will be ready to serve them at any time they make application, pay the cost of service -connection, and provide the pipe and other facilities from the main line to point of consumption. Definite figures are not given m the record as to what the service connection with the main line will cost, but the consult - ing engineer of the North American Light &amp; Power Company stated that it should not exceed $75. In answer to an inquiry as to the cost to a rural customer receiving the service, he said: " it depends entirely on how far the rural customer lives from the main line, and what it costs to connect, how much gas is used for heat, etc. and how many appliances he has, etc. Assuming an instance where a farmer will be, say, five hundred feet from a pipe line. Connection to main line costs not to exceed $75, connection to his house not to exceed $75 more, good gas range, water heater and other appliances could be pur - chased for, say $175 more, $325 would outfit him." The evidence shows that arrangements have already been made with some thirty farmers, along the lines, for service connection, and it is estimated that 60% of the farm homes within a half mile or less of the pipe lines will receive service. It is the plan of the company to charge the farmer the same price for gas that is paid by the near - est city or village consumer. We find that the allegations of fact of the application are sus - tained by the evidence. The matter now turns upon the questions of law involved. A very extensive and well prepared brief was filed on behalf of the ap - plicant company. Considerable space is given therein to discussion 220 </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION of the question as to whether or not the applicant company Is a public utility. In view of the facts already found, to-wit: that the company has a sufficient supply of gas which is apparently assured for at least fifteen years; that it offers to sell gas at wholesale to any municipality or distributing company m any city or village which may apply for service, and is now conducting its business upon that plan- that it will. serve all rural subscribers who make arrangements for service connection, and that it is the plan that the rates to be charged such consumers will not exceed the rates that will prevail m the nearest municipality; there appears to be no question as to the public service • character of the concern. This is the first company to bring natural gas into Nebraska, and, of course, there | are no decisions of the Su - preme Court of this state concerning the subject. Under the usual con - ception of a public service corporation, th'e applicant company may be properly considered such. A much more difficult question is presented as to whether or not this company is a common carrier. Its articles of incorporation provide: .

APPLICATION NO. 8200 In the matter of the application of Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph Company for approval of purchase and consolidation of Nuckolls County Independent Telephone Company. COMMISSIONER RANDALL PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph iCompany is a public utility corporation which owns and operates a large number of telephone ex - changes south of the Platte River m this state. Included m these are the exchanges at Superior, Davenport, Edgar and Deweese. The com - pany has applied to this Commission for permission to purchase and consolidate the property, franchises and earnings of the Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company; with the public utility properties that it now owns and operates. The headquarters and switchboard of i the Nuckolls County com - pany are located at Nelson, and its exchange lines extend m all di - rections from this point m Nuckolls county. The Lincoln company owns an exchange on the south of Nelson, at Superior, also the ex - changes on the north and east at Davenport, Edgar and Deweese. The lines of the Lincoln company exchanges meet the exchange. lines of the Nuckolls County company at a number of points m the county. The testimony shows that none of the telephone lines owned by the applicant parallel the exchange lines of the Nuckolls County company 223 </seg>

It further shows. that the companies involved have cooperated through the purchase and sale of exchange lines where subscribers have applied to be changed from one exchange to the other. Applicant has purchased all of the common stock of the Nuckolls County Telephone company with two exceptions, one where the owner of a few shares of stock refuses to sell and the other where a small amount of stock is owned by an individual who cannot be located. Applicant proposes to dissolve the Nuckolls County Independent Tele - phone corporation and consolidate the property of the company with the property now owned and operated by the Lincoln company. A reserve will be set up to protect the stockholders m the Nuckolls County company who huve not sold and who cannot be found.

            <seg id="p234">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT The Odell Independent Telephone company has a long and varied history having been organized m the year 1904, with the majority of the telephone users being stockholders. The company managed to exist on a very low rate for a number of years, and the property de - teriorated to such an extent that the service became bad, and many complaints were made. These complaints were evidently not satis - fied and a group of telephone subscribers banded together and or - ganized what was known as the Farmers Mutual Telephone company, for the purpose of furnishing telephone service m Odell and vicinity. The new company placed a switchboard m Odell and constructed telephone lines paralleling those of the Odell Independent Telephone company. This required many of the subscribers m this community to install both telephones m order to receive complete telephone service. It was not a very agreeable or business-like situation and consequently was short lived, so m the year 1919, the Farmers Mutual' Telephone company agreed to purchase the Odell Independent Tele - phone company and thereby consolidate the two plants. This was done. The new stockholders and directors realizing that the rates In effect at that time were inadequate to take care of the increased cost m maintenance, and provide a return on their investment, filed an application with this Commission for a schedule of rates, which was granted to become effective May 1, 1920, and are the same as those now m effect. Applicant now contends that operating expenses have increased to such an extent that the present rates are no longer sufficient. The . testimony shows that higher wages are being paid to linemen and telephone operators, also more operators are employed and that ma - terials which applicant is compelled to buy at the present time are higher than m the years of its early existence. In addition to this free service is given the subscribers to twelve other exchanges m the Odell territory. While no exhibits were. furnished by the applicant to substantiate these contentions, the Commission furnished exhibits which were taken from the annual reports of applicant company, showing the assets and liabilities and operating revenues and expenses from the year 1919 to 1929, inclusive. The books of the company were set up m the year 1919 with fixed investment based upon a valuation made by the Commission on. the original cost basis. Applicant has kept these- books since that time, and made the annual reports as required by the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission. These books show that the fixed property of ap - plicant has increased but very little since the year 1919, and .that the depreciation reserve has grown considerably. Upon examination of 226 </seg>
            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION I the secretary of the company, it was brought out that he did not have a lull and complete understanding of the methods of bookkeeping as required by this Commission, and therefore many discrepancies have crept into their accounts. It was shown that the proper charges to the plant account had not been made, and that consequently a larger amount of new construe - ■ tion had been made than the accounts showed. This was due to the fact that no accounting whatever had been made to the secretary of the company, by the manager, of any new material put into the plant. The manager of the company testified to the fact that m the last two or three. years there had been some rebuilding which ordinarily should have been charged to the plant account, but instead was charged to taaintenance. The exhibit also shows that ; the material and supplies account has grown since the year 1921 from $1,386 to ?2,810 m 1929. On examination the secretary testified that whenever any ship - ment of new material was received, it was credited to the stores arid supplies account, but when the manager, or linemen, took material out of the storehouse to put into plant, no reports were made to him, hence the constant growth -in this account.! The Commission is satisfied that additions have been made to the plant since the year 1919, and that the present hook value of the plant is greater than the cost figure of $34,936.84 found by the Com - mission's engineer m 1919. The outside plant is not m good operating condition as testified to by the manager and some of the rural subscribers. This is due to lack of maintenance on the part of the present management, occasioned by the inadeouate rates m the past, which have not furnished an equit - - able return. The property was shown by the Commission's engineer m 1919 to be m a 57 per cent condition, and has continued to de - preciate to such an extent that major repairs are more expensive thfln 'replacements. The present condition of the property constitutes an emergency. - ■ As the Commission cannot excuse poor service conditions, nor allow them to continue, and the Odell Independent Telephone com - pany must see that sufficient repairs are made at once, m order that all subscribers will have continuous service. After this order has been m effect sixty days, the Commission's engineering department will make an inspection of the work done and report the progress . that is being made. :■';■■ There has been a payment of only one dividend to the stock - holders m the past ten years, and it was shown that due to this fact it is impossible to sell any of the authorized stock m any appreciable 227 </seg>

However, notes pay - able have been reduced during this period from $13,000 to $5,500. Applicant should make an effort to sell at least this amount of its authorized and unissued common stock, to retire the balance of this indebtedness. There was some testimony that the present method of collecting rents a year m advance, imposed a hardship upon the subscribers. In view of this fact the Commission will require that this practice be discontinued beginning March 1, 1930, and the following methods of collecting rates shall be installed. City business and residence phones payable monthly m advance, with 25 cents additional charge for failure to pay by the 10th of the month; rural subscribers shall pay three months m advance with 75 cents additional charge for fail - ure to pay within the first thirty day 3 after it becomes due. This will not prevent subscribers paying for a longer period if they so. desire. The income that would be derived from the schedule of rates applied for is not unreasonable, and will pay less than a seven per cent return on the book cost of the property. The rates applied for are therefore approved by this Commission.

            <seg id="p238">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Petitioner herein owns and operates the only telephone exchange serving Edgar, and vicinity. It has applied to this Commission for a permit to charge and collect $1.75 per month, net, for full metallic service on its rural ljnes. The matter came on to be heard at Edgar on February 25, 1930. Rural subscribers of the Edgar exchange were served with ground - ed return service with a net rate of $1.25 per month. In the sum - mer of 1929 applicant represented to the Commission that it proposed to make the farm lines metallic and asked for the Commission's ap - proval of the rate of $1.75 for the improved' service. The change m rate to be applied on the rural lines only where 66 per cent of the existing subscribers served by any line expressed a desire for the im - proved service and agreed m writing to pay the increased rate. In view of the above conditions, careful consideration having been, given to the reasonableness of the rates proposed for the higher grade service, the Commission considered it unnecessary to hold a- hearing and issued an order under Application No. 7787, wherein it stated its position as follows: "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the securing of metallic farm line service is optional with the subscriber on the farm line, and that such service shall not be provided by applicant herein until not less than two-thirds of the subscribers on any farm line shall, have expressed, m writing, a desire for such im- ' proved service." ' .■:'■■' ■ '■'■■':.''■ ' ■ Applicant made all of the. 'arm lines metallic and put the new rate m effect January 1, 1930. Shortly thereafter the Commission received protest m writing from the subscribers setting forth the fact that patrons on eight of the farm ines had not consented to the proposed change, nor had they agreed to the new rate.. The petitions were signed by a Jarge number of the rural customers. Applicant also submitted signed petitions showing the consent of a large number of the parties at interest. ' A comparison of these documents showed that many of the same names were on both peti - tions, and the fact was admitted that the company had failed to secure the necessary approval of the- subscribers on eight of the lines of the exchange where the new rate vas put m effect. The confusing nature of the evidence before- the Conmission made it impossible to reach a definite conclusion. Applicant then filed this application for an in - crease m its rural rates, based on its investment m the exchange giving effect to the cost of metilllcizing the farm lines and the matter was heard on its merits. 230 </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The record shows that applicant purchased the exchange m the year 1916 and put the property on its books at actual cost to the company. A careful record of the net additions and betterments has been kept since that time and the investment m plant as of December' 31, 1929, giving effect to the changes m th&lt; construction of farm lines after the cost of property removed had bjen deducted, is shown to be $36,748.19. The company's operating revenues for Ihe years 1926, 1927, 1928 and 1929 were J9.619.45; $9,283.46; $9,799.14 and $10,032.54, re - spectively. Operating expenses for the corresponding years were $9,588.84; $9,141.94; $8,933.87 and $13,626.19, providing net earn - ings for these years as follows: $30.61; $141.52; $865.27 and m the year 1929 a deficit of $3,593.65. The loss iii 1929 is found m the item ... of current repairs for the year which resu ted from the change from grounded to metallic service, and is not ecpected to occur again for many years. Estimated earnings and expenses under he new rate put into effect January 1, 1930, are as follows: Revenues $11,213.75 Expenses 10,704.53 Net Earnings , $ 509.22 The net available for dividends or surplus is practically 1.4 per cent on the investment. It appears at no time m the last four years has the exchange paid as much as two per cent on the investment, whereas the loss in.1929, which is abnormal, exceeded the profits tor many years. ■ Since the purchase of the property m 1916, applicant has charged operating expenses and credited its depreciation reserve with $15, - -467.96 and during the same period the cost of realized depreciation has been $11,086.78. From this it appears that applicant now has a net credit m its reserve on account of the Edgar exchange of $4, - -381.18, which m all probability is insufficient to provide for the ac - crued depreciation m the property. Since petitioner acquired the property m 1916, the prices of tele - phone materials and equipment have risen; rapidly and have not de - clined with the break m prices m the years 1920 and 1921, with the exception of switchboards which are lower than they were some four or five years ago. As the replacements m the property have taken place m the last few years the effect of the higher prices is reflected m the investment. However, it is true that much of the plant has 231 </seg>
            <seg id="p240">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT not been displaced that was m existence m 1916. It follows that the present Investment is not as large as an appraisal ol the property would show on present price levels. The Commission finds it un - necessary to find the value of the property used and useful for tele - phone purposes as a rate base, as the estimated earnings are less than a fair return on the investment basis. The courts of our land have repeatedly held that fair return must' be computed, not on investment or book cost, but on a fair value figure which gives serious consider - ation to reproduction new values.* At the time of the hearing the protestants filed a stipulation which shows that the patrons on the Edgar exchange have no free ser - vice connections with any other town m their locality, and. that the total number of service connections available to its subscribers is 440. It also shows that Clay Center has free service with Harvard and Sutton and is connected with 1,630 phones. The exchange at Har - vard has free service with the Clay Center, Sutton, Inland and Eldor - ado, exchanges, and 1.210 subscribers. Also that Sutton has free connection with Clay Center and Saronville, or a total of 1,275 tele - phones. The city of Hastings with 4,600 service connections is cited, but this is not comparable with the Edgar exchange. However, the free service situation at Clay Center, Harvard, and Sutton, shows that the village of Edgar with the same, or similar rates for- farm line ser - vice, is discriminated against as compared with- other exchanges of the company m that territory, from the standpoints of the free phones available under the new rates. The Commission will provide that within sixty days from the date of this order applicant shall provide the necessary facilities for free service connection for the subscribers of the Edgar exchange with the subscribers of the Clay Center exchange which is the county seat of the county m which Edgar is located. The company admits that the new rate for metallic service should not have been charged to subscribers on eight of its lines where it failed to secure the necessary consent m writing. Confusion results when the petition filed by the company is compared with the one filed by protestants, as to the number of subscribers on the rural lines, other than the eight mentioned who have consented to the change m rate and service with full knowledge of its meaning and effect. The Commission will suspend the new rate for metallic services effective January 1, 1930, and make it effective March 1, 1930, and provide that the company shall return the difference m money, if paid, between the old rate and the new rate to the subscribers, or credit their accounts accordingly at the option of the subscriber. 232 </seg>

Newman Grove will be the smallest town m Nebraska which will be served with machine switch - ing apparatus, however, it has been tested out m a number ot towns of this size m other states. The equipment costs more money than, the switchboard and instruments that are now m use, and still more than common battery, which is m common use m towns of this size m this territory. Operating economies due to the use of mechanical devices as a substitute for operators will partly off -set the additional expense of the new service. The Newman Grove exchange now has free service to Lindsay and Albion. Applicant proposes to continue the free service to Lindsay but discontinue it to Albion. This means that the free line to Albion will be eliminated, however, Albion will still have free service with Newman Grove, perhaps until such time as the Albion rates are under consideration. • Applicant presented an inventory and appraisal of the physical property of the Newman Grove exchange at the hearing on April 2, 1930, at Newman Grove, including working capital and going concern value as of November 1, 1929, m the amount of $106,220.98 estimated cost new, and the same less depreciation m the sum of $86,262. The fixed property exclusive of working capital and going concern as of this date amounts to $90,270.94, and the same less depreciation m the sum of $70,312. An estimate was also submitted showing the fixed property exclusive of going concern value and working capital after the installation of the new automatic equipment which shows an estimated cost new of $123, 581. 55 and the same less depreciation m the sum of $107,794.39.

Operating economies due to the change to automatic service as well as increased operating expenses have been given effect m finding the net return. However expenses have been charged with 6% computed on the estimated cost &gt;e» pf the property for accrued depreciation. The Commission has found m other cases that 8%% will be sufficient for this purpose; therefore, the Commission will add $620 to the estimated amount available for return which becomes $5,676.! The lowest figure which may be used asja measure of the cost or value of the property, as disclosed by the record, exceeds $100 000 after the automatic equipment has been installed. Therefore the re - turn is less than 6% on any of the estimates of cost, or values of the Plant as disclosed by the record. Therefore,! it will be unnecessary to say which one of the numerous figures should be selected as the actual value of the property devoted to the [public use for rate mak - ng purposes. The proposed additional charge of 25 cents per month for desk sets is not justified by the cost of the equipment; moreover the custom &gt; this territory has been that one party service in - cludes a desk set at the option of the subscriber.

In the matter of the application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, for a change of rates charged at its Hastings, Glenvil, Hansen, Juniata, Pauline and Prosser exchanges. COMMISSIONER RANDALL; PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein is a public service corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska. It is engaged m the telephone business and owns and operates 134 telephone exchanges with connecting lines 1 , south of the Platte river m Nebraska. It owns and operates the exchanges at Hastings, Glen - vil, Hansen, Juniata, Pauline, Prosser and adjacent territory which, for telephone purposes, are called the Hastings zone. Connection is available for telephone purposes for each subscriber of the above towns and villages with all the stations m! the zone, or a total of ap - proximately 4,890, and all charges for exchange service are included m the net rate. Petitioner has applied to this Commission for an increase m the zone exchange service rates.

Prior to the year 1913 Hastings was served by two exchanges, namely, the Hastings Independent Telephone company wmoh provided automatic service, and the Nebraska Telephone company which used manual common battery equipment. These companies were competi - tors m the town of Hastings, and there were many duplicate telephones - ns the exchanges were not connected. The exchanges m the villages of Glenvil and Hansen were owned by the Independent Company and Juniata, Pauline and Prosser were owned by the Nebraska Company. Applicant purchased both properties and consolidated them m one ex - change, with headquarters at Hastings, and provided free service be - tween Hastings and all of the villages above mentioned. At the time of the acquisition by the applicant company, all of the physical property of the exchanges were entered on the books of the applicant on the basis of their estimated cost new as of the time of purchase, m 1912, m the suni of $373,314.89. Exact infbrmation is not available, but following the custom of the company at that time, it is fair to say that the depreciation found m the property was cred - ited to its reserve. This figure is challenged by protostants as not representing the historical cost of the plant as shown by the books of the original owners, the price paid for the property, nor any actual 240 </seg>
            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION : . ■■■'■':. transaction of the purchasing company which would show the value of the property at the time it was acquired. This Commission made a state-wide valuation of telephone prop - erties which began m 1911 and was completed m 1912. This shows an estimated cost new of the Hastings Independent Telephone property m the sum of $190,665.24, and the same; of the Nebraska Telephone company's property at Hastings m the sum of $146,000.89. Also, the Glenvil and Inland exchanges m the amount of $6,397.88. The Juniata exchange was appraised on the same basis m the amount of $19,363.29 and Prosser m the sum of $2.950.29, or a total of $365,407.59. Ap - praisals of the Hansen and Pauline exchanges are not available. In making all of these appraisals, the owning j companies made inventories m the. field and the Commission 'applied cost units to the various classes of property which it considered consistent with current prices of materials, equipment and labor at that time. It is possible that the difference between the original entry of the company m 1913, and the. physical valuation made, could be accounted for by additions to Plant after the inventory was made, or working capital not included m the appraisal. There is much confusion m the record; as to the meaning of book value. Protestants contended that the property should have been put on the books of the company at the purchase price, or the historical cost to the original owners. The record shows that the book cost of the fixed property of the Hastings Independent Telephone company m 1912 was $144,507.07 and the total assets were $154,082. Petitioner purchased the stock of the Hastings company at par m the Bum ot $96,200 and assumed the bond indebtedness m the amount of $24,750 and other liabilities m the amount of $9,000, or a total of $129,950. This figure included the Glenvil and Hansen exchanges. The record does not show the price paid for the properties of the Nebraska Tele - phone company, although the flies of the disclose that it was acquired through an exchange of properties on an appraisal basis. This raises the question as to the importance ot book value when it. originates from an appraisal as compared with the market price of the property purchased, or the historical cost as disclosed by the books ot the selling company, as it may affect operating expenses or serve as fair value of the property as a basis for rates, as applied m the in - stant case where the fixed investment has been changed by continuous additions and betterments, deductions from plant and charges to re - serve through a long period of years. • For purposes of accounting, it has been customary to enter prop - erty on the books of the company at its estimated cost new as of the time of the purchase, and credit iU reserve with the depreciation as J . 241 </seg>
            <seg id="p250">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT nearly as it could be determined, and the difference between the purchase price plus the reserve, if any, and the appraisal, has been credited to surplus. As a practical matter, it is not sq important on •what basis the property is put on the books of the company, provided plant displaced is written out of the plant account at the same value that it was put m, and new property is charged at actual cost to the company, provided the period of operating following the set up, is long enough to fairly represent a cycle m the life of the depreciable property. Applicant has kept its accounts under, the rules provided by this Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission, which require that all plant removals shall be credited to its fixed investment on the same basis that it was entered and that all plant added shall be charged at its actual cost as of the time of construction or installation. The record here covers a period from 1913 to December 31, 1929, which is long enough to experience almost a complete change m the physical property, with the exception of real estate. At the time of consolidation, and for several years thereafter, much plant was displaced which originated from the competitive situation, also plant replaced on account of depreciation and other causes. The plant added has been very substantial as the develop - ment m the service is indicated by an increase from 2,500 to prac - tically 5,000 stations. The plant added has amounted to $717,998.31 and the plant displaced, which included some toll property, has been In the sum of $517,368.10, and the cost of realized depreciation has been $309,484.15. Having m mind that the original entry was $317, - -314.89, it would appear that nearly, if not all, of the cost of the plant, as it was originally entered on the books of the company, has been written out and new plant at actual cost has been substituted where required. Therefore, the book figure of $580,174.70, which is the average plant m service as of December 31, 1929, should fairly re - flect the actual cost of the company at the time of the hearing. Protestants contended that the credits to the depreciation reserve which have been charged to operating expenses, have exceeded the re - quirements of the company, especially with respect to the Hastings portion of the property. The credit to the reserve during this period, computed on the entire property, amounts to $375,942.51, while the cost of realized depreciation has been $309,484.15. Protestants con - tend that the true cost of depreciation should be determined from the period 1915 to 1929 inclusive, and not from 1913, when the plant was consolidated, as more fairly representing normal depreciation and the future requirements of the company. The sudden depreciation caused by the consolidation of competing units is abnormal, but the benefits 242 </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION to the public both m rates and service may be and generally are In proportion to the losses experienced. Duplicate switchboards, tele - phones, pole lines, cables and' wires were removed entirely. Pole lines were consolidated and rerouted. T^his provided the subscribers with service from one telephone, at a cost of less than two telephones, and access to all the phones m the system, the cost of which was included m the exchange rate. Under these conditions, it is "proper that the public should bear its proportion of the expense. For several years after the consolidation m 1913, the company was unable to charge operating expenses and credit its depreciation reserve with an amount sufficient to pay the cost of plant removed from service on account of depreciation, for the reason that the rev - enues m the development period were insufficient to pay the cost of operating expenses and fixed charges including depreciation. The company began charging 2.8% computed^on the cost of the depreci - able property m 1913, which was gradually increased to 4% and 5.42% m i 917. It began charging 6% m 1919. This Commission has found, from a large number of investigations, that 5%% com - puted on the first investment is sufficient to pay the cost of realized depreciation, and m finding the net return available for surplus or dividends, looking into the past experience of the company, as well as the future. The Commission's conclusion as to the proper rate will be used. The credit balance m the reserve after fifteen years of operation is $66,458.36. This does not appear to! be excessive to provide for existing depreciation m plant facilities m service. It is possible that the Hastings portion of the property has! paid more than its share of the annual credit to the reserve. Nevertheless, the use of the Hast - ings exchange proper is extended to the subscribers of the entire zone, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to make a complete separation of all depreciation costs where the facilities are used jointly by many exchanges. In April, 1914, applicant applied to [this Commission for an in - crease m exchange rates for the Hastings zone. The record shows that the book value of the property at jthat time was $295,082.36. From this it proposed to deduct" plant to be removed m the amount of $58,546.81, and provide additions to complete the consolidation m the estimated amount of $37,318.64, or a total cost of plant m the amount of $273,854.19. To this amount 'working capital m the sum of $20,570.66 was. added, making a total! book value of $294,424.85. It is possible that the estimated cost to complete the consolidation was insufficient and by reason of the fact that 1 new plant is not charged to the fixed investment until construction is completed, it may be that 243 </seg>
            <seg id="p252">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT this figure Is not directly comparable with the book value shown m this case for the year 1913. However, the average plant m service for the applicant, appears to be $291,008. 2 i. Much of the accuracy of both of these figures is determined by when the entries for plant deducted and plant added were made, depending on when construc - tion work In progress was completed and entered on the books of the company. Petitioner offered an inventory and appraisal of the physical property of all the exchanges m the zone as of February 1, 1930, which shows a total reproduction value new m the sum of $843,996.91, and the same less deterioration m the. sum of $752,679.92. These fig - ures Include working capital computed at $5.00 per station, and going concern estimated at 10% of the physical property value. The fixed investment only, or appraisal value of the physical property, is shown to be $741,465.37 reproduction value new and the same less deprecia - tion m the sum of $650,156.48. The costs used m this appraisal are based on current prices of equipment, materials and labor as of the time of the appraisal. The record shows that the reproduction value new less deterioration m the sum of $650,1.56.48 is the estimated cost new less the visible wear and tear, but does not include any deprecia - tion not visible nor functional depreciation, due to Inadequacy and obsolescence, unless it was apparent. The Commission has found that deterioration as measured here m the amount of 88% of the estimated cost new, does not include all of the depreciation existing m the property. For the purposes of this case, the Commission will use 80% of the estimated cost new or $593,172, exclusive of working capital and going concern. As the appraisal value new less depreciation and working capital, the Com - mission will allow $2.50 per station, having m mind that exchange service is paid for m advance, or a total of $605,397 including work - ing capital and excluding going concern, as the estimated .value of the fixed property plus working assets, for purposes of comparison with the book figure, which is $582,550.70 as of January 1, 1930. The lutter amount will be increased by additions and betterments during the year 1930 m the sum of $28;371, or a total of $610,921.70. Operating revenues and expenses were fully explained at the time of the hearing, and fairly sustained; with the possible exception of current repairs estimated for the year 1930 to be $30,773.68. This is an average figure and approximately. $11,500 less than the actual experience for the year 1929, which was $42,209.96. The cost of current repairs for the years 1927 and 1928 was $27,224 and $27,88 C, respectively. This Item has increased from $17,558 m 1920 to the amount as shown for the year 1929. Direct comparison of the cost 244 </seg>
            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION of maintenance cannot be made by years, for the reason that this expense varies with the amount of plant m service; also, because ot the practice of the company of placing construction crews m the field m addition to the regular maintenance \ forces, to restore plant to good operating condition, at intervals, as the service may require This expense should be computed on the average ratio ot the cost of current maintenance to the plant m service, rather than an esti - mate of the cost of repairs reasonably anticipated. At the second hear - ing, the estimated cost of repairs and maintenance as disclosed by the percentage basis, indicated a larger amount than the one included m the estimated expenses for the year 1930. The estimated taxes for the year 1930 were determined by previous experience as adjusted to include the proposed; additional property, also the proportionate share of the national revenue tax. Therefore, &gt;it does not agree with the actual taxes paid Adams county. ■. , The charge for depreciation has been included m the estimate for the year 1930 at 5%% computed on the fixed investment as found necessary and determined by the Commission In the examination of other properties. Net earnings have varied with the changes m rev - enues and expenses for the years 1920 to 1929. The net available for return on the cost of the plant and equipment m service for the year 1920, was 2.G3%. This increased gradually to the year 1924 when it was 8.15%, and declined rapidly In the years 1927 and 1928 to approximately 4%, and the year 1929 shows less than 1%. The esti - mated net earnings under the proposed schedule ot rates will yield $37,849, which Is approximately 6% of the book value of the prop - erty including additions and betterments required m the year 1930. The estimated reproduction new value of the property less de - preciation and not including going concern is somewhat higher than the book value of the property and the book cost of the same property before the proposed additions and betterments are included Under these conditions, the Commission does not ilnd it necessary to find the fair value of the property for rate making purposes, as the rates proposed m the application will not yield to exceed 6% on the lower figure. Therefore, the Commission believes and so finds that the rates applied for are reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation. ■■'■■"■■■- ■••■■ : ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company ot Lincoln, Nebraska, is hereby permitted to charge and collect the following monthly net rates for exchange' service at the towns and villages set out below: 245 </seg>

APPLICATION HO. 8330 ■ ■ ' In the matter ol the application of the Union Telephone Company at Carroll for authority to publish and collect increased rates at the Carroll exchange. COMMISSIONER RANDALL PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: ■ Under date pi March 30, 1930, application was made by the Union Telephone company through its owner, Mr. E. C. Hunt, for increased telephone rates at Carroll. This is an exchange of 374 subscribers, lie of whom receive city service, 2 farm service and 256 switching service. Applicant alleges that service being rendered is well on a par . with the rates received for rendering this service and does not believe that a better grade of service can be given unless numerous changes are made m the equipment. Some new poles should be set, open wire removed and replaced with cable and metallic service installed throughout the city. These changes necessitate the investing of con - siderable additional. capital which applicant is willing to provide if the proposed rate increase is granted. As part of the exhibits applicant offered an appraisal of the prop - erty, made by the American Appraisal company of Milwaukee, Wis - consin, as of December 1, 1928. This appraisal did not appear satis - factory to the Commission and consequently the Commission's engineer .." made a personal investigation of the properties. In the investigation he found the units to be approximately correct, although the depreci - ated condition of the properties was somewhat m excess of that found by the American Appraisal company; therefore, the Commission deem - ed it advisable to use its own engineer's findings. After a thorough investigation the Commission found a fixed investment of $7,815.58 m a 76 % depreciated condition. Due to the fact that applicant contemplates a very thorough re - building of the majority of plant m service the following calculations were made: The fixed investment account found by the Commission m the amount of ?7,815.58 is used as a basis. The company's exhibits stipu- 247 </seg>

This was found by the engineer to be m a 76% condition thus giving a depreciated value ot $5,126.20 to the plant remaining. Atter eliminating ceitain items as shown m the exhibit a total amount of $2,275.00 was arrived at as additions and betterments which would show a total plait new less depreciation after all rebuilding has been completed In amount $7,401.20. A revenue statement using the proposed rates as a basis reflected probable annual revenues m amount $5,257.91. An expense statement submitted by the applicant reflects annual expense m the amount of $4,495.38. In studying the case, the Commission feels there is not the proper spread between the rates for the various kinds of service. Under the conditions they believe that the business one .party and residence, one party service can be rendered by the applicant tor a monthly net rate of $3.00 and $1.75 respectively. With this change m the proposed rate schedule the applicant would receive $120 less revenue which should be deducted from officers' salaries per annum. This would not create a hardship for the applicant to overcome inasmuch as a careful study of the expense statement submitted reveals the fact that the average per station expense for officers' salaries amounts to approxi - mately $3.55 per year. This item of expense is considerable above the average for the rest of the exchanges with which Mr. Hunt is connected wherein we find the average to be $1.71. per year per station. A comparison with other well-managed companies indicates their ex - penses for this item to be less than half and as low as one-sixth of the amount $1.71 per station. The Commission feels m view of this com - parison that the expense of officers can well be decreased to an allow - ance sufficient to off -set the loss m revenue due to the change m rate schedules as suggested. This would still leave the amount being charged as officers' salaries considerable above the average. With the above mentioned changes m the application as presented, the Commission believes and so finds that the proposed rates for the new service .will be reasonably required to pay operating expenses including fixed charges and a fair return on investment.

REPORT Comprehensive exhibits were presented by the company, which exhibits had been previously checked with the company's books by the Commission's engineers m conjunction with the city comptroller of Omaha. No conflicts were found between the exhibits and the com - pany's original records m so far as the same related tp the past operating experiences. j President Shannahan of applicant company was interrogated by the company's attorney, by the attorneys for the city and the United Improvement club, by the engineer, and the attorney for the Com - mission. The Commission finds the following facts exists: In mi opinion dated September 25, 1923, amended as of September 22, 1924, this Commission found the applicant's property to be of the fa r value of $13,800,000 and with working capital added, $14,100, 00 as of. December 31, 1919; and m said order stated that 7% woul 1 be a fair return on such value. In an opinion dated June 10, 1925, this Commission fixed the schedule of fares applicant was permitted to charge as folkws: Adult cash fare , &#132;-.. ..:i I cents Adult token fare, G tokens for .'. 40 cents Children five years of age, and not over twelve years of age: Cash .......;..... :... 1 1 cents Token, 10 tokens for 3!' cents Children under five years of age carried tree. . / Until the emergency order was made herein May 21&lt; 1930, the rates aforestated were the fares charged by applicant sine* the said 10th day of June, 1925, except that from the third day of March, 1928, m response to a strong public demand and request of applicant, tokens, under authority of the Commission, were sold three !or twenty cents. ■ During the period since June 10, 1925, applicant failed In each year to earn from its street railway revenues a fair return; durinK the years of 1928 and 1929 applicant failed to earn its operating ex - penses and fixed charges; and m the first quarter of 1930, the most profitable quarter of the year, applicant earned only ?17,i142 above operating expenses, and with which to meet the $134,32! interest charge due for such period. The Commission, therefore, finds that the operating revenues of the applicant, under the June 10, 1925, schedule of fares, would be insufficient to operate and maintain its property, and to pay the inter- 258 </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY i COMMISSION est on its bonded indebtedness; furthermore, that If default should occur m the payment of such bond interest, the appointment of a receiver would Inevitably follow, to the great and irreparable Injury of applicant, and to. the injury of the city of Omaha. Applicant company has a leasehold interest m an interstate bridge between the cities of Omaha and Council Bluffs known as the Douglas Street bridge. The revenues from this property have been impounded m an arrangement to pass title to the two cities at the end of a 6 % year period. Some suggestion was made by one of the improvement clubs that revenues from the bridge might be used to meet deficits from the Omaha street car system. Under the law, this could not be done. The Nebraska State- Railway Commission, and the city of Omaha have no jurisdiction whatsoever over the street car com - pany's interest m the Douglas Street bridge, jor m any other property m Nebraska, other than the street railway system m the city of Omaha. On the fair value of the Omaha street car system, the ap - plicant company, under the law of the land, is entitled to earn a fair return. Any revenues from any. other property may not be involved . with the operation of the street car system; even though, as In the case of the bridge revenues, they have m fact been used to help keep the street car company afloat. There is nothing In the law requiring that this be done, or permitting the Commission to compel it to be done. For a period of twelve years petitioner has not earned or been able to declare a dividend on its common stock, and tor a period of three years it has not earned or been able to declare a dividend on its preferred stock, and, unless granted increase of fares relief, applicant will be unable to meet its current interest charges. The competition to which applicant is subject has steadily grown through increased use of private automobiles, and more general use of taxicabs, with the result that the number of passengers carried by. applicant has steadily decreased. During this period of decreas - ing revenues applicant's expenses have remained practically uniform. In 1929, the wages of the trainmen were increased $65,000.00 per year, and thirty (round trip) miles of new bus lines were added, under the direction of the city council. The revenues from the operation of these busses have failed to pay the operating expenses, and have further decreased the company's revenues. For about a decade there has been a steady decline m the num - ber of passengers carried by applicant, the number of passengers carried during that period having declined from 61,650,839 m 1920, to 41,426,482 m 1929, notwithstanding the population of the city has steadily increased. In the first quarter of 1930 there was a fur- 259 </seg>
            <seg id="p268">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT ther falling off m passengers carried, m comparison with the first quarter of 1929, m excess of eight per cent. . As no market has existed for applicant's securities tl c necessary additions and betterments, since the year 1914, have been paid for out of its depreciation reserve, with the result that applicant's cash has been greatly depleted. Some criticism was directed at the salary paid Pres dent Shan - nahan, same having been increased from $20,000 whi :h was the amount paid him at the time he became president, to $30,000. The salary of General Manager Porter has also been increased from $12, - -000.00 per annum to $15,000.00. At the time of the heiring, Com - missioner Randall commented respecting .these items, anl suggested that the increase should be paid by the bondholders. ' 'here is, o.f course, always serious question as to how far this Com nission can ' go m substituting its judgment for the judgment of the management of the company, respecting what are fair and reasonable salaries. However, for the purposes of this case, it is entirely .unnecessary to reach conclusions as to whether these salaries are so high as to justify Commission action. If the president and general m mager were to donate their services to the company, and the amounts of their salary annually be dedicated to the net' earnings, applicant would still lack $29,581 of earning bond interest, based upon its experience m the year 1929, under the then prevailing rates. Such being the case, any revision of salaries which this Commission n ight order, could m no wise affect the rate base and Commission conclusions re - specting same. As of 1928, it would still lack $45,773.00 of earning interest on bonds. In other words, the emergency order which this Com Mission has entered m this matter, would have been necessary had no salaries been paid either the president or the general manager. Giving con - sideration to the rate schedule authorized herein, the amount of salaries paid to these two named officers, is of interest, n a degree at least, to the stockholders. Since December 31, 1919, applicant has expended for iiropevty re - placements $1,881,890.00 and for additions and betterments (net) $1,159,370.57. During all of this period the maintenance of the property has been well kept up, the expenditures therefor being $2, - -904,268.27, and the street railway system is m first class operating condition. As price levels applicable to street railway construction remained uniform for several years, and are of as high- a level as oi the period of this Commission's December 31, 1919, valuation, applicant's prop - 260 </seg>
            <seg id="p269">. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION erty, for the purpose ot. this hearing, may well be assumed to be worth at least as much as ot December 31, 1919, the date on which the $13,800,000.00 valuation was fixed, and with working capital of $300,000 added, makes a total of $14,100,000 on which the com - pany should be permitted to earn a fair return. Applicant has petitioned for an order authorizing it to charge the following schedule of fares: I— All cash fares 10 cents. 2 — All token fares— 3 tokens for 25 cents. 3 — Children under five years ot age carried free. Comparison of these fares with fares prevailing m other cities show that the fares m force m Omaha, prior to the emergency order, were materially lower than the average fares m cities ot the same general class m this section of the country. The schedule of fares asked for by the company did not make any provision for reduced fares for children between the ages of 5 and 12 years. It is a universal rule with common carriers that children between these ages shall be permitted to ride for one-half the fares charged to adult passengers. The Commission has applied this rule m fixing the schedule of fares. The added revenue which such increased tares may produce will haraiy exceed applicant's annual interest charges, and, m all prob - ability, will afford very little, if any, return to the stockholders ot applicant, notwithstanding the annual saving m operating expenses hereafter m the amount of $125,000 annually by reason of purchasing its power under contract. The rates approved m this order are based upon the absolute necessities ot the present situation. The Commis - sion will follow the case closely to the e«d..that best possible service to the patrons may be given m return tor the fare authorized. We therefore, deem it advisable that m the future no service changes be made involving substantial increases m operating costs or capital investments, without such changes having been first approved by this Commission. Applicant company is. annually subjected to an occupation tax, the charge being three per cent of the gross annual revenues. This tax for the last ten years has averaged approximately $100,000 per year. Applicant is also subjected to the expense of paving between its rails. In the last ten years this expense has averaged $54,000 per year. As these two charges are special charges imposed upon the street car company, and under the law, m turn authorized to be col - lected as expenses from the street car riders, the practical result is that an annual burden of approximately $154,000 is imposed upon the 261 </seg>
            <seg id="p270">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT street car riders ol the city of Omaha; and, to that extent, thoße citizens fortunately able to ride m their own automobiles are saved that amount of tax expense. As there seems to be little, if any, hope of adding to revenues through increasing the number of i :ar riders, the only practicable method of avoiding or minimizing further in - creases m fares is through reduction of expenses. Here is an obvious place and opportunity to reduce the company's expenses approximately $154,000 and thereby assist the car riders to that extent. The Commission re-affirms their suggestion made at tie time of the hearing that the increase m salary granted to the president and general manager should be paid by the bondholders. If tl is is done It will reduce the amount which the company lacks of paying a fair return.

COMMISSIONER RANDALL PRESIDING (Entire Commission Sitting.) MINORITY REPORT MILLER Commissioner, dissenting: . I dissent from the opinion and order entered m this application, for the following reasons: 1. That not enough time between the filing of the application and the granting of it was taken to make a careful study of the op - erating conditions surrounding the operation of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway, :-. 2. That increases m salaries of officers were not justi cd. 262 </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 3. That the effect of this order will affect the transportation of thousands of school children. 4. That the cost of producing power is considerably leas now than m 1925. 5. That the Increase of expenditures for advertising campa gns is greater than is justified. 6. That halt of the. operating revenues, expenses and investment of the bridge over the Missouri River should be credited to the trac - tion company operating m Omaha. 7. The operating expenses m connection with the operation of the street cars can be materially reduced by the use ot one man care. 8. That the occupation tax should be reduced or set aside I feel that a proper investigation should have been made ot the entire property used and useful now m service of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs. Street Railway. That the cost of the properties should jbe brought down to date. As to the investment depreciated, that a care - ful study might have shown where the service could have been cur - tailed to great advantage. A study involving these things would take three to six months, and such a. study should have been made before the rates were increased. In my opinion $20,000 is a fair salary for the president of a com - pany of this size, and that $10,000 per year is a fair salary for a gen - eral manager. If this is true, there is $15,000 that could be used for other things. The board of directors should be criticised for allow - ing such increases, knowing that the company was m bad financial condition. I agree with the majority report that the bondholders should pay this increase out of their own pockets, if they desire to give these officers an increase. This Commission has always laid down the principle that children over five years of age and under twelve years of age should ride on half fare, and I see no reason why this principle should not apply m this case. Why increase the burden of the parents ot school chil - dren almost double? There are thousands ot school children who ride the cars both ways five days per week, which will mean a con - siderable amount m the due course of a school year. Heads ot fam - ilies of a large per. cent of these children are laboring men and any increase will be an added burden on them, as they are compelled to count their nickels m trying to make both ends meet, and it is certain that the increased burden will fall on this class ot people. The man a little better off will use his own car to take his children to school and return them, rather than pay the increased rates. 263 </seg>
            <seg id="p272">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT When the Commission made the investigation back m 1925, the street car company manufactured their own power or energy. It was considered at that time reasonable, and the rates -vrere partly based on the cost of power production. The company testified that they can buy their power now at a saving of $125,000 per year. This, if anything, should have a tendency to lower the fares. In previous years, advertising has run not to exceed $2,500 per year, and now all at once it has. jumped to $30,000 per year. lam un - able to see where it is necessary to spend $30,000 per ysar for ad - vertising that has been taken care of heretofore for $2,5H0. It cer - tainly has not increased the passenger business m the saiie ratio or relationship. This item, among the many, could be reduced back to the $2,500 per year. People will ride the street cars, regardless of what advertising the company may put out, that is, if they so de - sire. It is my understanding that the street car offlcia s and em - ployees use their own automobiles to come and go to and from their work. Instead of using their own cars I think they should ride the street cars, on a reduced fare. This of itself would brii.g m some additional revenues. ' I feel that even though the majority did take the pc sition that they had no control over the bridge company, that half of the bridge investment, the expenses and revenues of this bridge, should be carried m the accounts of the Omaha &amp;. Council Bluffs Street Rail - way Company, for the Omaha side, for the reason that this state line extends to the center of the Missouri River. I am unable to understand why the one-man cars caniiot be suc - cessfully operated m Omaha as well as other cities. Usiig Lincoln as an example, Lincoln has operated one-man cars for ths past five or six years. It may be that this kind of operation will sow up the service to some extent, but it will also cut down expense; i, and this must necessarily result if street car service continues m Onaha. In my opinion, it the city of Omaha is so vitally interested m its street car system, and desired to help maintain its service, they should get together under whatever procedure is necessary- and reduce the occupation tax of $100,000 per year and/or set it aside lor two or three years. The city could also assume part of the new paving, as well as the repairing of the paving between the tracks of th( street car company. It is my observation that this paving is used more- by automobiles and trucks than by the street cars. THEREFORE, the application should be denied until, a careful in - vestigation is made and the matter of the bridge investment allocated on a proper basis. 264 </seg>

OPINION' AND FINDING DRAKE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing at Hartington, Nebraska on September 24, 1930, after due notice, upon application of the Cedar County Farmers Telephone company for an increase m exchange rates at its Hartington exchange, as follows: 265 </seg>

Applicant submitted for the record a resolution of the chamber of commerce as of March 4, 1930, wherein hey unani - mously endorsed the improved service, and approved the Increase In rates for city service if and when the Improvements shoull be made. None of the subscribers appeared at the hearing to offer objections to the new type of service or the rate adjustment. Harcington and community are progressive and are desirous of a more c ficient and speedier type of telephone service. The rates applied for are more favorable to the subscriber than those m force m many other cities of like size and for the class of service rendered. The increase m rates does not affect the rural service. The new switchboard is m place and all necessary central office changes have been made, and the patrons are now enjoyiig the new service. Data submitted by applicant shows a book cost of $79,476.56 as of January 1, 1930.. This figure is based on a valua ion by the Commission m 1916 and spread on the books of the company at that time, under the supervision of the Commission's accounting depart - ment, and has been kept m accordance with its rules and egulations. The new equipment m plant has been installed at a grass cost of $11,179.62. At the present time it is impossible to make any ac - curate estimate of the removals but this will be done ii due time, using the proper accounting practices by making the pro &gt;er charges to the plant account and the depreciation reserve. This will no doubt result m a larger fixed investment. The depreciation reserve account on January 1, 1930 was $23, - -909.92. Applicant's manager testified . that the book cost less de- 266 </seg>
            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION preclation would be approximately $53,000. and m his opinion that figure represented a fair value of the plant prior to the installation of improvements. It follows that with the gross addition of the new property m amount of $11,179.62 and charging the depreciation re - serve with the removal of old property at book cost, the" condition per cent and fair value would be increased. The Commission concludes «/, n n c n PUrP ° 8e ° f thls case the fair value would b * m excess of the ?53,000 figure suggested by applicant's witness. Applicants sets forth annual telephone revenues and expenses for a five-year period and the Commission finds these figures to be fair and conservative. The salaries of officers and clerks are especially low. and other expenses including the maintenance and depreciation account are lower than the average of telephone companies under like circumstances. Applicant proposes to further improve its farm lines by cutting the lines with the largest number of subscribers into two lines, and to recondition all rural property m general. In the event the proposed increase becomes effective, the annual revenue, based upon present number of stations, less maintenance and depreciation figured upon an eight per cent basis and direct operating expenses including taxes, will. not produce m excess of a fair return upon the fair value of the telephone property used and useful m the service of the public. ■ Applicant filed this application on May 23. 1930, setting out plan of improvements and requesting a finding and order if and when such improvements had been. made. The record now shows that the plant has been cut over to common battery and patrons are enjoying the new service. It is the opinion of the Commission that the rates requested are reasonable, and that an emergency exists, and applicant should be authorized to publish and collect the new schedule of rates on October 1, 1930.

Petitioner has applied to this Commission for a permit to issue and sell its common stock m the face amount of $249,700 to pay for the property and assets of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone company of Alma, clear of all liens and encumbrances and floating obligations. This requires that 147 shares of the stock shall be sold to net the applicant not less than face value to provide the cash to pay for existing indebtedness of the Alma, company. The matter came on to be heard m the offices of the Commission on June 24 and Sep. tember 18, 1930. The Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone company owns the exchanges at Alma, Orleans, Republican City and Stamford m Nebraska, also the exchanges at Woodruff and Long Island m Kansas. All ot these ex - changes are connected for operating purposes. Applicant offered a complete inventory and appraisal of the physical property of these exchanges on the basis of their reproduction cost new as of November 1, 1929, m the sum of $297,229.45, and less deterioration m the amount of $253,121. Right-of-way was included m the above m the sum of ?3.050. also going concern m the amount ot $26,534 The value found for right-of-way was the estimated cost of securing the consent of property owners to the construction ot pole lines m streets alleys and highways.. The -legislature of this state has granted com - munication companies the right to construct pole lines on the high - ways and the franchises iv villages and towns include the right to set poles m streets and alleys. The constitution of the state prohibits the capitalization of any value for going concern, therefore, these amounts will be excluded for the purpose of this case. The company's estimate of deterioration does not include all the elements of depreciation which come about through age m service, in - adequacy and obsolescence. Progress m the art and science of the manufacture of telephone materials and equipment require replace - ment of the various units ot plant to provide modern standards of service, regardless of repairs and replacements. . The assistant engineer, of the Commission checked the quantities of physical property of these exchanges m the field and found the estimated cost new to be $258,201.70, not Including any value for right-of-way and going concern, and found the same property, less 269 </seg>
            <seg id="p278">TWENTY-THIRP ANNUAL REPORT depreciation to hare the value of 5190,825, giving effect to all elements ot depreciation. Neither of the appraisals include additions and bet - terments to plant between November 1, 1929, and March 31, 1930, m the sum of $1,554.00 which occurred after the inventory was taken. The operating statement of the Alma company was. based on the actual revenues and expenses for the year ended March 31, 1930, which include the charge to expenses for maintenance an 1 deprecia - tion as ordered by the Commission. This shows a net available for surplus and dividends m the sum of $4,493. These expenses also include interest on indebtedness which will be paid from the proceeds of the stock sold for cash. The company's property includes an exchange buildin r, arid two lots at Alma, only a part ot which are used for telephon 5 purposes. However, the rentals are included m the revenues. This situation might suggest the prudence of including all of the property m finding a value of the property used and useful f or . rate-makini ; purposes, but the rule is that such property may be included m the values for purposes of capitalization where it is not clearly separate! from the facilities used by the public. The investment accounts of the Alma company started from the estimated cost new of the properties as found by the Commission m 1918, to which have been added the additions and betterments to date, as disclosed by the company's annual report for the year 1929. A large part of the property including the building, switchboard, central office equipment, telephones and the like have not been re - placed, as well as a substantial amount of the outside plant. There - fore, it is conservative to say that 70 per cent of the. bock value ot the property does not reflect the rise m price levels which h is occurred since 1918. It is also true that the price paid for the stock when it was sold a few years ago can not be used as a measure of the physical values involved as it was sold subject to the outstanding 1 abilities of the company and all of the local and market conditions which might affect the judgment of the purchaser and owners of the stock. Giving effect to the purchase of the properties of the Alma com - pany, the balance sheet of the Nebraska Continental Telephone com - pany shows that it will have assets m the amount of $1,9 24,671. In the liabilities we find the property represented by $1,579,7 0 m stock, of which $1,179,700 is common. Working and accrued liabilities amount to only $95,968.00 and the company will have a c epreciation reserve of $222,736. The company had no mortgaged indebtedness and the new stock will not be sold to the public, but will be held by the officers and stockholders of the Continental company. 270 </seg>

            <seg id="p280">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT for authority to cancel the present commodity rate of five cents per 100 pounds on ice moving from Omaha to Lincoln. - At tie time of the hearing the application was amended to include ths Missouri Pacific R. R. Corporation m Nebraska. The prayer of the applicants asks for an order permitting them to cancel the rate of five cents per .100 pounds on ice from Omaha to Lincoln as established m our order m Formal Complaint N&gt;. 612 (22 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Rep. 180-189), and to substitute in' 11 ju thereof the scale rate established by order of this Commission m i application No. 7896 (22 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Rep. 399-403), which fir the dis - tance from Omaha to Lincoln, would make a rate of six and one - half cents per 100 pounds. In Formal Complaint No. 609, dated December 1, 132S (21 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Rep. 166-173), and as supplemented, we authorized all Nebraska lines to establish a distance scale of rates on ice from Omaha to Nebraska points within a distance of 200 miles, this scale to apply during the so-called summer months. In .entering this order, it was our thought that this scale would cover any sporadic movement . that might take place and would, at the same time, servj to place all lines operating out of Omaha on the same rate level. The rate under this scale for a distance of 55 miles, which is the. d stance be. - tween Omaha and Lincoln on the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. would ie six and one-half cents per 100 pounds. In Formal Complaint No. 612, dated July 16, 1929, ! upra, and Supplement No. 1, dated August 6, 1929, we ordered the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. and the C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. to establish a commod ly rate of fjve cents per 100 pounds on ice moving from Omaha to Lincoln, and also ordered reparation on certain shipments. In that ord sr we also prescribed a minimum weight of. 55,000 pounds. Here we took into consideration the volume of the movement and the small amount of claims. In our conclusions we discussed the condition of ars used m the transportation of ice from Omaha to Lincoln and sugj ested that this matter, relative to the condition of these cars "should "be given proper attention by the carrier." We also stated that while "we, of course, are aware of the fact that during the summer months there ,vill not be a constant shipment during the whole period &lt;&gt;f a' maxl - :num number of cars per day" . . . "if this average should r m as high as two cars per day this fact would appear to justify a reduction- in :he rates established by us m Formal Complaint No. 609." Witness J. B. Dviggs, assistant general freight agent of the C. B. ifc Q. R. R. Co., presented at R. 6,- Application No. 8476, Exhibit .No. 'B", showing the volume of movement of ice on the C. B. &lt;fc Q. R.

This exhibit also shows the number of broken cakes m each car on which claims have been fUed but have not as yet been paid. Mr. Driggs, at R. 10, testified that claims paid on ice for the system m 1929 were only .83 of one per cent of the freight revenue, while M r. Rawlings has filed claims on these 216 cars amounting to U. 5 8% ; of the frelght revenue . These cla , ma&gt; how nay been paid. (R. 10) At page 20, Witness Driggs, testined that he knew of no move - ment on any other commodity from Omaha to Lincoln that would amount to over 1.77 cars per day. Mr. Fred J. R ue th, testified at page 32, that ice was shipped out of Omaha up to the 15th of June. 1930, but practically nothing after that date due to an ice shortage. Mr. Rawlings, testified as to the condition of the cars generally used for the movement of ice, stating m substance, that such cars *ere m a deplorable condition (R. 34). Mr. Rawlings also stated that due to the floor conditions and bulging sides of certain cars, ice will not carry well and is easily broken. The fact was also developed that on at least one of the cars on which claim was filed the car was broken at Ashland and that that car was almost a total loss (R 35). witness also testified that about 130 cars for the season of 1930 had been shipped into Lincoln over the Missouri Pacific (R. 37). Mr. Bergen appeared on behalf of the Metropolitan Utilities Dis - trict of Omaha and testified that shipments of ice had been made to Mr. Rawlings at Lincoln and that the movement had been three to Jive cars per day; that after the first day ot July the tonnage fell off to nothing. CONCLUSIONS 1. That while we have no jurisdiction over the damage claims referred to m this proceeding, it would appear from the evidence sub - mitted that the carriers have not taken proper steps to put this class of equipment into shape for the movement of ice. as suggested by us m Formal Complaint No. 612. In our opinion, the correction of these conditions would very materially reduce the damage claim figure of 11.58% of the freight revenue, making it much closer to the figure of .83 of 1% of the freight revenue; 273 </seg>

That the average movement of 1.77 plus cars per diy between these two points for the seasonal movement m 1929 was an exception - ally heavy movement of ice, and, m our opinion, should be entitled to a commodity rate lower than a distance rate established to take care of only an occasional movement.

Business, 1 party $4.50 Residence, 1 party 2.50 Residence, 2 party 2.00 Rates for special service and switching will not be changed. Applicant owns the town portion of the exchange, which is now operated full metallic with magneto central office equipment. -The farm lines are owned by the rural subscribers and switched by the company. The rates for farm service are not involved m this ap - plication. The company's outside plant consists of underground and aerial cable installed m recent years and the central office equipment is out-worn, obsolete and inadequate to supply the quality of service demanded by the public. The company owned stations m service at the time of the hearing was 405, not including the farm stations re - ceiving switching service, which amount to 520. The necessity for replacing the switchboard was selected as a fa - vorable time to change the class of service from magneto to common battery. The town subscribers o£ the exchange were solicited and the company secured the written consent of practically all of the subscribers to the proposed change m the class of service, and the increase m rates. The chamber of commerce of Cozad, also passed a resolution approving the company's application. No protestants ap - peared at the time of the hearing. The company's books were set up m 1923 on the basis of the estimated original cost of the physical property m the amount of $22,787. Additions and betterments to date of application have been taken into the investment account under the accounting rules pre - scribed by the Commission m the amount of $9,206, as required to supply the growing demand for service. Deductions, or plant removed by reason of the change to common battery will amount to $12,172. The plant added including the switchboard and new telephones m so far as they may be necessary, also changes m the outside plant will amount to $25,930. This results m a net book figure of $45,750 estimated cost new for the physical property and $47,750 including working capital. The company has accumulated a credit m its depreciation reserve m the sum of $9,960. This will be wiped out, including a part of the company's surplus reserve by the cost of the plant removed from service. 275 </seg>
            <seg id="p284">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT In so far as construction had proceeded at the time of the hear-: ing, the actual cost experienced exceeded the estimates wl ich were made a part of the record. The company's franchises will not ex - pire for twenty-three years and the company's public relations ap - pear to be excellent. In so far as these things are elements of value, they were not included. . ':..| Applicant's estimate ot gross revenues under the proposed schedule of rates, including all classes ot service was prepared on the baßls of 422 company owned stations m service. At the time of ths hearing this number had been reduced to 405. Giving effect to the loss m telephones m service, the revenues become approximately $1 3,500 per annum. Operating expenses, including maintenance and depreciation, interest and taxes will be approximately $14,878 providing net earn - ings available for dividends or surplus m the amount of ?3,6 &gt;5, which is approximately seven per cent on the estimated original cbst of the plant m service, including working capital. Current rates of interest m this locality run as high as eight per cent.

Extensive repairs are also necessary to maintain the high grade ot service which it has been the policy of the company to offer. Many of the telephones now m service, especially on the rural lines will also have to be replaced. Therefore, this is an opportune time to change the class of service if desired. An expression m writing, of the patrons of the exchange was taken which shows that approximately 85% of all the subscribers desired automatic service, and were willing to pay the proposed ra es. These were divided as follows: business subscribers 89%; individual resi - dence 90%; party line residence 78% and rural subscribers 85%. Al - though the change m service will not be made immediately, it was necessary to secure the approval of the Commission before the con - tracts could be let for the purchase of the new equipment. Applicant's investment accounts were set up on the bcoks of the company m 1920, on the basis of the' original cost of the property of the Wisner and Beemer exchanges as found by the Commission. This cost has been continued to date under the accounting rules prescribed by the Commission, and the actual cost of the fixed investment m both exchanges as of December 31, 1929, is $115,992.66. When work - ing capital is added it becomes $119,434.47. Approximately 75% of this amount, or $90,000.00, represents the investment m the Wisner exchange. The operating statement shows that after all expenses the net earnings of the company for the year ended December 31, 1929, was $1,676.25, or approximately 1.4% on the actual cost of tie property, and not to exceed 2 % on the investment, less the depxeciat: on reserve. This has been accomplished by exercising strict economy m operating expenses. The company has paid dividends at the rate of 7% an - nually on its capital stock m the amount of $61,797.00, or $432.58 for the year 1929. The difference between dividends paid and net earnings have been credited to surplus and invested m new plant. The net additions and betterments which will be required for the proposed change to automatic service at Wisner will amount to ap - proximately $11,088, after deducting from the plant account all the property removed from service. The Increase m revenut under the proposed schedule of rates will amount to $3,207, and the increase m operating expenses will be $3,689, which means that ths net earn - ings for the Wisner exchange will be approximately $400 less under the new schedule of rates, after the proposed changes .m plant have been made, than it was for the year 1929. 278 </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Under these conditions the Commission does not find it necessary to find the lair value of the property, giving effect to the proposed changes m plant, as net earnings under the proposed rates will be well below the rates established by the courts arid commissions of this country. The Commission believes and so finds that the proposed rates for the new service will be reasonably required to pay operating expenses, including fixed charges and the present dividend rate on the stock outstanding.

            <seg id="p288">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Commissioner: This application is made by the Railway Express Agency if Omaha relative to the service to be furnished at their South Omaha Station. On August 26. 1927. the company made application to d scontinue delivery from their South Omaha station and make delivlry direct from their Omaha station, only using the South Omaha si ation for the storage of such express as was not delivered, or was forwarded to parties outside of the delivery zone, packages to be left there to De called for by the consignee after receiving notice from the] company that there was express at that office addressed to them. The company put into operation the delivering of express direct from their Omaha station to the patrons of South Omaha vho were within the delivery zone. This system seemed to give satisfaction to the patrons as no complaints had been received by the Commission of the service rendered by the company. On August 20, 1930, the Railway Express Agency madl applica - tion to the Commission to change their office facilities at South Omaha from the Union Pacific, depot that had been used by the company as an express office, to some point up town m the vicinity cf 24th &amp; O Streets. The application states that the receiving agencj will be benefited with a convenient place for the shippers to leive their packages and obtain receipts therefor. All Vehicles from Omaha will gather up the business left at this agency twice a day, (jonveying It to the Omaha terminals for forwarding m the same mannJr as now handled from their office at the depot. ■'. The application states further that as the present pick-ul and de - livery service pretty well covers the entire South Omaha section, there is not very much business brought to the office and for uhe same reason the on-hand business delivered through the office is negligible and is addressed to patrons residing beyond the pick-up delivery limits. This new arrangement also contemplates holding at the city) office m Omaha, at 1308 Farnam, the undelivered business for the South Omaha section. Postal notices will be mailed to consignees of un - delivered shipments for that section, indicating thereon thl address of the Farnam Street office where they may call for the same, ex - cept that it would be provided that consignees may request the Far - nam Street office to send the shipments to the South Omaha office where consignees may obtain the same by calling for it. Whore pack - ages are sent to consignees outside of the delivery zone, consignees may notify the South Omaha agent that they desire the packlge to be sent from the Farnam Street office where they may obtain the same 280 </seg>

This service of notifying the Farnam Street office can be done either by card or phone, or by making application to the agent at the South Omaha station without, any expense whatever to the consignee. It appears to the Commission that if this change is made it will be a decided advantage to not only the shippers but to the receivers of express as the office will be up town m a more convenient location than at present and the service will be practically the same between the South Omaha Station and the Omaha Station, and the point from which the articles are to be shipped from Omaha. An order will be issued m compliance with the application, subject to written com - plaint from interested shippers and receivers of express and if the arrangements suggested m the body of the order are not satisfactory the Commission will require the express company to make any reason - able changes to bring about more satisfactory conditions. • ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Railway Express Agency of Omaha, be and the same is hereby permitted to move their express office from the pres - ent location of the Union Pacific depot to an up town office on 24th street to be conveniently located between "L" an,d "O" streets on 24th street, South Omaha, service to be rendered m accordance with the conditions stated m the application and m the body of the order.

CHAIRMAN RANDALL PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: • Applicant herein is a public service corporation engaged m the telephone business and owns and operates the exchange 1 Bruno It has purchased the stock of the Farmers Telephone Company of Abie and has applied to this Commission for a permit to consolidate the two exchanges. Petitions were circulated ■by the applicant and the written consent of more than sixty per cent of the subscribers of the Abie exchange was secured to the proposed, consolidation. The Abie exchange is located approximately four miles north of Bruno and is serving about 100 subscribers and has free service with Bruno. The Bruno exchange is serving approximately 150 subscrib - ers and has free service with Bf-ainard, David City, Dwight, Garrison and Octavia. The subscribers at Abie desire the additional free ser - vice to nearby exchanges, enjoyed by the patrons of the B-uno ex - change. The central office at Bruno is a substantial fire proof brick build - ng, large enough to house the, new central office equipment which will be required for the proposed consolidation of service, the lines of both exchanges are metallic with the possible exception of ,i few on nn 6 n ?, ? XChanee - TheSe ■ wUI l be made metallic an d the rJrar lines on the Abie exchange will be limited to ten subscribers to confirm with the practice at Bruno. : T. The rates m the Abie exchange are, one party ', businesl 42 00 residence $1.50, and rural $1.50 ; . The same rates apply at tie Bruno exchange with the exception that business one party is $3 0 ) Peti tioner proposes to discontinue the one party business rate at Abie and substitute a special six party business rural rate of. $2 50 per month. Subscribers of the Abie exchange will also have 24-hour service, seven days a week, whereas they have had a service limited to certain hours per day and restricted service on Sunday Th 3 service 282 </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION on the Abie exchange has been poor due to insufficient maintenance, overloaded farm lines and limited hours of service. The Commission believes and so finds that consolidation of the exchanges is reasonably required for the development and mainten - ance ot both exchanges and the perpetuation of the service, as set forth by the applicant. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company of Lincoln, be and the same is hereby permitted to consolidate the prop - erty and service of its exchanges at Bruno and Abie, under the rates' and rules of service now m force at its Bruno exchange. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant is hereby permitted to offer a special six party. business rural rate at its Bruno exchange after the consolidation, for which it may charge the net amount of $2.50 per month. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the rates now m effect at the Bruno exchange, including the six-party business rural rate, referred to above, shall not apply to the Abie subscribers before December 1, 1936, and only if and when the properties have been consolidated and applicant is prepared to supply the service "of the Bruno exchange to the former subscribers of the Abie exchange.

OPINION AND FINDING DRAKE, Commissioner: Applicant company owns and controls thirteen exchanges m the state of Nebraska. It alleges that these exchanges have b&lt; en bought recently from various other interests. An investigation of the flies of this Commission shows various different rates and rules authorized at the different exchanges, and applicant requests that for the pur - poses of uniform accounting and centralization of bookkeeping and supervision, that the gross and net rate rule and discount leriod and charges for installation and changes m service connections should be the same at all exchanges. A search of the records of this Commission discloses th&lt;i following conditions to prevail at the various exchanges of this company: ■ .1 ■-.',. Bloomfleld (762 subscribers) No gross and net rate rule. Callaway (253 subscribers) Discount period expires 1 )th of mo. Crofton (463 subscribers) Discount period expires 1 )th of mo.

            <seg id="p293">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION changes, requesting such period to expire on the 10th of the month at each of such exchanges. Applicant further asks authority to publish and collect various ■amounts for service connection charges. The Commission at this time will not consider that part of this application, for the reason that its Resolution No. 50, which has been effective since December 1, 1921, is m full force and effect, and covers all points raised m this application m that connection. - ■. •*■ The gross and net rate rule has beeii authorized at practically all exchanges m Nebraska by this Commission, and is considered a cor - rect and proper rule. That rule is now m effect at ten of the above named stations. The gross and.net rate rule is now m effect at two of the stations, namely: Ewing and Page, with the 15th of the month as the exSration date. The record discloses that at Bloomfleld, there is no grjfe and net rate rule, it is the opinion of the Commission that thepross and net rate rule should be applied at Bloomfleld, the same as at other exchanges, and that the discount period date at all exchanges should be made the 10th of the month. Applicant requests that the discount period on rural service be made the end of the first month where customers are billed quarterly. Paragraph 9 of the application deals with the switching of rural lines. The rule requested by applicant appears to be very broad, in - asmuch as they do not specifically ask for a definite payment date. A study of the records of this office covering other exchanges m Ne - braska shows that a majority of companies collect switching charges semi-annually, and that such charges are collected from the switched line through its officers or agents, and not from individual members of such switched line organizations. It is a well-recognized rule that the switched line organization should be made responsible for all its members, and held accountable to the company performing the switch - ing service, but that ten days notice before cutting off the line is probably too drastic and that a reasonable time must be allowed the switched company for payment. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Western Telephone Corporation be and the same is hereby 'authorized and directed to put into effect the gross and net rate rule at its exchanges at Bloomfleld, Callaway, Crofton, Ewing, Lynch, Monowi, Oconto, Osmond, Page, Stapleton, Verdel, Verdigre and Wausa, with the discount period on the 10th of the month. 285 </seg>

APPLICATION NO. 8045 In the matter of the application of the South Side Irrigation Company of Cozad, for authority to charge and collect increased rates for service. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein owns and operates an irrigation system near Cozad, Nebraska, and supplies water for sale to the public for irri - gation purposes to land under its canal. The stock of the company Is owned by twelve farmers who are water users, and tho water is. also sold to the public as it may be available. The annual mainten - ance rate per acre has been $1.00, and rental water per acre $3.00. Petitioner has applied for an Increase of fifty cents annually, for each clasa of consumers. The service revenues for the years 1928, 1929 and 1930 have been substantially below the expenses, and the company is now laced with deferred maintenance that -will .cost a substantial sum. The total number of acres watered m 1928 was 3,025; m 1929 — 3,717 and 1930 — 2,940. On an average basis of 3,000 acres Irrigated annually the increase m rates would amount to $1,500.00, which appears to be required for expenses and a small return on the investment. No dividends have been paid on the stock outstanding, except m the years 1926 and 1927. The increased rates will be approved as they appear to be re - quired for the purposes of the corporation, subject to the provision that no protest is filed by the water users under the canal within sixty days from the date of this order, otherwise the rates shall become permanent. 286 </seg>

APPLICATION NO. 8052 In the matter of the application of the Lincoln Traction Company for authority to abandon street car service on the Havelock and Uni - versity Place lines, and substitute busses therefor; and to abandon both service and physical property of applicant's two lines between 27th and Clinton, and 27th and Leighton Streets. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This action originates upon application of the Lincoln Traction company for authority to abandon certain of its street car service on the Havelock and University Place line; for authority to abandon its physical properties now m existence on its two lines between 27th and Clinton and 27th and Leighton Streets, and the authority to sub - stitute bus service tor the service now being rendered by electric street cars. Quoting from the application, the request respecting abandonment is as follows: "Applicant now desires and requests authority to abandon street railway service along the following route m the city of Lincoln, Neb. to-wit: from 27th and 0 Streets to 27th and Leigh- 287 </seg>

The above mentioned route and streets are occupied by the rails of Lincoln Traction Company over which the Havilock and University Place street cars now operate. Applicant further requests authority for track and service abandonment on 27th Street m the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, from Clinton Street to Leighton Street — a distance of seven blocks." The application comes as a result of action on the part cf the city Commissioners of the city of Lincoln m creating a paving ( istrlct on 27 th street between Clinton and Leighton Streets, such paving involv - ing approximately seven blocks of double track of applicant's street railway properties. It is estimated and the evidence shows, that If applicant is to share m the expense of this paving, as a result of its tracks being located on the streets m question, as above l amed, its portion of the paving costs will be, approximately, .$35,0 90. This ' situation occasions the request for abandonment of street railway service and of properties. It is stated very emphatically by applicant, through General Man - ager Helny, that it is. financially impossible for applicant o assume this financial burden, involved m the paying of this district. As evi - dence of this fact, it submits certain studies and exhibits pointing to the decline m revenue, and passengers from year to year. Exhibit A consists of a comparison of passengers handled on dif - ferent railway lines for the first ten months of 1930, as comi ared with the first ten months of 1929. This exhibit shows a decrease of pas - sengers carried on all lines of 346,253.. The University Place line shows as follows: • 1020 1030 Decrease 347,846 307,261 40,585 Havelock line shows as follows: 1020 1030 Decrease 472,190 365,920 106,270 Exhibit C is a comparative statement of railway operating revenues and expenses for the first ten months of 1929, as 'compared with the first ten months of 1930, and is as follows: . 288 </seg>

Exhibit D sets forth the revenue per car mile for the first nine months of 1929, as compared with the first nine months of 1930, for each of applicant's lines. In each instance, the revenue per car mile is less for, the 1930 period than for the 1929 period. The University Place line for this period shows a per car mile revenue tor 1930 of .2097, and .2327 for 1929, or a decrease of .0230. The Havelock line for this period shows a per car mile revenue for 1930 of .1739, and .2247 for 1929, or a decrease of .0508. The testimony of General Manager Heiny, respecting the present financial condition of the company, appears to be important. In this connection he said: "Q. Has the Lincoln Traction Company any money m the bank or on hand, or any way to raise any money except from Us associated companies? A. No sir. Q. Are you still paying the city ot Lincoln paving obligations of the past ten years? A. Yes sir, we owe the jcity approximately $18,000. Q. I stated m my few remarks at the outset that your total taxing obligations were 'approximately ?43, 000.00, is that correct? A. That is correct, yes sir. 289 </seg>

I cannot, it will eventually force the Traction Com - pany into receivership, no doubt." . This Commission is entirely familiar with the constant decline m passengers and the resultant reduction m revenue which confronts the applicant from year to year. It recognizes that m tle face of marked economies, which have been effected m many different ways, it is confronted with a constant problem of securing enougi revenues to continue to meet fixed charges. The record shows tie bonded indebtedness of the applicant to be'sBoo,ooo. Annual and ixed inter- - est charges upon this fixed debt are $40,000. The record shows that under existing revenues, and there appears to be no prom se for im - provement, applicant will find It difficult, if not impossible, to pay its bond interest. The evidence also shows that applicant has paid no dividends for a number of years; but on the contrary unde" prior un - derstandings with this Commission has put back into its traction properties every cent over and above expenses and taxes m the past five years and m addition some new or borrowed capital m the aggre - gate sum of about $275,000. The problem is not one pecvliar to the Lincoln company, although it may be somewhat more severe with it. Throughout the entire country, street railway companies are con - fronted with a serious financial situation. Regulatory bodies have found it necessary to grant them wide discretionary power m matters relating to operation and service, that flxed charges may :&gt;e met. It 290 </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION seems apparent that the applicant should not be required to con - tribute to the paving program m the district herein Involved. The record does not disclose any such demand on the part of the city commissioners nor does there appear to 'be any demand on the part of patrons, of the company, that it be required to stand this expense. The Commission certainly feels that every effort should be made by It, and by all interested parties to avert the possibility of any ultimate receivership. It is the opinion of the Commission, however, that the routing of the busses, as proposed by the applicant, does not satisfactorily serve a certain section of the city, which is now served by street railway cars. However, because of the present condition of certain streets, which/must be traversed by these busses, if this territory be accom - modated with bus service, it becomes out of the question for this Commission to compel the company to attempt this bus operation. The question of maintenance of streets and alleys of the city, is entirely outside the jurisdiction of the Commission. This Commission has no authority to order or require the improvement of such streets. This duty rests upon the city council of. the city of Lincoln. Until the streets m question are graveled or otherwise improved, to provide for all kinds of weather conditions, busses could not be operated under unfavorable weather conditions on these roads. It will be necessary, if bus operation be permitted to authorize such operation under the routes as proposed by applicant, because of the existing road con - ditions. -Applicant has advised that, if the authorization be granted, seven new busses will be put into service. It was stated that the busses will be of the same class as those now operated by applicant on the streets of Lincoln, except that they would be either a thirty-three or thirty-seven passenger bus. General' Manager Heiny testified that the frequency of service under bus operation would be practically the same as under street railway operation. He also testified that it had been his observation that bus service was more satisfactory to the • company, and the customer, than street railway service. It is regarded as a more comfortable, as well as a more flexible and certain service, than the street railway service. The Commission concludes, having m mind the facts and cir - cumstances, that the applicant should be granted the application.

As a result of this resolution, representatives of the two carriers appeared at the offices of the Commission and had a conference with Commissioner Randall and Rate Expert Powell, m which conference they showed that on class rates at the present time there is m effect joint rates between the two lines of railroad on a continuous mileage basis; that to establish rates on a distance tariff basis between stations on the two lines of railroad on live stock would m many instances, very much advance the rates that are now m effect by reason of the fact that tariffs now provide that the rates from stations on the C. &amp; N. W. to stations on the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. on live stock will be not higher than the higher Sioux City rate; that the rates on lumber and many other commodties do not move between stations on the two lines of road; that the two companies are willing to establish continuous mileage rates on grain and grain products between stations 293 </seg>

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this eighth day of Sep - tember, 1930. RESOLUTION NO. 110 In the matter of the Missouri. Valley Gas Company. BY THE COMMISSION: The Missouri Valley Gas company, a Nebraska corporation, engaged m distributing natural gas, has recently been laying a number of pipe lines m this state. It has been repeatedly reported to us that the right of way agents employed by the. company have made rep - resentations to landowners, through whose lands the pipe were designed to run, that the Nebraska State Railway Commission had given the company the right to enter and occupy private lands for rights of way for pipe lines, and had fixed the amour t to be paid therefor at twenty-five cents per lineal .rod, it apparently being pre- - sumed that the width of the strip to be taken during the installation would be about thirty feet. These reports came to the Commission so frequently that it could not properly overlook them. It, there - fore, upon its own motion, entered the following resolution: "WHEREAS, numerous persons from Gage county, and numerous persons from Jefferson county, all beinj landowners, have made complaint to this Commission that the agents of the Missouri Valley Gas company, m order to induce such persons to execute right of way contracts, and m order to secure rights of way across their lands, respectively, for the laying of pipe lines, represented to such persons and stated as facts, upon which such persons should act, that the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion had authorized said company or had granted] permission to said company to enter the state of Nebraska with its lines and to take possession of and occupy private lands for rights of way for its pipe lines, and that the Nebraska State Ra lway Commis - sion had fixed as compensation, to be paid for the taking of said land for such right of way purposes the sum of twenty-five cents per lineal rod; and "WHEREAS, the Missouri Valley Gas company has never appeared before fhis Commission for any purpode whatsoever; and 300 </seg>
            <seg id="p309">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "WHEREAS, the Commission has no jurisdiction concern - ing the securing ot rights ol way for pipe lines, and has no juris - diction to fix damages therefor, and has never attempted to exercise any such jurisdiction whatsoever; and "WHEREAS, the circulation of such statements is injurious " to the puhllc and to this Commission, and tends to bring the administration of justice into disrepute, and if such statements were made by the agents arid representatives of said company as complainants allege, it is the duty of this Commission to re - port the same to the attorney general for action against said com - pany. "THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that m order to ascer - tain what statements, if any, were made, and under what circum - stances they were made, and all of the facts concerning the same, this matter is set down for formal hearing m the offices of the Commission m the capitol at Lincoln, on the 19th day of September, 1930, at 10. o'clock a. m. "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that said company be given opportunity, if it so desire-, to appear by its officers at said time and place to give evidence as to whether or not its agents and representatives made the statements charged." Those who had made the reports as to statements of the company's agents, the officers of the company, and the public generally were given notice of the hearing. At the time of the hearing, thirty-four landowners and three officers of the company appeared. (None of the offending agents appeared.) Eleven of the landowners present were called to testify. The testimony was limited, to the representations that were made by the agents concerning the State Railway Commission. Of the witnesses called, from among the landowners, two testified directly that the right of way agents ot the company stated that the State Railway Commission had fixed the compensation for damages at twenty-flve cents per lineal rod. Several ot the landowners testified that the agents had said that the State Railway Commission had given the company permission to lay its pipes through the state. Several others testified that the agents said that the price of twenty-flve cents per lineal rod was fixed "by the state", although no particular officers of the state were named. The witnesses were interrogated at some length and were cross-examined by the counsel for the company. While the testimony lacks distinctness, due to the fact that the agents always sought to hurry the parties to sign the contracts immediately, and to the fact that some of them understood the English language only imperfectly and were not able to read the contract understand - ingly, there is sufficient testimony to show that the agents were using improper means m soliciting, and were wrongfully using the name of the State Railway Commission m that connection. Owing to the fact that the statute seems to give the Commission no power to punish 301 </seg>
            <seg id="p310">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT for contempt directly, but only by going through the courts, the Com - mission could not bring m the. implicated agents. As stated above, none ol them appeared. . As the statements of the agents were made with all assurance that they were relating facts, and as some of the landowners relied upon such statements, it is clear that some of them were misled and on that account signed the contracts. Several of them testified that they would not have signed m the absence of such statements. The company fixed an arbitrary price of ; twenty-flvis cents per lineal rod to' be paid for going across land. This is called the "rodage" charge. In addition to this the company is willing, of course, to pay for damage to crops and other property. It is clear that many ele - ments of damage cannot properly be covered where there is a fixed charge that is made applicable to all conditions. Frequently the lines run near buildings or through groves, or orchards, where the damage is difficult to determine, but it is plain that it must be considerably m excess of twenty-five cents a rod. In rough land, used only for grazing, it is conceivable that the damages might not reach that amount. The agents were given an impossible task m being re - quired to explain to landowners why a fixed amount of twenty-five cents per lineal rod was made. It is not strange that the agents sought to shift the responsibility to someone else. The Slate Railway Commission seemed to afford a convenient refuge when they were questioned too closely. As soon as the reports concerning the misstatements reached the company, the officers discharged the offending agents. This makes it evident that the company found that the reports ab&lt; ut the mis - statements were true. The company, through its chief right of way representative, its general counsel and Its president, appeared and gave testimony at the hearing. Officers categorically denied that they had ever heard of the representations of the right of way agents until shortly before this proceeding was started, and that they learned of such statements through reports m the public press. They each testified specifically that right of way agents had never been authorized to make the statements referred to above, that the officers greatly legretted the making of such statements, and that they would see that ;here was no repetition of the offense. They also said that they desired that the greatest publicity be given to their denial of any authorization of such statements. Our conclusion is that the agents made some of ths statements imputed to them, and that some of the landowners signed the con - tracts m reliance thereon. We are convinced, howevjer, that the 302 </seg>
            <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION company had not authorized the making of such statements. If the Commission had power to punish for contempt it would not hesitate to cite at least one and perhaps others of the agents to appear before it to show cause why there should not be a punishment for such conduct.. But m view of the rather indefinite character of the evi - dence, and the fact that the Corn-mission did not learn of the making of the statements until long after they were made, which would render it difficult to secure conviction, we shall not recommend that prosecutions be instituted. The officers of the company assured us that they will see that their agents make no misstatements m the future, and. we are convinced of their sincerity, and that there will be no recurrence. The case will therefore be closed without the •entering of an order. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this fourteenth day of October, 1930.

GENERAL ORDER NO. 54 In the matter of the time of . payment of charges of corimon carriers and public utilities having gross and net, or discount rates. It appears to the Nebraska State Railway Commission that m the application of the rules relating to gross and net, or discount, rates of common carriers and public utilities, over which rales this Com - mission has jurisdiction, there is lack of uniformity m the time of applying the gross rates; that when the last day for the payment of charges and the obtaining of the net, or discount, rate falls, on Sunday, or on a legal holiday,, some concerns insist upon payment on the previous day, while others permit payment to be made on the next succeeding business day. This diversity and the inconvenience occasioned by requiring earlier payment are causing difficulty, and frequently result m unsatisfactory relations between the cojnmon car- 304 </seg>

Neb. 1922, as amended (Laws of Neb., 1923, c. 167), printed m the margin. (The section referred to reads: Section 5527. Whenever any person owns land on both sides of the right-of-way of any railroad, such railroad shall provide and keep m repair at least one adequate means for such land owner to. cross the right-of-way. Any interested land owner with land on both sides of the. right-of-way of any railroad may file written complaint with the state railway commission against any such railroad that the crossing is not adequate or is unsafe and dangerous to the lite and property of those who use the same, and the commission thereupon shall make such investigation and hold such hearing as may be nec - essary, and shall issue such orders as it shall deem necessary, proper, and adequate. If circumstances warrant the commission may require overhead, underground or grade crossings and require wing fences at underground crossings or may require existing crossings to be re - located so as to be safe to those who use them, but where such. special crossing involves an expenditure of more than seven hundred ($700.00) dollars the land owner shall bear one-half the expenses m excess of seven hundred ($700.00) dollars). The plaintiff assails the statute, as applied m this instance, as depriving it of property with - out due process of law, and as impairing the obligation of contract m violation of the federal constitution. Defendant's farm comprises a quarter section of land, divided ap - proximately m half by plaintiff's track, which crosses from the north - west corner to the southeast. For fifteen or more years plaintiff has maintained a farm crossing, at grade, now equipped with gates, which connects the parts of the farm near its northwest corner. The state court assumed that the crossing was established before 1921 and .while the statute provided only that where the same person owns land on both sides of a railroad, the latter "shall, when required so to do, make and keep m good repair one causeway or other adequate means of crossing the' same." Amendment (Laws of Neb., 1921, c. 261, and that of 1923) added the provisions authorizing the Commission to entertain complaint by the landowner that a crossing "is not adequate or is unasafe and dangerous to the life and property of those who ■ use" it, and to require an overhead or underground crossing "If cir - cumstances warrant". The proceeding now under review was begun m 1924 by defend - ant's petition to the Commission, setting up, as the sole basis for the order . sought, that the surfacn crossing was inadequate. The only 309 </seg>
            <seg id="p318">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT ground of inadequacy alleged or sought to be proved was that the crossing could not be reached without passing through defendant's cultivated fields on both sides ot the' track, to avoid which, defendant was compelled, m transferring his cattle from water supply to "pasture and return, to drive them back and forth a distance ot three-fourths of a mile on a public highway which crosses plaintiff's line at grade. The petition stated that an underground pass could easily be estab - lished at another point on plaintiff's line, where there was a depres - sion on each side, so as to connect defendant pasture with the south - west part of his farm, and with a cattle runway extending to his yards and water supply. The Commission, after a hearing, found the tacts as aV.eged, and others showing that defendant's farm could be more convex .iently op - erated if the proposed pass were established; concluded that the present crossing was "inadequate and impracticable"; aril granted the order asked. The Commission did not find, nor was there evi - dence before it tending to show, that the crossing was not adequate for the passing and repassing ot such persons and cattle as would normally go from one part, of defendant's farm to the oth 3r m con - ducting usual farm operations. The state court, m passing on the order, had before 11. only the evidence given and proceedings had before the Commission. Saying that the record did not adequately present the point, it assumed, upon the basis of concessions stated to be m briefs before it, tlu.t plaintiff acquired its right ot way by condemnation prior to 1921. It pointed out that at that time the statute required plaintiff to mainta n a cause - way or "other adequate means of crossing" between the two parts of the farm. It said that compensation for the land condemned must be taken to have been assessed m view of the provisions of the statute, and that plaintiff took its right of way subject to the statutory ob - ligation to construct and maintain the "adequate" farm crossing de - fined by the statute. It mooted, without deciding, the question whether the present crossing was adequate within the meaning of the statute as originally enacted, suggested that there might be "a fur - ther definition" of adequacy "by the state m proper exercise ot its police power", and supported the order of the Commission on the ground that the state could, m the exercise of its police power, "eliminate the perils ot grade crossings." ;■; ; • There is no occasion for us to consider how far, if at all, the state's power to remove the dangers of public grade crossings, see Erie Rail - road Co. v. Board of Public Utility Commissioners, 254 y. S. 394, extends to private farm crossings when unsafe to the traveling public or individual users. The Nebraska statute has delegated to the State 310 </seg>
            <seg id="p319">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Railway Commission authority to order farm crossings underground because either inadequate or dangerous, if circumstances warrant. But there is nothing m this record to suggest thai the order of the Commission . was either asked or granted as a safety measure. The Commission did not find that the crossing was dangerous either to the public, the litigants, or their property. Neither did it find that this crossing was m anywise different from the usual farm crossing at grade. True, there was testimony that cattle passing over the crossing needed to be -attended and controlled to prevent injury to them by trains. But this was no more true of that crossing than of surface farm crossings m general. The case is one of single track branch line. The track is straight and it was conceded on argument before this Court that there were only four trains a day. While there are bare assertions m the testimony that the private crossing was dangerous, there was no evidence of any danger beyond that which would attend the use of any farm crossing. Neither the Commis - sion nor the state court regarded the statute as condemning all such crossings, doubtless because the statute distinctly includes that type of crossing among those which it authorizes the Commission to re - quire, its words being, "the Commission may require overhead, under - ground or grade crossings" as the circumstances may warrant. It is plain that the Commission proceeded upon the assumption that the statute authorized it to compel plaintiff .to establish the underground pass-Tor the convenience and benefit of defendant m the use of. his own property, and that that alone was the ground and purpose ol the order. The application thus given to the statute deprives plain - tiff of property for the private. use and benefit of defendant, and is a taking of property without due process of law, forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.

By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. -' \±v. I • ■■ — ; February 20, 1930. The following statement of facts and the following question were submitted by Burlington operating officials to the State Railway Com - mission. The Commission has transmitted the same to this depart - ment with a request for a written opinion. A freight train is operated on a continuous run, employing the same crew and the same train number throughout the journey, from Oxford, Nebraska, to Hastings, Nebraska, via Lester. The distance from Oxford to Lester, which is main line mileage, is about sixty - . four miles, and that from Lester to Hastings, which is branch line mileage, is about forty-three miles. The train carries passengers and local merchandise and does station switching. Does the train require three brakemen for its operation? The statute relating to this subject, Section 5337, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, is as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad doing business m Ne - braska to operate or run over its road, or any part thereof, or to suffer or permit to be operated or run over its road, or any part thereof, outside of yard limits any freight train which is " not manned with a crew. consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and two brakemen: Provided, main line local freight trains running one hundred miles or more and carrying passengers, local merchandise and doing station switching shall be provided with a crew consisting of one conductor, one en - gineer, one fireman and three brakemen." A main line local freight train is one operating on a main line, and is such a train only so long as it operates on a main line.- The • fact that the train operates more than one hundred miles, forty-three 313 </seg>
            <seg id="p322">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT miles of which is on a branch line, does not make if necessary to carry a third brakeman on thjj sixty-four miles of main Hie mileage. In order that the statute may apply, there must be a hundred miles or more of main line operation. It should be understood that this department is not passing on the character of the mileage from Lester to Hastings, whether main line or branch line. That is a matter which can only be determined from consideration of the relevant facts. Very truly yours, C. A. Sorensen, Attorney General. " By Hugh LaMaater, Assistant Attorney General. May 13, 1930. . The question, which you submitted at the request of Mr. E. W. Wedge, of Cozad, Nebraska, has been given consideration. The question is as follows: A tract of land is so bisected by an irrigation ditch as to leave a portion of the land wholly inaccessible to its owner, as such portion is surrounded by lands belonging to others, except where it is hounded by the irrigation ditch, over \'hich there is no bridge. In order to reach the tract thus cut of, it will be necessary to construct a bridge. The irrigation ditch was placed across the land prior to its purchase by the. present owner. Is it the duty of the irrigation company, or district, t ) construct and maintain such bridge? It is the opinion of this department that it is incuinbei.t upon the irrigation company, or district, to construct and maintain the bridge! A similar question was presented m the case of State v. Farmers Irrigation District (98 Nebr. 239). The court stated the ficts m that case as follows: "Relator is the owner of land m the south hall of section 18, township 22, range 53, m Scotts Bluff county, which land is traversed by the irrigation canal of respondent. About 120 acres lie north and about 26 acres south of the canal. Kelator brought this action m the district court for Scotts Bluff count/ to compel respondent to construct a bridge across the canal so as to con - nect the two tracts of land. From a judgment denying a writ and dismissing his action, he appeals. 314 </seg>
            <seg id="p323">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "The action is based on the provisions of section 3438, Rev. St. 1913, viz.: 'Any person, company, corporation, or associa - tion constructing a ditch or canal through the lands of any. per - son, company, or corporation having no interest m said ditch or canal shall build such ditch or canal m a substantial man - ner so as to prevent damage to such land; m all cases where necessary for the free and convenient use ol lands on both sides of the ditch or canal" by the owner or owners of such lands, the owner or those m control of such ditch shall erect substantial and convenient bridges across such canal or ditch, and they shall erect .and keep m order suitable gates at the point of entrance and exit of such ditch through any inclosed field.' The case turns upon the construction to be given to the words 'm all cases'; immediately following the semicolon. Does the re - quirement of the section, beginning with those words, relate to lands owned by one person and located on both sides of the ditch at the time the ditch was constructed, or does it relate as well to cases subsequently arising where one person becomes the owner of lands on both sides? In 190G the Tri-State Land Company, being the then owner of the entire tract of land, con - structed the irrigation canal through the same. In 1909 it sold the canal, together with the right of way, to the Farmers Mutual Canal Company. After the construction of the canal, and after the sale of the same to the Farmers Mutual Canal Company, the Tri-State Land Company sold the lands m controversy to relator; and at a still later date the Farmers Mutual Canal Com - pany conveyed the canal and right of way to the respondent Farmers Irrigation District. It is contended by respondent, m support of the judgment of the district court, that, the canal having been built by the Tri-State Land Company while it owned the land, the canal was constructed through the lands of a cor - poration having an interest m the canal, and that, such being the fact, the land, by virtue of such interest m Its owner at that time, was thereby excluded from the provisions of the statute, and, hence, the statute does not apply to the present case - that the statute does not apply where the canal is constructed over the land with the consent of the landowner, and does not apply to cases where the necessity for a bridge occurs at a time subsequent to the building of the canal." In its discussion, the court said: "We are unable to concur m this construction. The statute is not ambiguous, and must; therefore be construed according to its terms. It provides, first, the manner m which the ditch or canal shall be constructed, viz., 'm a substantial manner so as to 315 </seg>
            <seg id="p324">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT prevent damage to such land. . This provision relates solely to the manner of construction. The words 'through the lands of any person, company, or corporation' do not limit the statute to cases where the ditch cut through the land of son c individual owner, leaving land on both sides thereof. They ajply as well to lands abutting on a ditch. As to all such lands, as well as those actually pene.trated or cut m two by a ditch it must be constructed 'm a substantial manner so as to prevent damage to such land.' The statute then proceeds to say what shall be done so as to enable owners of lands on both sides of the ditch to have 'the free and convenient' use' of such lands, and pro - vides that, where it is necessary tor the free and convenient use of lands on both sides of the ditch, the owner of the ditch shall erect substantial' and convenient bridges across its canal or ditch 'm all cases.' The words, 'm all cases,' mean precisely the same, whether they be used, as m the statute, immediately preceding the requirement for the construction oE bridges, or immediately following such requirement. If the legislature had intended this requirement to relate only to conditions as they existed at the time the ditch was constructed, it would have been an easy matter to have said s.o. We see no difference be - tween the rule which should be applied m construing this statute and that applied to the statute requiring railway companies to construct farm crossings across their roads. The principle in - volved is the same m each." In discussing the requirement that irrigation districts should erect and maintain such bridges, the court said, with respect to constitu - tionality: "It is next said that the section under consider ition is void, for the reason that respondent is given no compensation for the taking of its property for the purpose of a bridge, and that it would take the property of respondent for private purposes. The answer to this contention is that the burden thus imposed upon a ditch company constitutes a- part of the consideration for the valuable right -of eminent domain given it by the statute. Without such right it could not build its ditch through a man's farm. Having accepted the right ito build, regardless of the wish of the landowner, it must, take that right burdened with the conditions imposed by the legislature. The qviestion of the weight of the burden is one for the consideration of that body, and not for the court." The judgment of the district court was reversed, and the irrigation district was required to construct the bridge. . 316 </seg>
            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The case went to (he Supreme Court of the United States, -where it appears under the title of Farmers Irrigation District v. State of Nebraska (244 U. S. 325, 61 Law Ed. 1168). The decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska was affirmed. In its discussion of the constitutional questions involved, the Supreme Court of the United States said: "... The state was not obliged to confer upon this corpora - tion the sovereign authority to take property by the right of eminent domain. When it did so, we do not think it took the property of the corporation without compensation when it also obliged the latter to comply with the conditions of this grant of power, one of which was that It should construct bridges under the circumstances now presented. "Nor do we think it makes any difference that the corpora - tion was not obliged to exercise the power of eminent domain to obtain this particular right of way. This right existed, was conferred by the state, and might.be used to construct other portions of the canal for the purposes intended. In this con - struction and application of the legislation of the state we are unable to find the taking of property without compensation, as is contended by the plaintiffs m error. "As to the denial of the equal protection of the laws, thls^ court has frequently held that there is nothing m this provision of the 14th Amendment to prevent the states from reasonable classification of subjects for legislative action. This statute applies equally to all owners of irrigation canals. The fact that it does not embrace canals constructed for other uses and pur - poses does not make it obnoxious to the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment." The statute, being section 3438, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, remained m force until 1919. It was repealed by chapter 190, Civil Administrative Code, Laws of 1919, page 434. A new provision, being section 11, division 3 of Article V, of Civil Administrative Code, Laws of 1919, page 850, was enacted. That law is still m force, and appears as section 8461, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. It reads as follows: "Any person, constructing a ditch or canal through the lands of another, having no interest In said ditch or canal shall build such ditch or canal m a substantial manner so as to prevent damage to such land. In all cases where necessary for the free and convenient use "of lands on both sides of the ditch or canal by the owner or owners of such lands, the owner or those In 317 </seg>
            <seg id="p326">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT control of such ditch shall erect substantial and convenient bridges across such canal or ditch, and they shall eroct and keep m order suitable gates at the point of entrance and exit of such ditch through any enclosed field." While there is some difference between the language employed m the 1919 act, and that used m the 1913 act, there does not appear to be any substantial change m meaning. It is, therefor j, concluded that it is the duty of the irrigation company," or district, as the case may be, to construct and maintain such bridges. It will be observed that the statute above quoted does not specify that the company, or district, shall maintain such bridge, but it is apparent from the language of the act that a bridge must be built by the company, or district, where it is "necessary for the free and convenient use of lands on both sides of the ditch or canal." The word, "use," implies a con - tinued duty upon the builder of the bridge to maintain it The case of Lindeman v. St. J. &amp; G. I. Ry. Company (113 Nebr. 284), (22 Neb. St. Ry. Com. Rep. 170-175), involving ths right to re - quire a crossing over a railroad which severs a tract of making one portion thereof inaccessible, is m point m this matter as throwing light on the principle involved. C. A. Sorenseh, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Pursuant to your request, the question propounded |by Mr. H. E. Christman has been considered by this department. Mr. Christman's question may be stated thus: , "Is a railroad company required to do all the grading and build all the bridges within its right-of-way, wherfe it is crossed by a public highway?" Section 5524, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 19 ! 2, relating to this subject, is, m part, as. follows: "It is hereby made the duty of every person cr corporation, owning or operating any railroad, crossed by a rubllc road, to make and keep m good repair, good and sufnqteit crossing for such road over their tracks, Including all the gn ding, bridges, ditches, and culverts that may be necessary with n their right - of-way." 318 </seg>
            <seg id="p327">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION . Ans. The rule Is this: The public authorities must build that part of the highway within the right-of-way which they would have been required to build had the railroad not been constructed; the railroad company must build the other parts. In State v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. r. Co., 29 Neb. 412, the Supreme Court of this State said: "It has been frequently decided by the courts that under the police power the legislature may compel existing railroad cor - porations to fence their tracks and put m cattle guards. (Au - thorities cited.) By a parity of reason the law-making power may make it the duty of railroad companies to construct and keep m repair highway crossings, notwithstanding the railroad was built before the enactment of the law. Such a burden is not m violation of the constitutional provision requiring that taxes shall be equal. Similar laws have been held constitutional. (Authorities cited.) The Supreme court of Illinois, m I. C. R. R. Co. v. Bloomington, 76 111., 451, declare a similar law un - constitutional. "We do not mean to be understood as deciding that it is the duty of a railroad corporation to construct and keep m repair all highways laid on or across its right of way. What we hold is that it must construct suitable crossings m that part of the highway within the right of way made necessary by the build - ing of the railroad, and keep the same m repair. If the railroad track Is laid above the natural surface of the ground -where the highway crosses it, the crossing would include suitable ap - proaches: If the track is below the natural surface of the ground, the crossing would include whatever Is necessary to make a reasonably safe way for persons traveling the highway to cross the railroad. "It cannot be said that the public good requires that the burden should be upon the railroad company to construct the remainder of the public highway within the right of way. No serious consequences would likely result from requiring the public authorities to construct the highway after the crossings and approaches are put m. We think that it is the duty of the public authorities to construct and keep m repair all the high - way within the right of way which they would have been re - quired to build had the railroad not been constructed. (Au - thorities cited.)" In Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Cass County, 76 Neb. 396, the Court approved the language above quoted. 319 </seg>

By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Several times recently the following question has been asked, some of the inquiries coming through the State Railway Commission, and some of them coming directly to this department: - "Can a foreign corporation, not domesticated n Nebraska, engaged m furnishing natural gas, lawfully exercise the power of eminent domain to secure rights of way for its pipe lines?" It is the opinion of this department tliat it cannot. The question has been asked so frequently, and the matter in - volved is of such importance that we feel that the reasons for this conclusion should be fully set forth. Section 635, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, for 19 22, defines a foreign corporation thus: "'Foreign corporations' as the terms are. used m the next preceding section shall embrace and include all corporations or - ganized under. the laws of any foreign government, of any other state than the State of Nebraska, arid of any territory thereof, including the District of Columbia." The policy of this state, respecting the power of a foreign cor - poration to hold real estate, is disclosed by Sections 56!;7 and 5690, Comp. Stat. 1922.

Section 5690 is as follows: "This article shall not, nor shall anything In the statutes of Nebraska, prevent the holders, whether aliens or corporations not organized under the laws, of the State of Nebraska, of liens upon real estate or any interest therein, whether heretofore or hereafter acquired, from holding or taking valid title to the real estate subiect to such liens, nor shall It prevent any such alien or corporation from enforcing any lien or judgment for any debt or liability now existing, or which may hereafter be created, nor from becoming a purchaser at any sale made for the purpose of collecting or enforcing the collection of such debt or judgment: provided, however, all lands so acquired shall be .: sold within ten years after the title thereto shall be perfected m such alien or foreign corporation, and m default of such sale within such time, such real estate shall revert and escheat to the State of Nebraska, as provided m this article: provided, further, the provisions of this article shall not apply to the real estate necessary for the construction and operation of rail - roads; and Provided, further, nothing m this article shall be construed to prohibit any alien or foreign corporation from pur - chasing and acquiring title to so much real estate as shall be necessary for the purpose of erecting and maintaining manu - facturing establishments; and Provided, further, the provisions • of this article shall not apply to any real estate lying within the corporate limits of cities and towns; and Provided, further, that the provisions of this article shall not apply to any real estate acquired by any alien prior to the passage and taking effect of this act, as long as such real property shall remain the property of such alien." . These statutory provisions m substantially their present form superseded earlier enactments In the year 1889. The amendments since that date have not substantially changed them, so far as they ' relate to the present discussion. Section 641, Comp. Stat. 1922. should be referred to, as it affords explanation of some of the seeming differences m the authorities It is as follows: "Foreign corporations shall have the right to receive, take, purchase and hold by mortgage or otherwise, any securities and liens executed, given or transferred or so Intended to represent or secure loans upon or purchase-money of lands or other prop- 321 </seg>
            <seg id="p330">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT erty situate or being m this state, and to sell, assign, transfer, and to sue upon, foreclose or otherwise enforce th^ same here - tofore or hereafter acquired." Section 479, Comp. Stat. 1922, provides the method of domesti - cation of foreign corporations. .It reads as follows: "Any corporation organized under the laws ojf any other state or states, territory or territories, which has filed, or may hereafter file with the secretary of state of this ntate, a true copy of its charter or articles of association, shall, en* filing with the secretary of state a certified copy of a resolution adopted ljy its board of directors, accepting the provisions, of this ar - ticle, be and become a body corporate of this state." It will be seen from the foregoing statutory provisi ins that the public policy of this state is to restrict the ownership of real estate by foreign corporations to narrow, limits. The constitution is silent on the subject, except as to the power of railroad companies to condemn lands. A railroad company, not organized as a domestic: corporation and not domesticated, may not exercise the right of emiient domain, nor acquire veal estate m this state. Section 8, Article X, of the Con - stitution, is as follows: "No railroad corporation organized under the laws of any other state, or of the United States and doing business m this state shall be entitled to exercise the right of eminent domain or have power to acquire the right-of-way, or reil estate for depot or other uses, until it shall have become a bcdy corporate pursuant to and m accordance with the laws of this state." That section was also found m the constitution of 1875. At that time pipe lines were not m use m this part of the United States. There were then no common carriers requiring rights o way m this state, except railroads and telegraph lines.. There we -e no canals for transportation purposes. There were a few canals, but they wer.e used m connection with water power plants, or possibly n connection with some small irrigation projects. No federal question is perceived m connection with this subject. Section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act (U. S. Cole, Title 49, Chapter 1) is, m part, as follows: . "The provisions of this Act shall apply to coirmon carriers engaged in— (a) The transportation of passengers or prope-ty wholly by railroad, or partly by railroad and partly by water when both 322 </seg>
            <seg id="p331">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION are used under a common control, management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment; or (b) The transportation of oil or' other commodity, except water and except natural or artificial gas, by pipe line, or partly by pipe line and partly by railroad, or by water; ..." The constitutional provision relating to railroads, above Quoted, has been before the supreme court a number of times. In State v. Scott, 22 Neb. 628, the court was asked to issue a writ of mandamus requiring a commissioner of public lands, and buildings and the governor to prepare and sign, respectively, a deed for certain real estate to the relator, the Burlington &amp; Missouri River Railroad Com - pany, a foreign corporation. A demurrer to the petition was sustain - ed and the writ was denied. In the opinion the court said: "The undeviating rule adopted by this court is, not to discuss the constitutionality of a. statute unless the question fairly arises m the case, and m no case heretofore presented to this court has the right of a foreign corporation doing business m this state to condemn right of way or to acquire real estate or other uses been presented. It is apparent, however, that such foreign corporation possesses no such rights. Our laws are liberal m promoting the organization of railroad companies and the con - struction of railways m the state. But such corporations must be under our own laws — the creature of our statutes and not of the laws of other states. It will be observed that m each application for the condemnation of the lots above described the C. B. &amp; Q. and. L. &amp; N. W. R, R. Co. are joined as relators. That the C. B. &amp; Q., being a foreign corporation, is debarred from the right to the relief prayed tor was conceded by one of the attorneys for that corporation on the argument. That mat - ter may, therefore, be dismissed; but can it take as lessee of the L. &amp; N. W. R. R.? The constitution declares that it shall not acquire right of way or real estate for depot or other uses. If it cannot acquire these, it cannot, take by lease or other means. It cannot do by indirection what it is absolutely prohi - bited from doing directly. To be entitled to relief it must or - ganize under the laws of the state." Trester v. The Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 23 Neb. 242, in - volved the power of a nonresident railroad corporation to acquire real estate for right of way purposes. The court said: "If defendant desired to exercise the right of eminent do - main, it could do it m one way only, and that would be by be - coming 'a body corporate pursuant to and m accordance with the laws of this state.' Failing to do so It is without the ability 323 </seg>
            <seg id="p332">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT to call into action that 'due process of ; law' necessa -y to deprive a citizen ol his property, and is powerless to take any steps m that direction. The 'principle of estoppel contended lor by • plaintiff m error can have no application. No rights can be acquired by it by user, and nothing which it has done by way of filing the request can give it the ability to take o: 1 acquire the right of way." Koenig v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 27 Neb. 699, involved the power of a foreign railroad corporation to exercise the righ . of eminent domain. In the opinion, the court said: ■ .'■ •'■'■ "This question was very fully considered m S ;ate v. Scott, 22 Neb. 628-9, and it was held that a foreign cirporation is j prohibited from acquiring right of way or real est ite for depot or other uses, and that it cannot do indirectly what the con - stitution prohibits it from doing directly. In other words, that, ;ih it cannot perform any of the acts named, therefore it can - not avail itself of the services of another corporation . to- ac'rj complish this result. The denial to a foreign rail "oad corpora - tion of the right of eminent. domain, and the power to acquire right of way or real estate for depot or other uses, is an absolute prohibition against such corporation either owning or holding a railroad m this state. The. denial of the right to acquire right of way is. very broad and- comprehensive, and its meaning unmistakable.. 'No foreign corporation can exercise the right of eminent domain or (can) acquire right of way,' eic. If it can - not acquire, then it is forbidden to hold what it is prohibited from acquiring, because the effect of the denial ol the right of acquisition is to prevent it from taking property. And as it cannot do indirectly what it is prohibited from doing directly, it cannot acquire and hold a leased line and thus evade a plain constitutional prohibition. These provisions were placed m the constitution not as a measure of hostility to railroads, but to protect the citizens of the state m the enforcement of the rights, and prevent corporate abuses. Therefore a foreign corporation, to own or operate a line of. railway m this state, n ust become a corporation under the laws of the state m some of the modes pointed out m the statute. ..." In State v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 25 Neb. 156, it appeared that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, a corporation jot Illinois and of lowa, had consolidated with the Burlington &amp; Missouri River Railroad Company, a Nebraska corporation, by merging the stock of the respective companies into one joint stock company to be known as the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad .Company. It was held by virtue of such consolidation and compliance. With Sec. 114, 324 </seg>
            <seg id="p333">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Chap. 16, Comp. Stat. of 1887, the corporation created thereby be - came a body corporate m accordance with the laws of this state, and was therefore not a foreign corporation. The same effect was given a consolidation m the case of Trester v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 33 Neb. 171, and m Rogers v Cosgrave, 98 Neb. 608. In Gould v.~ Board of Home Missions, 102 Neb. 520, the court considered a devise of certain real estate m Nebraska, subject to a life estate, to. a foreign corporation "to be appropriated and applied for the use and benefit of the Women's Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church m the United States of America." It was held that the words quoted above denoted a charitable trust or use for a religious purpose, and that the trustee named was a foreign corporation and could not take the trust estate. It was further held that as a valid charitable trust was created, it would not be per - mitted to fail because the trustee was incompetent to take title of the real estate, but that a trustee would be appointed by the court In its discussion of the subject, the court said: "Agnes v. Gould, deceased, devised to the defendant, a for - eign corporation, subject to a life estate" m her daughter, the plaintiff, the real estate m controversy, 'to be appropriated and applied, for the use and benefit of the Woman's Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church m the United States ol America.' A demurrer to plaintiff's petition was overruled, the will was declared void, the judgment quieting title m plaintiff, heir at law, was entered, from which defendant appeals. "Section 6273, Rev. St. 1913, provides: 'Non-resident aliens and corporations not incorporated under the laws of the state of Nebraska are hereby prohibited from acquiring title to or. taking' or holding any lands or real estate m this state by descent, devise, purchase or otherwise.' "Under this prohibition of the statute, intended as a part of the public policy of the state, touching land, it is unlawful for the trustee named to take, and hence unlawful for the testator to . give to it, the. land m controversy. Some cases are cited inter - preting statutes limiting the amount of real estate which cor - porations may acquire, holding that such statutes are regulatory merely of the corporation and can be invoked only by the state. These cases do not apply. This statute is prohibitory. If the language above quoted, together with the sections following, do not forbid and prevent foreign corporations from taking or hold - ing Nebraska land, as against anybody, it would be difficult for a legislature to find words that would accomplish m full a 325 </seg>
            <seg id="p334">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT purpose which, m some form or other, has pt ssessed every people which has occupied' a territory as its own." Attention is called to Lord v. Schultz, 115 Neb. 33, which might, at first sight, seem to be, m part, inconsistent with the holding m Gould v. Board of Home Missions. In Lord v. Schultz, which in - volved a question as to whether or not a good and merchantable title had been tendered, it appeared that the plaintiff's grantor was a foreign corporation, and had taken over the land iv question m settlement of a mortgage obligation then due to it.. The settlement also included certain land not described m the mortgage. As to the land covered by the mortgage, there seemed to be no doubt that the title conveyed by. the mortgagor to the mortgagee was covered by the exceptions m Section 5G90, Comp. Stat. 1922, as quoted above, and by the provisions of Section 641, Comp. Stat. 1922, also quoted above. Further, it appeared that the mortgagor, the grantor :o the foreign corporation, had also quitclaimed all his rights In and to the lands to the plaintiff m the case. (It seems that the quitclaim covered the entire tract, although It Is not quite clear. from the opinion.) There was never any attempt to enforce an escheat by the stat 3. It must be concluded from the statutes above quoted, and the cases cited, that the public policy of this state forbids foreign cor - porations not domesticated to hold real estate. We no v come to the consideration of the statute under which the pipe line companies seek to exerciße the power of eminent domain. Section 5081, Comp. Stat. 1922, is as follows: "Any company, corporation or association, formed or created for the purpose of transporting, transmitting or conveying crude oil, petroleum or the products thereof, or gases* from one point m the state of Nebraska to another point n the state of Nebraska for a consideration are hereby declared to be com - mon carriers; and any such company, corporation, or associa - tion desiring or requiring a right-of-way- or right-of-ways for the laying and maintaining of any pipe line or lines for such purpose within the State of Nebraska, and being i nable to agree with the owner or lessee of any land, lot, real eutate, or right - of-way on the amount of compensation for the use and occupancy of so much of any lot, land, real estate or right-of-way as may reasonably be necessary for the laying, relaying and mainten - ance of any such pipe line shall have the right to acquire the same for such purpose, as hereinafter provided. Such company, corporation or association is hereby placed under the control and subject to regulation by the state railway commission of the state of Nebraska, and subject to Article X of chapter 67, of the revised statutes of Nebraska for the year 1913 (Art. X, eh. 59) 326 </seg>
            <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION • so far as the provisions thereof are applicable to pipe lines as common carriers." The first question for determination is whether or not foreign corporations are included m the language of Section 5081. supra. Certain general principles of law relating to eminent domain should be kept m mind, namely: Eminent domain is an attribute of sovereignty; a sovereign power will only be conveyed by an express grant; the right to exercise the power must be based on constitu - tional provisions or legislative enactments; there can be no taking of private property for public use against the will of the owner with - out authority under the constitution or under legislative act; the right ot eminent domain is not granted as a matter of interstate comltyji the legislature, unless restrained by constitutional inhibitions may grant the right to an individual, to an association or to a cor - poration, either foreign or domestic. With these general rules before us, and with the general public policy of this state with regard to the holding of real estate by foreign corporations m mind, it would seem clear that as foreign corporations are not specifically mentioned m the statute, they are not included Within its purview. This appears especially clear when it is con - sidered that the statute attempts to affect the sovereign power of the state. It is a general rule that sovereignty is not affected by an en - actment, unless specifically mentioned. Therefore, it seems clear, on principle, that foreign corporations are not included within the lan - guage of the statute. Such is- the holding of a number of authorities. Lewis on Eminent Domain, Third Edition, Section 374, states the law thus: • "Strictly speaking, the legislature cannot delegate the power of eminent domain. It cannot divest itself of sovereign powers. But, m exercising the power, it can select such agencies as it pleases, and confer upon them the right to take private prop - erty subject only to the limitations contained m the constitu - tion. Accordingly it has been held that the right may be con - ferred upon corporations, public or private, upon individuals, upon foreign fcorporatlons, or a consolidated company composed m part of a foreign corporation, and upon the federal govern - ment. Such has been the common practice since the Revolution, and the right to do so has never baen a matter of serious ques - ;■ ' tion; and it may be regarded as settled law that, m the absence of special constitutional restriction, it is solely for the legislature to judge what persons, corporations or other agencies may properly be clothed with this power. 327 </seg>
            <seg id="p336">TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT "The general grant of the power of eminent domain to all corporations of a certain class or organized for certain- purposes, is held not to include foreign corporations. This is m accord - ance with the rule of strict construction universally applied to such statutes, and also m accordance with the rule that statutes, are presumed to refer and apply only to persons and things with - in the State enacting them. ... " Chestates Pyrites Co. v. Cavendar's Creek G. M. Co. (Ga.) 46 S. B. 422; Helena Power Transmission .Co. v. Spratt (Mont.) 88 Pac. 773, 8 L. R. A. (N. S. 567); Duke v. Postal Telegraph Cab c Co.

In the. last case cited above, the coirt said: "The power of eminent domain is an incident to sovereignty and inherent m the state, and can be exercised only on the oc - casion, In the mode, and by the agency . prescribed by the Legis - lature. No other state can authorize the exercise of that power within this state, and the laws Under which petitioner has its existence could not and do not purport to do so. The petitioner can have no legal existence m this state outside of the boundaries of the states where it was incorporated, and can exercise none of the powers conferred by its charter except by consent of the Legislature of this state. It is competent for the Legislature to delegate the exercise of the power of eminent domain to a for - eign corporation (authorities), but the power can only be exer - cised when so granted. The power ..to take the property of the individual without his. consent is against common right, and all acts authorizing such a taking are to he strictly construed, (authorities). .Unless both the letter and the spirit of the statute relied upon clearly confer the power, it cannot be exer - cised." In Ruling Case Law, Vol. 10, title "Eminent Domiin," Sec. 168, the law is stated as follows: "A grant of the power of eminent domain, which is one of the attributes of sovereignty most fraught with the: possibility of abuse and injustice, will never pass by implication, and When the power is granted, the extent to which it may be exercised is limited to the express terms or clear implication of the statute m which the grant is contained. . . . " See Spratt v. Helena Power Transmission Co. (Mont.) 8 L. R. A. 567. There are numerous cases holding that where a general term such as "any person", or "any person or corporation", or "any and all cor- 328 </seg>
            <seg id="p337">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION portions I* used m a statute. It includes foreign corporations. 20 O. J., p. 543, title "Eminent Domain", Sec. 28. Such authorities ap - pear less convincing than those that hold that general terms, such as those used above, do not include foreign corporations. As pointed out above, the fixed policy of this state prohibits for - eign corporations from holding real estate. It appears impossible that the legislature had m mind the abrogation of such policy and yet made no direct declaration m regard to it. This leads to the second question: Did section 5081 repeal the several statutes prohibiting foreign corporations from holding real' estate?. There was no direct repeal. The fixed policy of this state con - cerning the ownership of real estate by foreign corporations, the rule that implied repeals are not favored, the rule that the vesting of a. sovereign power must be clear and explicit, all strongly indicate that there was no repeal. Again, it is a settled rule, of statutory construc - tion that an act, the provisions of which are general, will not, unless unavoidable, be interpreted to affect more particular and positive provisions of a prior act on the same subject. State v. Hay, 45 Neb 321; Dawson v. Clark, 58 Neb. 756. In the last case cited, the fol - lowing language appears: " 'The rule is that repeals by implication are not favored, and when acts upon the same subject can be harmonized by a fair and liberal construction, it will be done, (authorities). And this rule has especial application to cases where' the subsequent statute treats of the subject m general terms but not expressly contradicting the more particular and positive provisions with reference to the same subject m a prior act. (authorities) In State v. Dwyer, 42 N. J. Law 327. the court says: "Where a general law and a special statute come m conflict, the general law yields to the special without regard to priority of date, and a special law will not be repealed by a general statute, unless by express words or necessary implication." Applying these rules of construction to the statutory provisions m question it is possible to give effect to each.' In the light of the doctrine recognized arid applied m that case there is no escaping the con - clusion that the said act of 1867 was not repealed by implication by the adoption of section 69, article 1, chapter 14, Compiled Statutes, inasmuch as there is no conflict between the two statutes, but the provisions thereof can, and should be, so con - strued as to give effect to each and all of them." 329 </seg>
