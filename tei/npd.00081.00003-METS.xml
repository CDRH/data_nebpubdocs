To: His Excellency, Roy i L. Cochran, Governor of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. Subject: Biennial Report of 1936 and 1936. 1. In compliance with requirements of Sections 1 to 5, Chapter 55, Article 1, Conn iled Statutes of Nebraska 1929, the following Biennial Report for :he calendar years 1935 and 1936 Is respectfully submitted. The Netraska National Guard occupies an enviable posi - tion in its standing in the National Guard of the United States and that steady improver lent which has so richly rewarded the efforts of its personnel for ye: rs has never been more potent tban during the period covered by ths report. Each year training has materially im - proved in a logical : nd progressive manner, and notwithstanding the fact that many states allot much; more money for use of the National Guard, I sincerely believe there; is not a better organization in any State In the Union tl an has Nebraska at this time. 2. The community- interest in our units and the assistance given by committees of Cl ambers of Commerce and by the citizenship as a whole has been n ost gratifying and most helpful and I feel that this support is well warranted for it has become known throughout the State that our training camps are absolutely clean and whole - some and the fear of young men acquiring any bad habits In the Nebraska National Guard is a thing of the past. 3. Annual arm &gt;ry Inspections are made by officers of the United States Army detailed for that purpose. The results of our last armory inspection evidenced the closest conformity to prescribed schedules and found our organizations as a whole very satisfactory. I 4. As previously reported, the most discouraging proposition with which the units of the Nebraska National Guard have to contend Is the rental of armories. It is almost Impossible to rent suitable build- </seg>
            <seg id="p006">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL Ings and the government officials are becoming more exacting con - stantly as to the care and protection of government equipment. This is particularly true with reference to ordnance, as there have been a number ot thefts in the East of the 45 automatics and also of machine guns aqd we are compelled to pay the penalty, notwithstand - ing the fact we have had no losses of this kind. Government inspec - tors have, already peremptorily ordered a number of changes made in our armories, which entails considerable expense and which results In either an Increased rental or the State defraying the expenses of the additional security demanded. It is, therefore, recommended that our. Legislature give very serious consideration to making provisions for an Armory Building Program which will undoubtedly be much cheaper in tin long run. 5. The results of the Armory Drill Training and the Field Train - ing for the period of this report have been very satisfactory. The reports of. officers from the War Department assigned to make in - spections Indicate that the state of training of all organizations has steadily improved and that our National Guard of today is better than ever before in its history. In connection with the armory drills it Is gratifying to note that the attendance is better than it has ever been before and that nearly all of our companies have enlisted to full strength authorized by the War Department and have a waiting list of those anxious to join. 6. During the year 1935, our Commander-ln-Chlef found it necessary to call out the National Guard three times as follows: a. June 1, 1935, the Republican River got out of its banks and flooded the whole Republican Valley, causing great damage to life and property. Thousands of people were marooned on house tops and in tree tops with no immediate means or chance of rescue, which necessitated the sending of the National Guard to the devastated area to render all possible assistance and aid. ■■•■'• ■■■'■-• ■•■' - : I ' ' ■■■ The troops used on this tour of duty were twenty one (21) officers and two hundred and thirty seven (237) enlisted men and the tour lasted four days. Seventy eight (78) were rescued and . numerous bodies recovered. The total cost of this tour of. duty which Includes pay, food (numerous refugees being fed), transportation, freight, medical supplies (all being used for ref - ugees), gasoline, oil, etc., was $4,848.38. b. On June 15, 1935, It became necessary to send the National Guard to Omaha on account of a street car strike that </seg>
            <seg id="p007">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL had existed lor approximately two months and in which feeling had become so jitter that on the night of June 14 one man was killed Instantly and approximately one hundred and ninety were wounded. This resulted in : threats to burn many of the leading places of busin ss and to kill some of the leading stockholders of the street car &lt; ompany and to exterminate the police force. It became known that an unusual number of weapons and am - munition had bsen purchased on the morning of June 15 by the UistrubiiiK element, and with this showing made, and upon urgent requests of the Mayor, the Sheriff, the Chief of Police and the leading business men and newspaper men of Omaha, our Com - mander-ln-Chiel rightfully decided to send In troops and .to de - clare martial 1; iw. Troops used on this tour of duty were one hundred and three (103) officers and one thousand two hundred and seventy three (1273) enlisted men and the tour lasted seven days. The cost of this tour of duty was $34,339.46 and would have been much greater had not our Commander-in- Chief, in his wisdom, appointed an Arbitration Board which un - doubtedly redu :ed the length of this tour of duty very materially, thereby makin ; a great saving to the State of Nebraska. e. On August 28, 1935, it was made known to our Com - mander-in-Chicf that a state of lawlessness,- disorder, rioting and insurrection ex sted in Scotts Bluff County and that same had ex - isted for some time and that there was reasonable apprehension that the tame would continue and become pronounced. Upon the showing made by civil authorities of Scotts Bluff' County, the Department of Roads and Irrigation and the Bureau of Irrigation, Wa :er Power and Drainage, our 'Commander-in-Chier ordered the Adjutant General and our State Engineer to proceed to Scotts Bluf County in an endeavor to settle disputes causing the lawless ac s. An endeavor was made by the Adjutant Gen - eral and the State Engineer In a session lasting three days, to arbitrate and t ettle the differences so that the laws of the State and the mandi tes of the Court would be obeyed, but this was to no avail and as an inevitable result, our Commander-ln-Chief found it necessary to order in the National Guard and declare martial law. i ' ' ■ •■■•■ ; ■ ■• ■■ For this our of duty there were used fifteen (15) officers and one hundred and fifteen (115) enlisted men and the tour lasted seven days. The total cost of this tour of. duty was $3,639.69. Oi the three aforementioned tours of duty of the National Guard, I am proud to report that the officers and en- </seg>
            <seg id="p008">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL listed men conducted themselves in a soldierly manner through - out and so exemplary was their handling of the respective situa - tions it did not become necessary to fire a single shot or explode a single gas bomb. I feel certain there was nothing but the most friendly feeling towards the Commander-in-chief, and the National Guard as a whole when ea,ch tour of duty was termin - ated. In conclusion I wish to express my appreciation to our Com - mander-in-Chief, Governor Roy L. Cochran, to the officers and enlisted men of the Nebraska .National Guard and to the dozen* of Chambers of Commerce and the thousands of loyal citizens who have so heartily cooperated with us in their work, energy and moral support and thereby assisted in bringing the: Nebraska National Guard to its present high state of efficiency and in naking same a bigger and better organization.

            <seg id="p048">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL Subject: Discipline and the Administration of Justice. To: All Officers, Nebraska National Guard. 1. The ability to handle men is the paramount requisite of good leadership. This is particularly true in the case of company and detachment commanders and other officers dealing directly with enlisted men. Courage, education, fortitude or any other qualifica - tion of a .commissioned officer will accomplish little unless he has a thorough knowledge of applied psychology ami the management of the American soldier. 2. The establishment and maintenance or' discipline are matters of instruction and training. To a great extent discipline is iu.stilled by the power of example. The soldier imitates his officers, If th:; officer is neat in appearance, military in bearing and punctual at formations, men under his command are inclined to be likewise. Conversely, if the officer is slovenly in dress, indifferent In attitude and tardy at formations, the soldier has a propensity to become his counterpart. However, there are a very few men \.i:o fail to respond to diplomatic methods. For these men the imposition or the penal factor of discipline is necessary. .] 3. In imposing disciplinary action great care should he taken f&gt; prescribe a punishment no mere severe than is necessary to accom - plish the desired result. The punishment .should contorui to law and follow the offense as soon as circumstances will permit. It should be based upon the character of the man as well as the nature of the offense. According to the Articles of War and the Military Code of the State the means and methods of imposing disciplinary a,ction are briefly as follows: a. Administrative .correction and admonition to check minor offenses. b. Action under the 104th Article of War for more serious derelictions and repeated minor infractions. c. Trial by courtsmartial. 4. A few years ago there was a tendency to resort unnecessar - ily to trial by summary courtmartial. Recently there appears to be a tendency toward the other extreme. Obviously a man should not be tried for each simple offense of absen.ce without leave, but if he is repeatedly absent without authority and action under the 104th </seg>
            <seg id="p049">REPOKT OF THE ADJUTANT GENEKAL Article of War fails to accomplish the desired result, or if the ab - sence is willful and unjustifiable, he should be tried by summary court martial. A i ractice of merely admonishing and discharging i lie man is particularly to be deplored, since an honorable discharge is not a punishment, but to the contrary, a reward for honest and faith - ful service. In this connection attention is particularly invited to the provisions oi paragraph 26, NGR 37, which provides for dis - honorable discharge on five previous convictions, or when the aggre - gate punishment f o :■ two or more offenses is a fine in excess of fifty doilari (150.00). r&gt;. After making a thorough study of these matters officers must use good judgement in their application. As this may only be ac - quired by training and experience, a system of discipline must be esta - blished in each unit for the education and training of officers and men. I'articular care should be taken to read and explain the Art - icles of War and tl.e pertinent paragraphs of Army .Regulations relat - ing to discipline. Each offense should be carefully analyzed, the proper method of h indling it considered, and the degree of disciplinary action decided upon. Just as ah officer should know how to use prop - erly all the mean provided for maintaining discipline, so should each soldier be familial with these means and their applicaton. (I. Summary Court Officers are cautioned that sentences need not be severe to le effective.! A fine of a dollar or two will prove adequate in most :ases and sentences of imprisonment are unreason - able and unnecessary. Sentences of imprisonment are bad publicity fur the National Guard and w-ill usually be disapproved and rendered void by action at this office.) Uy direction of Governor Cochran: H. J.

The following letter from the Chief, National Guard Bureau, is published for the information and guidance of all concerned. 2. As will be seen from a perusal of the percentages publish - ed, Nebraska has entirely too many enlisted men in camp with less than two months service and every effort should be made to reduce this number to the minimum this year. In order to obtain the desired results you should start NOW. "1. A study of the field inspection reports for field train - ing, 1934, indicates a slight increase over the preceding two years in the number of enlisted men with less than two months service participating in field training. The average number of enlisted men with less than two months service, present in camp, was 11,263, which represents 6.97% of the total enlistea attendance. ■'.: :'--.- : ■'■■•■■"..■ '■■ ■ ■ -;■■•■■'.■■.■ 2.

An excess of 10% of enlisted men with less than two months' service is considered too high for effective training. This number can be further reduced by careful planning, as shown in the follow - ing states, which had less than 5%.

The National Guard of your state is due to be paid by this office in June. It is requested that every eMort be made to have your pay rolls reach this office as soon after the first of June as possible. The reason for this request is that this office pays some 12,000 members of the C. C. C. These C. C. C. pay rolls begin arriving in this office about the 16th of the month. Froni that date until the end of the month it takes the full time of this office to turn out C. C. C. pay. Sin.ce War Department orders required that the C. C. C. be given precedence over other payments, it can readily be seen that National Guard pay rolls arriving here after the 15th of the month are very apt to be delayed until the very end of the month or the first of the succeeding 1 month. This not only results in the incovenience to the Natiot al Guard ot having to wait for their pay, but causes a congestion of work here. 2. This condition will probably obtain as long as the C. C. C. is handled by the army. If your office will send ont a reminder to each of your organizations relative to this subject, it is believed it will result in quicker payments to your organ - izations and will, also be a favor to us.

Company paper work as a whole is far "Below Average", in fact has finally reached a point of "Very Unsatisfactory"- Responsible officers are too prone to leave this matter to clerks and first sergeants and do not exercise the close personal supervision of this important duty which is their direct responsibility. In that the Federal Armory Inspection this year will be conducted by an officer from outside th&lt;' State, it behooves every company commander and administrative of - ficer to immediately see that this deficiency is corrected. </seg>
