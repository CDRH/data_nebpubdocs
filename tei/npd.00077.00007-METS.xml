            <seg id="p003">DIVISION OF PREVENTION LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL To His Excellency, Roy L. Cochran, Governor of the State of Nebraska. Lincoln, Nebraska. Your Excellency: In compliance with the laws of the State relating to the powers and duties of the State Fire Marshal and his deputies, I have the honor of presenting for your consideration the Twenty-Sixth Annual Report of the Division of Fire Prevention. This report embraces the activities of the Division for the year 1934 under the, then, direction of L. ,T. Butcher, State Fire Marshal. Respectfully submitted, Horace M. Davis, State Fire Marshal. February 15, 1935. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">STATE OF NEBRASKA THE DEPARTMENT'S FINANCIAL STATUS There is an erroneous impression that a part of the funds collected for carrying on the activities of the Fire Marshal's office are diverted into the State general fund. The sole income of the Department of Fire Prevention is derived from an assessment of three-eights of one percent of the gross incomes of stock fire insurance companies and foreign mutual companies doing business in the state, and one-eighth of one percent of the like income of domestic mutuals, and all on business done within the state. That fund may not be used for any other purpose than for inspection of fire hazards and investigation of fires of unkown or incendiary origin. The statutes make it clear that the State of Nebraska is not responsible for any of the expenses of the department beyond the proceeds of the levy paid by the insurance companies. Before the force of the economic depression struck general busi - ness in the state, the sum realized from the legislative assessment brought in more funds for several years than were currently spent. Thus, a surplus of about thirty thousand dollars was built up. This carried the department into the lean years when fire insurance pre - miums fell off due to reduced values of insurable properties and the inability of the public to carry insurance and pay premiums. During the depressed times, buildings were permitted to fall into disrepair, thus requiring added inspection and condemnation. The pub - lic morale also suffered and incendiary fires increased as mortgages matured. Thus, extraordinary demands have beeen made during the last three years on the Fire Marshal's office for inspectors and in vestigators to do intensive field work. As a result, the office has spent more during those years than its current income and is now very close to total exhaustion of its reserve. For the present the personnel of the department must be cut, certainly for 1935, with its activities correspondingly narrowed. A slight increase in the annual assessment against gross fire insurance premiums has been suggested to the legis - lature, but if that increase shall be allowed, it cannot increase the in - come of the office for the current year. During 1934, $24,000 was spent for fire prevention out of a $14,000 income. Whatever funds are available will be used for intensive work during 1935 in inspection and investigation. Good citizens, firemen, public officials and fire insurance agents are urged to cooperate with the State Fire Marshal's office in getting maximum results with the least monetary cost. Horace M. Davis, State Fire Marshal. </seg>

Gasoline, kerosene and volatile oils caused 236 fires. Twenty-eight, or forty percent, of the deaths by fire during the year were the results of gasoline and kerosene explosions. Starting fires with kerosene caused eight deaths and 22 injuries. Cigarettes and cigars are reported to have been the cause of 146 fires. Careless use of matches by adults and children playing with matches was the cause of 108 fires. Defective chimneys and defective wiring, both correctve, resulted in 215 fires. Bad Buildings Need Inspections During 1933 and 1934 the funds of the State Fire Marshal's of - fice were spent almost evenly bettween the two statutory activities, inspections and investigations. Incendiarism seems to come in waves and, as this is written, it seems apparent that there will be fewer arson investigations in the near future. But disrepair in old buildings makes inspections increasingly important to fire prevention. </seg>

            <seg id="p011">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION Fire Prevention Campaign in Rural Schools. In this campaign the following letter was sent to every rural school district in the state. The figures in the last column show the number of compliances as reported by the school boards. To the Honorable School Board and Patrons of the school, Dist County of „ State of Nebraska. Pursuant to the authority vested in me by law, I hereby make the following orders, same to be complied with in days from receipt of same.

            <seg id="p012">STATE OF NEBRASKA You are advised in no wise to fail to comply with the above or - der under penalty of law. Witness my signature at Lincoln, Nebraska, this of 1934. (Signed) L. J. Butcher, STATE FIRE MARSHAL. Keep this order and when it is fully complied with, sign and return to us, so we can credit your school as O. K. (To be signed by member of school board) Fire Prevention Week. In preparation for Fire Prevention Week, October 7-13, which was set aside for this purpose by the Governor, 10,000 large window posters and 15,000 small posters were sent out by this office These posters were distributed, proportionally, between school superintend - ents and fire chiefs of 525 Nebraska cities and towns. The large posters were for window displays and the small ones were distributed to students as an aid in their studies of fire prevention. * . ' Fire Prevention Campaign Through 4-H Clubs. In cooperation with Mr. Frisbie of the College of Agriculture, who is m charge of 4-H club work of the state, a campaign was car - ried on through the 4'-H clubs for fire prevention on farms. This office furnished 5.000 ''Home Fire Prevention" buttons as, awards to the children for their accomplishments in fire prevention work on their farms. One of the projects of the 4-H Clubs was called "Fix It Club Demonstration". Questionaires were sent to all members of 4-H clubs to be filled out. A certain number of points were given for different accomplishments, such as: Paint and label gasoline containers. Clean tamps and lanterns, Fix stove pipes and chimney leaks. Fix wires to hang lanterns in barns. Put fire extinguishers in farm buildings. Provide fire buckets In buildings, Ground lightning rods and fences. When 40 points had been earned, a "Home Fire Prevention" but - ton was given. Mr. Frisbie reports that, "These buttons have been worn with a great deal of pride by club members who have won them" </seg>
            <seg id="p013">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION ARSON The arson epidemic, which rose with the peak of the depression, has subsided, gradually, in Nebraska, as it has in the Middle West, generally, although there have been a few notable exceptions. An arson racket that had for long festered, and had been suspected in Chicago was uncovered among a class of un-American criminal opera - tors who had plied their trade in a dozen states and other cities. Through cooperation of local and state officials, wholesale arrests and convic - tions have resulted and the atmosphere is felt to be clearing within the night-ride zone of Chicago. Incendiarism in Omaha was less acute during the past year than in the two preceding years. There are many contributing reasons, of which careful thinkers would agree on the few: 1. The public morale has been bettered since living conditions are easier for the poorer class of people, and moratoriums have made pending foreclosures less terrifying. 2. Investigations and prosecutions have served as warnings that arson is not immediately profitable. 3. Insurance companies have been more carefully considering the moral hazards, have avoided over-insurance and have cancelled many undesirable risks. As stated in the annual report of 1933, that year and the closing months of 1934, marked the worst period in Nebraska's fire record, so far as incindiarism is concerned. There have been fewer fires where criminality was suspected or proven in 1934, and fewer cases were re - ported by local officials for investigation by the state fire marshal's office. Considerable space was devoted in last year's report to the Millard hotel fire in Omaha. The trial of the criminal case against Harry Weiner, which resulted in a divided jury, is yet pending in the district court of Douglas county. Many civil cases against insurance companies by Mr. Weiner are now on the state or. federal court dockets. Inas - much as arson is set as the defense of the fire insurance companies, the trial of these cases runs quite parallel with the criminal action. One civil suit was tried in Omaha and the district judge directed a verdict for Mr. Weiner. The case was appealed to the supreme court and reversed, directing the trial judge to permjt certain circumstantial evidence to be submitted to the jury. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">STATE OF NEBRASKA Just as the Millard hotel case was the most spectacular fire in 1933, so the Frontier hotel fire at Nebraska City was potentially the most out - standing mysterious fire of 1934'. The old four-story brick and ce - ment building was nearly filled with about forty people when an ex - plosion and subsequent fire broke out after midnight. Two strangers were seen in and around the hotel during the busy evening, and after the leasees had retired, one or both of the men were seen to enter the office, it was asserted by witnesses who testified that the men went back to the washroom. An explosion rocked the building and awakened many of the guests. Fire immediately rushed up an adjoining, unused elevator shaft, thus carrying the flames to each of the sleeping floors above. Stairways were immediately filled with smoke, the lights went out, the fire escapes were inadequate and unsafe. The prompt action of firemen with ladders resulted in saving the lives of all the guests, with little injury. They also salvaged some of the furniture and ex - tinguished the flames before the building was totally destroyed. The hotel had been unprofitable trading property for several years and was owned by Morris Levy, or the Levy estate, of Omaha. An earnest investigation of the fire by the state fire marshal's office led to the conviction that the fire was incendiary but there was insuffi - cient evidence to warrant a criminal complaint. This case is of special interest in that it developed the fact that there is no Nebraska statute that permits the state, county or school district to establish a lein for delinquent taxes against the proceeds of the fire insurance policies. Checking back over two years, the fire marshal's office discovers that more than $100,000 in back taxes have thus been lost in fires of quesionable origin. It is hardly necessary to urge that the owner of a property heavily in default of taxes finds that the insurance companies afford the only cash market. Tax evasion may thus be a potent motive for arson. After a series of eleven fires within five months in the Rock Island railway yards at Fairbury, it developed that a former trusted employe had been responsible for some, if not all, of them- Under the influence of drugs which he took to allay pain in an injured leg, Carl Belser was impelled to start a fire so that he could have the super - ior 'satisfaction of ordering out the fire department and bask in the glory of his alert attention to business. Reiser confessed, pled guilty and was sentenced and lodged in the State Reformatory all within one </seg>
            <seg id="p015">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION day. He is now receiving medical attention for his painful limb and is becoming cured of the narcotic habit. When cured and freed from the reformatory, he will probably return to his accustomed place with the railway company. A non-resident husband and wife owned an unprofitable house in a northwest Nebraska town. By connivance, an itinerant friend moved into the house. It burned. A deputy state fire marshal and a deputy state sheriff, with the aid of local officials, developed evidence, held Ernest Richey for trial at the next term of district court. - A warning came from Omaha that tenants were being moved out of any old house preparatory to having a fire. The fire happened ac - cording to schedule in an early morning hour and was quickly put out by firemen. Later in the day the recent occupants of the house were seen about the place and very soon a second fire started. It was better kindled and this time a complete job was done. The matter of owner - ship and occupancy was involved, all parties having collected money for previous fires. But no one could swear to just which person struck the match that started the fire in the kerosene-soaked house. So the in - surance companies paid again, and paid enough. John Bartlett of Strang paid $150 for an abandoned church build - ing in that village which is without fire protection. He insured it for $600 and secured $200 more insurance on $50 worth of furniture that he moved in to start a beer parlor. The beer business was not a suc - cess. The church burned down during early morning hours. Bartlett was bound over for trial in district court but a retiring county attorney dismissed the case for want of evidence as his last official act. Clifford King is doing time at Hawthorn Apartments for a big store fire at Kearney. He pled guilty to robbery and said that while he was inside the store, he accidentally started a fire that almost cost him his life. About six years ago Roy Preston was suspected of burning his dance pavillion at Monroe. He went away for some time but when he returned he met his Nemesis in a man whose son he had abused. An eye witness to the fire was discovered and brought back from the Pacific Coast, with the assistance of postal inspectors and National Board agents. He was tried in district court of Platte county and convicted. His case is now pending on appeal to the supreme court. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">STATE OF NEBRASKA With the value of the buildings set at $6,500 and insurance to the amount of $15,250 in four policies; with the firemen reporting that the fire started on the southeast side of the building, the side from which the wind was blowing; with two other fires of record against the man in another town; with the man away from home at the time of the fire, these circumstances, at least, all point to suspicion. No one saw the man near the buildings which were fifty miles from his home. Nothing was found which would actually connect him with the cause of the fire except that he would greatly profit by the burning of the buildings. i What might have been a serious fire had the windows been open to give it draft occurred in a small city. Kerosene was found spread all over the parlor rug, gasoline can in the wood box in the kitchen, alcohol had been poured on the foot of two beds. The owner had requested an employee to get some information from a party living seven blocks away and they would meet later and go to a show. When faced with the evidence, the assured boarded a bus for another state before the" papers could be served. Arrested by the police upon arrival, at first giving an alias. Finally waived extradition and was brought back. The trial was held and the defendant acquitted. The owner appraised the property at $1,600 with insurance of $3,000. Seven hundred* dollars would probably cover the actual value of the property. Two fires in ten days with a record of twelve fires in ten years cashing in on $14,000 insurance, on none of which was the full face value of the insurance policies collected, is the record. Two houses and grourfd had been bought for $550. Insurance was secured on one of them for $1,500. There were taxes on the property to the amount of $200. ; The old tenants had been requested to move because he "wanted to improve the property". By burning this building, he could make the difference between $1,500 and the $550 paid for the buildings, pay the taxes and have to the good $750 and the other property free.. Did he pay the taxes? He did not. Theodore Zoller of Brewster, a lad of fourteen was sent to the State Industrial School at Kearney for setting fire to a barn at a rural school house. Young Zoller was soon suspected and confessed to the sheriff. His object, he said, in setting the fire was "to see it bum". Theodore and his sister had been living with a member of the school board since there mother died. The whereabouts of the father is unknown. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION Lawrence Briggs confessed to starting no fewer than five fires in small garages in the neighborhood of 38th and T Streets, Omaha, after having been caught at a garage of F. Tonner, 3812 T St. He seemed to have no motive other than to see the fire and to watch the fire trucks rush to the rescue. Evidence of pyromania warranted turning him over to the Douglas county board of insanity for observation. If he is found to be sane, he will be tried for arson. Two young men, one a minor, of Omaha were apprehended for burning an uninsured shack in the extreme northwest part of the city. Because they are members of good families, they were quietly taken before the juvenile court. They pled guilty and were paroled from the bench. Gunpowder, dynamite caps and fuse were found in the immediate rear of a restaurant and candy kitchen in Fremont. An explosion in the basement was first attributed to a leak in the natural gas pipes. But gas does not need gunpower and dynamite. The loss was heavy but the insurance carried was heavier. Business had not been good and the owner was known to have sought a purchaser. He was not on the most friendly terms with a rival confectioner of the same nation - ality. But the owner was comfortably situated financially and had un - limited credit through wealthy relatives. Some body set the fire that exploded and burned the store, but there was not enough evidence to satisfy a jury "beyond a reasonable doubt" and no complaint has yet been filed. A once valuable home had iost its value because colored people had pre-empted the neighborhood and the property had become trad - ing stock. Its size and construction warranted insurance beyond its market price. Under a forfeited contract for sale, delinquent taxes had accumulated until they almost absorbed the sale value. The prop - erty was purchased for a small payment by a man who assumed the taxes. When it immediately burned the insurance was collected but there was no way to make the man who collected the insurance pay the taxes. Mr. Rundin is about 77 years old, a drifter. He was around North Loup as a charity boarder, doing occasional jobs for two or three years. Two or three harmless fires were traced to him. Recently his mind has been wandering and he was seen in different parts of the village at unseemly hours. Mr. and Mrs. Westberg had fed and lodged him. They became fearful of him since finding a fire under their bed. He has, also, frightened other people. Word was passed to the Valley county authorities by a member of the fire marshal's office and we are advised that the insanity commission has found him of unsound mind and has committed him to the State Hospital at Hastings. </seg>

The figures given above are probably about half the losses sustained by motor vehicles by fire in Nebraska. The Fire Prevention Association With Gordon Beats as president and Paul Barr as secretary, the Nebraska Fire Prevention Association, which is generally made up of the fire insurance field men of the state, painstsaking inspections were made during the summer months at Superior, Beatrice and Grand Island. Two days and about twenty men employed in each case care - fully inspected all public and commercial buildings, pointing out to the owners and occupants the fire hazards and the best remedies. In - formative addresses were given at public schools and luncheon clubs, and a final meeting was held at each town with the chambers of com - merce. The State Fire Marshal's office was represented at each meet - ing and gave final orders in stubborn cases. The Nebraska Fire Prevention Association is a unit of a simitar national organization and is doing a fine piece of educational work in saving life and prop - erty. New Volunteer Fire Departments Representatives of the State Fire Marshal's office and of the Omaha Fire Department assisted in organizing a volunteer fire de - partment at Papillion. Ponca, Winnetoon and Stella are similarly interested. </seg>
