            <seg id="p018">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 17 Wednesday, Thursday and Friday January 19, 20 and 21, 1916 Held in Assembly Room, 110 Plant Industry Building, University Farm, Lincoln, Nebraska State Farm, Lincoln, Nebraska JANUARY 19, 1916 Wednesday, 1:30 P. M. Afternoon Seaaiaa Meeting called to order by President Joe. S. (lark, of Ravenna, Nebraska, who said in introducing the first number on the program: Ladies and Gentlemen, and Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association : At this, the thirty-first annual gathering of the association, we have the pleasure of having with us an expert from the State Dairy Department, one who is the head of the Dairy Husbandry Department of the state of Nebraska, in the person of Professor Frandsen, who is the first on the program with an address of welcome, and who is here to show the people out over the state and the members of this asso - ciation and especially the dairymen that the State is desirious of work - ing closely together with us, and that they have an interest in our wel - fare all the time and are only too glad to have us come down and use their buildings and make us feel at home, and to know that they will do everything for us they can do in our endeavors to build up dairying out over the State. They are only too glad to do it and in order to crys - talize this feeling in a few words, I have the pleasure of introducing Professor J. H. Frandsen, the head of the Dairy Husbandry Department of the State Farm, who will welcome you here today. ■ Professor Frandsen spoke as follows: Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I see a few ladies here; I was afraid I would not be able to am any ladies, but I am very glad that I can. I want to emphasise that one point. I presume it is because it is stormy today and be - cause the ladies do the milking and have to be at home to attend to that duty, that is really why they are not present. I think we ought to make an extraordinary plea to the ladies to attend all of these functions because I think they have a very vital interest in these matters. t Professor Holden told a story a couple of years ago which I think good. He was visiting a couple of old people. The doctor had called shortly before to see the good wife of this man and he ? a very careful examination. When he came out the husband said, at is the matter with Mary?" The doctor said, "She is suffering i melancholia." "The husband says, "I don't see where Mary </seg>
            <seg id="p019">18 could get that, she hasn't been out of the kitchen for twenty-thrt-i yean." I think if we would scratch around a little and bring our lady friends out here they would not only be prevented from catchinir melan - cholia and things of that kind, but it would help in running the financial side of the association. When our secretary asked me some time ago to deliver this ad - dress of welcome I looked up some of your old reports and was sur - prised to find that for a large number of years you got along without an address of welcome — I wondered just why this change. I wa* especially worrying about it until I remembered when on the Dairy Demonstration train run some years ago where ycur secretary, Mr. McGinnis, took a prominent part, he always introduced me to the au - dience as the "State's Hired Man." Now, who ever heard of listening to the hired man? If you have any work on the place for him he is gen - erally a valuable man and you usually have something cut out for him to do other than making speeches. He is a busy man, so I was wondering about this address of welcome. Here at the Farm we are all busy. We are a good deal like the hired boy who, after he had worked for a farmer on a ranch for a year or two, felt that he could live with the daughter. He talked to the old farmer and asked him if he could marry his daughter. The farmer said, "I wouldn't think of you marry - ing my duaghter until you have a steady job." The boy came crying to his friend and said, "What do you think, he wouldn't let me have time enough off to find a steady job." That is the way we are here with our short courses and one thing and another, but we are very glad to take this week off in an effort to show you what we have here and you will probably gather inspiration for the future. I think as your secretary used to say, it is quite proper to call us. or speak of us, as your hired men — your servants. You are here to inspect the work of your servants and to look over the work being done on the campus. You are here to look over the location of these build - ings, and the cows, and while here I hope you will look over the dairy barn, the calves, and our butter making, and ice cream cows. I hope you will get all you can out of this looking over of the plant. These cows, and buildings and servants are all anxious to make your wel - come sincere and cordial for this three days' session, but, we hope you will be glad to attend a longer session and will want to come back to the nine days' short course session in dairying, and the milk producers short course. We expect others will be interested in butter making and ice cream making and we hope to interest you in that in our five days' course which we will have. Then we hope you will want your boys to take the six weeks' short course and some even, to register in the regular agricultural work. Another thing, I want you to get acquainted with our field men in dairying. You can all come to this institution for help and encouragement and you can tell your troubles and we can tell our troubles, too. We hope to increase the number of our dairy field men who can come to you and who are not afraid to pull off their </seg>
            <seg id="p020">19 coats and get right into the work and help you if they can. ProfeMor D. H. Propps is our dairy field man and I want you to get acquainted with him. He is willing to work on your different farms and is there, not to indulge in theoretical efforts, but to help you solve your troubles. He is there at your service; if you want him to help you select batter cows or sires or weed out your poor cows. He is also there to help plan better and more scientific milk houses and barns and make sug - gestions regarding the best and most scientific equipment for such buildings. He is like the mother-in-law; someone asked a man if his mother-in-law ever visited him. He said, "Yep, regularly twice a year and she stays six months each time." Now the professor wont stay that long, but he will stay as long and give you as much time as he can, and all you have to do is to call on him and he will come aa soon as he can. We hope in some way, some how, soon, to be able to put more field men out. I was in Omaha the other day and we invited the ice cream men's convention to Lincoln, and this is the argument we put up to them; ■m* said, "Why meet in Omaha all the time?" Mr. Ringer of your Manufacturer's Association especially made this point. Why not come to the State Farm where everything is saturated with ice cream? They saw the significance of it and decided to come to Lincoln for their next meeting. I think that is quite a significant point; you are where your speakers can make use of the cow's records and history building from the equipment we have, and to impress a little stronger the points we intend to make. So I think you start out right with the surroundings while you meet here on the campus. While you are here I want you to look over our new dairy build - ing, which we showed you the plans of last year. This year we are having to report progress and the walls are looming up somewhat above the second story, and next year, I feel that I can proimse you, without any degree of rashness, that your meetings will be held in that building, which will be one of the best equipped and will cost as much as any dairy building in the country at this time. It is perhaps the first building on this campus that compares favorably with the other buildings and other institutions; it is a step in the right direction. It is equipped not only to give illustrated talks, but you will have here a building built in the most sanitary way, yet it isn't anything extrava; (rant; it will have rooms so that we can demonstrate butter making and testing, cheese making, ice cream making and every other work connected with a dairy organization that will al be at your service at the next Then just below that you will find the dairy barn. It is changed somewhat since last year; we have spent a little time and some money in remodeling it; we have put in new stalls and stanchions and new floor material. There is a lesson in that; we could have put in all one kind of stalls and floors which would have looked a little better but we thought we would make it as much of a demonstration and show the educational feature as much as possible, so instead of selecting </seg>
            <seg id="p021">20 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION one kind we selected three of the best stalls; three of the best kinds of floor material; so when you go there you will have a chance to see the advantages of the three kinds put in the dairy barns which I think will be of value to you. You will find three different kinds of floor material used, and there is a good deal of controversy as to which is the best kind; you will see how cement on top of cinders works; you will see how creosote blocks with asphalt work; and on the third row you will have a chance to see how brick works — they are all three in your view. Perhaps there has been no bigger foe to the dairy interests than tuberculosis. Three years ago we erected an open shed in which we kept our cows as much as possible. In the eastern states and in Europe they keep them in barns and thev have more trouble than we do, so when we put our cows in these open air sheds they are getting the open air treatment; they are kept as much as possible in these open sheds so they are getting plenty of air and circulation, and most of the feeding is done in these sheds. They get air, light and exercise. so you will see how that works and we have had very few cows with tuberculosis since that was started. I think you will find in that barn some of the most convenient mangers and places for feeding and the best of it all is that it is made from our own lumber that we worked up ourselves.

It is an open air bull shed constructed on similar lines as the cow shed. tNow we have tried not to make these things expensive or extrav - it, we have tried to make them all economically.

PRESIDENTS ANNUAL ADDRESS Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association, Ladies and Gentle- men: Your directors of this association, in planning the program for this the thirty-first annual meeting of the association, have endeavored to build up a program that would appeal personally to everybody, either directly or indirectly connected with or interested in the dairy business of Nebraska. tThe improvement in quality of the raw material, butterfat, and enhancing of the price to the producer, the good being done for iring and the dairymen by the farm demonstrator, the interest of the umer in, and how best he likes his milk, cream and butter served to by the producer and, the interest of the producer in pleasing the umer are all topics that your committee deemed of live and vital •est to those that come here to attend this annual gathering. t&gt; building up of a dairy herd, which means so much to the suc - il dairyman in the way of cash returned for his labors, the exhibits and demonstrations made each year at the State Fair ow the people of this great state, the progress and development e of its greatest industries and the future of dairying generally »n by a master mind in the business are all items of great interest ill of which will be thoroughly treated here within the next two tit is earnestly hoped by your directors that this program will I with as hearty and loyal support as have those of former years, if so they will not feel to have labored in vain, but that the con - n of the association and the dairy business in Nebraska shall be </seg>
            <seg id="p023">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 22 at least no worse off for our having been entrusted with it for the past twelve months. »In referring to Nebraska as a dairy state, which is the topic that ve chosen for a few minutes' talk, one is naturally led to look the history of dairying in Nebraska, past, present and future. Kf observation of the dairy and creamery business in Nebraska, not quite so extensive as that of some of our older members. s back over a period of twenty-two years this past summer. tSome few of our members have been interested in the dairy and nery industry in Nebraska, six to ten years longer than this, but i sure they will agree with me, when I say there was very little ge or improvement in dairying methods from 1880 to 1890, and no icular progress indicated, except for the steady growth and in - ■ing volume. Both to the dairymen and the creamery men, however, this con - stant growth of the business from year to year, is today and was a quarter of a century ago a sure indication to those interested and ob - serving, that dairying is "a natural resource" so to speak and a fixed institution of Nebraska. tLook back for a moment on the first official census report of the int of creamery butter made in Nebraska. I use the official govern- I census reports of creamery butter manufactured, to indicate the rth of dairying in Nebraska, as there is no accurate report of the ant of dairy butter made, yet we must conclude that the amount rather larger than normal as at that time there were so few tneries in the state. I In 1880 the entire creamery butter product manufactured in Ne - ka for one year was sixty-five thousand pounds, an amount equal liat which several of Nebraska's largest creameries now make in lgle day, during the flush of a season. Think of it, the make for entire year of the whole state being only equal to that made in : of our largest creameries in one day now. Pi sixty-five thousand pounds made in 1880, we find the make increasing to over six million pounds in 1890 and to nearly lillion in 1900, and again an increase to nearly twenty-five i 1910. Frem 1890, when, as we might say, the real develop - dairying began in Nebraska, we find the make of butter each ten years as shown by the national census of 1900 and Now at the close of the season of 1915, only half way between the past national census and the next national census, what do we find the condition of dairying to be, namely this: that in the past five years only we have seen doubled our volume of butter manu - factured and as 1916 greets us, we find that we have just finished a yearly make of nearly fifty million pounds of butter in Nebraska. With these most remarkable figures of development to refer to, we have every reason to believe that when the next national roll is called, five years hence, Nebraska will have achieved the most re- </seg>

It reads like a story abian Nights and nothing can approach it, yet these are the facts, with the state records of Nebraska to substantiate every of it. With a start towards improvement in the grade of dairy cattle this year of 1916, together with the natural rate of increase in volume we could in 1920 be producing actually two hundred million pounds of butter each year, worth fifty to sixty millions of dollars annually to Nebraska. No other agricultural industry in the world can begin to show such a gain in volume as we have in the past five years, nor such a gain over these figures as we will make in the next five yean. I In view of these most encouraging and most remarkable condi - i, it is to be hoped that Nebraska dairymen will not settle back the feeling of satisfaction and plenty, but instead look the sit - &gt;n squarely in the face and see if we cannot find it possible to in - se the present average production of the Nebraska cow at least &gt;le what it is today. I This suggestion at first might sound like talk and theory only without weighing carefully the cost and effort required to aeean - i so much. I The average butter fat production of the Nebraska cow today is hundred and thirty pounds, annually, this according to the very records the state is able to compile. The cow, Duchess Skylark Ormsby of Woodlake farm two miles from Minneapolis has within a few weeks completed a year's record of over twelve hundred pounds of butter fat, or nearly as much as ten average Nebraska cows are doing today, and there stands within a few yards of us in the stable over there a cow that has made a record of nearly seven times what the average Nebraska cow is doing and in that stable are two dozen cows that have produced and are pro - ducing every year, four or five times as much as our average Ne - braska cow, and on feed grown in Nebraska, and accessable to every dairyman on every dairy farm in the state. In order to increase our butter fat production forty million pounds annually in Nebraska and add to our wealth as a state twelve or fifteen million dollars each year, our cows don't have to produce half as much as she did, they don't have to produce one-fourth as much butter fat as she did, but if they can only be made to produce one - fifth as much as this great cow, or one-fourth as much as our own LtMay in the barn over there, then our production of butter fat will again double, and Nebraska will profit fifteen million dollars every year, over what she now profits from dairying. I haven't the time and probably not the technical knowledge to enter into this matter in detail, but simply wish to outline the possibil- ities of Nebraska as a Dairy State, and to say further that the two </seg>
            <seg id="p025">24 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION greatest factors, in fact all that is required to accomplish these great ends, is summed up in these two words, feeding and breeding. I For example, take the average farmer today milking ten cows, will say, and he is selling one hundred thirty pounds of fat from 1 of the ten cows, or thirty-five dollars worth from each cow and n his herd of ten, three hundred and fifty dollars worth per year. Now, if instead each farmer were milking ten good grade Hol - steins, Guernseys, Jerseys or Ayrshires and with the twelve hundred pound cow as his ideal, would it not be possible to raise our Nebraska average production from the present one hundred thirty pounds per year to at least two hundred forty pounds, only one-fifth, twenty per tof what the champion has just done. By this improvement in ing, each farm would be turning off practically twenty-five hun - pounds of butter fat annually, an increase of ten to twelve hun - weight of butter fat and $300.00 in money and Nebraska would few years be realizing an increase of fifty or sixty million pounds of butter fat sold annually and an addition to the wealth of this great state of fifteen millions of dollars per year. kBy the proper selection of a dairy sire for the herd, to get to - er a bunch of high grade dairy stock is but the work of few s, yet note the wonderful increase in cash returns to the dairymen ebraska. I As an alfalfa and corn growing state, we have right in our very •p. in alfalfa and the silo, together with our wonderful climate, very fundiments of the greatest dairy section of the world. I All these things nature has b?stowed bountifully upon us and now ing at dairying in Nebraska from the standpoint of the marketing his great volume of product we find we are just as much blessed fe are with nature's golden bounty. The farmer lesiding way out on Wyoming and Colorado lines can get within a few cents of as much his can of cream as the fanner in our Missouri River counties, and of this comes about through the extensive trunk lines of railroads ersing the state from end to end and ever increasing competition the cream product. As our much-loved ex-Secretary S. C. Bassett once said in an annual meeting a few years ago — the fact that our state is traversed from east to west with three trunk lines of railroad and the fact that the western half of the state is rather sparsely settled, makes the establishment of large creameries in the eastern portion of the state, at great railroad centers, perfectly natural and but a result of conditions prevailirg. KTo ore who will stuHy the map of Nebraska as to railroads, it d look as natural for the bulk of the cream over the state to er at these points, as for the confluence of all rivers and streams iis wrstcrn country into the Missouri. kThe fight for bvtter fat grows fiercer year by year and the er of 1915-1916 w'll go into history as a period of the highest ■s ever paid for butter fat in Nebraska. </seg>

With the united efforts of the creamery man and dairyman towards improvement in the general quality of cream delivered which can best and most quickly be accomplished by the use of the cream cooling tank, the quality of all Nebraska butter will be improved. With the improvement in quality comes the quick and sure improvement in price, and the making of butter in quality equal to that of any other section and when that time comes we will not only be producing the most butter of any state, but we will also on account of our superior marketing privileges, be receiving the most money of any dairy state for our production. This is a condition that is sure to follow, other - wise at the close of the great war, with the tariff on butter removed, the foreigner is going to take our best markets for butter, and the war is serving as a period of probation for us, till we can fit ourselves to meet the foreign butter competition.

That is, how much money it costs the consumer and how much money it yields the producer. It might mean utility or intrinsic value. That is how it serves the consumer for the pur - pose for which he obtained it. It is natural for dairymen to want a better reward for their efforts. A better reward justly earned, is an index of efficiency and usefulness to society. From a viewpoint of public policy, a better reward obtained by such methods is desirable and praiseworthy.

The Eighteenth Report of the Commissioner of Labor, page 847 •hows that in the period from 1890 to 1903 there was no substantial upward or downward course in the relative price of butter. The period from 1907 to 1913 I find in the Statistical Abstract of the U. S. 1914. Relative Retail Price of Butter 1907 g4.1 1908 85.7 1909 90.2 1910 94.0 1911 87.6 1912 VIA 1913 _ 100.0 The average price for 1913 is taken as a basis 100. These figures- ■bow an upward trend in the price of butter. These are the latest available figures. From the above mentioned Statistical Abstract, I calculate the yearly per capita production of butter as follows: Tear lbs. per Capita 1850 13.6 1860 14.8 1870 13.5 1880 16.1 1890 19.1 1900 19.4 1910 _17.4 Gain in population 1900-1910 „ 20.3% Gain in butter 1899-1909 &amp;&amp;% 10.3% less butter per capita in 1909 than in 1900. The supply of dairy products this year is more abundant, but it is yet to be seen whether this is the temporary result of a wet season or a permament change in the industry. Hence a higher price of butter is consistent with supply and de- mand. The farmer has received 95% of this advance in price. In the last decade his land has nearly doubled in cost, and the cost of his labor has grown considerably, thus increasing his cost of produc- tion. By the expenditure of more sanitary barns and labor the farmer is producing a more wholesome product but at greater cost. Increased demand, decreased supply, and increased cost of produc- tion justify an advance in the price of butter. But the price has ad- vanced very little. The reason for that is that a retail price of 40 cents a pound is to the limit of what the majority of consumers think they can afford to pay. An excessive price of butter curtails consump- tion and drives people to substitutes. When the price falls to normal levels consumption does not respond and prices fall abnormally low. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">28 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Thus the producer suffers a loss in the end because the high price was for a small volume and the low price is for a large volume. »The winter price of the best grade of butter is as high as the con - ?r can afford to pay and the dairyman cannot expect a better re- I from an increase in price of such butter. »But only 15% of the creamery butter sells for the highest price, other 85% and the majority of farm-made butter sell for about cents less because the flavor is not so good. Hence the farmers to get $50,000,000 a year because they needed flavor. I The majority of the farmers fail to get the benefit of the high «r price because they produce most of their butter-fat in the sum - when there is a surplus of it and it is cheap. What they remem - and talk about all the time is the low price in the summer. What consumer remembers longest and talks about all the time is the high e he has to pay in the winter. Si market milk conditions resemble the butter situation. The &gt;d cost of land, labor, buildings and sanitation have increased t of producing milk. The consumer is paying all the price he he can afford. An advance in the price results in decreased ption. A special grade of better milk at a higher price finds small sale in the large cities. t Therefore, the belief of the consumer that he cannot afford to more than the present top prices for butter, milk, and cream es it impossible to increase the dairyman's profit by a higher top &gt;. But the majority of the dairymen do not get the top prices be - e their product lacks flavor or is produced in the summer when s is a surplus. t Winter dairying brings the best prices. It equalizes farm labor lg more to do during the slack season. Calves born in the fall winter are less liable to scours. They get the benefit of pasture l ready for it hile the summer calf has to be winter-fed after weaned. Absence of flies, heat, and the demands of sowing, hay - and harvesting make milking a pleasanter chore in the winter. tLack of cooling causes most of the lack of flavor in dairy products, and cream should be cooled as low and as soon as possible. Run spring or well water, or ice will do this. Cream just skimmed Id not be mixed with previous skimmings until it is well cooled, should be done in a narrow can set in cold water. Water cools ity-five times as fast as air. Milk and cream promptly cooled in * will keep sweet two or three days in the summer. I The farmer can build his own cooling tank. For this purpose s and specifications can be obtained free upon request to the dairy ols and creameries. Those who do not wish to build a tank can one. I have made temperature tests of a number of tanks. Wooden ■ and metal tanks insulated with cork, flax fibre, and lith at 3° w zero withstood freezing for 48 hours. A metal tank with espe - y thick insulation withstood freezing for sixty hours. At 95*, h is very hot, these tanks held the temperature below 60° for 12 </seg>
            <seg id="p030">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 29 hours. The especially insulated tank held the temperature below 60* longer than 24 hours. K Keeping cream cold will protect against injury to flavor if the m is delivered promptly to the creamery. It should be delivered •ast every two days in the summer and at least every three days le winter. KThe dairyman's profit is the difference between the cost of pro - ion and the selling price. Reducing the cost of production ten cent increases the profit just as much as increasing the selling I ten per cent. i Profiting by reducing the cost of production is in harmony with ic policy. It is a problem right at home on the farm and there - more under the dairyman's control than price problems in distant s. It affords as great opportunities for profit as increasing the e. Cost can be reduced by increasing soil fertility, labor saving tiods and equipment, better crops, better storage of crops, and bet - cows. The possibilities here are wonderful and as great as those rded by any other business. The quality of an article has a great deal to do with the way the price looks to the consumer. Forty cents a pound does not look quite so big if the quality is excellent. The worthiest labor of all has to do with increasing the intrinsic value or utility of dairy products to the consumer. To do this the highest quality should be the aim. Flavor and every other quality should be good. The methods of making and packing should insure keeping quality. The packages should protect against external injuries to keeping quality, appearance, and loss of weight. Pasteurized butter is as safe from disease as any food can be made. The pasteurization gives it the very best keeping quality. The more uniform the quality the better pleased is the consumer. Giv - ing the consumer an excellent product at one time and an average product another time provokes more complaint than furnishing him an average product all the time. A brand on a product enables the consumer to buy again the product which he found good and to avoid the product which he found poor. If the product is not branded the consumer might go to another store to seek relief and there have the same unbranded product thrust upon him. Cleanliness certainly pays well in quality of dairy products. But even if it did not pay, no dairyman could say that he would be dirty unless someone paid him for the effort to clean up. I know it coats to keep clean but the dairyman keeps clean because it is a moral obligation and not a question of pay. A product that is healthful has greater intrinsic value to the con - sumer than a product that might communicate disease. The responsi - bility and cost of producing a disease-free product is a burden which the dairyman must bear. Cleanliness, health of attendants and the herd, and certification or pasteurization protect the consumer ade- </seg>
            <seg id="p031">30 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION One of the marks of the times are drastic statements about th - bad condition, unhealthfulness and exorbitant prices of foods. There ia an impression that only those who tell how bad and dear food is. are truthful and disinterested; that those who have anything- good to say about food are selfish and untruthful. Persons who use sensa - tional superlatives and assert that all of a certain food is unfit to eat. and that all the producers of that food are what they should not be. receive vastly more publicity than those who express themselves in the language of polite society and do not believe everyone wrong and all of a food unfit to eat. I believe that the first right to speak for or against food belongs to the consumer and to those whose living de - pends upon supplying food. Consumers have been prejudiced against dairy products by misrep - resentation and exaggertion. To have the consumer appreciate the value of dairy products an educational campaign is necessary; for this purpose I give the following facts upon the nutritive and dietetic value of butter. t December 10, 1915, a well known first class grocery sold butter ie consumer in Chicago at 38 cents a pound. For this price they ined a certain amount of nutrients and economic service. At the » which prevailed for the best goods at that store, ten cents would bought the following number of calories in the foods given, cal - ted from "The Principles of Human Nutrition," Jordan, p. 119, 1912: §In the winter the prices of butter is at its highest figures. The of the year the consumers buy it at a lower price. The price is i lower in the summer. The other foods in the above table ar*&gt; ly the same price the year around. 1 Contrary to popular opinion, butter is not the most expensive food. I moderate in nutrients obtained for the price. Butter not only a high nutritive value, but it also has a high flavor which increases palatability and digestibility of food like bread and potatoes, which Id otherwise be insipid.

It is the cheapest food of that class. Combined with bread, butter makes one of the cheapest of foods. Bread and butter is about the lowest priced order or dish in restaurant. The above table does not show the full nutritive value of butter because it gives only the chemical value. In actual digestion 97 H per cent of the butter is digested and other fats have a still lower digesti - bility. This is stated by Robert Hutchinson in his "Food and the Prin - ciples of Dietetics," p. 135: "The ease with which butter is digested renders it of great value as a source of fat in the diet of sickness.. In phthisis, dia - betes and many forms of dyspepsia, patients can take a quarter of a pound of it a day without difficulty and with great advantage to nutrition. Cooked butter, on the other hand, is more apt to disagree, probably owing to the liberation of fatty acids in it by the heat employed in cooking. The absorption of butter in the intestine is very complete even when one quarter of a pound of it is taken per day, less than .5',' ( is wasted. This is a more profitable result than would be obtained with any other form of fat and should teach us that it may be well to give butter a fair trial before haying recourse to cod-liver oil or other medicinal fatty preparations.

In preparing for cooking and for eating, a considerable part of most foods is discarded. The work of preparing the food, the seasoning, and the labor and fuel con- sumed in cooking, add that much to the cost of those foods. The cooking .shrinks many of the foods. Butter is ready to eat as purchased and tno further expense of preparation. Ten cents worth of butter food and actually furnishes the consumer 948 calories of which is digestible with ease. The digestion of a bulky food of low nutritive value consumes considerable of the food's energy in the work i if digestion itself. Other fats may substitute for butter chemically by furnishing the required number of calories, but they cannot take its place in digesti- bility and flavor. Bread spread with jam becomes more nutritious and savory. Hutchinson describes as follows the possibility of such substitution: To srtrtitute for butter would require 2* parts of </seg>

Health Through Rational Diet r Arnold Lorand, a prominent Carlsbad Physician, p. 189, 1912. "Fat is a cosmetic in warm climates; craved in cold. "Good fresh butter is the most savory and probably also the most easily tolerated of all fats. Its principal advantage over other kinds of fats is that its fat is not enclosed in cells but consists of free globules so that it is more easily acted upon by the digestive juices and more readily digested." "It would be a good thing for us to adopt the custom which prevails in America of eating some butter with each meal. In the restaurants there, butter is furnished without charge, along with the other foods ordered." He ranks butter in digestibility as follows Butter and goose fat. Pork fat. Beef fat. Lamb fat. He further states that fish fat is more unpleasant than butter. Also that butter is far better than vegetable fats. The nervous system of a young infant is the least developed of all animals. To develop it the human breast furnishes a milk richer in lecithin than the milk of any other animal. Lecithin closely resembles nerve and brain tissue. This is testified by Burow in the Zeitschrift fuer Fysiologische Chemie 19000 Vol. XXX, p. 495. Suckling of Ox Dog Man Weight of brain to weight of body...- 1:370 1:30 1:7 Percentage of lecithin in protein of milk 1.40 2.11 3.05 I calculate that the fats of the above animals contain the following rentages of lecithin in the fats: Ox, 1.4; Dog, 0.16; Man, 1.7. Butter fat ranks next to human milk fat in lecithin. Figures on the percentage of lecithin in other animals fats are scarce, and it appears that the percentage is very low or none. The researches of McCollum of the Wisconsin Experiment Station, reveal in butter and eggs the unique power of promoting growth of young animals, which is lacking in the majority of other fats.

            <seg id="p034">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 33 tically coincide. I cannot tell whether intelligence creates an appetite for batter or eating butter produces intelligence. Butter is the product of milk and contains the same germs as milk. But the churning and washing of the butter eliminate the ma - jority of germs. Furthermore butter is eaten in small quantities, a half an ounce making a portion where a four ounce glass of milk is a portion. In speaking about disease and butter, some people place them in an association that makes butter appear a very dangerous food which has caused much disease. I know of no authoritative record where a disease was caused by butter. Some of the most eminent authorities state the case in substantially the same words. The producer wishes to make butter as good as possible and hopes that it will be as good as the consumer wants it to be. Pasteurization destroys all disease germs. Pasteurized butter is as free from disease danger as any other food that comes to the kitchen door. Considerable of the butter is pasteurized. If the consumer appreciates pasteurization, the producer will furnish pasteurized butter. In summary, increasing the value of dairy products by increasing their price is not possible nor lawful. Proceeds can be increased by bringing some of the low grade products to top grade quality and by producing more in the winter, when prices are high. Profits can be increased by reducing the cost of production. The customer will feel that he is getting more for his money if the quality is pleasing and healthful. Dairy products have been scandalized before the consumer. He should be informed of their true condition and utility. F. W. BOUSKA. Professor Bouska: You will notice that these figures are gathered from various sources. It is only recently that the Govern - mental Department Agency has been gathering figures and in some cues these are only scattered. (Here Professor Bouska exemplified his talk with lantern slides and charts.) Question asked Professor Bouska by member: Q. — Does the silo increase the cost of producing butter fat? Professor Bouska: I think it increases the capacity for producing butter fat, yet it takes more money to equip a farm and get it to going, and as such I think it not out of place to point out to the con - sumer that we are putting in more money. Mr. Stewart: I think we ought to give the professor a vote of thanks, for this speech shows a vast amount of labor and research and it is full of salient facts; as far as I am concerned I wish we might devise a method by which it could be put in print; it is a very solid, substantial and unquestionably a very truthful statement. The President: I would say that we have made such arrangements to take care of this matter and to have it entered as a part of our proceeding*. </seg>
            <seg id="p035">34 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION The President: Yes sir. Nobody appreciates to what extent Pro - fessor Bouska has gone to compile this, and it is very doubtful if we could have gotten the same matter from any other part of the country. The President: Now as conclusion of this article on the "Im - portance of Improving Quality of Dairy Products," we have a dis - cussion to follow, to be led by Professor A. L. Haecker of Lincoln, and I take 'pleasure in introducing to you Professor A. L. Haecker, who will now conduct the discussion on this subject. Professor Haecker spoke at follows: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have put in writing a few remarks I want to be embodied in my answer to this splendid paper. I expected that Professor Bouska would confine himself to the subject of dairying and improving the quality, but he has taken up the subject and put it on a broader basis and has gone really where we must go, and that is back to the cost. Last week it was my privilege to attend a similar gathering in th&lt;' state of Minnesota. At a banquet which was given by the Holstein Breeders of the state of Minnesota, I heard a splendid address given by Mr. John B. Erwin who now deserves the distinction of producing and having the cow that has the world's record for butter and milk pro - duced in one year. He has well earned this title, for his father before him was a great breeder of Holstein cattle for many years. He took up the same line of work and has carried it out in a splendid and intelligent manner, and has done a great piece of work in developing some wonderful strains of dairy animals of the Holstein breed. This is what he pointed out very clearly and those of you wh enow a little of the dairy history of this country will know it is true hat is, that we don't place enough stress on advertising and publicity and the power of the public press. It is like public sentiment, 1 sweeps everything when it gets started and it has a momentum whic seems to pick up as it goes. The fact is, we are building as dairymen o mat years, and instead of promoting this campaign and fostering it w are actually standing in the way and blocking it and interfering wit jiving publicity to good, wholesome dairy products. You know in th &gt;ottom of your hearts that milk is one of the most wholesome food that can be consumed; you know it is good. You know in all familie where the children have consumed large quantities of it they ar nvariably strong and healthy and vigorous and haven't the ills tha other children have. Japan has seen this years ago and has started to break down tha old religious conviction that there was something unholy about th cow. They saw on their small island with something like — I dont know the area — but they have over 40,000,000 people, that they were coming to the place where their population didn't increase; the children died because they didn't have milk, if their mother was unable to nurse them, and their inability to eat ordinary food naturally meant death We know how many children there are in this country and this state who are practically reared on cow's milk, it is nearly one-half, maybe </seg>
            <seg id="p036">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 35 I&gt;; so Japan tried our way and tried to overcome that foolish super - &gt;n that the cow was unholy, and went even further and got into ow business. I have met Japanese (government buyers, buying cattle ike over to Japan: they saw the need of the cow, maybe. That 1 illustration. It is absolutely true that the civilized people and strong people of the earth are the people who are engaged in bury business on a large plan. Now here is where I want to repeat what I heard at Minneapolis, from Mr. Edwin: Mr. Edwin told how the popularity of the Holstein breed had increased immediately after they began to adver- Ithat the Holstein milk was a good milk, the very best for chil - ; that it came nearer in its composition to human milk than the ?r milk, so they got a stamp and put in about $25,000 in aJ - ising and put an "ad" in the Ladies Home Journal appearing in j issue and which cost them several thousands of dollars, but ras the best money they ever spent. We felt it here. I ran a y wagon at this institution, and I had forty or fifty families de - ding Holstein milk for their children. It was publicity that did it. must have the truth back of it, bat if it is true and you behind it and publish it, it is going to go, so that anyone who has nterest in the dairy business is interested in just such things. People will tell you that from milk we get typhoid fever and all the diseases of mankind. But a person that consumes large quantities of milk has more resistence of disease. I am not afraid to drink milk from tubercular cattle — I am not advertising that — I don't think it is wholesome for the man or for the stock. (Laughter.) But it is a fact. I believe in testing cattle and condemning them for tuberculosis. I dont think there is a fellow in this institution who believes in it any .stronger than I do; I do it twice a year and I keep it clean, but I do it for the cow's sake and I always tell people so. I have seen people where good bacteriologists and two or three veterinarians, that didnt see beyond the other side, had talked to a crowd like this that would go home and fire all their milkmen. Mr. Erwin actually cited a town where there was tuberculosis and the people started a cam - paign where they reduced the consumption of milk so much that they had to lay off two wagons in that town. We are all subject to in - fluence but I think that is the wrong influence to exert. I believe in testing and keeping your milk clean and pure, but I dont believe in taking it up that way, it may be all right. People say if you get such and such kind of a barn and do so and so to your cows, I will take your milk, but we want to keep in mind that lots of times the agitation is unfounded, it isn't backed up. There is another point I want to bring up in the discussion of this splendid article, and that is the quality we must hope for and stick to. It is the life of the dairy business and means the price of butter. If you get butter at 10c a pound in this state, butter fat, see what would happen to the business, the pure bred stock business; it would deceased 150%. We must stand back of the quality then. </seg>
            <seg id="p037">36 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Eave had some interest in this tank movement and I want to in record that the official cream tank adopted by the American Manufacturer's is a tank which sooner or later must be taken e are going to improve our quality of cream and butter fat in ite and country. After having a year's experience with the am satisfied that it will be adopted very .slowly until there is a systematic method of cream grading, and when all cream will be bought and sold on the grade. Why, we are on the old subject, we have been bounding off on it for years and years but it must come if we are going to have the quality improved. Because the quality must be improved on the farm and the man is not inclined to improve the quality unless he is paid for the trouble. So when we sell our i main graded to its grade and graded to its quality, then we will start improving the quality because it must come, just as sure, it must follow as the night follows the day. If a man is going to be cut three or four eentc a pound on his butter fat because the cream is not in ?ood condi - tion when it reaches the market, he is either goinsr to quit the busi - ness or improve the quality. I know it is a different matter to grade; it has been tried ;we have been experimenting on it and are still. It is an exceedingly difficult thing because it is difficult to measure or tot One man says it is good; another says it isn't; so we have a very difficult matter to deal with. While we test wheat or corn we have some fundamental things to guide us — we have the size and weight, and with butter we have the color and the oder and things that can be controlled easily and with some degree of accuracy. In live stock when we send it to the market we there have some difficulty. I be - lieve it is almost as difficult to grade live stock for beef as it would be cream for the butter. Of course, some men don't think so; it probably isn't quite as difficult, but nevertheless there are grades, of course, not in numbers as No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, but in price. Prac - tically all commodities are sold on their grade and so we must sell cream eventually. How this is going to work out 1 cannot say, but until it is worked out and until then we cannot have an improved quality of the butter in any marked degree. Mr. Noble of Crete, Nebraska: What are we going to do with our centralized creameries which gather cream from 200 to 400 miles in the summer time, allowing it to stand on the warm platform and become acid; how can we expect to improve the quality as long as that condition is allowed? (Professor Haecker: I simply say we don't have anything to do our gathering creameries, but that certainly is not a good prac - that is a measure, however, that should come before our Pure I Department. We have deputies and officers to look after such tices and we, ourselves, as producers of the raw product should after our own protection there, I don't think any of us are helpless. nk if I produced a can of cream and watched it clear through and and out it wasn't properly cared for, they would hear from me; ■uld write to the man who is to blame for it. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 37 Mr. Noble: Suppose you lived in western Kansas and you started .1 can of cream for Lincoln? Professor Haecker: You mean the long haul? Mr. Noble: Yes ,sir. t Professor Haecker: That will have to be worked out by having ' churning stations and more creameries. I think those things-. work out themselves when we get to producing enough dairy pro- I and get the community organized. tMr. Noble: Is that where we are going to have creameries that are 1 creameries? Professor Haecker: Yes, but big enough to nandle the products that community. tMr. Noble: I believe that by the time a man produces a good le and takes it to the local creamery and then the cream comet miles, the home man don't get enough and the fellow that ships »ts too much. t Secretary McGinnis: The best way to remedy that is to discon - ; shipping it in the hot weather. Have your cows fresh in the and milk during the winter when they are taken care of and the • of feed is higher. Mr. Campbell: The problem that appears in the shipping of cream is not peculiar to Nebraska; it is a condition that also prevails in the East in the sale of milk for supplying large cities where it is shipped hundreds of miles. Milk for New York City is shipped from northern New York, 200 miles. I made that trip about a year ago. I left New York City in the evening and had breakfast on the way and arrived at Messina about the middle of the day. I am told that coun - try ships milk to New York but there is a practice there of buying their cream in Canada because it is cheaper. There is a bulletin issued by the United States Division or Department, dealing with the scarcity of cream. A great deal of cream is shipped to Jacksonville, Florida, from New York, and also to New Orleans, so the practice of shipping a long distance is not a new thing, and you will find, according to sta - tistics, that when the cream is not being shipped, the farmers get a great deal less for their butter than by selling it and a good deal more work. You will further find in one of the farmers' bulletins published by the United States Department of Agriculture and which deals with the Western condition, an explanation why that Western country was at times settled and is now being settled and probably permanently by the centralized creameries which has come to be one of the factors that has enabled the farmers to make farming profitable. Mr. Allen: It might be interesting to know at this time what Professor Bouska said about shipping milk a distance of 300 or 4O0 miles. It might be interesting to know what this is doing for the farmers of northern Wisconsin who are from 100 to 200 miles from Chicago. They produce a lot of milk in the winter time and in order to make it the easiest and cheapest they have it shipped from points as far as 190 miles north of Chicago to New York State. Not only will </seg>

That was a distance 90 miles. Mr. Severe: It seems to me in such cases that it would be a very easy matter to have the milk and cream cooled and shipped in refrig - erator cars so as to land it on a 24 hour route as far as that goes and have it come in good condition, and if there was enough of it to justify the railroad companies in using refrigerator cars from the Wtti'u part of the state, I can't see any reason why the cream wouldn't come to Lincoln in just as good condition as it would come from Pal- ■ Mr. Noble: That is the trouble, there isnt enough coming from western part of the state to justify shipping it in refrigerator cars. t Professor Bouska: There were a few years ago, and must be now. gerator cars coming from the western part of the state. Am I right in saying that there are two roads having refrigerator cars ing into Lincoln from the western part of the state? Secretary McGinnis: Yes sir. Professor Haecker: I want to go on record. Coming back to what we were talking about — that is the quality of the cream on the farm — it isn't properly handled because some of the producers — and I am one of them — (let's not shirk the responsibility.) — I say there isn't one man out of ten that has a proper place to keep the cream when he produces it. I have been there, I have gone all over the state and I have found it in the cellar and in the barn and in the kitchen, and that is what we want to stop. We want to have a proper place for this cream and keep it in that place. We have been complaining about the weather during the last few days. Why the other morning when it waa 22 degrees below zero, and that is nature's way of giving us cold storage, we are not utilizing it; we have been complaining about our prices for cream and our prices for butter, but we haven't done the first thing to take advantage of nature's cold storage under our feet. Here in Nebraska we have well water that runs from 53 to 60 degrees and if we let the wind pump it up with a windmill and pass it through a tank, you can gpt 60 degrees in temperature. That is the cheapest kind of refrigeration without ice. I have to pay 50 cents down town for a chunck of ice but I can get just as good facilities by passing water through my tank and let the water go on through to the stock tank and give them good water too. If necessary, let it run down through a pipe and give them fresh water; there is plenty of water under this American country and it is cold too. It is handier and more convenient for the producer to have and place it where he can handle it, and it will be a lot more satisfactory to him to know that he is doing his share in making good, Nebraska butter, and making the busi - ness profitable. If he produces that kind, he wont need to worry about the price either. I sometimes think when we complain about the price </seg>
            <seg id="p040">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 39 we are to blame ourselves. If we will produce the product and go after the good butter we will get the price, even if we can sell it every day and get the price, but what I want to emphasise is, that we are not utilizing the cold in the ground stored up in winter. If we get our products good in summer we can do it with very little cost. IJ. O. Shroyer. Humboldt, Nebraska: I am glad that Mr. Haecker e that talk. I realize myself that we who produce the cream on farm — I realize that it is well taken care of since we have had the irator as before. We heard that the separator was to be a great g to bring us cream properly cared for, but it removes the quality, ther thing we don't receive an example from the creameries. The has been to get a proper kind of quality produced on the farm, when we take our cream to town it is stored in very unsanitary Is. Another thing, the creameries don't try to accommodate them - es to the situation, for they place their stations right in town re we have a creamery, and one man will ship south and another h whether it is possible to route it to better advantage or not eems to be their way of handling the cream after the farmers lay own and their methods don't seem to be such as to encourage us to my better on the farm. Professor Frandsen: I am glad to see so much interest in this quality proposition. About a year ago we began, at this station, to experiment with all the cream cooling tanks on the market. This par - ticular one that Professor Haecker spoke of was developed right here and the first experimenting we did was right here. Of course, last summer was not a very bad season to get the worst cream, but even last year we estimated that the cream we put through the tank and which was kept separate from the cream standing outside in the usual way, and our conclusion was that the butter made from the cooling tank, which is expensive, secured us about 4 points higher than the butter made from the cream kept in the careless way. There is another thing that I want to call attention to at the present time. When we have had some 10 degree below zero weather while we are continuing the use of that tank, and we have had it out here as low as 12 degrees below zero, we found that by throwing a horse blanket over the tank we could prevent the cream from freezing at all if the water was changed once a day. I think that means just as much for quality as the care of it in the summer time. In nearly all of the talks we have heard some reference to some of the condi - tions. I believe I have seen about as much cream spoiled by careless handling in the winter as in the summer. A good many people will keep their cream in the kitchen, sometimes in the spare room, and .sometimes in the cellar where there are other things stored, and the result is, you will get an undesirable grade as much as you will in the hot weather in the summer. One of the things about this tank, and which it will do is to keep the cream sweet and from freezing. have not only this particular tank but we have four or fire rent kinds of tanks over in the dairy building, and those of you </seg>
            <seg id="p041">40 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION who are particularly interested, we invite you to go and see them. We have a man there carrying: on experiments every day with them. I realize, as has been brought out in this discussion, a great many people are interested, and while a great deal of this is true about the farmers, some of it don't belong there. If we can get together in our discussions it will lead to discussions and a little cussing, and perhaps we will sweep our own door-yard with little trouble. Some of the trouble is at the creamery, some is at the farm, some at the station, and some at the station platform and if we can get together we can eliminate all of it. The time will come when every railroad must pro - vide refrigerator cars where there is enough cream to be handled. They will provide nice, sanitary sheds where the cream can be stored instead of standing out on the hot platform in the sun, and that time will come soon. There must be better co-operation on the part of the railroad company, the station people, and the creameries. They will do it if they know the farmer will insist on it, and if they know he is anxious to give them the right kind of cream to start with. Cream has a chance to spoil on the farm, but if we get good cream there I think the little questions of handling by the railroads and creameries will right themselves to see that it is properly handled. They don't care about getting the best butter market and they can't possibly make the best article unless they have the right kind of cream to start with, so as soon as they realize that the farmer is anxious to give them the best, you can count on their paying higher prices and giving; more facilities. I lived out on the Pacific coast for several years and cream was scarce. At Portland, Oregon, we couldn't get enough cream to run our ice cream department, the best cream we got there was shipped in from Richmond, Utah, about 1500 miles. It was skimmed right, and cooled right, and came in protected cans and refrigerator cars. I thought it came within a few miles of Portland, but that shows what you can do if you try. But this quality question isn't a one-man proposition. We have ail got to get together, first the farmer, then the railroad man, the station man and the creamery; and when we get together we will realize that the quality of cream is worth more because it costs more to produce it. When we realize all these things, we are going to have a better grade and we are going to send it right back to the man who iMr. Slater: It is easy to lay everything to the creamery man, and ty that as an excuse for what I want to say about the quality &gt;&lt;• as the creamery interests are concerned and the farmers are con - led. I am not familiar, in a business way, with the conditions Mr. ghton has mentioned. I am only interested in the condition of cream when it reaches the creamery shipped by the farmers direct, ive gone down in the creamery many times in warm weather and i matter of curiosity have passed my hand down along side of the i, and I think I can be safe in saying that a man can pick out the </seg>
            <seg id="p042">41 cans of cream that come from water tanks, no matter how far they have been shipped. It is not the transportation problem, except as these gentlemen have spoken of. You can turn a can of cream over at Fort Allen in the evening, carrying it 400 miles in a car — not re - frigerator — and it will reach the creamery in condition to make good batter if it was cooled down and rich in butter fat before it was shipped. That seems to lay the responsibility largely upon the farmer, and it is only the question of keeping that cream in the water tank, not the use of ice, but the use of running water in a tank such as des - cribed here this afternoon. We have repeatedly made tests of our cream and are firmly convinced that a can of cream that leaves the farm cooled to a temperature of 60 degrees or below and containing butter fat of 35 or above is going to reach the creamery in good con - dition. I don't believe the question of distance enters very much into the matter. It is a question of temperature, and the thermometer is the best test ever invented to test the quality of cream. Mr. Noble: We are small dairymen at our place and we don't have much trouble in getting cream for any length of time; it is bo simple, the method we pursue, and is not as costly as some others have. We rarely ever have sour cream. We live on a little eastern slope and our house is the highest up and between that — about half way between that and our stock tank, we have our milk house. It didn't cost over $20, and we don't keep anything in that only what pertains to the use of the milk. We don't keep any vegetables there. In the sumemr time we turn on the water, and in the winter time we have an underground flow and don't use that at all. After that we bring our milk into the house into the separator room and get it into the water as quickly as possible. The wife has a good nose and knows good milk, cream and butter; she knows how to make good butter too and she can pretty nearly tell when the cream is the temperature it oufrht to be, and when she finds it isn't, if there is a little on top that isn't quite under the water she stirs that cream and gets it to the tem - peraure it should be. We deliver cream to town on the very hottest day and, as I said, we have but very little trouble with it. That home milk house cost me, tank and all, not over $25.00. But one thing that I can't understand is why the farmers will keep their cream in the kitchen, or cellar or barn or any old place and still expect to get the price. I am glad this agitation has come up. I have talked to farmers and told them how easy it is to do this, and it will pay them dividends right off. I would be glad to see the farmer get his cream ready to go wherever it has to go and have it in the best condition. It seems to me it is against that cream when it is taken to one station, carried to another and put out in the sun and left until it becomes warm. I am willing to blame the farmers when it belongs to them, where they do things that are wrong; we want that straightened up and the way </seg>
            <seg id="p043">42 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION The Refrigerator Cream Tank Better cream means better butter. When we start to improve the quality of the butter we must start with the cream, and this leads us to the subject of cream tanks; for, without question, much of the poor quality is due to the improper handling of the cream after it has been drawn from the separator. I The well water of most of the middle states ranges from 53 degrees o 64 degrees F. and by passing the water designed for the stock ugh a cream tank the cream can be quickly lowered to about 60 ■ees and held at that temperature until it is taken to the shipping t. By this method any cream producer can turn out a number product and do it with little extra work or cost. K think we are all pretty well agreed on this point, but the ques - &gt; how can cream tanks or similar equipment be universally d by the cream producer? Eare all inclined to work along the lines of least resistence, we may know a certain equipment is beneficial, we put off g it until we find it absolutely necessary. The general use of cream tanks among the producers would cer - tainly have a marked influence on the quality of the butter, but the cream producer is not inclined to equip himself with a cooling devio - unless there is some system of cream grading put into effect. When the cream is bought and paid for according to its grade or value, we will certainly notice the producer getting busy and equipping his plant to turn out number one cream. KThe operation of the cream tank is simple. It is taking advantage ature's cold storage and applying it in a practical economic way When the thermometer is below zero, we are inclined to criticise the weather and ask the question, "What is the use of winter?" But when the thermometer stands at 100 in the shade we discover cold well water is a most inviting beverage. So with the Refrigerator Cream Tank, we can draw upon the cold water from the winter chilled ground during all seasons of the year. It is cheaper than ice and when properly used quite as good. If ice is at hand, it can be beneficially used in this tank and lower temperature can, in this way, be obtained. The tank is arranged to accommodate two ten-gallon cans and two five-gallon setter cans. One of the setter cans is equipped with a filler which has three compartments to accommodate butter, cream, meat, egg«, etc., serving the same purpose as a refrigerator. The other setter can is designed to chill the morning's and night's cream, after which it may be placed in the ten-gallon cans and held for shipping. The two setter cans and the filler go with each tank. tMost of us have to work and in order to enjoy life, we must enjoy L Properly equipped, the cream producer will certainly take en - lent when he has facilities to care for his product. »To the cream buyer the quality of the cream is of first importance, i is a chance to start something that will actually better the dairy </seg>

I have been s business about 15 years; I am just telling you that so yon may who I am. I dont know as I have anything that I can add very ially to this meeting. I thought today when I came in the door nted about thirty to forty people here and after I had been in i little while I thought that would be about the size of the meet- Of course, I realize this is the first day's session, but it seemed &gt; if we were going to improve the quality of the cream in the of Nebraska, it was essential that we would start out by getting d crowd; unfortunately, I am sure that of all the people who are i the sound of my voice, there isn't anyone who does not take care of their cream; the people who do not take good care of cream are the ones who are not here and they don't care any - thing about it, in fact they dont know anything about it. I know about the transportation conditions that my friend speaks of because we buy cream and it is shipped a long distance to us and I could convince him very thoroughly, in a private conversation, that cream does not materially suffer in transportation. Where the cream suffers is really mostly in the home of the farmers, and a great many of them dont pay any attention to it. And another fact is that there is such a competition for cream that you cant correct any of the evils there are in it. SI want to call your attention to one thing.

He was for years the leading man under Jim Wilson at the Ames Agricultural College of Iowa, and upon all these subjects he is a recognized author - ity. He is familiar with all of the dairy conditions, with the practical conditions, with the milk conditions, and with the quality of butter for the whole world. He has frequently been to Europe and he is an authority on these subjects. One thing that he said in a meeting not very long ago impressed me very greatly. It was after his re - torn from this last trip to Europe, that he said, the creameries of the United States, in the completeness of their equipment, in the costliness of their equipment, and for getting every facility and every device </seg>

Do you know there is all the reason in for that? It is because we have been able to make a good ' money and faster in many ways than we would make by the Why for years, as I said before — I have been in this business for 16 years — and I have heard time and again that you ought not to mix or let your warm cream from the separator run into your five to ten-gallon cans where you have your previous milk, as that spoils your cream. Well, now, it isn't three years since I was up in South Dakota and I thought I would take an examination there, so I wired the State Dairy Commissioner to know if he was at home and I went down to Brookings to take the examination. I didn't get there until the next morning and when I went to see Professor Reiger, the dairy expert wasn't there. I stayed around there a little while and I found where to go and pay my $5.00 license fee — that is what it is in South Dakota. I paid them that; they charge you $5.00 before they will examine you — if you pass they give you a license; if you don't pass they give you $2.50 of your money back. So I went down there and they showed me a young man who told be how to test cream. Every - body ought to know how and ought to have a tester. I went in and through the thing and then they gave me a list of questions to answer. I answered them the best I could, and I went back again and Professor Reiger was there and we sat down and talked and I fmmn\. He took up these questions and says you have answered these. I said, "There is a question there that I haven't really answered, I thought about it as I went along but it didn't occur to me to ask about it until now, and I would like to know why it is so bad to mix warm cream with cool cream." He said, "Of course it raises the temperature immediately, but it won't effect the quality." He answered me this way: "You know if you kill a beef and you take that warm meat and put it in an air tight vessel and let it stay there over night, when you take the lid off the next morning you will get a stench that will about knock you down." "Yes," I said, "I know that." "'Well now," he said, "that is what happens with this cream." He further explained that when this cream comes from the body of the cow it is full of animal heat and it has to have air in it, and all of these poisonous vapors most be allowed to escape, but if it has air in it and cools down first. it is perfectly safe to put it in with that other cream, and he says if you run it in from your separator into a ten-gallon cream can that way, that new cream will lap over on the warm cream and it will absorb all of those noisesome vapors and poisonous matter and you will lose your cream. Now I will bet you, if every farmer understood that and the philosophy of it and the reason for it as I did after Professor Rieger got through talking to me, seventy-five per cent of the fanners wouldn't let their cream run from the separator into a ten- </seg>
            <seg id="p046">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 45 gallon can. They would naturally say they milked cows yean before you were born and they knew about milk, that this is just a theory. I Now another reason why we have poor cream is because we injure pure cream. Why, here a lady comes along right on a hot sum - morning, her can shines like a silver dollar, she has a blanket it and that cream protected; she is taking it to market. She es a ram-shackled tenement building and there is a can of cream he front porch and the sun is shining on it and the flies are ering about it; it is dirty, and every bit of cream on the outside uicid. She says, "Here am I with a spring out here where the ■r runs all the time and I take care of my cream and take it in larket and I don't get one cent more for my cream than this other woman does for hers on that porch." The woman on the porch looks out and says, "Look at that woman going to town with that can of cream. Look at the labor she has put on it. I don't take any care at all of mine and I get just as much for my cream as she does for hers." Now of course, on the one hand we have discouraged the one who takes care of her cream, and on the other hand we have encouraged the one who doesn't. There are a great many things that contribute and have an influence over, as Professor Bouska says — and his was a very interesting lecture — the high percentage of deterioration that comes from heat. If it can be cooled down right away it will keep, and that is the reason you can grade cream whether you have held it three days or not. Lots of farmers will bring in cream that they have had a week and cream that will double discount cream brought in by other people — it is the dif - ference in the care of it. Of course you have the cellar flavor, and you have the cave flavor and, of course, milk takes up odors very quickly but very few people without education recognize it. Of course, if we could improve the quality of the cream that is churned into butter in this state, we would put more into the pockets of the farmers and not of the creameries, because we won't get a bit more, c-ompetion will see to that. It is not because we are against it but competition will be so that we will not get a bit more money, but the farmers that produce the cream will get the difference that is made into butter in the state of Nebraska. They will get an additional mil - lion dollars every year. Another thing about it; Professor Haecker and Professor Frandsen, awl Mr. Slater all know about it; that is, that in Indiana, Iowa, Wiscon - sin, Minnesota and Michigan they are going to skin us because they are going to bring their cream up to where they are going to give to any man, any butter maker, that will produce 95 score butter and they will give him a stamp, the stamp of Iowa, say, that the butter is guaranteed, of course, and he will have to keep it up, because the repu - tation of the state is at stake. Of course, you know now, if you go east you will find that Minnesota and Wisconsin butter hurts us like everything. Their butter isn't nearly as good as ours but it will sell for more money because it has that brand on it. So it is up to na and </seg>
            <seg id="p047">46 we will have to take care of this thing, if we make the amount of money we ought to. t)f course, as Professor Bouska said, and as Professor McKay said, average 180 pounds net, that is the average, as against 280 pounds irope of butter fat. If a man will just weed out his poor cows and lis cream he will cut his work in half. If he will weed out his cows and keep only the good cows he will cut his work in two bor, risk, insurance and everything else, and not only that, he will e his money. I was impressed with a lecture in Manhattan, Kansas. There was a fellow from Urbana, Illinois, from the experimental station of Illi - nois who did that. He had two cards like that (indicating) on one he had 25 cows and on the other covering 125 cows and he showed that the 25 cows made more butter than the other 125 cows. He said the farmers of Illinois were milking — I won't be sure of these figures, but my rec - ollection is — that they were milking for dairies two million cows that didn't pay them one single dollar a year. That there was no profit in them. He said that if they had a little pet cow that was gentle and kind they fed her and milked her twice a day and furnished the feed and pasture for her, and at the end of the year she hadn't made one single dollar. He said it was his duty to go through the herds in Illinois and test these cows and show the farmers just how much butter fat each cow was giving, and he could tell to a gnat's eyebrow Just how many of them were making or losing money for their own - era. He said he had a man that was milking twenty cows and another that was milking nine cows and the nine cows made him more profit than the whole twenty cows. He didn't have the investment and wasn't working, milking the eleven cows. tWhat I would like to see — I don't know whether it is possible or - but we have a great many people in one way or another who ish milk and I think one of the greatest ways to improve the ity is to disseminate this information. I think we ought to adver - this association better next year and get four or five times as y people here and get them to see it. Now, another word about these tanks. I will show you about them because I know about them. Professor McKay and Professor Binster got interested in these tanks and they wanted to stimulate their use so they came to the American Butter Makers Association, and they ■aid, "We want to hold a meeting." They had a meeting in St. Paul, and they had a meeting down in Omaha and discussed this tank propo - sition and what a wonderful thing it was. Everybody admitted that it waa a good thing, and they talked it all over and said, "Now we will see what we can do in the tank line." We had a two days' ses - sion in Omaha, that is, we had a good many out the first day, and thai they appointed a big committee for the second day and that committee worked all night and half of the next day with a half dozen manufacturers of tanks. Now those tanks, wooden tanks like these, average I think about $19 or along there somewhere — you can't </seg>
            <seg id="p048">47 Ii good tank under $19. Well, they went over this and they got f of these manufacturers, and Professor Haecker who then repre - ■d the Woods Brothers Silo Company was among them, but you ln't get the men to say what they thought. They have an awful hide-bound agreement and they got these tanks delivered to Farmers for $12. Xow they had two tanks, a 10-gallon can and shotgun cans — no, we had only two shotgun cans — and we agreed et this price. They are made out of better stuff, such as butts of , so we agreed to take so many hundred tanks and they bought s* f hundred tanks. We bought fifty ourselves and we tried to get them out — we tried to get them out at cost and we have got every - one of those fifty tanks yet; we haven't sold one. We sent them out to our most successful operators and they couldn't get them into the doors of their cream stations. You run the water from the well into this tank and another line from the tank into the watering trough, and there is a little place in one of these cans where the farmers can keep his milk, cream and butter. We thought that would be an attractive thing, but we didn't sell one. A lot thought they were too high. Of course, we had to pay the freight on them and we have a lot of them now that have come back from different places with $3 or $4 freight, which we had to pay. We have shipped some one, two or three places to try them but they all came back. The reason we couldn't «lo anything with them was we couldn't pay any more for the butter fat. That is what I told them at the time, and I thought I was awful wise to be able to tell them the truth. I said, "Why is anybody going to pay $12 for this tank? You might do it if you will offer 1 cent more for butter fat, because then you can show them a profit. Why should they put $12 into a tank when they can get just as much for cream without the tank as with it?" Now the only way I see to remedy this is by legislation. Really I had a bill prepared for the last legislature. I had my attorney pre - pare it at my own expense and I came here to Lincoln and spent two or three days more on it, but if you gentlemen have anything to do with legislation you will find that, unfortunately, when a bill comes before the legislature it isn't considered on its merits but is looked upon from the power behind it, and unless you can make an impres - sion in that quarter you can't do anything with it. I would like if any of you will write to me at any time, and will be glad to send you a copy of that bill. I won't take the time to read it, but it provides for a tax on creameries to pay for state inspection; it says that every creamery in the state of Nebraska that makes more than 500,000 pounds of butter in a year shall have a state inspector in that cream - ery all the time, and he shall test all the cream in that creamery, and it will be done by the State. There will be no juggling in the tests. The bill also provides that the inspectors shall be competent men,, chosen without regard to partisanship and for their knowledge of the dairy business and they shall grade all cream. Of course, now the thing is to grade the cream; if you can get the cream graded by the- </seg>
            <seg id="p049">48 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION proper authority there will be no question about the price of it. Any - body will give 2 or 3 cents more for No. 1 cream than for No. 3; it also provides what shall constitute No. 1 or No. 2 cream; it provide* for a tax of one-twentieth of one cent a pound to be put on these cream - eries to provide funds to pay for these inspectors. We must get, 1 think, upon a basis where the State shall control this thing absolutely: so that every man that milks a cow shall know that he is going to fret paid for what he has got, and if he has a good quality he will get paid for it. If any of you gentlemen are interested in this, I would be glad to hear from you and I will be glad to send you a copy of that bill and have you take it and study it. I think we can get up a little interest in it. You know, you can say what you please, but it is when the farmer begins to talk legislation that you will sit up and take notice. That reminds me of a conundrum, maybe you have heard it, but it won't hurt to repeat it: "What is the difference between a widower and a baby? The first six months he cries; the second six months he begins to sit up and take notice, but it is hard to get him over the second summer." I So they will begin to sit up and take notice, and when we get i where they will do that we can get them where we will be ab - xly able to grade and test No. 1 cream. We will get paid for t we produce, and everybody that produces No. 2 cream will get for what he didn't produce; and if he produces No. ■ cream he it not to be allowed to send it out. I think that is a very effective to handle this proposition. Eow this tank is an excellent thing, and it is as cheap as it can duced. I am sure that we are not mistaken about that. I don't how many hundred of these tanks were bought. How many did ree to take, Professor Haecker? The Secretary: He just stepped out. Well, each centralizer agreed to sell 100 of these tanks to enable Woods Brothers to produce them at this price, and as Professor Frand - sen told you regarding the weather, where he says it was 12° below zero here, I know it was 23° below at Omaha and the cream never froze in them at all.

Professor Frandsen: I don't think I mentioned it at noon, but I want to say to all visiting farmers while you are in the city that you are all cordially invited to visit the dairy and see the dairy herd; visit the new dairy building, and look at the records of the cows, and Professor Woods will be there to answer your questions about this cream-cooling tank. We want you to feel free to go over the dairy building and barn whenever you have the time, and ask any questions you wish. The President: We will now adjourn until tomorrow morning at 9:30 o'clock. STATE FARM, JANUARY 2«TH, 1916 Morning Session, Thursday, 9:30 A. M The President called the meeting to order. I The President: We are fortunate this morning in having with a particular friend of the dairy business, Dean Burnett, and we going to call on him for a few words to start us off, so we will be glad to hear what he has to say: BDean Burnett spoke as follows: President, Ladies and Gentlemen: In looking over your program for the day I notice a number of eminent speakers on the program, and it may look like a sort of break - ing in on you to make any extemporaneous remarks regarding the dairy business here this morning. I am sure that your technical pro - gram looks so good and will be so good that you will not want it broken into very much. I suppose all of you who are interested in dairying are feeling good at the prospects of the new home which we are to have on the University Farm, and before you meet next year that building cer - tainly will be in shape to occupy so you will have better quarters, and permanent quarters from this time on for your meetings. I suppose you couldn't have gone thus far without Professor Frandsen having explained in detail what those plans are to be, so it is unnecessary for me to go into that matter. I was interested two months ago when we dedicated the dairy building, in looking up some statistics relative to the growth of dairying in this institution. I am sure that when we look back to the first building located on these grounds, devoted to dairying and other purposes — the building, which I remember from the statistics, cost about $3,000— well, the first part </seg>
            <seg id="p051">50 of it cost about $3,000, but it was finally added to until it cost about $5,000 and was looked upon as a great achievement in furnishing a part of the agricultural institutions here on this Farm. That, it is true, was nineteen or twenty years ago. Not only did it house all of the dairying that was offered here, but that was really the central feature of the buildings, and it also housed all of the agricultural in - stitutions and furnished the facilities which the University of Nebraska offered for instruction in agriculture. Today we have a plant devoted, as you see, to the many branches of agriculture, and the dairy de - partment has long since overflowed that building and has occupied other rooms in various buildings here for its instructional purposes. Now we are to have a plant which will cost, as I understand, in excess of $175,000 when completed, and will be devoted very largely to dairying in the beginning. Certainly within a few years it will be wholly devoted to the dairy business. We appreciate that in doing this we are giving better facilities, probably, than any other agricultural department represented here, but it has been the policy of the Uni - versity, and will continue to be, I hope, from this time on, that when - ever we establish and decide to build a building to accommodate any department, we will build it with a view of permanence, and with a view of housing indefinitely that particular industry and giving it the facilities for development, and facilities that offer the best type of instruction which is known so that our students coming here — Ne - braska boys and girls — may have opportunities equal to that of any other state. I Now that means, of course, that departments which have not been d care of will not be quite so adequately housed, and it means ler that the farmers of Nebraska must get behind the program to build a substantial institution here, which will give adequate in - struction along all agricultural lines when once that plan is completed. It means that you can't build an agricultural college in a year or in ten years, and that as the needs of the state increase, we must take care of these new lines of development. We must endeavor in all cases, when a boy comes up to the agricultural college or the school of agricul - ture to favor and give him opportunities for instruction, equal to those he can secure anywhere. Now dairying has been very fortunate in getting the very first of these new buildings erected on a large scale and with a more com - prehensive plan in mind; that is extremely fortunate because it gives all of the impetus of adding all of the facilities before all of the other departments are so taken care of. It means also, as I look at it, that we will be able to give more stimulus and more direction to the development of the dairy industry throughout the state, and that in this way the state will be repaid many times over for any expenditure which it makes at this institution for a thoroughly substantial, modern and adequate plant, tending to develop that industry. Now, in addition to that, we have plans completed. Plans for a </seg>
            <seg id="p052">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 51 building which will be erected right over north, behind the flagpole, to house the agricultural department. The contract has not been let bat is almost certain to be let within the next sixty days, so a year from now that building ought to be completed or nearly completed. It will be a building as large and as good as the dairy building and costing somewhere near the same amount of money; a building which will house, as we think, permanently, the various lines of agricul - tural engineering and give the very best facilities for the young men who come here to become experts along these lines. I talk to you of what we are interested in here in the way of production. It may be the production or breeding of beef cattle or any other line that you are interested in. There are two things we are interested in: The first is, perhaps, the stimulation of the industry in the state, that we shall develop that industry in the very best possible manner. Second, you are interested in the education and development of the young men and women of the state so that they shall have the best opportunity. Now we do these two things whenever we develop any branch of agricultural education in this college plant; first, we stimulate the industry throughout the whole state and endeavor to put new interest into it and work out methods by which a larger profit can be made on the land. And second, and quite as important, we offer opportunities for the young men and women of the state to get the type of education with which they can go out into life and apply, whether they apply it on the land or whether they remain in Nebraska always or not. You are just as much interested in giving these young men and women an opportunity to be successful in life as you are in forcing them back into any particular occupation. We believe that when the right type of agricultural education is given to the young men and women in this state, the boys and girls growing up, not only here in the central plant, but out over the different sections of the state, that agriculture can take care of itself with any other industry; we have no fear along that score. But if you don't give these young men and women the kind of education which fits them for their life work, you are certain to drive them away from the type of life which they would naturally adopt and drive them into some other vocation. Because the man and the woman or the boy or the girl who is not skilled in the occupation they are engaged in, is certain to feel that some other line of work, which they know little or nothing about offers better opportunities. The facts are that it doesn't make so much difference to my mind what line of work the boy or girl is engaged in, provided he is an expert in that work and knows the very best methods to accomplish it and is at the top of the profession. Then he is in a very good situation; he can take care of himself in any pro - fession if he is one of the very best in that profession. It don't make any difference what vocation a man is in, if he is down at the bottom he is being ground hard. Now it is to the interest of the state of Nebraska as a Common - wealth to try and educate as many of the young men and joaag </seg>
            <seg id="p053">52 women as possible so that they will be experts in the profession which they follow. If you give them the right opportunity for agricultural education, I haven't any hesitation in saying that agriculture will hold it* own and will be able to develop a better industry, be it live stock industry, grain industry or dairy industry, and we will be able to de - velop diversified farming so that we will have one of the finest agri - cultural commonwealths to be found anywhere in the world. If any of you were privileged yesterday morning to hear the discussion of Director Thorne of Ohio, in which he went into a very careful and technical discussion of the use of artificial fertilizers and manures upon the land in Ohio, you would have had very forcibly impres.-wl upon your mind the fact that the land in the state of Ohio has to be fed before it will produce a crop. It just has to be fed, some land one thing and some another, and he didn't hesitate at all to tell that $14 worth of fertilizer, distributed over a five-year period, ma more than double the profits — that that $14 worth of fertilizer was worth more than double its cost. Now here we live in a country that doesn't respond as yet to artificial fertilizers, a country that is rich. Eintry that has stored up in its soil, all of these things which have to buy in Ohio and we have them in abundance, unless it I be nitrogen. He recommended to the farmers of that particular ct in Ohio that it was profitable to expend not less than $14 for ive-year period upon those lands. We have that fertility in our I now, and what we need is to study methods of farming which postpone forever if possible, or at least for the next generation. such drain on our profits and resources. We believe — in fact. w. - k we know — the right system of farming that can postpone at t two generations the necessity of that enormous cost for fertiliz - which the state of Ohio is paying, and will be forced to pay for all ' in the future as a tribute upon its agriculture before it can make a profit in the industry. Everybody recognizes, whether they are in the dairy industry or not, that the dairy industry and other lines of industry are the lines of activity which will postpone longer than any other class of farming this necessity for artificial fertilization. So that any man who has a dairy business and is making a reasonable profit upon that farm is assured that by the best methods his soil is growing richer year by year and that it is not being depleted of its fertility through an elevator. So I think the industry is to be con - gratulated, first, upon the fact that it is increasing its output year by year, and second, that we are conducting a dairy business on a strictly scientific basis, with its reasonable profits, upon the fact that it is a permanent industry which is bound to increase as the agricul - tural industry of the country' builds up, and as the population of the state and nation increases. The President: We certainly appreciate very much having these words of encouragement and instruction from Dean Burnett. It makes as feel that we are welcome here and that anything the department of agriculture can do for us they are only too glad to do. </seg>
            <seg id="p054">53 The next number on our program is something of particular interest to certain members here. In certain sections of the state there has sprung up in the last few years in various counties and communities what is known as the "Farm Demonstrator." This is familiar to certain people, and slightly known to others, and not at all known to the people of a great many of our counties. A great many of our counties are now working to get a farm demonstrator. It is being advocated by different agriculturists in various counties, and we will now have the pleasure of listening to Mr. O. H. Liebers, of Beatrice, on the topic of "What a farm demonstrator can do for dairying." Mr. Liebers spoke as follows: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen I In getting the material for this talk today I sought the advice i some of the officers of this association and they told me, which, ourse. was satisfactory to me to just talk and tell them what has done in Gage county. So from that perhaps you can see a num - of things that a county agent, as they are called now, and that is latest name — can do along these various lines. Somehow the idea gotten out that I have devoted practically all of my time to dairy uragement. That is impossible for a county agent to do bwiiK s supposed to take the various lines of work and has practically pvote his time equally to the various lines. If we spend more time he dairy' business, the beef men, especially over the eastern part he state, will come and say, "We want you to do something for And the same with the hog men, so a person has to distribute time over these various subjects. Now a county agent can really be of immense value in promot - ing any line of work, but especially, perhaps, that of dairying, be - cause in order to make dairying pay you must get it running on the right basis. The most important, perhaps, is the thing he can do constantly and must do first before he can do anything else in the educational nature of work. First, he must get acquainted with his county; perhaps it isn't adapted for dairying; and, by the way, a county agent must be very careful what he preaches because he is on the firing line and if he tells a fanner that he should do a certain thing and it don't turn out just right the farmer is liable to walk in on him, and the agent will hear from him. I can see the great advantage of the people at the experiment station; the way they are reached is through a long letter, they don't get it as quickly as we do. So I ques - tion whether it is the thing to tell everybody that dairying: is the thing they ought to be in. Some men are not adapted and not constiuted to make dairying pay. I think it is just as essential to tell men not to go into it if they are not fitted for it as it is to tell other men to go into it right. If a man in the long run goes into dairying without knowing what he is going into, and makes a failure of it, it is a great deal harder on the dairy industry than if he had never gone into it at all It isn't the number, it is the i etui its they get, if it is profitable. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">54 that speaks for itself. A certain number in the community that makes it profitable encourages the rest to go into it. A good deal can be done in this line by just analyzing the subject as plainly as possible and giving a discussion at meetings and demonstrations wherever you can demonstrate the difference between the beef and a dairy cow. The first thing I did in the county was to have a number of these demon - strations and I am sure they were valuable to a good many. The thing for a county agent to do is to get information from the dairy department here and from other sources and keep in touch with the farmers. I have found the results we have gotten through that source of information are very valuable. You can make arrangements with Professor Frandsen and the Government officials to come down and assist, but for a man to come out and hold an institute and spend a day when he doesn't really know what our problems are, there is a probability that he may make a talk on dairying from an angle that doesn't appeal to those people. But the county agent should know the problems those men are up against and an expert can talk intel - ligently to them and give them something of value. I found that it was quite important to create an interest in the value of milk, and what milk is. Very few people look at it that way. the care it deserves and the value of it, but that can be brought out very forcibly by the splendid exhibit which has been arranged by the dairy department and some of the men from the United States Division of Dairying. And then the county agent should have these demonstrations such as you saw at the State Fair last year, showing the comparative value of milk with common food stuffs used, and the prices. I am sure those things all help to encourage the work, and especially in a county like Gage where the dairying industry is in its infancy, or where dairying gives the people a standard to show what dairying really is, and what can be done and how it differs from just keeping a bunch of common cattle. I also think it is necessary to show some of the hardships, because in the long run it will come up best after the subject has been thoroughly discussed so that people can see the value of the work that will go into it. These are some of the things that the county agent can do. For example, getting cattle. That question arose in Gage county. They became interested in dairy - ing and wanted to know where they could get dairy cattle. In some cases the county agent can always be of help because he is supposed to be in touch with those things and know where they §be gotten. He should know about that so that he can see that cattle brought into the county are healthy and profitable to a large nt. I found that a good many farmers were prejudiced against y cattle and especially against one breed, and it took me a long I to find out what was the matter. I finally got it from various sources, and this is about the story: About ten years ago as near as I could find out there was a large number of scrubby dairy cattle — Hoi steins — shipped into the county from New York State and Ohio and scattered orer the county, and especially is thin true down around </seg>
            <seg id="p056">55 Liberty. They were small, inferior, unproductive and unprofitable cat - tle and people carried those along, and there are some remnants of those herds left there yet. That thing of bringing in six or seven car - loads of those poor cattle has left a bad taste in the mouths of a good many people and they were rather afraid to go into the dairy busi - ness. They said the cows had a poor constitution and were affected with tuberculosis, and wouldn't give any more milk than common red cows and that they were a failure. Now I think it is the county agent's duty to see to it that none of those poor cattle are put in, if it can be done through county organ - ization. Gage county has an organization, they have a county dairy association and have a committee to see that cattle brought in and dis - tributed over the county are good cattle and, if possible, try to get them free from tuberculosis. I believe that is a very important thing, because that one little thing happened ten years ago is still remembered. Very often I hear this statement: We have shipped in quite a few cattle in the last two or three years from various places in this state and outside which some of the people purchased. Just recently a man from Blue Springs said, "Do you know where I can get some cattle like so and so has?" He was referring to some Holsteins. He says, "Those are the biggest cows I ever saw and I want to get four or five to start a herd." Then he told the story like some of the other people who had bought dairy cattle he saw years ago which were little stock and inferior in quality and poor producers. He says, "I want to get some of these big ones like so and so has." So these things are creeping out continuously, and in getting cattle see to it that the stuff is good. Stock already in the county is perhaps one of the most important things to work with, because everyone milks cows; I think the statistics show about 12,000 cows being milked in Gage county. Practically every farmer, and by this I mean the ordinary farmer, milks from two to a dozen cowi, and I believe I am safe in saying that twenty-five per cent of those cows are being milked at a loss. It were better that they didn't milk them at all or at least just let the calf run with the cow. If the people knew how simple it was to test their cows and keep a little rec - ord to find out what they were doing, a good many of these cows wouldn't be milked and those that were, would be taken better care of. So the thing that is taking the best, and the work that the county agent can do is the testing work. A good way is to work through the schools, and there is no reason why the country schools should not tthat. To give an illustration: We have a school teacher by the ie of L. N. Smith who graduated from the high school three years . He went right out to a country school and got himself a little icoek tester which cost about $3. I think the creamery company i kind enough to let him have the outfit reasonable. He came to office and we talked it over and he wanted me to come out and t a demonstration. He also wanted a number of record sheets. So got about half a doses youngsters to go home and get their father* </seg>
            <seg id="p057">56 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION to keep a record of their cows. Every week they would bring some of the milk and they would test it in school, and he made it a part of their exercises. He got to testing- sixty or seventy cows in that district, and before the season was up there were four or five schools after him. They wanted that teacher, and the result is he is getting $10 a month more than any other teacher in that county. This year that was taken up as a special study, and it shows the value from the schoool teacher's standpoint. This year at the county institute this young man grave a talk and told how easy it was and the good effect it had in the community. As a result of that, a number of teacher - took this Up and there is about 200 cows being tested by these teach - era and pupils. Now that don't only mean that they are testing the.--- COWl, but it gets the boys and girls interested and they know what the milk is and the value of it and the composition of it. They hav-' an idea of what it costs to produce dairy products. They get mighty good hints as to the sanitary part in making dairying profitable which 4MM teachers are developing, and it makes a fine branch of rural school work. I hope more teachers will take it up and I think they will. judging by the demand for testing demonstrations. They aim to hav. that as one of the numbers on the program and it can be made a very interesting feature on any program of that nature. The cow-testing association is the best thing that can be start, i in any community where it can be supported to promote dairying. W&gt; - have had considerable experience since June 14 with our dairymen an-' farmers who milk a number of cows in and around Beatrice and wh&lt;&gt; have been in the association and are getting the association of Lan - caster and Gage counties testing associations organized, but there not being enough herds from either county, they have taken half from each county and the people are well satisfied. I haven't heard any complaints and it has done a great deal of good; it has given the dairymen a different idea of what their work is. If we had stopped with these fourteen men probably it wouldn't be quite so valuable, but it spreads and the whole community gets the benefit because the results are discussed at meetings and practically everybody in the community get« the benefit from these scientific, business-like methods of dairying. The county agent, I think, can do a great deal towards dairying at the county fair; that is one place where he can get in touch with a good many people in the county. As an illustration of what can be done, at our county fair last year we had a sort of testing contest, or demonstration. We got a dairy cow, it happened to be a Holstein, but we just wanted to get a dairy type; we had four cows and we had regular stanchions fixed up on the fair grounds; next to this dairy type, this Holstein, we got as near as we could get a large dual pupos&lt; - cow. She was a large Shorthorn, which had indications of being a good milker; next to the Shorthorn we had a strictly beef cow, a Herford. and, by the way, these Shorthorn and Herford cows weighed prac - tically the same, somewhere around 1,300 pounds. A lot of people made gmtna, a good many said the Herford was the one they picked on </seg>
            <seg id="p058">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 57 and some said the Shorthorn. Then we had a little red cow, the kind you find too many of on a farm — just cow. Now these four cows we entered in the contest and we kept track of the feed and weighed ami tested the milk and we allowed 25 cents a pound for the butter fat and 30 cents a hundred for the skimmed milk. We took the market price for the feed and every day we posted the results, and it became very interesting towards the last. Everybody came in to see how the four cows were coming out, but the results were just about as you would expect them to be; the dairy cow made a profit of $1.65 for the four days she was doing business. She was a mighty good business propo - sition. The dual purpose cow, the Shorthorn, made a profit of 78 cents, that was mighty good also. The beef cow made a loss of 16 cents; we had the fun of milking her, milking and feeding her and donated 4 cents a day for keeping her. She was the hardest milker in the bunch and it took about as long again to milk her. The little red cow just got through with a profit of 20 cents. It was a very striking illustration. The way we used that illustration was that hundreds of people came in that never had any idea of the situation. They were not situated for dairying but they were milking cows like this Short - horn and this Herford, probably half and half, in an hour, 10 or 12 perhaps, the owner himself not doing the milking. Perhaps his chil - dren were do'ng the milking year in and year out and the milk was poured into «.ie can and sold — the owner really not knowing which cows were profitable. We classified them into two classes. First, from the strictly business standpoint, and then from just the cow standpoint that you find on the ordinary farm, and they made a fine illustration. Having two cows practically identical, it is mighty hard to guess which was profitable and which was not, but if you were examining closely and knew something about the dairy type you could see the difference. I brought out the lesson that the tester was the most reliable thing to determine the dairy cow's value. tNow that test could be put on by the county agent in every county ie state. He could show the good modern equipment, and some - r that the county agent ought to be up on is the new kinds of and strainers and buckets and so forth. This is what he is there He could also show, as we did, the comparative value of milk other food stuffs, and feeds and those things. It can be made ry interesting feature and of considerable value. The men who are dairymen and want to make that their business, many of them have three or four pure breds and are building up a pure bred herd, and you have to help as much as you can the men — the ordinary fanners — by testing, and advising on feeding. And another thing of particular advantage to these pure bred breeders is the disposition of and exchanging of their breeding animals. During the past few years that work has just started in Gage county and has opened up a field in the county for something like fifty pure bred bulls, Holstein bulls. Some of these are excellent animals but a good many times we find that they are sacrificed on the farm every two </seg>
            <seg id="p059">58 or three years because the man didn't know the value of these sires. If he did he would want to buy him, but as a result these sires are shipped out to a different part of the state and get nowhere, while he could probably do better right at home to sell him to his neighbor. Perhaps he has a bull that is the head of his herd and a very valuable animal but he don't know anyone who needs him and he ships him. That is the way some of our very best animals have gone to market that should have stayed right in the community. Now the county agent can do this because he can get next to every dairymen's asso - ciation in the county. He knows where the pure bred sires are and he ought to have this information all in his ofRce so that people would know where to go for this information. He could find where a man who was through with his sire should know where to go to get this information, so that three or four of his neighbors would be waiting to get a chance to get that valuable sire, and perhaps that can be made a valuable part of the work. t Another thing, I don't know how the dairymen stand on this ques - but I believe they feel about like we do down in Gage county he subject of tuberculosis. There is nothing that holds back the r industry and gives it a black eye quicker than to bring into a try cattle under cover, cattle that are supposed to be healthy and for the production of human food, that are diseased with tuber - iis and then keep them in here for a number of years. In Gage county we have started a campaign for the eradication of tuberculosis from two standpoints. First, from the economic stand - point of the breeder; because good men are starting up in the pure bred business and are getting sires and families and these people ought to know where they are before they go too far. We are advocating the testing for tuberculosis because they might get ir a tubercular sire. They might have had some red cows that have had it. We have a record of 800 cows tested in Gage county during the past four or five months and we find that about eight or nine per cent have it. More times they take it from pure breds than from grades, and they come around and thank us for teaching it, because then we feel safe and we know where we are, especially people who breed pure bred cattle; one place we tested a herd of seventy pure bred cows and twenty-two reacted. This man, if he had tested years ago, would have lost less money. In another case, there was sixteen cows and five reacted. It is a better thing to have this cleared up now, and take it from the public health standpoint; it is still more important, because when you stop to think you are liable to produce milk that contains a disease that may prove fatal to children especially, and a man has really no right to take the chances, because it takes very little to find out the condition of your cattle. If you should happen to find a reactor in the herd you can prevent lots of trouble. Some people are afraid to test, others haven't given it much study and are not much interested; some say there is no results; others have given the subject a great deal of </seg>
            <seg id="p060">59 study and make the subject look serious both from an economic and a health standpoint. I There are three hundred cows furnishing milk — to give a concrete nple — to the city of Beatrice and the number of family cows is iibly one hundred fifty. We found a number affected with tuber - sis and with the udder almost decayed. They said, "We are pleased ad it out because we will cut off this danger of affecting the human ily, especially the danger to children in using this milk coming from tubercular cows." So the county agent, by going into the county and just sasBariaff up the educational end of it perhaps as most important, can very easily get the information necessary as to what the dairying is and what it can be in that county. Those men feel that is what they want and he can help them and advise them on getting stock, or feeding, on equipment and methods of handling those products and in protecting the families and testing. If possible try to get a testing association for them and carry on this work of eradication of tuberculosis with the educational feature. He should not do the actual work of testing but he ought to do the educational work. It is one of the most im - portant things that he can take up; and then he should show a dis - position to help in the selection of pure bred animals, and holding county fair demonstrations. He should get the people in touch with experts such as our dairy department here and the Government Divis - ion of Dairying and any other source of information that can be gotten hold of. The President: We are certainly pleased to hear from this man who is «i the firing line as a farm demonstrator. The only fault I have with his talk is that he has been entirely too modest. He has kept under cover some of his own achievements and has sort of apoligized for talking dairying as much as he has. Everybody who has been keeping track of dairying in this state knows that Gage county has done more in dairying, in the way of improving their herds, and in shipping in cars of thoroughbred dairying cattle than any other point in the state; and to this man is attributed all of these results; he has kept that in the background because he is too modest to tell the whole story. We have another man out in the field as an apostle of dairying, who is talking out straight and directly along the line of the improvement of herds and of dairy methods and of everything pertaining to it in the way of upbuilding and establishing the business on a permanent basis. We will now have the pleasure of listening to Professor D. H. Propps. of the University Dairy Extension, co-operating with the U. S. Dairy Division. Professor D. H. Propps spoke as follows: To get the dairy industry before the people in its proper light is a matter of education. This, of course, is true of any phase of improved agriculture, but it is especially true of the dairy business. To become a successful dairvman actually reouired more stndr and </seg>
            <seg id="p061">60 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION more carefully thought-out, systematic plan of procedure than 4sss any other type of live stock fanning. Why? Because it is more intensive and a alight neglect or mistake, therefore, may prove more fatal than in any other type of farming. Dairymen, as a rule, do not become wealthy by leaps and bounds, by speculation if you please, but rather by the constant liberal income from a well selected, well cared for herd of profitable producers are they able to add gradually to their possessions and eventually take their place alongside so-called sur - ceaaful men. Here, gentlemen, is a critical point and one that we must con - stantly keep in mind in our constructive work. It lends to our problem a two-fold phase. Promote dairying, to be sure. We should have more dairying in Nebraska where we have such an abundance of farm-grown feeds and where we enjoy such excellent markets. But what is even more important, we need also a more successful kind of dairying, so to speak. There are men in Nebraska who are making good money in the dairy business. But this is not a sure indication that every other farmer of the state, who might take a fancy to dairying, would make a success of the undertaking. A certain poultry man is said to have remarked that to be successful with hens, a man must have feathers. I take it that he meant that to make a success of the poultry busines.- a man must understand and enjoy the work. He must like poultry. So, in dairying, if one is to succeed, he must understand the business: he must like cows and he must understand at the outset that lon^r hours and a great deal of labor is required. A man, then, who is think - ing of launching out in the dairy business should consider well hi. - qualifications, his stock in trade as it were, whether or not he is going to be equal to the task, and having decided to become a dairyman, he should be careful to start right and grow successfully into the work. Just here is where the county agent may become so helpful in following up and keeping in touch with the work in such a way as t&lt;&gt; accomplish results. Such a plan, while laying particular emphasi. - on details, is at the same time the very best way to promote the in dustry. If a few men in a county are making more money milking cows than at any other part of their farm work, the 'problem then may become to keep too many unfit men from undertaking the same system of farming, for whatever will contribute to more successful dairying will also serve to extend that industry. The county agent's territory is limited to a single county. He is in close touch with each farmer and knows his individual characteristics and his particular needs. He is, therefore, in a position to serve the farmer to the very best advantage. il spoke in the beginning of the educational phase of the problem dairy promotion. In no other state perhaps is this need more ap - ent than in Nebraska. The system of farming in this state has n extremely extensive. Nebraska has been essentially a steer feed - state. As land advances in price and as cattle feeding becomes re or less hazardous, farmers are relunctant to chang-e their sys- </seg>
            <seg id="p062">THIBTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 61 tern and to turn to the dairy cow. Few of our young men have been taught to milk and care for cows, and they have not learned to look upon dairying with the degree of respect that have the young men of other states. As an old cattle feeder recently remarked in my pres - ence, "Dairying is a steep road to wealth." Steep it may be, but when properly undertaken it is nevertheless sure. Indeed, many of your old settlers have already told me that had it not been for their cows and their chickens, they could not have made a living for their families during the years of crop failures and other hardships of the early days in Nebraska. While profits are becoming low for cattle feeders, and in many cases feeders have been losing money in the last few years, many dairymen have realized handsome returns from their cows. We need to cultivate more respect for the cow that has tided us over in times of financial stress, and is constantly returning a liberal profit. The county agent can assist greatly in this phase of the work by keep - ing constantly before the people of his county the real place which dairying should occupy. He can not only aid men who are adapted to the work in getting started right and keeping right, but he can al.-o discourage men who already have failure written on their plans. Some other specific things that the county agent can do for dairy - ing, and while I refer especially to county agents, bear in mind please that in only a few counties of the state do we have county agents. For this co-operation 1 might therefore well appeal to every man in the state who is interested in dairying. Now are there any questions about some of the points that have been made or that Mr. Liebers has made about the county agent's work, whether you have a county agent or not? Question from the audience: How is the tuberculosis situation in your neighborhood, and do the people test for tuberculosis ? t Professor Propps: First, the dairy cow is more easily disposed iberculosis; they are harder worked; it is a harder strain on the ous system; they are more closely housed than other cattle and may be more liable to get tuberculosis, at least it is reasonable cpect so. As a rule dairy cows are housed too closely. They are worked, producing a great amount of milk in a year and it is rally hard on their system if they are cared for the same as a cow and given the same treatement. They should have plenty pen air. Another question from the audience: You won't get much milk in winter if you do that, will you? Professor Propps: No, I am not advising that. K Another question: Is the milking done, or the production done at expense of the lungs? i Professor Propps: No sir, the cow doesn't have tuberculosis of lungs. Tuberculosis in cattle isn't like the tuberculosis in the an family. As a rule we find it in the human family in the lungs, in cattle it is not found in the lungs as a rule. They may have it </seg>
            <seg id="p063">62 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION in the lungs, but not necessarily. It affects the digestive tract mor - than the other. ■ Another question: What about the possibility of getting the foot mouth disease in this country? ■ Professor Propps: I suppose they are watching that carefully, it is well to be on the lookout for it. Another question: Can you give us some idea how to keep out of our communities inferior quality of dairy stock? ■ Professor Propps: Well, the only thing I know is just refuse to it Same enquirer: We have had a little touch of that experience in our county. t Professor Propps: I know what you refer to; a man brings in ; cows for a public sale and people buy these cattle. Now, how you going to prevent them from buying the cattle unless you edu - the people to the point that there is nothing in buying inferior ■Us? ISame enquirer: I realize that, and I mentioned this more from fact that it is better for all communities to be on the alert along line; this bunch of stuff was actually detrimental to our county, ill discourage a great many, as the speaker before you said, from ng dairy stock. They often made the remark concerning the mat - that they were black and white, but there was no milk about n whatever and never would be, and those people that bought them to immediately reduce the price of milk. I Mr. Andrews: A great many farmers have mentioned the fact it the farmers being prejudiced against a certain number of cows use they were bred to inferior animals, and inferior animals ha&lt;l bred in the community. It don't make any difference what breed if an inferior breed is used. If you have a county agent you ought se him; if you haven't, you ought to apply to the state department help or competent men in your county whether it is the county it or not. A layman of a farmer can often set people right about e things. KMr. Wyant of Kearney: To what extent is the offspring of a dairy affected with tuberculosis, or to what extent do we need to expect her offspring will be affected? Professor Propps: Don't understand that I am going to answer everything about tuberculosis, because I am not a veterinarian. It takes a veterinary to answer many of those questions you ask. Some of those questions are not well settled, and I am not going to attempt to answer that question, at least not until some other men express their views on it. Mr. Little: I would like to say that tuberculosis is not trans - mitted to the offspring if the calf is immediately isolated and taken from the dam. If it is immediately isolated it will not be affected from </seg>
            <seg id="p064">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 63 Mr. Noble of Crete: Can the calf consume the milk from the cow without any danger? I Professor Frandsen: The calf should be brought up on boiled milk milk from other cows. It has been proven in this country and in ope that there is no danger from that cow if you will immediately ? the milk pastuerized; of course the milk from that cow might be right, for it isn't every cow with tuberculosis that has tuberculosis L I think the veterinaries will tell you that less than five per cent ; tuberculosis of the udder and they will not give tuberculosis :, but if the cow has tuberculosis you ought not to use the milk any purpose, and if the calf is immediately isolated there is no Er. Severe of Palmyra: I have heard the statement that tuber - , or consumption, in the human family, was hereditary; I have tood that pretty nearly a whole family would go with it. Professor Frandsen: The reason for that is, they may be formed with rather weak lungs and lungs of small capacity. The germs from that one person may get into the air and the whole family become infected in that way, but they are not born with the disease. KMr. Severe: I would like to ask another question. Is there any jer from ihe sire side? That is the main question interesting me. If the sire is affected is there any danger of heredity on that line? Professor Frandsen: Mr. Severe has brought up a very inter- Iig question. I wish Doctor Gaines had been here; he is interested lat subject and has gathered a lot of statistics and I think he is ng to explain them. If your sire is properly segregated when ght to the cow for service I think the danger is almost a minus itity. We have discovered that by bringing only one cow they have had bad results, but I will not say that that is desirable. If you ' a real good sire and take those precautions, I don't believe there s any danger, but it is a practice that should not be followed reek- Mr. Severe: I was enquiring from this standpoint: Would his ■ff spring be liable to carry that part of the disease with him? f Professor Frandsen: No, there is abundant proof to the contrary, doesn't transmit the disease. Tuberculosis is a germ disease a good deal like typhoid fever. We don't get it unless we are exposed to the germs. I think that point ought to be emphasized, whether or not you want to test your cows for the sake of getting a healthy product. That is one question. It used to be a common thing for the farmer to try to cover it up if he had cows that reacted. But from another point, from the economic standpoint, it is most dangerous, for sooner or later the other cows in his herd are going to contract that disease. So it is up to him to weed out his tubercular cows as quickly as he can and at least segregate them. Mr. Little: I was in New York this summer and on my trip I visited two large herds, the most important herds. They had both med Bang's method of eradicating tuberculosis. In one of these herds </seg>
            <seg id="p065">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 64 Kins Segus stood at the head, a Holstein herd. In the other, a son of the sire sold for $12,000 last week and went to California, so you realize the value of that blood. In each case a competent veterin - arian supervised the method as practiced in Denmark for over twenty years. In one of these herds this method of taking the calf imme - diately from the dam and segregating it has been practiced for five years, and instead of losing the blood which that producer had worked with for fourteen years previous to establish in his herd, he has, by this method, continued it. He told me that the month before my visit he had tested 150 cows and there was not a reactor and he had done it with this method. A year previous to that time in the other herd the result was the same. This, I think, proves that it is not trans - mittable, and can be eradicated under the proper method. I Mr. C. K. Anderson of Table Rock: I will g?ve my experience g that line. Three years ago I had five cows in my herd that ted. At the time I was milking about eighteen cows and before reaction I got information from the United State Department that id a hog slaughtered in Kansas City which had tuberculosis and advised me to look the matter up. We had our herd tested and id five reactors. I had milked those cows several months and had id the milk from the whole eighteen together and had fed some ten or eighteen calves. Among them were five from these five i that reacted. I have had my cattle tested three times since the five and have never found a reactor. This hog that had tuber - sis never drank a drop of milk from these cows as far as I know, followed after them in the pasture. Professor Frandsen: I hope you will understand me in my remark, when I said that cattle didn't have tuberculosis of the lungs. I meant that they do not have it so very often there. The very best place to give a hog tuberculosis from a cow is to let him follow the cow and he will take it much easier than if he takes the milk. Mr. Liebers: May I make a statement about the opposite of this answer? I have tested sixty or seventy herds and one large herd had pure bred cattle in which we found twenty-two cows and twenty - six heifers and half of those reacted. You can't always tell. I had the help of some veterinarians and as far as statistics go, only two per cent have an affection of the udder, that is two per cent of the dairy cows. Of the fifteen per cent of perfectly healthy tubercular cows, the calves have the disease through the milk, sometime during the milking period. According to Cornell of Illinois at the United States Experiment Station, at least eighty-five per cent of the healthy, tubercular calves have the disease, and fifty per cent of the hogs following the perfectly healthy, tubercular cattle will take the disease. You may have a perfectly healthy cow having a calf which may be perfectly safe, and at other times you may have half of these calves with tuberculosis, because they have no other milk. BMr. Weyant: We tested at our home, some ninety days since, a of fifty cows, and in this herd of fifty cows, two of them reacted. </seg>
            <seg id="p066">TH1RTY-FIKST ANNUAL CONVENTION 65 We have been furnishing milk for the State Tuberculosis Hospital at Kearney and as a result of testing those cows, without our asking it, the state increased the price of our milk five cents a gallon. I think that is pay enough, and I thank the State Board for that at least. The patrons of our milk in Kearney did likewise, and, without our asking, increased the price of our product five cents a gallon. The only loss that we were at was simply the difference in the price of a pure bred cow and the price of that cow on the market. There is one thing that has always looked funny to me and taht is this, the cow that was condemned as a milk cow, they allowed her to be shipped to Omaha and slaughtered and the meat put on the market. I Professor Propps: There has been a good deal done along this of tuberculosis but I think we have spent as much time as we ht to this morning. I think it always pays to test the cow and these questions regarding tubercular milk as affecting the young nals, I think are all worthy of investigation. Cows have tuber - &gt;sis in various parts of the body while the human family has it he lungs and in the bones, but dairy cattle may have it in any of glands, and especially in the intestinal glands. You may never w your cow may have it, but it is not safe to use her milk. I it to mention again that if we can help you in any of the prob - s that you have we will be glad to do so in any way we can, and ou will let us know we will appreciate it very much. Mr. Apperson: A good many men know that some ten or twelve years ago I had about as good a dairy herd as anyone in Nebraska. It was during the time when Professor Haecker was the whole show. I know I had a few good ones for I sold Jacobi Reim for $2500 and I sold another for $850. I know I must have had some pretty good ones because I got so well fixed that I didn't like to get up so early and I couldn't hire the ones I wanted to (and they say it is hard to came back) and I wanted to see if I could come back. I came up and had a talk with Professor Frandsen in order to get a little assist - ance in trying out a new proposition. I wanted to go into it econom - ically and I had to try out the men, too; it is just as important to have the men right as to have the cows right. I asked Professor Frandsen il didn't know that Mr. Liebers was an expert dairyman in Gage county) if he had such a man as I wanted. He said, "Yes, I can furnish you with a man that will just suit you." I said I wanted stanchions because I wanted to try out the man as well as the cows. I said, "Now, I don't think a college dude will help me any because he will want cement floors and all those things." So Professor Propps came down to help me and we took off our coats, (everything seems to be familiar to him and he takes off his coat the first thing), and he didn't want to run in the fine cement walks about the premises and all that kind of thing, but he was ready to use just what I had on hand.

The President: We certainly are pleased with the discussion by Professor Propps and wish we could continue, but our time is growing KOur program committee, in arranging this program, tried to in - »erse something new and different from anything we ever had re, and coming at the subject from a different angle than had ever been approached from before, so they gave us this subject: "The Con - sumer's Interest in the Producer of Dairy Products," and we will now listen to Honorable Ross Hammond of Fremont on this subject. Mr. Hammond spoke as follows: I come before this association in the person of an innocent by - stander, with the emphasis on the qualifying adjective. I am in thi. - relation, one of the great, unidentified throng, except by the common designation of Ultimate Consumer. I am representative of this ob - ject of the solicitude of reformers, research-workers, sociologists, econ - omists, statesmen, politicians and honest men. In this capacity, what - ever ills I may be compelled to bear 1 may yet content and console myself with the thought that I am at least one of the great majority. It it a comfort always to know you are touching elbows with others. There is a feeling of strength in it if you are engaged in battle. Then - is satisfaction of sympathy in it if you are suffering, and the ultimate consumer, if we are to believe the foregoing category of professional crepe hangers, is always a sufferer. The misery that loves company, therefore, has in this instance so much of it as to make the ultimate consumer perfectly happy in his misery-. t Having thus established my identity more or less definitely, let pass to the privilege of the moment of presenting some of the ts of the indictment found by the proletariat grand jury against plutocratic culprits in the dock before me. Or the theory that I words butter no parsnips" and that you are all in favor of a ! extension of the buttering 'process, I feel more at liberty to pre - the findings of this grand jury. Grand juries are bodies sitting ■mittently for the public welfare. Their purposes are good whether are able to return any true bills that result in conviction, or They may serve as monitors and thus perform the salutary work upplying the ounce of prevention that is worth a pound of cure. The consumer is interested in the producer. The dependent is interested in the one depended upon. Whether that interest is wholly reciprocal, itself depends. K There are two paramount demands of the consumer upon the pro - r. First, the consumer wants quality. Second, he wants the pro - r's product at a reasonable price. fThe question of quality comes first, and this one involves all that ntive genius and scientific application can devise. In a peculiar almost abnormal sense with respect to dairy products, it involves public health, and therefore the public happiness. Since bacterio- </seg>
            <seg id="p068">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION' 67 logists have revealed to us a new world of which our fathers knew little or nothing, we shudder at the consequences we have escaped. The marvel is that any of us are alive to know the truth, that the primal producer and the ultimate consumer are not both extinct. Yet bac - teriology and chemistry are such exact sciences and their conclusions so easily demonstrated that none can deny them. Despite all this knowledge the consumer is compelled to charge negligence as one of the counts of the indictment returned. If milk and its derivatives were not such indispensible products our insistence would not be so emphatic. But here are foods divinely ordained and dedicated to our use, and it is our business to make the most of them. Neither the milk producer nor the butter maker has any moral, and therefore no legal right to cheat us of our dues. It is just as sane for us to knowingly permit the criminal vandalism that would pol - lute our water supply and put arsenic in our coffee and bread, as it is for us to fail to demand of you milk producers and butter makers the very cleanest and best you can give us. We cannot afford to use your foul and contaminated stuff at any price. We consumers are learning slowly how susceptible your products are to extraneous influences and with the increase of this knowledge our determination increases, our suspicion grows and our apprehension riaea. Adam Bede has graphically described the old-time methods of butter and milk production. That was in the day of the one-room home and gravity separation of butter fat; when the milk pans set on shelves for the cream to rise, these shelves skirting the room where the family cooked, baked, ate, smoked, washed and slept. In those days, said he, you could taste every member of the family in the butter. But since then has come the cream separator, that wonderful combination of steel discs and centrifugal force that has revolutionized the whole dairy business. But we are still mammals and there is no prospect that we shall ever be eliminated, except by death, from among those classes of animals that .suckle their young. Therefore our interact in the quality of dairy products is sure to abide. Only as the con - sumer is alive to his own interests will he compel the dairymen to move along the path of humane and scientific sanitation. Less and leas will he be tolerated of dairy negligence. It was my business as a boy on the farm to do the milking after 1 was large enough to grasp the — situation. The family was supplied with milk, cream and butter and, in flush times, surplus butter was taken to the village store and traded for prunes, hairpins and overalls. 1 shudder now as I think how careless I was of sanitary conditions. The cow was not sufficiently divested of the plastered coat of her own ointment. There was no administration program of preparation. She was not groomed and wiped, except in such extreme instances, not to say rare, as would appeal to a boy between the years of 13 and 18. No attention was paid to mussing up bedding, manure and hay at milking time. No microbes had ever then been seen in that quiet little Quaker community, so I was not on guard against them. I am </seg>
            <seg id="p069">68 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION sure now, in the light of subsequent discoveries, that I must have negligently and ignorantly introduced into those frothy pails of milk enough impurities to poison the whole German army in the trenches. How my good mother overcame this handicap so as to enjoy the repu - tation of being a good butter maker, as she did, I am at a loss to know. She did give scrupulous attention to sanitation in the house and she wrought the miracle of turning that filth into milk and golden balls of butter. How she did it I shall never know. iWe, the consumers, insist that you, the producers, shall constantly rve all the rules of health and cleanliness in the cow barn and in creamery. My mother would have made better butter had the and the milking been looked after as well as the house. It takes 1 work to get the best results. Foul milk can be pasteurized and milk sterilized, but neither is as good as if it never had been bad. i in your performance, will always be behind our demands, and we, ur demands, will always be behind our best interests, so at most e is sure to be a gap or opening for improvement. Too few cities and towns are fortified with milk inspection. My own home, which is in a city of 10,000, is one of them. We are trying to ge inspection of milk. A few months ago without any definite knowledge or even without much suspicion, I asked that a state in - spection be made of our milk supply. The result was to disclose some dairy conditions that were deplorable. Lots belly-deep with manure. burns unclean, unventilated and unsanitary and milk that had had filth substituted for its extracted and only redeeming feature, butter fat. After all these months the city council is still haggling over what kind of an ordinance to pass, after all its members and all the people, including most of the dairymen themselves, have approved the plan. Why permit ourselves to be chained to a rock? In traveling to and from Omaha regularly for some years I daily saw a dairy plant of a character all too common in the milk supply of cities. It wore a bleak and desolate aspect. The cows were melan - choly and morose, sad-eyed and listless. They never heard the Mother Goose ditty, "Hi diddle-diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the cow jumped over the moon." There were no evidences of straw about the premises, no sign of animal comfort, except a cheap barn, apparently neither convenient nor warm. The cow lot was filled with hillocks of manure that heightened the dejected appearance of the poor cows. I always wondered how that dairy could have been profitable to the producer or satisfactory to the consumer. To the latter it could have been so only on the theory of his blissful ignorance. The consumers' interest in the producer is his own enlightened self-interest that will eliminate such woeful spectacles as this. The consumer is interested also in the producer, in that he de - mands the latter shall not deliver him the product of diseased cows. Typhus germs are bad enough, but tubercular bacilli are positively criminal. The indictment runs against these without reservation. There are too few tubercular tests of dairy herds. There must be </seg>
            <seg id="p070">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 69 E regard for the rights of the consumer in this particular. Sel - ilk from diseased cows is as bad as some of the other forms of traffic. A resident of a certain Nebraska town, the other day :ted with a fanner for some dressed pork. A few days later i of the farmer was in town and he was asked, "How about that "Oh," said the boy, "we haven't any; the pig got well." would you prefer as a regular diet, tubercular milk or cholera ork? t Producing dairy products is a fine art. It requires skill, persever - , broad knowledge. The consumer may not always be aware of it the extent of being prompted to say so, but he really does demand Fie producer a higher service than he does of many others who 1 him. He demands of the physician who treats his family when that he have certain acquirements. He must possess a certificate f attainment* before he can, practice his profession. He demands &gt;f his pharmacist that he pass an examination and be granted a diploma &gt;f fore he can compound medicines. Should we not fix a standard by aw to which dairymen must attain before they can supply us with -nilk or butter? This in addition to their butter tests. Is it not as mportant that we keep well as it is that we get well? "D. D." ought o be a title as honorable in meaning Doctor of Dairying as in meaning &gt;octor of Divinity. »But let me not present these indictments without paying a mer - tribute to the clean, progressive, intelligent, honest dairyman for is the salt of the earth. He is serving his day and his generatoin faithful and honorable manner. He is furnishing the consumers products that are of great value, wholesome, nutritious, indispensable. He swats the fly, evades typhus, abolishes filth, banishes disease, con- rms to science, ministers to the highest needs of mankind. My hat iff to him. Mav his tribe increase! All the foregoing on the consumer's demand for quality. His sec - ond demand, as I have said, is for the dairyman's product at a reason - able price. The cost of living continues to mount upward as upon eagle's wings. Dairy products constitute an enormous bill. But we consumers have fixed a high standard for them and we must pay ac - cordingly. Still we demand efficiency in their production. We want highest types of dairy animals. We ask the dairyman to adopt meth - ods that will determine for him what cows are paying their board, with a margin above. We want that he shall avail himself of the most approved appliances, not recklessly, but economically. We recog - nize that a fair return is the legitimate reward of honest labor and good service. It is important to the prosperity and the development of this state that he prosper, for he is intimately allied with our in - tegral and basic form of wealth, namely, agriculture. I do not know whether co-operative creameries are to be interpose-J as important fac - tors in giving producers larger returns and the consumers lower prices. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">70 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION I only know this, and I submit it is axiomatic, that whatever agency of production and distribution does not pay in service the toll it take - from any industry must eventually be eliminated. That is but the just and inexorable law of compensation. I am one consumer who wants to see dairying so adjusted as to impose the manufacturing process upon well established, well equipped sanitary creameries. Farm butter should be only a memory for commercial purposes. The cream - ery can equip itself with all appliances, whereas the farmer cannot. The creamery makes butter manufacturing a business. On the aver - age farm it is a mere incident. With creameries standards may be established. On the farm standards are impossible, for there are ten thousand graduations, from the positively vile to the excellent. I have never permitted myself to be deluded into preferring "good farm but - ter" to the creamery brand. I would rather risk the creamery mako&gt; for a dozen reasons. The profits to the producer must always be of the utmost im - portance. These are what induce him to engage in it. They are the compelling impulses. There are those in this business, in both pro - duction and distribution, who disregard most other features, or hoKi them of secondary importance. It is necessary to have inspection to prevent fraud upon the consumers. It may not be as necessary to put dairymen as it is to put oleo makers under the microscope but it is necessary. Adulteration is not a crying evil, but it is not unknown to dairymen and creameries even in this state. When but - ter sells at from 30 to 40 cents a pound there is strong temptation for the unscrupulous to work into it all the moisture the law allows, for that price a pound for surplus water that costs nothing is a get - rich-quick scheme. As collector of internal revenue for the federal government in this state for some years it has become my official duty to penalize this offense on several occasions. I am compelled to say that in my judgment the most of these offenses were mere inadver - tences. Even when they were not as I believed, I found my sympathies unconsciously going out to the men who were struggling to build up a great industry here. Manufacturing is, as a rule, so hazardous and precarious, that I would willingly or wittingly exact no pound of flesh merely because I had the power. Whether the 16' ', of moisture fixed as a maximum limit is the proper line of demarcation between unadulterated and adulterated butter, I do not know. I am of the opinion, however, that the consumer of the farm product is as much entitled to the protection of federal law as is the consumer of the creamery product. The Gray moisture test should be applied to farm butter sold for commercial purposes as well as to dairy and creamery butter. The consumer has a right to ask this small boon. The right of the consumer to buy butter substitutes I recognize as a battlefield where dairymen have fought and won some notable victories. This effects many millions of households where the family larder, out of respect for the family budget, must remain butterles&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p072">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 71 One hundred forty million pounds of oleo a year serves as the poor man's lubricant, including also those who think they are buying your products. While for twenty-five years I have taken the side of the creamery men in their fight against the fraudulent encroachment of oleo I am of the opinion that oleo is entitled to a "place in the sun." always, however, that it be there under no assumed name. If it were merely a question between the big packers who make oleo, or "mar - garine," its new name, and quiet, unobtrusive, law-abiding dairyman and farmer I would fly at once and unreservedly to the side of the latter. But for the purpose of this discussion I am assumed to be the advocate of the consumer. In this advocacy I must admit that if I am able to buy oleo at a very much less price than your fragrant and delectable product brings I must not expect to get it as masquer - ading in the respectable habiliments of butter, either as to color or name. If my lot be so ordered that I must live on a beer income I cannot, either in common honesty to myself or . justice to others, through mockery or sham, pretend to be living on champagne. The proposed federal law now before congress prepared by the National Dairy Union appear to be drawn in a spirit of moderation and fair- Iln conclusion I must pay the tribute I feel in my heart. I witness in all the ramifications of this organization of allied societies a Endous powerful machine for the upbuilding of this great state or transmuting through it as by the magic power of a wonderful n y the baser elements into a stream of gold dividing into a myriad «f tiny rivulets widely distributing the largest among a happy people. Nebraska is progressing wonderfully in dairying. It is the home of the areest butter-making center in America. Its fertile meadows, its fields and hills, its crops of cereals and maize poured out lavishly from the cornucopia of Ceres, the beneficient Goddess; its succulent and flowing brooks, all conspire to make this the conspicuous abode of that queen of farm animals, the dairy cow. Here, when the sober judgment of a moral people is this year rendered against John Barleycorn, as it surely will be, there will be breweries to be converted into creameries and a new demand for your wholesome products by families heretofore denied Them on account of slavery to an evil thing. Here the lowing, peaceful herds will multiply and with them come a conservation of the riches of our soil, a multiplication of blessings that will make our destiny 'loubly secure as a great, a happy and a prosperous people. This is my benediction upon you. The President: We certainly have had this subject handled in good -hape from the consumer's standpoint, and now we will have the pleas - ure of listening to a discussion of the same subject from the producers standpoint by Mr W. Righter Wood, of Omaha. </seg>
            <seg id="p073">72 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Mr. Wood spoke as follows: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I What a compliment it is for the "humble milkman' to be called to platform for an address, knowing full well that, ordinarily, his Is must be "delivered to the rear." Replying to Mr. Hammond's paper, the speaker shall endeavor to give the "producer's interest in the consumer of dairy products." In presenting this subject I shall treat it chiefly in the light of the milk producer who sells his product direct to the consumer. Beinu a dairyman, the writer can assure you he is very much interested in the consumer of dairy products; for without him and his family, the producer would have to engage in some other line of work. Khe consumer has created the demand and the producer must fill the best of his ability — there must be an interchange of ideas: 'getting together" is what assists progress. The consumer says: nt my milk cool, clean and sweet; it must be drawn from healthy or else it must be "pasteuried," I can take no risk." From these ids have sprung the various ways of handling milk. I How well one recalls the years gone by, when at the sound of the man's bell, the good housewife would come running out, with crock ind to be filled with the day's supply of milk. Those were "palmy ," when "bacteria" was unknown; the "sediment test' unheard of; rculosis" only thought to afflct man, and the "pump" made up for lay's shortage. Anything went that had a blueish color. The only ranee the customer had in getting nearly what they wanted, was instantly change dairymen. As the "new broom sweeps clean." M the above mentioned sell "straight stuff" till the "timelimit" was hed — then down went the quality. Ah, yes! Those were "sweet " to the producer. Yet, like childhood, they have gone, never to rn. The world has grown older — we have advanced. This downright deception and ignorance on the part of the pro - ducer, were causes that brought about the better — more uniform milk of today. Like the building of a city, the advancement of science and on down to the production of dairy products, there has appeared a spirit of betterment. Had the dairyman followed in the footsteps of his predecessors, there would have occurred a branrl of "race suicide" different from the one of today. Disease would have spread through the agency of milk drawn from unhealthy cows, or subjected to unsani - tary conditions, which would have caused a death rate like unto a plague. As a consequence, we find dairying being taught in our agri - cultural schools. The instruction is both practical and thorough. What a blessing these institutions are to a state! Think of the young men and women leaving these schools to return to the farms, better dairy - men and intelligent producers, who are bound to take a keen interest in the consumer of dairy products. a safeguard to public health, men are appointed to inspect the * of the producer of dairy products. This is an important posi- </seg>
            <seg id="p074">73 THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION El should be filled only by men familiar with dairying. A good r is an asset to a city or state; for he has the interest of the - and consumer at heart. His work should be appreciated by the office permanent, with a good salary and out of politics. Surrounding cities of moderate size, one sees small dairies that are not built with any degree of permanence. The proprietor is generally a renter. Aside from his cows (mostly "natives'), he has very little at stake. He is there simply "after the money" and rares nothing for a good name; he only expects to remain there a short time. Being like the Arab, he can quietly fold his tent and steal away. The writer knows of one that did. A contageous disease had broken out in this mans home. No proper quarantine was established and as a conse - quence many cases of the disease was spread by his milk. Nobody knew this fellow; he was just a "floater" — milked a few months and was gone. You say: "Why did not the dairy inspector guard the public?" Why, bless you, this official cannot be everywhere at once! This disease might have started after his official visit You say: "What shall the consumer do?" My advice is, buy your milk from a dairyman who bears a good name and, if possible, owns his own farm; if these cannot be had, use pastuerized milk. How slow were some of the producers in adopting the "tubercu - lin test" for their cows. This occurs mostly with older men or those ignorant of their own good. They seem to think that the cow is immune from disease. Not so. The "bright minds" of today have found that old "bossie"' could be effected in body much like her keeper. The writer ventures the assertion that before long no one will buy a critter unless its health is properly vouched for. I Proper methods and equipment for handling milk have been changed derfully within the past few years. Clean, pure milk can be pro - id if the cows are healthy, the buildings inexpensive yet well ted, lighted and ventilated; the method good rind the equipment erate in price, backed by careful management; the consumer of y products need have no fear of milk from such places. You good iewives, get acquainted with your dairymen. Call at his place and for yourselves how the milk is produced and handled. The consumer, who lives in a large city, will have to use "certi - fied" or "pastuerized" milk, this is the safest in your case. Tis nothing short of a miracle, what this pasteurizing method will do to render the milk wholesome. This great mass of milk shipped to the city dairies comes from "cow farmers" not dairymen by any means. This milk has been produced and handled in as crude a manner as ignorance and slovenous will allow. Thank goodness, the state and creamery author - ities are working diligently to compel! these fellows to improve. They are like the proverbial mule — you may lead to water, i.e. (improve their methods), but all h — 1 can't make them drink. The best way to make them take notice is to "sting their pocketbook,' compensate those who do try. Generally those fellows are not with us at these meetings. Should there be one, you creamery men are the gainers, for I venture </seg>
            <seg id="p075">74 (that cow-keepers, after attending these meetings — looking car. at the "working models" of better dairying displayed on thi^ s, will go home, and if he has mentally "hit the sawdust trail" 1 revolutionize his whole farm. Just imagine the milk you will 8 from him now! Why, your separator will "smile" with joy. Ice a good run without being stopped for cleaning. If it were not for these large commercial dairies, the great mass of humanity in our cities would have to be content with "condensed" milk, because land values near these places render the production ex - pensive. It can be produced and shipped a long distance at a less cost and more economically than that produced near the city's border. In that case the producer should receive a higher price than ordinarily, then there is a profit. Many pasteurizing stations are located in the country, near where the milk is produced. After bottling it is then shipped to the city. This insures better quality than that transported in cans. And, by the way, Mr. Consumer, please tell your wife not to use our bottles for "preserves, etc." We need them in our business. We sell milk — not bottles. In closing, I wish to quote a few "snappy" lines from the musical comedy called "Alone at Last." You will note that the author, a con - sumer of dairy products, does not mention the milkman or milk, but attacks the water you drink, the air you breathe, the chef, oyster man and packer, so this producer of dairy products is glad to see "there are others." Here are the lines: In these days of indigestion It is oftentimes a question As to what to eat and what to leave alone For each microbe and bacillus Has a different way to kill us. And in time they always claim us for their own. There are germs of every kind In any food that you can find In the market or upon the bill of fare. Drinking water's just as risky As the so-called deadly whisky And it's often a mistake to breathe the air. </seg>

AFTERNOON SESSION Meeting called to order by the President. The President: We will take before noon. The first number on up of a Dairy Herd," by Mr. A. S. now listen to Mr. Nelson. up the program where we left off the program will be "The Building Nelson of Stromsburg, and we will Mr. Nelson spoke as follows Building up Dairy Herd tin building up a dairy herd I will take for granted that we start, with a herd of common cows; second, the grade herd; third, the breds; and fourth, the high producing pure bred herd. In Ne - ka, we find but few large pure bred herds. There are more grade s with a few pure breds, but a still larger number of herds of com - cows with a scattering of grades. It is much easier to improve a herd of common cows than one of the high producing pure bred kind. For example, the average Ne - braska cow of 130 pounds of butter fat per year would be a fair type of the cows found in a common herd. Giving the sire credit for being half the herd, it would be an easy matter to improve it. A pure bred sire out of a dam with a credit of 400 pounds of butter fat per year used on such a herd should increase the production through the off - spring to nearly 200 pounds of butter fat. But with a high producing pore bred herd with an average of 400 pounds of butter fat per year, it would be a far more difficult task to secure a sire so prepotent as to increase the average production; that is, understand me, not so marked an increase would be noticed here as upon the common herd. Yet, to our own satisfaction, in our own herd last fall, while doing official test - ing, we found junior two-year-old heifers sired by our senior herd bull make better records than their dams at full age under the same fitting, management, milker and feeder. We consider ourselves for - tunate in being able to own just such a sire. Long may he live! </seg>
            <seg id="p078">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 77 But the great question now before us ii: how shall we improve their offspring. Now I do not want you to get the impression that one should start to build up from a common herd necessarily, nor do I want you to get the impression that one should start with a high pro - ducing herd. As to these two subjects much has been said, much is said, and much will be said. It is my conviction that you will obtain the best results by starting with a good grade herd, using a good pure bred sire from a cow yielding at least 400 pounds of butter fat; and from these good grades omit the scrub pure breds, preferring the high producing pure bred. It may seem strange to many of you for a breeder of pure bred cattle to advocate grades, but when a man starts in with pure breds I want to see him make a success of it. What do I mean by the scrub - pure bred? It is the result of the undeveloped breeder — not knowing - how to properly care for the young calves, improper mating, and mis - management in general. As a result, the animal is undersized, with a lack of capacity, constitution and vigor. You have all undoubtedly teen catalogued for many sales just such an animal, though it has a pedigree that would be admired by the best of breeders, yet it couldn't make the advanced registry if you fed her on strawberries and let her drink cream. Another kind of scrub pure bred that we generally find for sale has a pedigree which runs something like this: Her grand sire's dam is by a brother to the sire of a certain 30-lb. cow. It just grows, that's all. In building up a dairy herd, starting with good grades, I would suggest that you buy such cows as are capable of producing at least (pounds i question) butter fat per year. And right here I want to lion in the first place, that you use your own judgment in selection ossible. If any assistance should be desired, do not depend too i upon the advice of the seller, but better, call upon the Dairy irtment at the State Farm which will be glad to give you all the •tance 'possible. Don't take too much of the other man's word. Let Babcock's tester and a milk scale tell you what she can do. II may as well say right here, at the time of our first purchase ure breds and in starting our herd we were at many times ably ited by the instructors in the Dairy Department and I am not in least afraid to compare our herd to the leading herds of our great e. You know it is getting to be more of a fact the older this world that it is harder for people to take advise and much more to ask it. i That's another kind of scrub.) Why we have parties in our county that wouldn't join a cow testing association for the simple on they had no silage to feed their cows, where land sells from ) to $300 per acre. Why they even burn their straw stacks, sell r horses and buy tractors so they dont need to haul horse manure. 1 Again turning to our herd, let us ever bear in mind the tester and milk scale. If possible, join a cow testing association, and stay </seg>
            <seg id="p079">78 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION by it; get the other fellow in it, it aids in so many ways especially in better and more profitable feeding. I After selecting the herd the next proposition will be the selection ne sire. While I talk from a Holstein breeder's standpoint and a. - ehoice of the various dairy breeds, I can make this statement that i herd of grade cows you can afford to pay $150 for a sire, and at time when he can be of no more service in your herd with proper can be sold for beef for very little less than the purchase price therefore the cost of calves at birth from the sire's side would be prac - tically the cost of his feed. It is nothing unusual for a Holstein bull to weigh a ton in a little better than three years. This can be done by buying him when a calf, feed him lots of skim milk, even until a year old, feed him oats, bran, ground corn, some of that good fourth cutting of alfalfa and your neighbors will say: "My, what a bull for that age, I never saw anything like him." tOne hundred fifty dollars should buy a bull from a splendid sire and m with about a 20 pound butter record for a seven day test, or with edit of 400 pounds of butter fat per year used on these grade cows d certainly bring splendid results by keeping the heifer calves i this sire and mating them to a still better sire and by continually g the tester and milk scale, this would certainly be building up a y herd. To many of you this may seem a long way but dairying is no getting-rich-quick scheme. Dairying proper is a continual building up; first the herd where there is always room for improvement; second, soil, which means better cows, better soil, better profits and better In building up a herd, as in any other business one would undertake, a certain aim should always be in mind. We had our aid for a cow to the acre and 400 pounds butter fat per cow a year increase the pro - duction of the soil through the cow, increase the production of the cow through the sire, the tester and the milk scale, and at last through seven years of hard work and thought, find ourselves this fall with corn yielding 15 tons of silage per acre and alfalfa yielding 5 tons per acre, or enough feed from two acres for two cows 365 days at the rate of 40 pounds of silage and 14 pounds of alfalfa hay per cow each day. A large number of our cows will cross the 400 pound butter fat mark this year and can rest assured that as far as production of the soil is concerned there will be no decrease and through proper selection of sires the production of the cows should not decrease but increase. I Before leaving our grade herd and selecting our pure bred herd uit to impress upon this audience the care of the dairy heifer calf i which we build our herd. Neglect is dangerous; we cannot be careful in the care of that heifer calf in her first six weeks. We cise the greatest of care in starting her on milk, at first born, once does she get to nurse from her dam; many of our calves never Her first feed will contain the seemingly small feed of one pound iilk. This amount will be fed four times daily and increased one- </seg>
            <seg id="p080">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 79 tenth of a pound per feed per day for twenty-one tiays at which time her ration will contain twelve pounds of milk daily, which we con - tinue until four or live weeks old; during this time we are teaching the calf also to eat grain. We have found that a calf a few weeks older, which has already been educated to this, a great help in instructing the younger calf. At the age of four or five months they eat four or five pounds of grain per day at which time they are about on full ration of skim milk which will take a period of some six weeks. We have never fed more than twelve pounds of skimmed milk to any calf until after three months of age and then not to exceed sixteen pounds. We do not find it profitable, for at that age silage is added to their ration which we find is the greatest developer of capacity of all feeds. We always feed our heifers a liberal allowance of grain until they freshen, and after according to production. I We seldom pasture, generally keep them in a .-haded lot with all new-mown alfalfa they want to eat with silage and grain. We find luch better growth condition and disposition especially when with I breds that are to be tested at first freshening. We also depend fall freshening as a wonderful help in developing the heifer. We fall freshening a triple benefit — better production, better price for products and better development of the heifer calf. For housing the yearlings we use baled straw for sides, with straw roof, with an opening to the south. We rind this very com - fortable as by using a double wall of bales no wind can get through whatever. This kind of a shed serves the purpose well and can be had at a very small cost. For the calves we have a barn built especially for them equipped with steel stanchions and quides for con - venient and quick feeding. Included in this barn are box stalls for cows at calving with the aim in view of having everything as comfort - able as possible for the new-born calf. Continuous rows of windows .ire used, giving abundant light which adds much to their comfort during stormy weather such as we have just had. Of all the many things there are to be mentioned in the care and comfort of the heifer calf and it is the thing I always enjoy to do, is the liberal use of wheat straw for bedding. There is nothing I enjoy more, when I leave the calf barn at night, than to see the beautiful little black and white calves cuddled deep in nice, bright straw. tNow, with the experience received from the grade herd as to care management, little trouble should be encountered in the selection, and management of the pure bred herd. In speaking from a Hol - i Fries ian breeder's standpoint (as mentioned before), bearing in I we are selecting high producers, little trouble will be found ig to the splendid advancement of the official test. I Any buyer should require of the seller an extended pedigree of animals he should desire to purchase and by comparison can y classify.

            <seg id="p081">80 viduality combined, but much more has been said of the great producers of our breed than has been said of its splendid individuals. I speak not from the view of the hobbiest, but from the view of the man building: up a herd with the profit side in view. KThe calf from the champion Butler cow of the world will sell for : money than the calf from the champion cow of the National y Show. And now in closing I want to impress upon you how vastly impor - tant a fact it is that we should strive for better stock. I sincerely hope that the time will come when we, as breeders of dairy cattle of Nebraska, can be able to produce such stock as will interest the western buyer, and it is speedily coming as you have all undoubtedly noticed through the various agricultural papers of the advancement of the official test. Our Dairy Department is employing two men, doing nothing but official testing this winter; we also note of several splendid records. Splendid sires are being used and coupled with good care, good management, honest dealing and the official test, success will be ours, and may the day soon be here when Nebraska can also point with pride to her own 40 pound cow. tThe President: We are very happy to have with us this afternoon Id and respected member, in fact one of the oldest charter members le association who in later years has not been attending so regularly ;ept in touch with us as he used to, but I am going to ask our ecretary, Mr. S.

I want to tell about two things that I noticed. I When the older men, like myself, clapped ther hands each clapped himself, but when the boys clapped, they clapped together; that was n work. When we older people cheered, we each one cheered for slf, but when the boys cheered it was altogether. That is team k, that is the new order of things in this state. I Another thing noticed was that when we came to these meetings s ago we were all the older or middle aged men, but now as I at them it seems to me as though the boys are doing the work. I was talking with the Chancellor last evening and I said: "A few yean ago if you used technical terms nobody understood what they meant, but now these young people use them as easy as I do the mul - tiplication table." tl think the most important part I have gotten out of life has been people I have come to know in these meetings; what you really out of the discussions you can get out of a book or newspaper, bat can't know the people unless you meet them. I remember in </seg>
            <seg id="p082">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 81 1886 I met a man at the republican convention that I have been glad to know ever since. So come to the meetings even if you don't say much; come to learn how to do things and it is in getting acquainted with people that I get their ideas. fwant to speak of one thing here. Sometimes we get awfully raged when we think we are not making much progress. If you it from year to year. I believe you people think you cannot make in the dairy business, and it does not seem to you that you have sssed very much, but it is keeping at it that counts. The other day I met an old friend whom I used to know in 1887 or 1888. We had a creamery and he drove a cream wagon and gath - ered cream. I said to him, "Skully, how many miles a day did you drive?" He said, "Forty miles a day except Sunday." I said, "How many horses did you have?" He said, "Six." I asked, "How much cream did you get?" It was guaged by the inch in those days, an inch was supposed to make a pound of batter. He said, "I got 150 to 300 inches. Now the man who drove twenty-five miles a day had four horses; I drove forty miles and had six horses." Can you not see what a wonderful progress we have made? Then we found when they discovered the Babcock test that one-quarter of the butter fat was left in the skim milk. I made hundreds of tests just to determine that point. They were leaving one-quarter of the butter fat in the skimmed milk, and didn't know it. I Then came the hand separator proposition, but I will skip over some lese other features, such as the skimming stations and the hand rator which took out all the butter fat. Now I will talk a little bit about the achievements of dairying and agriculture. I think the origination and development of the central - ization method of butter making was one of the wonderful achieve - ments in this state. I do feel that the great centralized method of commercial butter making is one of the great achievements in the history of this state and I thought I would like to drop those two thoughts — one is the team work the younger generation is doing, while in the earlier days we worked each for himself. Now they work in unison and they are better equipped than we were. They get ac - quainted when they come to the meetings and they know how to take hold and accomplish things. Another great achievement in the history of our state, and I think the greatest of all from the very beginning, was when Dean Bessey introduced in the state legislature in 1900 a bill to enact a law which said the elementary principles of agriculture, including a fair know - ledge of the habits of the common plants and so forth, shall be taught in the normal schools of the state. 11116 President: I wish to make a few announcements.

I The President: Owing to the absence of our succeeding number will take up the next number on our program for this afternoon, have the great pleasure of having with us a man, who has had r large experience along the lines of dairying and dairy cattle breed - and raising. He also goes a step further than the ordinary dairy - &gt; in that he has a somewhat different policy and can see a little her ahead than many of us and is able to tell us about the pitfalls lie in the way of dairying and the dairy business, for the future rs as well as the good things. I personally have had the pleasure istening to this gentleman once before and I say without a bit 01 hesitation that I feel you will all be pleased after hearing him thi&gt; afternoon. We will now listen to Doctor H. B. FaviU of Chicago. ■ Doctor. H. B. Favill spoke as follows: President, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is alwas a little difficult to explain why a practicing physician should be brought off on a long trip to talk on a technical subject which, presumably, is better understood by nine-tenths of his audience than by him. I am not going to go into an explanation of that subject, ex - cept to say that I have gotten into the habit of being called upon for a good many different functions; in fact I always think of myself in connection with the Chicago judge. One of our very learned men, Mr. Emory Story, a very witty lawyer and a very scholarly man, was asked his opinion of the judge, Mr. Story assented in a way, at least. He said, "Yes,, the judge is a man of broad and comprehensive ideals, who knows less about more things than any man that ever sat on the bench." I often feel that might hit me if I keep on covering territory in the various fields that I get into. But I have a feeling that this is a little different; I judge it by my internal feelings. »This morning I was shocked and almost hurt to hear my friend. Wilkinson, who is responsible for bringing me out here and who paid my expenses, say, that the doctor had dairying as ■ Now if dairying is still my side line, I want it to be understood that that day is about over.

            <seg id="p084">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 83 small dairyman. I have gotten involved, very likely, in the organiza - tional end of this business — I refer now to the comparatively new but ambitious organization known as the National Dairy Council, an or - ganization which has charged itself with harmonizing, amalgamating and rendering effective the various branches of the dairy industry. But I am not going to stop to talk to you about that, I simply call your attention to the fact that this is the avenue through which I come to you today; it is because of circumstances related to this that I am here today. And it is because of this point of view which I have ac - quired in connection with that great attemp to do something by which it can be generalized and made effective with reference to the dairy industry, that I feel myself at liberty today to presume ot talk at all to you about a view of the dairy industry. I am .peaking, not from the standpoint of any limited dairy point of view, but about the de - velopment of the enormous industry in this country, which, I do not hesitate to say to you, is the greatest and most important single in - dustry in this country. One cannot look into this question of dairying of the future without undertaking if possible, to analize the thing to its smallest terms; because when you view th'e industry from its final terms, in its large development, in its higher branches of commercialism, you find the subject so complex, so intercommunicative, so inter-locked in all business ways, that it is almost impossible to talk about the thing in any clearly analitical way. It is only as you reduce the industry down to its smallest terms that you can get any kind of grasp of the situation from which to start towards a conception of the dairy in - dustry, and it is with reference to that, that I use the term I do of "dairying unit." Now by the dairy unit I don't mean the single dairy farm. Fre - quently that has been alluded to as the basis of our calculations. What is the aspect before us of the dairy farm as being an ele - mental factor? tgo beyond that. The unit of the dairy business is the cow. The r we reach that point of view the sooner and the better we will come to see that our calculations must start from the cow, must cor - relate to the cow, then we will be able, more quickly, to get on sound irround of reasoning as to this dairy industry. Well, what do I mean about the cow? It is an old story and I dont want to worry you with that and talk about the cow — that is, a profitable cow — I don't want to go on and repeat to you all of the things that have become axiomatic with reference to the fact that there is a profitable and an unprofitable cow. I dont need to argue with you about the general proposition of carrying unprofitable cows. But after all, you and I know that the question of the unprofitable cow has not yet been impressed upon the people of this country at all. The fact that you know it and that I know it does not in any sense solve the problem. The question is: What are you and I doing with our knowledge, our information and our convictions upon that subject? </seg>
            <seg id="p085">84 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION {we carrying the propaganda on this subject of the profitable and ofitable cow to the place where it must go to be worth anything ly as propaganda? In other words, I am here to impress upon what you shall do with what you know, rather than trying to bring anything that you don't know; and that is the gist of this whole tion of pushing our industry Now bear in mind, the mere question of whether the cow is produc - ing enough milk to pay for her feed, is not the sole question from an economic standpoint, but it is an unavoidable question. There is no use considering the value of a dairy cow that is not producing more than enough milk to pay for her feed. You say there are other factors. There is the question from the standpoint of soil fertility; the question of manure, and the offspring those things have to do with it. That ithe dairy cow. That can just as well do for a beef cow, but that itirely another subject, and I am not discussing what you shall .ith your beef stock. I am talking about the dairy cow. It goes out saying that the dairy cow must make milk enough to pay more than for the feed she uses. Do you know — every practical er here — do you know that it pays to feed the profitable cow liberally, that the more profitable cow you have the more you will find shv • a profit on all the feed she can be given? That is the final test profitableness — her capacity and increasing returns upon the feed Let us look at that a moment; we don't want to talk any non - aena* here; we want to take the last view about this thing. What do your dairy papers tell you? What do your aricultural schools tell you? Of course lots of things friends, but once in a while they will tell you this: If you can feed corn and alfalfa you have a balanced ration, and they imply that is all you have to do to run a dairy- That if you can feed corn and alfalfa and thereby have a balanced ration it is all you have to do; yet you have only to turn over the page and you are advised to feed so, much concentrates according to the supply of milk. That does not mean at all that you can run your dairy on simply the roughage with which they say it can be done, but what they really mean finally to say is, that good producing cattle will pay you a profit on the grain that you buy and feed them, to say nothing of raising it, so that is what this question becomes in the large. Do you not see that the question is very much larger than what the produce of the farm is? It becomes the question of every man who has any surplus grain, more than is necessary for human con - sumption, and who is interested in this question of the quality of the dairy cow, that the only place where grain, that is not necessary for human consumption, can profitably go is to be fed to stock of some kind; the purpose — we are speaking of the dairy cow, of course, and of the preponderating importance in this respect. Every farmer who never saw a dairy cow is interested in the question of the dairy cow; </seg>
            <seg id="p086">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 85 Then comes this other great question, the question of the fertility of the land. A thing that we have adopted as the A E C of agricultural schools, you and I. This conviction that the future of this country, as to fertility, is dependent upon animal manure, we know. We have accepted it; and I come here today preaching from the old ground that you know just as well a* I do, but although I know that however well you may be convicted of the fact, the country at large is not convinced of it. We have paid the price in a thousand different spots in thi.s country for not having convictions on that subject. It has been known in New England, New York, North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas from time immemorial that without proper fertilization of your land it will run down in productiveness, and in spite of all your knowledge the land has gone down in productiveness. You and I know it isn't new, no matter how well we understand it ourselves, the coun - try at large has not adopted it as a working formulae. Now the question is whether to take and make a state like Ne - braska, with its resources of grain, hay and everything that you can take off the soil to market, learn that lesson itself as other states have, or whether it is going to have some foresight. Are people going to come in here and rob the state of Nebraska and let Nebraska pay the bill, or is Nebraska going to do something about it while it still has an abundance and an opportunity to do something itself? That is the question that is before us to settle. But this obligation is upon us, you and me, from the very fact we know what the facts are. And there is another question but it is a little more of a special question which applies to me, to Mr. Nelson, Mr. Marsh and all other people who are fully rearing up pure bred cattle. Do we understand fully that the only excuse for our being in the pure bred cattle hnirincnn the grade cow? Do we really understand that until the products of our best efforts and money and brains is embodied in the product of our pure bred cattle; until that product is distributed upon the grade cows of this country we have accomplished nothing? And up to that point but stopping short of that point, we are playing nothing but an interesting game. Do we realize that? Do we realize that the pure bred business hasn't any possible foundation, except a grade business, until the young bulls we raise, not the highest type, but the next and the next before it — at some stage of our development we develope a stage of quality in our product — are distributed among the herds of this country. Until then we have accomplished nothing and we might as well be out of the business. Do you realize that? The farmers do not realize that. tin my own state of Wisconsin there isn't 25*^ of the herds headed pure bred bulls. It is largely because the pure bred dairy men mselves are not holding that before them; they do not see that yet. &gt;m the high tests, beautiful shows, big records, big prices, as well all the clamor and excitement and interest that comes in the indus - of the pure bred business, behind it all lies the grade cow and ;il we have contributed to uplifting the grade cow, we have nothing. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 86 Let's don't forget that there is a philosophy in this pure bred business which must be observed and elevated before it makes the whole thing transparent. So you can see why I talk about the dairy unit being a matter of importance. I see the whole thing tied together. I see another thing before me in my mind's eye and ideal. . I see better farm buildings. E conditions in which cows shall be housed; I find more sanitary underlying the whole installation of the dairy farm. That is one I see. And again I see the question of greater cleanliness in the ng of the dairy products on the farm. Why do I expeect to talk the profitable cow; why about that? KWhen we are talking about the product of the cow and interpret - it into terms of butter fat which can be sold at a given price, why it that? Which so far as it goes is a measure of reduction of ts; it costs money to be clean. I am going to talk about that later because I am interested in the remarks of Mr. Hammond, but there are other reasons too. I am look - ing forward to the time when the average dairy farmer will be a clean individual. Why not? Tliere is no reason why he should not, it is not expensive; what you must have is a clean conception; it doesn't mean a great expense, big equipment, and expensive installation. It means a clean conception. I And then I am looking forward to the time when there will be care ide of the production; when there will be intelligent care; when i will be a real recognition of the fact that it doesn't make any rence how clean our milk is in the pail, a clean pail at that, it n't make any difference if the temperature is such, nor what foul eria it has in it, for it always has some, but the cleanest milk on h can, under certain temperature conditions, be the dirtiest. II am looking to the time when the farmer will look towards the lilding of his products and when he realizes what lies in the care - he has made it. I am looking for the millenium too in just the same kind of way but I expect the dairy situation to improve a little before the millen - ium. But I will tell you that I do expect progress towards it, and I think the history of the situation in the last ten years justifies us. I have a great hope towards the millenial condition. I When we stop to consider what the changes have been in the dairy iistry in the past ten years and compare it with the previous season fifty or thirty or even twenty years you see the situation is not bout hope. There are things that can be done because things have a done without half trying, and up to the present we haven't even f tried. But there is one thing I want to say to you and it is this t leads me to come up to these meetings, particularly where there young men, young fanners. The thing that is going to determine i subject as to the future of dairying is going to be two-fold. It is ng to be in the first place a deep respect on the part of the dairyman his calling. There isnt a whole lot of romance running through </seg>
            <seg id="p088">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 87 the daily life of the dairy farmer when you come to consider what he had to do and how he has to do it, but if he is short of money and other conditions that he has to struggle with, there isn't a whole lot of romance in the life of the dairy farmer. But let me say to you as a irreat foundation principle of the psychology of the human race, that just the minute you inject into a subject a factor of real interest, intellec - tual interest, just at that minute you begin to dignify and uplift that subject. Of the things that are recommended with reference to the dairy cow, don't overlook weighing your milk when you have never weighed it before; it puts the element of interest into dairying that the average dairyman never saw in it. When you go beyond that and assay the milk as to the butter fat it contains, you put into that propo - sition an interest that never was in it before. When you begin to breed intelligently so that you can take your cows of a given breed and esti - mate them in the light of their progeny and their progeny in the light of them, you inject into the dairy business an element that never was in it before. And by the time you carry that increase of business on and on through the intellectual factor, you will find when you get to the top of that business, you have the most intellectual, agricultural prob - that were ever brought before the human mind, and, I undertake to say, one of the most appalling intellectual problems that ever occupied the human mind in any direction. I am not exagerating at all when I say that I believe the dairy farm offers a larger field and makes a deeper impression on the mind than any one vocation I have known anything about, and I fully believe it. Now, gentlemen, that being the case, do you not see that the way Ijring up the respect for the business is to bring into it intellectual tors and that means only to do it right. I don't care whether it i trrade business or a pure bred business, the thing only needs to done properly to become an entrancing business in a larger way. There are other factors in carrying on a dairy business. Success is faith in the future, faith in the industry. It is there we find the difficulty. You take an old dairy state like Wisconsin that is instilled with the spirit of dairying and they never have their faith particularly shaken. They sometimes growl around but they go right on dairying because they don't have anything else to do, and this is what has made Wisconsin what it is. But you take a new state like Nebraska, which has been one of these prosperous commonwealths, one of the biggest grain sellers and money getters in the world and is moving along towards a great commonwealth, but which is not particularly a dairy state, and you will find that the farmer is disposed to scrutinize his dairy proposition carefully before he considers changing his mode of living, as he has to when he starts with the dairy proposition; it is a close proposition without any great sales or profits and it takes him a long time to make up his mind to be a dairy farmer. What brings him to that condition? There are two things. First, perhaps he observes, if he is going to live on land where they must have fertile land, that </seg>
            <seg id="p089">88 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION he is not going to rob his soil any more, and for that reason he may go into the dairy business. Or he may say, as Mr. Marsh was pointing out to me in a conver - sation we had, he may say through the fears of adversity when it comes, as it will come, that dairying is a resource and is the salvation from adversity. When you get in hard lines, or in deep water financially; when returns are low and everything is dragging a little instead of on the highway of success; that is when a man turns to dairying because it is a definite and certain means of getting ahead, not by leaps and bounds, but by careful and systematic upbuilding. Those two things are what bring men into the dairy business in a new country. And the next of those important things really means faith in the business, and that is the great big predominant thing; they don't ieel absolutely cer - tain that the business will go on. Perhaps they might if they were stu - dents of history and saw that every great country that developed did so through agriculture and through dairying and agriculture. They might say, "Yes, it is sure to go on," but it isn't right before them and they don't see it. Don't you see that the time has come when the dairy - man is so tied up over every factor in the commercial situation that he can't get loose, so that these great middle men, great centralized people, great milk producers, distributors in the city, and manufacturers of milk powders, cheese and whatever it is, become a factor upon which the dairy business is going to be dependent? They are dependent on the dairy business and the dairy business upon them. And what does it mean? We have just been agitating that subject in the dairy council and various circles. It means that not only the dairyman — -no matter what his grade, his quality or what the care of his milk is, is dependent upon certain other important factors to maintain the advantage he gets out of them. In other words the transportation companies and handlers have all got to be related in their own methods of care of the milk in order not to ruin anything the dairyman can do. As a matter of fact it is the middle-men, who lead the way with reference to dairy pro - ducts, but it is all united together. There is no such thing as a separ - ate interest in this business, but even that is only collateral to the situation. Here is the question: What is the future market for the dairy product? Now, gentlemen, there is the great big question before us: Is the consumption of dairy products what it ought to be today? Well, you know perfectly well it is not. You know perfectly well there is no rule in regard to the consumption of milk products today. There ought to be. Who is going to make that market bigger? Will that market make itself bigger? Who is going to make it so? We maintain that the business interests that stand between the cow and the public must in some way or other make the market for the dairy cow's product, that will give the man who milks that cow confidence in the future. We maintain that the market is the especial business of the middle-man, and until he busies himself with making a market for the dairy pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p090">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 89 ducts, there is no security in the dairy business, and that, I don't hesi - tate to say. There is no security in the dairy business until the markets are on a better stabilized basis. Now why should we feel justified in trying to stimulate the market In the first place from the standpoint of the human race, it is the beat food there is in many respects. Because from the standpoint of special nutritive needs, it, and it alone, fills the bill for human consumption. The second reason is this: at present, even under the present ad - vene conditions it is the cheapest food of its character that is known. Now those two reasons are strictly in the interests of the public, and not in the interests of the cow men, or dairymen, or butter-man, or middle-men, but in the interest of the public, and for the two reasons, that it is the best food, and the cheapest food, and the market ought to be stimulated. The question is: Are you going to help stimulate it or are you not? And the second reason is this, I have hinted at it before: The future of the agriculture in the United States is tied up, absolutely tied up, to the question of animal husbandry. I wont just say dairy cows. But I do say that the great agricultural supremacy that the United States holds today, can only be maintained by a broad and comprehensive policy of animal husbandry. Now that becomes a question of individuals. The dairy farmer is not responsible for the country; none of us are; but it becomes a great question of national policy and there is what I want to call your attention to, particularly Is the national policy of this country thoroughly and intelligently directed towards the improvement of animal husbandry? I will answer, in certain directions, yes, it is. So far as its agri - cultural department and the department of animal husbandry is con - cerned it is intensely directed towards the uplift and welfare of animal husbandry. But so far as its legislation is concerned, so far as its cre - ation of public opinion is concerned, I can't say it is hostile, but it is very different. I don't believe that the administrative nor legislative function of this country in any large way is keenly aware of the fact that animal husbandry underlies our national prosperity. I dont be - lieve they see it, but so clear is it to those who think they know about it, that it seems almost beyond argument, and yet, I didn't come here to talk politics; I am not talking politics. I think in my mind, theo - retically, in my general train of thought I would say that perhaps I am a free-trader. At any rate I have a comparatively low tariff advo - cate, as far as my views are concerned I haven't mixed up in it. But this question of the relation of the dairy products to the tariff must be seen clearly. It is all right to say a commodity must be produced in the world where it can be produced the cheapest; that is the economic law of the world; I will accept that for the time being if you like. But I want to say that this question of dairy products is absolutely a differ - ent question from that of any other known commodity; even our agri- </seg>
            <seg id="p091">90 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Eroducts such as grain, cotton and tobacco are protected and ave a certain commercial value with reference to this ques - when it comes to the question of dairy products it becomes ! separate question, why not? Because the farmer needs to ed, the dairyman needs o be; and because the country needs therefore as far as the question of the tariff and dairy pro - two different questions, it spells disaster. tl will not undertake to say what the tariff should be, but 1 will it ought not to be regarded on the basis of mere commercial com - tion with some other country, but from the standpoint of national ssity of distributing the stuff, and whatever is necessary to make raising of live stock, particularly dairy cattle, attractive and profit - to the poor man who is starting out in life; that is the thing which te long run must be considered to contribute to national prosperity, i no political question at all. It is a question of conservation, and question of the salvation of this country. (Laughter) SI don't want to be misunderstood in this at all; I haven't the ghtest political aspirations, but I want to call your attenton to the fact that this question of the tariff and dairy products is, in a sense. by itself and absolutely must be so considered, don't let your minds be deceived. The other thing is, that with all the things I have said, it would seem as though it was a self-evident proposition that this country must stand behind the dairy business; it must appreciate the dairy - business in the last analysis for its solution, and we would think any - body to whom it was pointed out would know it was so. You know public opinion is behind all of this and it is not doing anything about it, because it doesn't care; it is too far away. All public opinion cares about is the price of butter and milk. So great is that fact, so much is that true that whenever we come at the public with any of our great economic issues in which we are concerned we are made to stand before the public simply on the basis of commercial rivals trying to save our trade. So it comes to pass that the dairy business is the subject of two very serious parables. One is the competition with a perfectly legitimate food product and that is margarine, oleo they call it now. That is competition with it on a basis of misrepresentation. The dairy - business and the dairy world have no right to object to straight busi - ness competition with margarine. There is no ground upon which to have any difference with margarine except one, and that you know per fectly well. The effort in all margarine business is to sell it for butter. and that you know, and as long as that is sold, it is a war to the knife and should be so with every dairyman as long as it is, if there is any way to distinguish margarine from butter. So the ultimate consumer should know what he is getting; that would solve the problem. Who is the ultimate consumer? Why the purchaser, the department will tell you; and the people on that side of the fence will tell you it is the woman that goes to the grocery store and buys a pound package, sealed and labeled Margarine, and as long as she knows what she is buying the argument is safe. That is the argument from Washington, from </seg>
            <seg id="p092">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 91 Chicago and elsewhere, but that isn't true. The ultimate consumer is the individual that gets a piece of butter put on his plate wherever he happens to be and the question then becomes: Is there any way for that individual to tell whether he is eating butter or Margarine? Until there is a way, this fight has got to go on because there is where the substitution occurs. It isn't in the kitchen, grocery store or fac - tory, it occurs when it is put on the plate. It sounds like bigotry to say that Margarine must not be colored. The Margarine people — and I had a long conference the other day with them, a long, pleasant, but absolutely divergent conference — the Margarine people say it must be colored, they can't sell it otherwise. We say it cant be colored be - cause if you do, it is sold for butter, and that is the only situation today, and the only thing worth talking about. Nevertheless, the public does not look at that from the standpoint of national salvation at all; it looks at it from the standpoint of competition between butter and Margarine, between the dairyman and the packer. It thinks it is enough to have a scrap between the dairyman and the packer, when it is a question that is undermining the dairy industry by making it compete unfairly in the market and thereby undermining national pros - perity. Now the question is just as big as that, gentlemen. Legislation and public opinion haven't touched the essence of that question and it remains for you in every possible way to exert your influence and see that public opinion is straightened out on that subject. It is not competition. It is the question of the unfair burden put upon the dairy industry by misrepresentation. And that is the whole thing. Then there is one other thing I want to talk to you about very seriously indeed. It is a very great menace, a menace that has never had a high motive. It was suggested to you this morning by Mr. Ham - mond, and I want to say that the burden and the great struggle be - fore the dairy industry today is the meeting up with the health ques - tion. This is one question that I feel abundantly competent to discuss; I have been in and out over the states in the health department my - self. I am not going to discuss it very much except to say this; That the agitation with reference to milk and milk products from the health standpiont by health officers and by agitators of one kind and another, and women's clubs and mothers rearing infants and all that, has been marshalled into a great big influence which, on the whole, has tended to check and restrain the dairy industry. Now, gentlemen, Mr. Hammond indicated that to me this morning and the logic of what he said is true. He said the public is going to demand clean milk at a safe price. He cited tuberculosis and typhoid and discussed one phase and another, and he is right about it. That is, where the public is trained it is moving toward a closer scrutiny as to quality of milk with reference to its safety. Their interest in it as to chemical quality and exact food value is a minor matter. What the public is concerned about is its safety. Now it goes without saying that in a great big issue where a very large percentage of the agitators whose motives are absolutely good, but where a very large percentage of the agitators do rot know one thing </seg>
            <seg id="p093">92 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION about the subject except the little bit of tiny knowledge they have on the subject of its bacteria, the agitation is naturally going to be in the nature of a crusade against the industry, and to a large extent that is true. Now as deeply as I realize the importance of the health aspect of this milk question; feeling as deeply as I do that ultimately it must be solved on a basis that is sound and in the interest of the public: I still say that it is of the utmost importance that the issues incident to the milk industry shall not be imposed upon from without. The ordinary health officer's regulations tend to be oppressive because it is not intelligent. The average attack that is made upon the milk situation is, as a rule, exaggerated because it is, as a rule, not com - prehensive. Yet that is the kind of regulation there will be unless the lag illation comes from within and that is the thing I want to say to you on this subject. The thing for us to do inside of the dairy industry is to take hold of this question of safety and of quality from within our own ranks and see to it that it is not necessary to have rules im - posed upon us that are impossible to carry out and, if carried out off - hand by legislative enactments, as Mr. Hammond suggested today, would put the dairy business right out of business. I don't say that Mr. Hammond means that, but after all, if they go to enacting right off on the whole subject the way it is conceived it might be done, it would absolutely terminate the whole dairy business. The thing to do is to go at it from within. Now with all of this lot of things I have said, what is the remedy? The remedy is organization in the milk business more than any other business in the world. It doesn't mean moving against a common enemy. If there is any one thing organization tends to do, it tends to self-government. That is what I look to it for. tin the second place, we must do something with our markets in r to get the people of this country to realize that they should be g from four to ton times as much milk products in order to fully ify their physiological needs, and economic needs. From four to times as much should be used as is used today in order to fully ,fy the situation. KAnd then I want to say to you this whole question becomes a mat - of education ; it is a matter of holding out information on the part &gt;very man who does know and the man who doesn't know as to it is the way out. IYou know what the agricultural stations have done, and yet there •s a point beyond where they cannot go, there is an abyss that they lot cross. Now take our county agent; he attempts to cross that is; he attempts to teach them of agricultural products and he goes t out and shows the farmer what to do. He is the man that is ing the trick. You have no idea of the difference it makes and responsiveness of the average farmer who wants to know what to I was talking to a gentleman this morning and lie said "How would go about such things to get one of these meetings. They tell us he schools that if you will send your milk in to us we will assay </seg>

            <seg id="p095">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 93 it and tell you how much butter fat is in it, but the truth is, w don't want to know and -we don't know how." I said, "Are you trying to tell your neighbor how to get it, are you standing behind your com - munity trying to get the county agent that actually takes he farmer by the hand and says, come on, this is the way to do it?" In the vast majority of caaes that is all that is necessary. Are you doing it? Not unly are you not doing- it; I am not doing it; nobody is doing it The middle-man is the man between the actual producer and the market, that means butter people, cheese people, pure bred stock people, and feed people; everybody is involved in this thing. First we must take hold of the subject and each and every one of those things must be focused and directed to some organization of its own, or directed to some other organization which is directing its efforts in this line. It is the only solution. I have come here because I am imbued with the importance of the situation; because I know it is as great a question as will ever come before this country. Increase the history of oar ation is just the question we are talking about today, and I hope my ntensity will lead you to feel there is something to be intense about. I thank you. tThe President : Ladies and Gentlemen : Surely everybody appre - ■ the speech we have just listened to, and we all agree with Doctor ill when he says he is thoroughly imbued with his subject. If he succeeded in imbuing the few people in this room with the intensity olds towards the subject, I feel that he is well repaid for this long out here to Nebraska. I know he will think he has made the right t for Nebraska if he has converted a few people. »The President: The next number on our program is a paper on lucational Dairy Exhibit and Demonstration, Nebraska State Fair" Professor J. H. Frandsen, of the Dairy Division of the University t:e Farm at Lincoln. I see the professor has arrived and we will have paper now. Professor Frandsen: I hope we can have another talk from Doctor Favil; we have tried for three years to get Mr. Marshall out at these meetings. I promised your secretary last fall when he was so much interested in the dairy exhibit that I would write a paper for them, Sut I didn't promise that I would deliver it and I am not going to do it. I am going to hand it to your secretary so it can be incorporated in your report and I am going to leave the little time we have now for the next speaker, with the hope that someway, somehow we may pursuade Doctor Favill to give us another short address. Professor Frandsen then handed his paper to the secretary. The State Fair, just closed, contained many new and interesting . xhibits of great educational value. Among these were the several ■dairy exhibits. In the dairy building were exhibits of peculiar inter - «tf to both dairymen and to those not directly connected with the dairy </seg>
            <seg id="p096">94 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION industry. These exhibits were put on by the Nebraska Dairy Asso - ciation in co-operation with the Dairy Department of the University ana the U. S. Dairy Division. B! exhibit consisted of a life size figure of a cow before a smiling &gt;f Uncle Sam who stands ready to milk Nebraska's champion he statute is made of butter and is the work of Mr. J. E. Wai Lincoln. The group is very appropriately labeled, "Dairying — Prosperity." Large crowds stopped to admire the excellent nship and no doubt carried away with them a keener apprecia - the peace and prosperity which dairying affords. »Near this exhibit was a model farm milk house with all the nece&gt; - equipment including a water heater, gasoline engine, a pump, cool - tank, tester, and other apparatus needed. The primary purpose of this exihbit was to show how milk and cream should be cared for on the farm. The cooling tank used in the demonstrations was the official tank adopted by the American Creamery Association. The cooling tank was connected with the pump and operated a. - under ordinary farm conditions. Several demonstrations were given daily. In these demonstrations the milk, was skimmed and the cream placed in the tank to cool. The facility with which cream could be handled with the aid of this cooling tank was fully appreciated by many interested dairymen from all parts of the state while many hou&gt;. wives admired the unique refrigerator compartment which goes wit I the cooling tank. Another feature which attracted considerable attention wa frequent demonstrations of the use of the Babcock test. I The value and importance of the Babcock test was further illu* - sd by a cow testing demonstration. This demonstration, conducted he University Dairy Department and the U. S. Dairy Division, wa. - large of Mr. C. L. Burlington of Washington, D. C. tThe cow testing demonstration was particularly instructive. There ! five cows in the demonstration. Two of these were special dairy ials. The other three were ordinary cows taken from dairies n. vicinity. These cows were charged with the feed consumed and ited with the butter fat produced. The profit or loss was shown day. iThe two special dairy animals showed good profits over the cost eed. ' Of the other three animals, one, a grade Holstein, showed a profit, while the other two were kept at an actual loss. The three lary cows were such as may be found on many dairy farms but he three there was only one worth keeping. This is probably as ' a demonstration as can be given of the value of the cow testine nation. Ehe importance of keeping up with the times was further shown im hibit representing one of Nebraska's successful dairymen. The sful dairyman is shown with his "strings" on rvery factor which </seg>
            <seg id="p097">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 95 makes for success. This exhibit was placed near the east door of the dairy building and caught the attention of many Fair visitors. The exhibits in the dairy building were planned more particularly tar the fanners. A second exhibit, which appealed to those who are not directly connected with dairying was shown in the University build- IThe object of this exhibit was primarily for those who are not liar with the dairy business. One very interesting feature of this Kwas the comparison of milk with other foods. The cost of different foods equal in food value to one quart of milk were shown. Of these, fifteen were more expensive and five were cheaper than milk. The importance of clean milk was shown in a very unique display which showed samples of pure and impure milk and the condi - tions under which each was produced. To show the importance of Nebraska as a dairy state, several desirable rations for dairy cows, made up from crops grown in this state, were on display. I Other features of this exhibit which were worthy of note were displays which were of particular interest to prospective students, value of a dairy education and the educational work done by the ?ge of Agriculture were emphasized. It is to be hoped that those who visited the Fair took the time idy these exhibits carefully as they contained many important ideas which, if put into practice would add materially to the pleasure and nrofits accruing from the pursuit of agriculture. State Farm, Thursday, January 20, 1916, 2:00 p. m r Doctor Favill was thereupon called for and spoke as follows: President, Ladies and Gentlemen: »I am not very easily embarrassed, but I haven't the slightest idea t to talk about. I could talk all night on a special subject, but now flow of ideas don't come. tlf there is anything anyone wants me to talk about, will you indi - what it is, and I will be glad to do it. I have just been enjoying j i-onversation with Professor Haecker who says he was up to my farm a couple of weeks ago and he says it is all right. Of course, he is -supposed to agree with everything I was doing there, with the excep - tion of the hogs and he raised the question which we have been discus - sing here together. I am not going to talk about it, but I would like to start a discussion on it. This is the question : Is it profitable to raise hogs on a dairy farm, and if so, under what conditions, and how can they be raised in order to make any profit? Now you realize how difficult farm accounting is. It is very easy about keeping your accounts on the farm and distributing your cost &gt;f production, yet you know perfectly well that in the most elaborate system of bookkeeping, you will find inaccuracies in a large measure when you come down to the finest details of cost. So when Professor </seg>
            <seg id="p098">96 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Haecker says he doesn't think I am feeding the hogs at cost, I can't say he is not right. It is a very difficult question to discuss and if there is any man here who has clearer views about that and really knows about what it coats to raise hogs to the point of marketing, I want to hear of his experience. My own belief is that hogs belong on the dairy farm, and the reason for it is simply plain enough; we believe there is a place for them, and a place to puc our skimmed milk to advantage. Now Professor Haecker says that with your dairy breed it, I believe you can better feed that to your pure bred Holstein le than to hogs for marketing, — assuming that I am raising hop - market and not pedigreed hogs. He may be right. I am not sure he isn't, but it has always seemed to me that here was a large me of skimmed milk which we could perhaps get a better market by feeding it to the hogs in connection with their pasture than other way. If the skimmed milk was necessary to the growth of those cattle after a certain age I wouldn't say that. For example; if after the cattle calve and the calves were turned into the pasture — I always pas - ture the calves in the summer in a special way — I don't depend on the pasture altogether, I feed them. If I didn't think the calves would do as well on corn, silage and hay as upon milk I would feed them on milk, but you can see that we get the maximum growth from those calves by feeding them in that way. Corn, hay and silage is a cheaper feed on the whole than milk, and we feed this milk to better advantage to these hogs even for market hogs. We mix with it a little grain a. - roughage which they get once a day with their alfalfa, peas, oats and pasture, and that is our plan to get all the growth we can, as long as they grow they have grain, and pasture, turning them from lot to lot and feeding along with the grain, skimmed milk at the same time. There is the question, I may be wrong; it may be better to put that into these growing bull calves. I have had men come to my place tsay they never have seen bigger calves, or heifers, and Mr. Haecker say that he never saw better ones on the whole, yet they were raised upon milk after what I call the proper milk period along it the first of June. KThat being the case, the question for me and for you — I don't 7 any more about it than you do, except that I am talking about it — juestion is, what is the most profitable thing to do with that skimmed ? Had it better go into the hogs or the calves? I Well, at present we think it had better go into the hogs. We keep reful account of the hogs and the grain we feed them and, on the e, our impression is that we had better feed the skimmed milk he hogs. We are not just accepting the ordinary statements we in dairy parpers— 'the dairy papers all say that a dairy farm should y hogs — but we are trying to work out that problem for ourselves ee which is correct. On the whole, we are inclined to think that pasture of the right kind, and with the right feed and skimmed , it is better to feed it to the hogs than to have to keep it for our </seg>
            <seg id="p099">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 97 calves long after they get to a pretty full grown age. Perhaps we will know more about that later. I would like to have Professor Haecker discuss this thing because we have been talking about it. He has a point of view that may be entrely correct and I may be all wrong and I really would like to have him participate in this discussion to let you see what his point of view is, because it is very important to everyone of us. I have an acquaintance who has been in the dairy business for fifty years and he said the other day, "I hope you will feed your hogs carefully and keep an account of them because I have been feeding all my life and I don't know whether it is best or not." I thought of it but you can't tell unless you keep an account and I don't know whether you can tell even after you keep account. It is a very close question and we don't want to be feeding hogs without profit any more than we want to be feeding breeder cows without profit so I pass it up to Professor Haecker. Professor Haecker: I don't know any more about it than you do. Doctor Favill is very modest in describing his farm, on which he has an experiment station. It is a very fine line of experimentation that he has out there. I took an extra trip out there because I had heard that I couldn't buy any cattle at his farm, but I took a trip to see his swine department. I had a deep interest in that work. I always have had, and I believe the hog should go with the dairy farm, but it is a serious question with men who are carrying on the kind of a dairy farm and breeding the kind of dairy cattle that Doctor Favill speaks about, and the question is, are they turning to the best advantage and to that end their energies and part of their land and crops? I have seen some wonderful work done in giving skimmed milk to heifers and even ■teem. I remember years ago at the Exposition,, the Trans-Mississippi Exposition held at Omaha, of eight steers grown on skimmed milk largely as a basis; they depended largely on that milk for their protein. There are very few foods that have as much digestible percentage of protein as skimmed milk and these steers had a wonderful growth. I Mr. Severe of Palmyra: May I ask a question? Isn't it possible ver-do the amount; isn't there danger of creating the scoures in ;s by feeding them too much? Professor Haecker: Oh, not small calves. Mr. Severe: Well, in large ones? I Professor Haecker: No, I fed as high as fourteen quarts a day bull calf six or seven months old and have had him do well. He 't use so much of another ration but made a marvelous growth and lendid development. I Here on this farm where Doctor Favill is producing such wonder - y fine stock I was impressed with the heifers; ne had two magnifi - ; bulls at the head of that herd weighing 2500 pounds apiece; he a herd of sixty cows whose average weekly performance was bet - than twenty pounds. I remember we found one herd whose average fourteen pounds which they thought big, but here was a herd lixty cows with an average better than twenty pounds. By mating </seg>
            <seg id="p100">098 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION thaw splendid bulls back for generations he has produced some BMC* nificent heifers. I believe they could still be made better by continuing to feed them the skimmed milk which he was giving the hogs. Now I don't mean to criticize your method, doctoi. but I think your equipment is a little better and beyond the average man. Why, he hae oak finish in his hog pens, that is a fact. Inside of that barn all of the pens and equipment has hard wood oak. I saw panels there that were very fine. He has a magnificent lot of swine and a wonderful growth he is getting on these young pigs. It is wonderful and I can hardly see how he can make it, but I know he can, and I would pay $300 apiece for the whole bunch but he won't sell them — they are worth more. You could make a good foundation with them for they have it in them, so he is going to throw some light on the subject, and it is light we are after, not facts and fiction; we hav^ the fiction and we will have more. Here is another thought and we can talk of that a little viciously; it is this: When we get a lot of fine hogs ready for market four or five men can get their heads together and think that pork ought to go down and just as quickly as it goes down the fellows get scared and ship their hogs right in to market &lt;ind down she goes, and then the price goes up again. We have been playing a ragged game all over this country, it is a pretty tough one to me. We have to raise hogs in Nebraska, we have cheap alfalfa and cheap corn; we ship our corn in four directions and we have alfaila pastures where we can run all year; in some sections we have the intensified country and some I went through, it seems, could be devoted largely to the swine business. Down at Fort Atkinson the buyers pay a premium on pigs for sausage and I was delighted to have the chance to have that sausage served to me, but you go to the stove and it is always thirty cents a pound. It isn't a question of whether you have the money but it is a question of whether they have tho sausage left, for you can make these pigs into that fine sausage. t Doctor Favill: Professor Haecker's statemenL is good, but it ds as though it could be misunderstood. There is no herd of sixty making twenty pounds in my barn or any other in the world. ■ have made twenty pounds under their test and they are twenty d cows as far as that is concerned, but as far M going right along continuing to make twenty pounds, don't misunderstand him. I The second thing is this, and this is really the fact; I am trying take up my mind that the professor isn't right on that hog ques - and the reason is this, I don't want to be a one idea farmer; I ; want to abide by the noton all over the country of having this a crop country, and for that reason I am trying to prove to myself I can keep hogs in spite of the fact that I have pure bred heifers rhich to feed the milk. I know that the country that doesn't good horses is running to dairy cows and is suffering because it one idea country, so for that reason I keep the best percheron ion, not only for my own use but for others. I am losing money </seg>
            <seg id="p101">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 099 if I break even on the horse business, and that is a fact about the hog business. I am struggling to prove that Professor Haecker isn't right. B Question from the Audience: You didn't tell us what time you ped feeding milk to the calves. I Doctor Favill : In October, November and December, they keep ng on until April and those calves are turned out in the pasture ront of the house where they are all under observation all the and they are fed three times a day in special stanchions or forms separate themselves. They are carried along with milk during and August, then the most of them that come before February be through being fed milk by that time. They won't get the milk ' the middle of June so that will be the general rule about it. Question: So that will be about six months? Doctor Favill: Yes sir. Mr. Noble: What about feeding the dairy cows that milk? " Doctor Favill: I never tried it, I dont know 1hat it is of value or not. You can figure it out as compared with other feed, but my impression is that it is rather expensive to feed to dairy cows more than most any other kind of protein. In testing, the rule is that cows iriving milk under official test shall not be fed milk. Question: Why is that? I Professor Haecker: We want the cows to consume the roughage le farm. The time may come in the human being when they will nd on this skimmed milk, and it is impracticable. I A Member: I want to relate one instance on my farm that harp - d this year, and I will leave it to you to solve. I raised some colts year and I raised one colt that took the premium at our festival this . The mother of that colt is turned out and if she can get to milk n't know how much she will drink. There is a barrel close to the where we put our separator milk and every time that mare could loose she would go there and drink milk, and her colt was the I have raised on the farm. I give that to you as an instance but n't know whether there is anything in it or not. If it is a good !. you had better feed some of this separator milk to some of stock. I Professor Frandsen: I think Doctor Favill brought out one point ought to have careful consideration. We want to test for dairy - all we can, but in doing that we must be sure we are going at it t. Doctor Favill says he favors general dairying and farming; ink that will be a success in this state. Now in New York we find 1 figures gathered by Doctor Warren that less than ff| of the essful dairymen are specialists. The great bulk are those who are le dairy business and also. in the hog business as that gives some crops, but less than f% are in the special dairying business, and ink from figures in this state that less than 3 r 4 of our successful lers are in the dairy business alone.

            <seg id="p102">100 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION to sell an occasional animal, but where you raise some hogs and some crops. I believe we must work out our salvation somewhat along line and not let our enthusiasm carry us to one high specialized of dairying. I Mr. Imrie: It seems to me that the wrong impression has gone I hardly think that Professor Haecker intended to say that there d be a loss on the average farm throughout Nebraska or any r state by feeding skimmed milk to pigs. It is simply in special s that he was arguing, because I know that Professor Haecker n't believe it is injurious to the ordinary farmer. tMr. Little: That is a very important question — the utilization of by-products of the dairy. But in which question lies the success he industry all along. Now skimmed milk we know is absolutely best feed we have for practically all young farm animals, but we go to excess- with it. Doctor Henry has worked this out from all experimental data he could find and the doctor's conclusion is that, young pigs not over four months old it is not profitable to feed ' three pounds of skimmed milk per day, and that greater gains be made by adding grain and feeding it with skimmed milk to nee the ration. A number of years ago here at the station it became our ambition to develop Holstein bulls to weigh 1200 pounds at one year old and we tried this by feeding an excess of skimmed milk and on the other hand by feeding with what grain they would consume, and we found that up to twelve months of age by giving them all they would drink of skimmed milk we could get 1200 pounds in weight and our ideal in development, but from twelve months up to eighteen months we got the greatest growth — that is the largest increase in weight — by cutting down on the skimmed milk in the ration and increasing the other grain feeds. We have fed the calf entirely on skimmed milk and common roughage until the first twelve months and by doing that we can obtain practically 1000 pounds, whereas practically a ful: brother of this animal, fed a fairly generous portion of grain together with skimmed milk, attained the 1200 pounds easily. So in the case of skimmed milk we must use judgment in utilizing it, of course, and not go to excess in the matter but keep it in its proper place and by using it to the boat advantage in that way, we may be able to balance the ration according to the need of the animal. </seg>

His father, a beloved physician, had graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1847. After graduating in Arts from the University of Wisconsin in 1880, and in Medicine from Rush Medical College in IMS, Dr. Favill began practice at home with his father. Following the latter's death, which occurred in a few months, he married Miss Susan Cleveland Pratt in 1885 and continued to practice in Madison until 1894. During this time he served as Professor of Medical Juris - prudence in the University. Called to the faculty of Rush Medical Col - lege as Adjutant Professor of Medicine and to the Policlinic as Pro - fessor of Medicine, he moved to Chicago and soon was engaged in a very active practice. He was made Ingals Professor of Preventive Medi - cine and Therapeutics in 1898 and Professor of Clinical Medicine in 1906 at Rush College. In 1908 he became a First Lieutenant in the U. S. A. Medical Reserve Corps. He was consulting physician to the Augustus Hospital , and attending physician at Passavant Memorial and St. Luke's Hospitals. The St. Luke's Medical Board elected him President in 1916. He was a member of the University Club, City Club, Chicago Medical Society (of which he was president in 1907-8), Society of Internal Medi - cine, Institute of Medicine, Illinois State Medical Society, a Fellow of the American Medical Association, etc. He was the only man without commercial connections in Chicago ever elected to the Commercial Club.

            <seg id="p105">102 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Ehe President: The next number, while it is the last, is not the We have been trying to pet something different and new and to preach to the dairymen from another angle entirely, so we asked a banker how he regards the dairyman as a credit risk &amp; banker's viewpoint. We will now listen to Mr. Thomas Murray. ent of the State Banker's Association, of Dunbar, on this topic. Mr. Murray read his paper as follows: Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association : Kin the first place, as president of the Nebraska Banker's Associa- I wish to extend to you hearty greetings from the bankers of state as you are assembled here today in your annual convention. &gt;r such favorable auspices, being blessed with peace, plenty and )iness, within our borders and good prices for all your products. IWhen we take into consideration the fact that so many nation. - now engaged in bloody warfare, starving and suffering on every I, truly we can say as a people, the Lord has blessed us beyond onception. I No doubt it is unusual for you to have a banker on your program especially one who never owned a cow, or even milked one. But rder to gain your confidence, I want to assure you that I am one )ur best consumers. I When your most able secretary, Mr. McGinns, asked me to address on the subject of "The Dairymen as a Credit Risk from a Banker's vpoint," of course I tried to recommend to him a banker who wa. - able speaker, and at least knew something about cows, but he Id not 'permit any substitute, having the idea that my office might weight to your program — nothing to it. I am sure the bankers of the state will be very glad indeed, when they find out, that at least there is one great organization in our com - monwealth that wishes to know what the bankers think of them as a credit risk. This is a splendid subject and one in which I believe every banker will answer in the same way. "There is no better risk." Nebraska, as we all know, is solely an agriculture state, no coal, oil, or minerals having been discovered within its borders, consequently the energies of the greater part of our citizens are exerted along the lines of scientific fanning, trying to make two blades of grass grow, where one did before. Doubtless a good many of you here today are aware of the fact that the Nebraska Banker's Association has an agricultural committee. And through the efforts of this committee $21,000.00 has already been pledged by the railroads, jobbers, stock yards and banks principally of Omaha to help pay for the demonstrators in the different counties of the state. And the first assessment of twenty per cent of this sub - scription is now being collected and will be turned over to the Agricul - tural Development Commission of Nebraska. This only goes to show that the bankers of the state are acquaint - ing themselves with the leading and most important business within our borders, namely, that of agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p106">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 103 K Perhaps it would not be out of place to define the words Credit , as there is so much credit on every hand, and so many risks in. It is unfortunate that this word credit has a number of different meanings. The primary meaning of credit is worthy of trust, and when applied to money matters or finance, it means worthy of financial trust, that is, financial responsibility, or in other words the ability and willingness of a man to pay back money which he wants to borrow. This is the sense in which the word is used in banks, and in busi - ness over the country generally, and especially in the great corn belt. It is different in New York where money is borrowed on stocks and bonds. There they look at the stock or bond and not at the man. Eastern bankers tell us that often they never look at the man who presents the stock but simply at the worth of the stock on the market. But in business generally the banker looks at the man, and he perhaps knows more about the man than the man knows about himself. He knows whether he is honest or not, whether he is capable, whether if honest he is thrifty, and whether if he is thrifty, he is willing to meet his obligations promptly. Kin this case the man is the main consideration. Bankers will often to men who don't have much except character. We well remem - the sensation Mr. J. P. Morgan made before a Congressional com - ee when he said he had once loaned a million dollars solely on aracter. »N'o doubt he knew his man. And that is true in a small way of v banker in the country. It is to the interest of the entire coun - that this kind of credit should be increased. Bat it is evident that an be increased only by increasing the ability and the willingness of men to pay their debts, or, in other words, their financial respon - sibility. This can be done only by better farming, better buying, bet - ter selling- and perhaps more honesty. Ilt is this sort of credit in which we are mainly interested, to enable lers and dairymen to increase their financial responsibility — or it risk. I Again on the other hand, there is a risk in everything. But to my I the risk the banker takes in advancing money to promote the ,■ business is about the minimum. True, cows take the foot and th disease, and whole herds of them have been destroyed in the last years, in some of our states, but in cases of an epidemic of this the government and state have paid for the loss, so it reduces the to a minimum. The interests of the state bankers is to promote every legitimate industry for the up-building and progress of our great state. A great many people in all avocations of life imagine that the banker is a cold blooded, aristocratic, stuck up creature, one who possesses no feelings toward humanity, but simply in a class by themselves. One thing I want to impress upon your minds today is that after aving spent twenty-five years of my life in the banking business in a </seg>
            <seg id="p107">104 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION small country town in this commonwealth, and gotten acquainted with so many of them, I have come to the conclusion that you will not find a better bunch of business men anywhere than are found behind the bank counters of Nebraska. The whole trouble seems to be that most people have not become acquainted with their bankers. Don't be afraid to tell your bankers all about your business; the more they find out about your business, the more help they can give you at a time you might need it. I would suggest this motto: "Get acquainted with your banker you might like him." KThe spirit of community interest that which makes for the building ity and country rings in every word of this simple little sentence. ;s and methods have changed more in the last fifty years, we are than in all previous history. KWe are living in an age that has no comparison with the dark ages ! by. Perhaps the fault lies with the bankers, in that case we want nd it out. t There are over one thousand bankers in Nebraska and every man tt to be a power in his community. Can you imagine the tremendous ence these men would have upon our agricultural and commercial if each man became acquainted with his neighbor, knew him better helped that neighbor become more efficient. That's what we arc ig to do today. Gentlemen, on looking up the statistics of your business, I find that you are connected with one of the largest productive industries of our state, that you produced last year no less than sixty million pounds of butter worth twenty million dollars besides the milk, cheese and other products in all amounting to forty million dollars. iThe great advantages of dairying are that the products are always emand at good prices, that the product is condensed and removes &gt; the farm a very small quantity of fertility, the product is econom in delivery and being a perishable product, must be sold often, h means that the cash is realized a few days after it is produced, fact that dairying furnishes a steady income throughout the year % with the insurance mentioned commends it to us as a splendid it risk. I Your business is one of the most legitimate in our state, and if bankers can help you in any way to double this business, do not fraid to let your wants be known. t Wisconsin, I believe, is the leading dairy state in the Union. Her lal sales amount to one hundred million dollars. A banker of that &gt; made the remark not long ago, that in thirty years' experience certain community, he had never known a failure to occur among i sturdy farmers who had started out with the dairy cow, and kept I to the business of dairying. Ilt isn't any wonder that Wisconsin ranks first in all the states of Union in the percentage of farms occupied and operated by their &gt;rs because men have not failed in their farm practices, and their </seg>
            <seg id="p108">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 105 profits have been such as to induce them to remain on the farm. Statistics do not tell us directly and accurately how rapdly the soil fertility is being depleted and lost in those sections, where wheat or corn is king, but observations convince us that no state can rank ahead of Wisconsin in the manner of maintaining soil fertility and making the agriculture as profitable for the son as for the father. I Wisconsin ranks first in the number of silos that have been erected. lere is any one thing which indicates that a man knows how to feed stock, how to utilize his farm crops in the most economical way ible, how to maintain the health and prolong the life of his herd, to build up and improve his soil — which indicates in short that in is a real dairyman — it is the silo on the farm. I That Wisconsin ranks first in the number of silos is only another of saying that Wisconsin is adopting a most permanent type of ting which entitles her to the front rank as a dairy state. I have been informed that the bankers of Illinois, which is conceded to be one of the great dairy states in the Union, have gone into the silo business in this way. They have obtained the agencies for the sale of silos and will sell them as cheap as any regular dealer, on one year's time without interest in order that their dairy business might be increased, perhaps the bankers of this state might do likewise. I find on looking back over the last twenty-five years that our most successful farmers have been men that gave a great part of their attention to dairying. I have in mind now one who owned 160 acres of land in the early nineties in Otoe county, who has milked all the time from fifteen to twenty-five head of cows and made a success of it beyond all question, for today he owns eight hundred acres of Otoe county land all paid for, and has just purchased 160 acres more, and land in our county today is selling for $160.00 an acre and up. I Gentlemen, I believe I am voicing the sentiments of every banker he state when I say that there is no business of industry in our monwealth that the bankers would sooner foster than that of the ymen. We might say your business is not confined to three, six, line months in the year, your business is perpetual, twice a day days in the year, rain or shine, hot or cold. The successful dairy - is the man who likes the work of feeding, milking or performing little things essential to the cow's comfort and contentment. KYour are truly entitled to be classed as our most industrious cit - ;, and our wants should be entitled to the candid consideration of y banker in the state. K order that the bankers might know more of your business and I would suggest that you select one of your number for a place program at the annual meeting of state bankers. And in conclusion, gentlemen, I hope this convention will be the beginning of a movement by your association for the doubling of your product in this state and that you will in a few years exceed all other states in production. »• ___- innpABBA uj^h" ImeinAai •♦ m hm wi u , Imimih M^^ f«tw ♦!* </seg>

I thank you. At the conclusion of Mr. Murray's paper the association adjourned to meet at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. STATE FARM, FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, 1916 MORNING SESSION— 9:30 I The meeting was called to order by the president who stated that first thing on the program was the reports of committees and bu.-i - session but owing to some of the members on the committees g called home, there were left on some committees only one men, and their reports are not finished but will be a little later, so we take up as the first thing on the program this morning, the topic Winter Dairying Most Profitable," by Mr. John Imrie, Wiseonsin'. - t successful winter dairyman, of Roberts, Wisconsin. tMr. Severe, of Palmyra: Mr. President, as chairman of the com - ee on resolutions, before we take up this address, I would like to say I am left alone on the resolutions committee and I would like to any lady or gentleman present who has any resolutions they would presented to present them to me. I don't feel that, alone, I am cap - of formulating and presenting all the resolutions that oujrht to ntroduced and I will ask for the help of all in the audience. The President: You have heard what Mr. Severe has to say and if anyone has any resolutions they wish presented, call on Mr. Severe and he will be only too glad to have you help him out and he will at the same time help you out. We will now listen to Mr. Imrie. Mr. Imrie read his paper as follows: WINTER DAIRYING MOST PROFITABLE Winter dairying means all the year around dairying, means getting a revenue twelve months in the year instead of seven or eight month.-. Not only is winter dairying more profitable in this respect, but in m&amp;ny others. For instance, if the cows freshen '"rom October 1st to January 1st, conditions are just right for best results. The worry and discomfort from flies is over for the season and the dairyman has absolute control of the feeding end, which goes a lonjr way towards success in keeping cows. If cows are well fed through the winter, when they are turned to grass in spring, the milk flow takes on an added impetus and is con - tinued much longer than if they freshen in spring. When the grass begins to dry up and the flies are bad it is almost impossible to keep the milk flow up to normal. If we do not dairy in the winter, the feed fed during this time is practically thrown away, simply given as storage for the machine over the winter as we sometimes do with our automobiles. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 107 Winter dairying teaches the keeper of cows to be a better feeder and this is the big end of the problem. More farmers fall down along feeding lines than any other on the farm. No herd of dairy cows will ever be better than the man behind the cows. Do you suppose Colantha 4-th's Johanna would have been a world's championship cow if Will Gillette had not been on the job? Or Hay Rilma or Murna Cowan had their feeders not been experts? Or that wonderful Duchess Skylark Ormsby with twelve hundred and five pounds "f batter fat, if Axel Hanson had not had charge of her feed and care? KWe have got to learn to be feeders before we can hope to succeed cows. We must learn that it is the feed fed beyond the mainten - point which pays us the profits in dairying. Every dairyman should set a standard of production for his cows and make them measure up to as near this standard as possible. My own standard used to be that each cow must pay me two dol - lars for every dollar's worth of feed consumed. If t&gt;he was not capable of doing this after being given a fair trial, she had to make room for one that could. When a feeder of cows finds that by furnishing one dollar's worth of feed as raw material to his machines he can get two dollars' worth of product he will soon be a more liberal feeder and wish to feed all his cows can handle and stand up under. I About this time we will begin to study this great problem of feeding begin to realize its possibilities. We may find it possible by simply ging the form of the feed, to make it more easily digested and ;by save wear and friction of the machine. KWe may find that we are throwing away feed on one cow that ot respond and not feeding another that can any where near gh feed for her to do her best for us. IWhen winter dairying is taken up and pushed it will be possible and sable to get Cow Testing associations started all over the state; I know of nothing outside of better feeding that is bringing up average production of our Wisconsin cows as our cow testing ■iations are doing. We have now fifty-one associations in full blast in our state, and will have a good many more before spring. corps of institute workers alone have four associations started ie last four weeks and one more on the way. t Winter dairying means more silos and with this cheapest of all s we are enabled to keep a great many more cows on our farms, means just so much more fertility for the soil; nor will we con - b to sell the fertility from our farms in the bag and bale, because will find we have a better market for our farm crops, in the winder dairy cow. Of course winter dairying means that comfortable buildings mast be furnished the cows, so that the temperature can be controlled at all </seg>
            <seg id="p111">108 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Eiese buildings need not be expensive. I have been in a good many barns built of logs with plenty of sunlight and a good system of ition furnishing pure air for the cows to breathe, enabling them the blood vessels with pure blood made from good food and pure lich means rapid circulation and a better and more rapid separ of the milk from the blood. » Again the keeper of cows who follows winter dairying receives gher price for his butter fat, milk or cream than he who milks in summer. t Wisconsin is receiving about two and one-half cents more per id for butter fat than the rest of the states because she is doing » winter dairying than any other of the states. ■ Or in other words, putting a larger per cent of her product o market when the price is high. tTo illustrate the difference in prosperity where winter dairying us I carried on as against summer dairying. I was holding a Farm- Institute a few years ago in one of the older parts of our state. is making quite an effort to induce the farmers to feed better that might be able to milk the cows the whole year. A farmer got ind said, "I hardly think you understand our conditions here. We make enough in summer milking to keep us through the winter, that satisfies us." I said I think I do understand conditions, as I notice your farm buildings need paint, your fences need repairing, and I am going to ask your wives if you are putting in water-works, bath rooms and sewage in your farm homes? I am going to ask you men if you are improv ing your dairy herds from year to year? They admitted these things were not done, nor were the dairy cow* any better if as good as ten years ago. I No cow can be an extra good producer unless she is a persistent er and the only way to make her so is to milk her almost the entire . This means winter dairying. I Nebraska, it seems to me, is fortunate in her location, climate, fine crops of alfalfa and com eminently fitting her as a state for results in summer and winter dairying. tNow I have here just a few figures that mean a great deal in lg the farm crops; that is, in every $100 worth of crops we sell l going to give you the amount of fertility that we sell from our I In every hundred dollars worth we sell of the following crops sell the following amount of fertility: Oat straw $55. Alfalfa $48.18. Clover $73.22. Don't sell your clover hay, it is especially good. Timothy @ $12 a ton $43.40. Corn @ 50c per bushel $35.68. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 109 Oats @ 40c per bushel $33.62. Wheat &lt;i $1 per bushel $25.11. Skimmed milk @ 35c per hundred $31.84. Beef 9 $8 per hundred $5.70. Milk © $1.60 per hundred $5.56. Cream testing 28% 90 cents. And butter @ 35c per pound 7 cents. » These are figures that you can't get away from. If we winter f and feed to the capacity of our cows we are going to get oat filing the fertility from our farm to a large extent. IXow this is all I have written in my manuscript. Are there any tions you want to bring out? t.Mr. North: Possibly you will qualify the one statement you made ■iler that I will understand it a little better. In any business that an goes into he doesn't expect to make 100% on his investment, if the dairyman buys a dollars' worth of feed and gets $2 back, is the standard, will not the young men get the idea that that le business to go into, but they will then find out that they will make 100% on their investment, and where one dairyman fails eans disaster. Where one dairyman makes a success it means or five will notice his success and perhaps go into it. Now is what you meant to say? Does a man going into the dairy bnnine— make 100%? Mr. Imrie: No, that isn't the standard to state; that is our ideal. Now of course it takes years sometimes to work up to that ideal, we have to do a good deal of cutting out cost, lots of cows are not paying a profit. Out of our 21,000,000 cows 7,000,000 are not paying for their feed; another 7,000,000 are just breaking even paying for their feed; and the other 7,000,000 are making us the wonderful amount of money that we are receiving from our dairy cows. Now if we set oar standard so that in a short time, say in a few years, we can reach it we have only to cut out the star boarders. How natural it is for us to have a little bit of a heifer which is gentle and kind and we have an idea that she is going to make a splendid cow; the children love her and when she comes in fresh she milks so nice and is so gentle that we think she is fine and if she happens to give a nice flow of milk for a month or two we think we have a bonanza, but if you will use a Babcock scales you will find that she is one of the star boarders, and we have to cut her out of this business proposition. It is not very easy to measure up to the $2 standard I spoke of. It took me five or six years to get there, and after I got the kind of cows I wanted I made it right straight through at $2.25 the last year I handled it, but that isn't anything wonderful, we have men doing better than that in Wisconsin. I am not saying that every young man can go into the business and do that exactly in the start; he might be able to take such a herd that has been brought up so he will get a larger production, but to say that every young man that starts in the dairy business can do that, I didn't intend to set any such standard at alL </seg>
            <seg id="p113">110 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION If we can show our boys here in the dairy farm that here is a good clean, honest, straightforward business with which they can take • dollar's worth of raw material and make two dollars' worth of profit through the winter, if we can show them this, they will not leave the farm. Our sons and daughters are just as bright as they ever were; if we can show them that it is not necessary to go into the dairy barn and wade half way to the ankle in filth it will be no trouble to keep things clean. I remember I was talking to quite a large audi - ence once and there was quite an agitation as to how we were going to keep the boys «nd girls on the farm, and a big German says : " 1 telta you how you keeps Johnnie, you just board the school ma'am and Johnnie says all right I bet you." Mr. Andrews: How much butter fat should you have per cow? Mr. Imrie: They have got to produce something better than H00 pounds, from that up to 400 pounds. ■ Mr. Andrews: Is that every factor, the cost of labor besides cost of feed, how does that compare; have you figures on that? ■ Mr. Imrie: I haven't it exact, we figure that the skimmed milk fertility pays for handling that. Mr. Andrews: Without the calf? »Mr. Imrie: Certainly, the calf is counted in, the calf anil the' med milk and the fertility left on the farm will certainly pay pay you well for handling the dairy cow. Mr. Andrews: What do you value the feed and skimmed milk Mr. Imrie: About 30 cents a hundred. Question: And the manure? Mr. Imrie: That depends; if taken directly out of the barn about $3.30 but 70 cents less when it is laid over until spring and then hauled out directly to the land. ■ Mr. Severe: Does that include the investment in the tixtur. stock? Mr. Imrie: No sir. Mr. Severe: I didn't suppose it did, but I wanted it brought out clearly before the young men. Mr. Imrie: No, that is counting the feed and pasture and every - thing that goes into the animal. »Mr. Walker: How much chance do you give a young cow, that &gt;w many years, to come up to your standard, and how well must do before you condemn her in the first instance? Mr. Imrie: We never condemn a cow the first year, that is, as a two year old; if the conditions are right we can easily locate the reason for it if we find that she hasn't quite measured up to the standard. We will give her another trial if she falls short of our standard. Mr. Femle: What is the use of these star boarders, do they go to market and are sold or are they sold to some innocent dairymen? ■ Mr. Imrie: We have lots of nice dairymen, and some that are so nice, but after all they are a pretty nice bunch, taken as they </seg>
            <seg id="p114">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 111 tWe believe the star boarder ought to go to the block, bat of se, in starting out I might have one that didn't quite measure o my standard and if I was selling her I would always give the free of that cow to the man who wanted to buy, and I would say produced so much last year. If you think you would rather have at this price take her, but she don't measure up to the Babcork Professor Haerker: I like your basis of feeding, that is your standard: it is certainly plenty low. In this state where we have cheaper feeds we can make even better than $2. We have made on this farm as high as $4 per dollar given. We don't need to bother about a great amount of profit. A manufacturer of a commodity finds his cost of raw material and to make that commodity he multiplies that by a factor, it may be I 1 -. 2, :?, 4 or 5 and he has the price right for cost, but there is that big factor called "overhead." You see I have been a dairyman and am in business now, a manufacturing business, and I see another side of the business. And this overhead is just as legitimate and just as reasonable and everybody is interested in it and interested in paying it just as much as they are in paying a fair price for a fair commodity, and so I like to think we should set a high standard; I like that idea and work towards it. 1 think the dairy - man ought to have $3 for every dollar he puts in feed because his overhead is large; he has his farm taxes, insurance, and pleasures, his automobile and his home conveniences and his cows that re-act, his rows that go wrong, his calves that died of the scours. He has 101 other things that tear down and take away his profits, and I think that is a very conservative basis for considering just the feed for the cows and the profit we get out of that feed. I There is a great deal of feeding of cattle for beef in this state that is one thing where I think the dairy business takes a higher 1, because in the dairy business it requires a great deal of energy study ami knowledge and thinking and reading while the other ness is a good deal of a gamble for prices. He goes on and makes tin. and he don't care whether he is a Shakespeare, a Webster or Emerson, or whether the fellow comes from the Old Country an.l t speak a word of English, for it don't make much difference about ling his cattle if he knows the simple rule of thumb of feeding, with the dairyman he has to know the right figures, he must almost i book-keeper. Mr. Imrie: I intended to convey the idea that no cow in the henl should just be able to come up to that standard, but we expect that most of the herd will measure way above it, and she is not fit to have a place in the herd unless she measures up to it. Professor Haecker: Then that is the limit* Mr. Imrie: Yes sir. Professor Frandsen: What is the average for the Wisconsin cow? IMr. Imrie: About 270 or 80, I don't remember exactly. I would to give you a few figures. (Interrupted.) </seg>
            <seg id="p115">112 Question from the Audience: Haven't you grot that about 100 too high? JMr. Imrie: Yes, I should have said 170. I want to say right here in our cow testing association, started about three years ago, 1 some figures, and when we first started the average of the herds t through that association — we had thirty herds — averaging 178 ids for two years' work, the average of the whole herd — thirty s — throughout this association was 256 pounds to the cow. Now is it worth while to get together and organize these cow - testing associations and push matters? I feel that it means wonderful dairying when we get the dairymen organized in a way so that they will take hold of their own business, it is a business proposition. Why, a farmer will come and unless he has a Babcock cow-tester, will say that he guesses he makes about so much. There isn't any business that could maintain itself two years in that way. We will make a little money from year to year, but we don't know which is the machine - that is doing it or which is the one that is cutting down our profits unless we have a testing association. I have gone into the dairy barns in Wisconsin and other states and I have asked which is your best cow? The first thing I notice is whether there is a Babcock scale, if there is one I don't ask the question because I know that man knows his business. If he doesn't have a scale, I get this answer more than nine times out of ten: "Now that red and white cow that stands right there, when she first freshened gave a big 14-quart pail of milk." That is the first answer you get. Then the next question is, "How long did she keep that up?" And the answer will be, "Oh, I don't know, but quite a while." He is even guessing at the time problem. I remem - ber how badly I was fooled when a young man. I had four high-bred Jerseys; I also had quite a few others, but these seemed to me espe - cially good. One was giving sixty-four pounds of milk a day and tasted 4.8; in those days we always resolved it into butter, and after we got the Babcock test it showed she was making about twenty-three and one-third pounds a day. The President: You mean a day or a week? I Mr. Imrie: I mean a week; now for those other three: I had that was giving eighteen and one-fourth pounds, in seven days; her seventeen and three-fourth pounds, and another sixteen pounds. It quite proud of those cows, and especially the one that was giving sixty-four pounds of milk, making twenty-three and one-third ids of butter a week. I kept on and I watched the next cow, too, she was giving thirty-five pounds of milk, but she was testing iderably higher. After three months I found that they were draw - dose together in the amount of milk and at the end of five months little cow was ahead. At the end of the seventh month she was tipper and by the middle of the eighth month she was dried up still the little cow was sawing wood with thirty-five pounds of every day. At the end of the year I figured it up and brought </seg>
            <seg id="p116">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 113 I profit and loss to bear on those cows and I found that the little cow rig the thirty-five pounds a day was making me twice as much net it as the one giving the pail full at first. So we will always harken : to the Babcock test and milk scales and we will find how to feed cows. Here we have two cows, each one is {riving thirty pounds of : a day, one is giving 3% milk and the other 6% or twice as much er fat, and as to feeding these two cows, we will either starve the to death or throw away feed on the other. Have you any cow - ing associations in Nebraska? From the Audience: Yes. Mr. Imrie: How many? From the Audience: Two. Professor Frandsen: We have about three in the state now, I think, and our results have been as striking as yours. Mr. Anderson was one of our first testers, and if I remember his records he had one cow that only gave 55 cents for every dollar of feed she was getting. In the same herd he had a cow that produced over $2 for every $1 worth of feed. I think we estimated that by weed - ing out the poor cows, when the farmers saw what they were, we raised the standard forty pounds as the result of that process of weed - ing in that one year's work, and similar results were obtained in other associations. We always feel justified in selling our star boarders. Some of our farmers don't take up with the sales quite as generously as they should. From the Audience: That is because it is a horse trade. I Professor Frandsen: I agree that the star boarders ought not to anywhere but to the block, and I realize the importance of cow - ing work. Mr. Imrie: I want to tell a story. A friend of mine tried to organize a cow-testing association. He succeeded very well but needed just one more farmer to make the number of herds necessary. He wanted a farmer to join the cow-testing association who was making .some money by his operations, and he says, "How about it, how much will it cost?" My friend said, "Is will cost you $1.25 a year to have your cow tested out." He said, "To find out which is my best cow?" My friend said, "Yes." He said, "I can tell which is my best cow; all I have to do is to milk out a little milk and if it is nice and yellow she is a dandy." He was a good farmer as we call him, and he said, "Who is going to do this work?" My friend said, "Mr. Searles of Fon du Lac; it is our business to furnish a man to do this work." He said, "I don't believe I have any hard-earned dollars to give any of these young fellows and have them running around wearing a white collar and looking for a soft snap." A few weeks afterwards he was called up by this same man, who said, "I understand you want to buy a couple of cows." "Yes," my friend said, "I have a good cream trade and am a little short of cream and need more cows." So my friend got in his automobile and went over and as he opened the door there were two big red cows standing right close to the door. The </seg>

This was five year* He said, "TTiat one you can have for $47.50 ami this one for $45." i a Durham breed and they didn't appeal to him, so he walked the line and came to about the thirteenth or fourteenth cow, and iced that she was of a different type. He noticed the lower lines X back over the udder where the separation was going on, and the heavy milk veins; he noticed that she had a splendid udder with a long: connection from the udder to the body; he noticed the rounti head and the wide muscles, and the bright eye and also that her manger was licked up nice and clean. He said, "What will you take for this cow?" The fanner said, "Oh, you don't want her." My friend .-aid. "Yea, I want her." "If you are satisfied with her," says the farmer. "you can have her at $32.60." My friend got out his check book as quickly as he could and wrote a check for $32.50. He put her in the row-testing association and the first year as a three-year-old heifer she made him above the cost of feed and pasture $84.57. Now, what did that man do to find out whether she was good for anything or not. and to save a dollar? That cow was equal to $1300 placed out ■ in a mortgage. Now these are things that we should think of. We want to get these organizations, and when we get them organized by personal work it will be a great impetus to the dairying interests of Nebraska. I thank you. KThe President: The next number on our program will be a paper ur Pure Food Commissioner, Mr. C. E. Harmon, entitled "Nebraska y Products." We will now have the pleasure of listening to Mr. non. Mr. Harmon read his paper as follows: KThe State Dairy Association which is now known as the Statt&gt; ymen's Association, was organized at Fremont, Nebr.. on Decem - 9th and 10th, 1885, which would make this the thirty-first annual •ing. »This association is certainly, above all things else, an enduring nization and has standing to its credit more long years of effort genuine results than any other organization in the state. I This statement on the face of things may seem hard to prove, but figures are before us, the results with us and evidence of every on all sides. In scanning the report of the convention in 1885, we find the same fervor and intensity of purpose then as we find in the convention this year. Then everything was against the dairyman, the crudest methods were employed, prices were ridiculously low, and creamery butter was a delicacy for the few and an extravagance for the many. J. Dixon Avory was elected president of the association. H. H. </seg>
            <seg id="p118">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 115 Wing, secretary, and S. C. Bassett as chairman of the Board of Direc - tors at the Fremont convention. (i an address to this convention, Mr. Bassett offered the following: •aska is destined to take front ranks as a dairy state and the on for her farmers to determine is whether they will push the ?ss and at once reap the benefits. Look at this industry in its est sense, view it from any and all directions, and it seems that effort should be put forth to develop the dairy interests of this A dairy fanner means a prosperous farmer. A dairy community prosperous community; a dairy state, a wealthy State." Mr. Bassett spoke truly; he spoke wisely. I Among 1 other subjects discussed at the first annual convention was bject then known as Bogus Butter which is now known as imitation er and the necessary steps were taken toward the passage of need - legislation for the protection of the then infant dairy industry in state as well as in the nation. The next legislature passed the law •h is still on the statute books, and is without doubt the best imi - &gt;n butter law in the land. Under it imitation butter must be sold served for what it is and nothing else. It is perhaps the most rtive of any law pertaining to dairy products ever recommended lie association. I The report of the first convention shows forty-three creameries cheese factories in operation in the state at that time. The larg - creamery manufacturing 290,000 pounds of butter and the largest «e factory, 360,000 pounds per annum. The average price for but - was 22 cents. Some creameries reporting a certain system of test - cream while others report none. A few operating a whole year, only part of the year for most of them. The total amount of cream - butter manufactured was in the neighborhood of 3,500,000 pounds the amount of cheese in the neighborhood of 1,000,000 pounds. tin 1888, Mr. Bassett was elected secretary of the association and nued in this capacity for several years. In his report for that we find some very interesting figures. The number of creameries cheese factories, 54. Average value of creamery plants, $5500.00. -age number of patrons to each creamery, 130. Total butter make, &gt;,000 pounds. iThe report of the Deputy Food and Dairy Commissioner of 1902 has its author Mr. S. C. Bassett, and again we find some very inter - [g figures. Butter make in creameries, 12,000,000 pounds. Cheese, WO pounds, which shows an increase in factory butter production Jie previous ten years of 35% with a decrease in cheese production 4 ■ , About this time his report shows that the state had paaaed ugh its experimental or promotion stage of the creamery business in the place of the creamery at the local point, a skimming station taking its place and the butter fat being; shipped to its Central IFor the year 1915 I have computed the dairy product of this State tat I feel safe in making the statement that more than forty million </seg>
            <seg id="p119">116 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION dollars of dairy products were produced. In order that the moat skep - tical may be convinced that these figures are approximately correct, I will say that the records in my office disclose the fact that the cream erie« manufactured last year forty-five million pounds of butter, or in dollars and cents, fifteen million dollars. Ice cream factories made and ■old three million dollars in ice cream. Farm butter amounts to ten million dollars. Cream and milk used in the home and on the farm, seventeen million dollars. This state has gradually grown to be a factor of no small impor - tance among the states of the Union in its dairy industry. Many rea - sons might be assigned for the steady growth in the production of dairy products, but one good reason is, that although the pathway of dairy success has been strewn with failures, caused by poor management, promotion schemes, insufficient capital and creamery plants being located at points where the cow population was insufficient, there has been a gigantic individual and collective effort on the part of a few who had no fear of the ultimate result in store for this industry in this Many men have come and gone who have given their every energy for the benefit of the upbuilding of the industry, but looking back over the past thirty years, one central figure stands out, one who is easily identified by practically every person present at this meeting. The gentleman I have in mind is not personally well known to me, but from the records I have at hand and the information I gain from others I am quite sure that all present will agree with me that this man has given his best efforts for the greater portion of his life in the placing of the dairy industry of this state in the position that it occupies today. In reading his reports coming down through the years one cannot help but realize that although the pathway at times was hard and more than discouraging, nothing presented itself that could in the least de - gree take away from him his optimistic view and determination to place this state in the front ranks as a dairy state. I The President: On account of the brief time at our disposal we have to dispense with discussion of this interesting subject, bave as our next number a paper along similar lines on the subject The Cost of Producing Milk," by J. R. Roberts, of Normal, Ne - ka, who will now talk to us: Mr. Roberts presented his paper as follows: My subject is "The Cost of Milk Production." In discussing this subject I wish to set up an economy standard. Although in all of the discussions we hear reference made to economy and one would think It all authorities were advocating an economy standard, yet I be - e that real enconomy in milk production has been lost sight of most all of the leaders of dairy though in the hot chase they are [ing after large records. The high record standard has come to lace the real economy standard. They have takeen to the air in hips for the sake of speed when walking might be a lot cheaper. The doctrine I intend to preach may be considered a very radical </seg>
            <seg id="p120">THIETY-FIKST ANNUAL CONVENTION 117 doctrine. When recently I held a meeting of farmers who were pro - ducing milk for my company, I asked a young man who was working Iie dairy extension service of the department of agriculture to come me. I had certain ideas that I wanted to convey and hoped to someone to help carry out the program. To my surprise he re- J when he learned of my doctrine. He said he wouldn't be a otter to anything so radical. Since that time I have thought this :er over a great deal and have decided that if the dairy author - &lt;lon't preach it, dairy authorities are wrong, and that perhaps 1 better, if possible, convert them. In the production of great records methods are used that do not pay as an every-day practice. Horse racing is more expensive than moderate driving and crowding cows for records have about the same economic results. It seems that a great deal of instruction is given to train men for fast records, when a high margin of profit from the average farmer's standpoint is more to be desired. When fast records are sought for the feeds most used by the farmer as a by-product to his grain farming operations, are mainly discarded and specially pro - duced feeds are fed to the cows. I wish to lead an attack on the orthodox feed menu recommended by all authorities so far as I know, as being the right feed for the dairy cow in Nebraska. These feeds are pasture, alfalfa, corn silage as commonly used, and grain. I criticise this menu not for what it contains, but for what it does not contain. It contains no by-products. Mot an acre of ground is used in the production of these feeds can be used at the same time for anything else. Not a particle of this feed is produced, incidentally in any other farming operations. If we fol - low this orthodox menu in feeding, it means simply that we may have certain acres of land that go to produce cattle and dairy products and that on other acres of land we produce grain. In producing our mil - lions of acres of corn we produce millions of acres of corn stalks as a by-product possessing an almost unlimited feed value if properly conserved. It has no value except when fed to cattle. Cattle alone can make money out of it and yet it is ignored in the rations advocated for the dairy- It is true that com silage contains com stalks, but it also contains corn. Because a certain number of acres has to be raised especially for the silo it is not a by-product. I advocate saving every corn stalk in the state of Nebraska, but I do not advocate as practical that we feed all of Nebraska's corn product to the cows. I In practice the average farmer who milks six cows has on his place t twenty head of cattle. The majority of his herd consisting of ig cattle, dry stock and the like. His feeding operations include the feeding of all the stock. The cost of producing milk includes the cost of producing the cow in the first place, and the cost of feeding »cow when she is not producing. From the farmer's standpoint he s up the cost of feeds, not of the cow he is milking alone, bat of whole herd. This is as it should be. The silo filled with corn, in- </seg>
            <seg id="p121">118 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION I ing grain, makes it necessary for him to feed grain to cattle that ot pay for its use. Many who produce thoroughbred cattle will ite this statement, but I agree with practically all the farming ilation that they cannot afford to feed grain to cattle no produc - and hat are not being fattened for the block. All steer feeders v they cannot afford to produce even high priced beef by grain ing. They must buy their steer at one price and after feeding i must sell the animal at a higher price or go bankrupt. The in weight made by the steer will not pay for the grain consumed. so in raising young dairy stock you cannot afford to feed grain. sad of the use of cattle to turn by-products into money, grain fee&lt;l - :o the average farmer's herd is turning money back into cattle. tThe "radical" doctrine that I preach is a conservative doctrim - pted by the conservative farmer. The big end of his dairy product by-production. And notwithstanding the fact that year after year lave been advocating the specialized dairy, and have been teaching young men that specializing methods are the only methods to us.-. is an unpleasant truth, but we may just as well admit it. With - the cream produced by farmers whose main feed is a by-product rain farming, not a wheel in a creamery- in this state would turn today. The use of by-products by the dairy farmer of Nebraska has made possible the largest creameries in the world. However sue cessful the specialized dairy may be elsewhere, in Nebraska little stands to its credit. The reason for this is noi the stubbornness, ignorance and foolish - ne» on the part of the farmer, that educated people are generally in - clined to suppose, but because the farmer with his scrub cows ami crude methods is really beating the cost production records of the specialized, herds. Out on the range I have seen cattle wintered on alfalfa at $3 a ton and on sage brush at nothing, and the sage brush paid better. About a similar condition exists for the milk producer of today, where by-products are to be had for nothing, more expensive and better feeds can't compare. I have before me the last issue of the Nebraska Farmer, which gives a report of the Lancaster cow test - ing association. It commented favorably on certain herds that have - made a high record, but failed to make note of the fact that the five lowest producing herds in the association have made the most money. The records of nine herds are given, the herds taking the four highest records made an average profit of $22 per cow in the year, the five herds lower down the scale of production made a profit of $38 per year. The cost records of the state farm herd for the year figured on the same basis would show a profit of $31. Some people prefer fame to riches and while some herds are taking the glory, others are "making the mon." The difference in net profit results from the prices of the kinds of feed consumed. KMy remarks are not intended to show that the farmer possesses mm total of wisdom or that his methods cannot be improved. Sev - years ago in a talk before this association I stated as my opinion </seg>
            <seg id="p122">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 119 that for the average farmer, to be taken care of just as the average farmer takes care of all his stock, the common rew cow, the "just cow" that everybody makes fun of, is the best he can get. Cattle that have to run out in the cold and wind snow while gnawing the boots from the com stalks had better be red cattle, for our improved breeds air - not meant for that business. What, then, should we conclude. The iroduct producer is the most economical producer and the "just his best friend. The thing to do is to preserve in better form by-products. Let them be by-products still, but let them not be eglected. Let us save for the cattle that which the cattle alone make use of, but let us so preserve it that it can be fed to better ntage and to more productive herds. Life is too short to abide .er with the old red farm cow, but let us not replace her without ing the use of better cattle practical. I On my farm today there is a silo filled with corn stalks that are ■ely a by-product production. Cows that are milking are fed grain are cared for as they should be. The young stock is fed silage out any grain, and alfalfa. They are doing fine. In this case the that went to till the silo was raised after a wheat crop had been ested. It was very immature and possesses very little feed value rding to reports, but is doing good business. We have also tried ome extent snapping out the corn from well matured fields and it is to work. Corn may be shocked in the fall and after a brief time he shock the grain will stand cribbing. The stalks can then be e into silage, as by using a husking attachment on the silage cutter then wetting down with a hose the feed as it is cut. I There are other by-products that can be made use of, but this seems ie the most important. The cow census reports show that milk I in Nebraska are distributed about in proportion to the popula- The farmer at present almost universally maintains a herd suf - nt to use his by-products as they are now used. However, under ent conditions only a small per cent of the value of the by-products saved. Teach him to save. Teach him methods of preserving his iroducts so that three, four or five times as much good will come i it and the dairy products of this state can be doubled and trebled beef cattle production can make the same grain. I Dairy science has not been wasted but will come into its own when earns the true meaning of the resistance offered by the conservatism the farmer. It will come into its own when it helps the fanner do the very good work he is trying to do in conserving by-products. hink the silo with the com husking ensilage cutter will be the means bringing science to the farmer and the farmer to science and that v will live happily together ever after. Questions and Discussions of Mr. Robert's Paper I Mr. S wager: I think Mr. Roberts and I have had a good many uments about one thing and another, that is private arguments, and i private argument I think I can hold my own, but I have my doubts well as anyone in the room about Mr. Robert's sincerity in this </seg>
            <seg id="p123">120 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION matter. Mr. Roberts likes an argument and sometimes he will start something along lines that he doesn't altogether believe in, and I think he has done that here today. I happen to be in the same business that Mr. Roberts is in. I was at one time a student in this school and am very much interested all along this line, but I won't attempt to answer only a few things. Mr. Roberts has suggested. I can't resist the opportunity to get up and say a few words in defense of the school, and also a few words of encouragement to these boys here. I don't believe for a minute that this school teaches that the cows should not be allowed to go into the field and eat the best part of the corn fodder and straw when the weather is right, and I don't believe Mr. Roberts would chase his cows out when it was zero weather, because he knows it would take enough more grain to keep them warm while eating that fodder than the fodder was worth. tNow in reference to these cow-testing associations: we had a herd ouglas county — oru herd happened to make the best record — I don't &gt;mber whether Mr. Hendry made that test or not, if he did he will smber some of the figures, and that herd was either first or second, our cost was something like $35 or $40 per cow. Our net profit something like $60 and our best cow's profit was $120 or $123. errupted.) From the Audience: $123. (Mr. Swalger continuing): We were not intensive feeders and did not feed to the limit but we fed along the line Mr. Roberts has sug - gested as much as we could, and from what we raised ourselves such as corn, silage, alfalfa, and hay; the same man that fed this herd and had charge of them is now in business for himself, and in two years he has picked up from his neighbors and traded cows until they are now giving him an average of four gallons of milk a day in the winter. He put up a silo two years ago and borrowed part of the money and he has paid a part fo his principal back on this system of dairying, and is paying his interest besides. Mr. Roberts argues that when you put all the corn in the silo you save one-third of the profit on your corn crop to put it up at the right time; he also says we farm too much, and the time is coming when the farmer will farm on a small ■ There are so many fellows who can talk so much better than I that I will leave the floor to them. I Mr. Growl, from Minnesota: It seems to me that the question been answered that Mr. Roberts didn't mean all he said. It would ar from his statements that he was taking some of the future of the cattle when he was attempting to feed young stock and dry i in the manner of which he said. We all know it is impossible eep up the standard in our young cattle and milk cows without ing them good feed and plenty of it. I believe too much has done along the line of high production. We all know it costs a s more to produce milk and butter fat when we make high records when we make small ones, but there is a medium between the </seg>
            <seg id="p124">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 121 two and we might emphasize that point. However, it seems totally against all my experience in dairying: that cattle can be handled in the way indicated, that is, the young stock, without affecting them later on. It may be possible for a time to get all there is out of the cattle that is in them at the present time, but the size gradually diminishes and after a time you will have cattle that are not up to the standard, so I would like to clinch that point; the more economical your feeding is at the present time, the lower the standard of your cattle will be in the future. §The second point: I want to know whether the cattle averaging were not cattle that had been bred for milk cows to some extent; int that question answered. Another question I want answered is: long will those cows under improper feeding give milk? I noticed the point was made that they became strippers. There is no advantage in having those cattle strippers. You can make them finish the end of the year if properly fed clear up to the end of the Mr. Roberts: I don't want to take up all the time, but I hope to keep the discussion going by shutting out things I didn't mean to say. I didn't say that you should starve that cow giving milk; I believe in taking care of those cows that give milk, but I believe in raising the young stock and our dry stock without grain; I believe in giving the cattle all the rough feed they can get for nothing, but that doesn't mean you have to starve them. I know by my experience that I can show as big cattle as anybody and I never feed any dry cattle nor young calves any grain and they are as big as anybody else's, too. Mr. Imrie: I think Mr. Roberts made the statement that you have to feed your young stock different feed than the dairy cows. Now the very best feed for the young, growing animal of all creatures is mother's milk, and to get that you must feed exactly the same kind of feed of feed you give to your real dairy cows. Just take that home. The ingredients must be exactly alike. There is no better feed known to any animal than its mother's milk. I don't believe Mr. Roberts intended to convey the idea that you must feed growing animals dif - ferently from dairy cows. Certainly, to get the animals to be pro - ducers just as Mr. Growl said, we have to rush them for the time they are with us; the cow must be fed that way until she comes in to milk; it is utterly impossible to get the best results in Wisconsin unless we do that very thing. Breed for a purpose and feed for a purpose. Those kind of men are getting the best results in our state and they are the men with the small farms, some have four silos on eighty acres. I asked Mr. Griswold, "What would you use without your silos to put your corn into as far as necessary?" He said, "If it wasn't for those I would quit dairying at once." Now he advises the placing of the ears of corn right in the silo. He says, "I can get more feed value because it makes it more digestaible." Professor Haecker: I think Mr. Roberts has thrown a bomb into camp which we have no time to answer, but I do want to make one </seg>
            <seg id="p125">122 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION correction; I am sure he is misinformed when he says that half of the silos in the state are empty. When they are empty it is a reflec - tion on the men who have silos. I just came from Wisconsin wheiv men in their days, and for generations before them, have to use silo* or get out of the business. I went through that country in a Ford car and stopped on each side of the road and there was not a hill ot" corn then standing out in the field. We tried to find shocks and couldn't, but once in a while you would find a fellow up on corn fodder piled up in a rack. We asked the next fellow why that was and he said he was either a poor renter or that he didn't know enough or something else equally as bad. Every hill of com in that region eventually will be put into the silos, as it is the most economic use of the corn plant, and these things are as fundamental as the law of gravitation. There is another thing: The very basic principles of feed must be clearly understood and it is a simple thing when known and I would like to size it up in one sentence: "Good feeding is supplying animals with all their needs with an economic ration." Anybody can feed a cow well, but it takes some figuring, sense and experience to feed a cow well and economically. Perhaps we have had some experience where the cow was fed well but not economically, but we are learning to feed economically and well and we are not going to stop. In ex - perience on this farm, I can prove by figures that the big breeds of cows are the most economical producers of milk and produce the most money. Don't forget for a minute that the trouble is, we don't feed the heifers, calves and dry cows well enough. In ninety-nine cases out of 100, that is true, the best feeders don't feed enough. » Gentleman from Michigan: I formerly resided in Nebraska, but iderstood that every man out of twenty had a public office so 1 d for and was elected school director by a majority of two. and 1 it make regular by a motion to make it unanimous. I think that, as I am a prophet away from my own country, you will believe seriously what I say. I formerly shipped cream to Mr. Roberts but I never saw him before today, but I will say he was the most honorable and upright man that I ever shipped a pound of cream to and gave me the squares t deal; I never at any time asked about the test because 1 knew it was right. I say this to you gentlemen in Ne - braska: you are knocking about things you don't know anything about. There are some of the best people here I ever met, but 1 want to come back and give a remedy to Brother Roberts in defense of these young men who are giving the best part of their lives for the upbuilding of the dairy industry, and I wil tell you that I have the remedy. Up in Michigan at the agricultural school they have too thin a diet but we have one upright man in that state and that is the Dairy and Food man. He found when he investigated at every single school where these young students were boarding that their diet was entirely too thin, and what was it? Oleo, and not a sign hanging up there, and even their States Attorney would not hold up the hands of the Food Commissioner until a certain party brought a suit for $25,000. </seg>
            <seg id="p126">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 123 On this diet of oleo the young men cannot give efficient work, it is too thin. Here is my remedy. We have here near Lincoln some of the most beautiful animals, they are not very large, but I say they are beautiful to behold, and they give the students the registered milk of those nice dairy animals. Do you think these students don't do good work? If you do, just send them to Mr. Young and tell him to prescribe good, wholesome Jersey milk with plenty of butter fat that will soon lubricate the whole sys - tem, and then you will have the most efficient work and none other. If there are any doubting Thomas among these young men, I want to send them to Professor Haecker; I have the remedy; it is good, pure, Holstein milk; it is guaranteed to be lOO'V water; clean out your system with that and you will do the most efficient work that has ever been known under the dairy flag as it waves over Nebraska, and if this prescription don't work, I want you to write or telegraph me way up in Michigan. Professor Propps spoke as follows: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I regard this as a very important movement. Mr. Roberts is ad - vocating some very good ideas that ought to be systematized. Now I didn't get my instructions in dairying at this institution, and I feel that those who are giving instruction at this institution are perfectly competent to defend themselves, but I want to learn more and more and am still learning and I would like to ask Mr. Roberts — in order to get the discussion before you and get right down to the point — one or two questions that I regard as necessary. First, I want to know what breed of cows this was in the Lan - caster County Association that made the highest profit last year? Mr. Roberts: Ask Mr. Coon; he made the tests. Mr. Coon: I haven't that information here; I took it over to the Nebraska Farmer; it is in the last issue of the Nebraska Fanner. Professor Propps: I would be glad to tell you it was the Holstein i that made the highest profit. tPropessor Propps: I would like also to ask about the empty silos Nebraska. What kind of fanners are these dairymen who have ;y silos? tMr. Roberts: I saw them everywhere around the country, but that ■mation I don't give as my own, I was told that, so maybe it is true, but I saw a large number of empty silos myself. I dont ? that as my own statement; as I said I had been told that by a agent. He said that half of the dairymen's silos were empty — might have been an exaggeration, but every man who has trav - around over the state hunting here and there for milk contracts see lots of silos not in use. Professor Propps: I saw some myself, and I don't believe anyone travels around any more than I do. because I am out all the time. I </seg>
            <seg id="p127">124 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION am out almost all day and sometimes half the night, but I know only a few men in the state who have empty silos, only a few, not nearly a half, nor a quarter. Many of those men who have empty silos are men who have been feeding beef cattle and they have been guilty of fighting the silage proposition for feeding to beef cattle as not profit - able, therefore, they have abandoned the silos. I only know of one dairyman in the state, (I have been looking it over since I have been here), who has quit the silos. I went to his place — I am a dairy exten - sion man — and I said, "I came to visit you and see if I could do any - thing for you." He said, "I suppose you are advocating the extension of the dairy." I said, "Sometimes I do, sometimes I advise people to quit dairying, it depends on the man." He said, "I had just about made up my mind to quit because I am not making any profit." I said, "There must be something wrong if you don't make a profit, undoubtedly something is wrong." He said, "If you will set me right I will be glad of it, I have been dairying a long time." I said, "How do you dispose of your product?" He said, "It retails at 8 cents a quart." I said, "Do you have a market for all you can produce?" He said, "Yes, all I can produce." I said, "That is better than some men I know who are get - ting 7 cents a quart and they think they are making money. Have you a silo?" He said, "I have two and they are both tmpty." A lot of other things were said, but that man had two empty silos. I said. "When I go to a successful dairyman he either has a silo or wants one mighty bad and if he hasn't one he is saving money to get one; 'dairymen believe in the silage business." I Now Mr. Roberts has mixed beef cattle with dairy cattle. He ;ed to talk about the economic production of milk and then began alk about feeding young growing stuff silage with corn fodder, that may not be a profitable proposition, but that isn't the ques - here today. The question is to produce milk with the least num - of dollars. I Now, Mr. Roberts is perfectly right in making the statement he e. He says that men who are making the most money in the dairy Mai are the men who are doing other things besides dairying. are raising young stuff; that is perfectly truo. You have heard y times that the diversified dairyman is the man who is making most money. He is in a position to use the by-products of his i and as long as the dairying proposition is a diversified dairy osition his farming will pay. il want to throw a little light on these reports of county organ - ion. Here is the Wisconsin dairyman who says they have thirty - associations whose influence for good is the best thing they can », that is the testing associations. The government believes in it they have 220 cow testing associations in the United States. They putting everything into it and I feel it my duty to defend this irt that came out of their paper. I know where the figures came i. Now our dairy business in Nebraska is far from ideal. If we an ideal system I would go home and go to farming or doing </seg>
            <seg id="p128">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 125 something else I would lose my job. You wouldn't have any buiine— for me, and so would these fellows here; they wouldn't have any use to teach any more dairymen, but we are far from that. A lot of dairymen are losing- money; they haven't the right kind of cows, and we are preaching all the time better cows. Weed out the poor cowa, and keep records and make more money. Men are feeding cheaper feed. Mr. Roberts is right, the kind of feed that the dairy cow ought to have is roughage; give her all the roughage she will consume; that is the cheapest feed. The high producing dairy cow can't eat enough roughage to produce the best results, therefore, you have to give her some concentrates. If your cow can't eat enough alfalfa — for cows will not eat it they say, they will only eat so much, and that argument as given is perfectly sound and good and it will save me a whole lot of talk. Feed your cows all the roughage, alfalfa, hay, corn and silage they will eat, there is nothing cheaper in Nebraska. If your cows were low producing cows and you had grain and just stalks it might be cheaper yet, because the cow producing a little doesn't need the concentrates with the grain, but the question with me is whether you ran take that out or not. If you have a corn shredder and a husker you will have to have two silos on your place, because you want to feed your cows that are producing milk some grain and you have the grain already in the corn and what is the use to take it out for dairy cows. Then here is the young stuff that he doesn't want to give that corn to. I don't know about this point, I don't know whether it would be true or not. It may be cheaper if that corn wa3 out of that silage. It may be true you would have to have two silos, one for giving the milk cows silage with the corn in it, and one for the young stuff with the corn out of it and feed them just the stalks and alfalfa hay. I &lt;ion't know about that, it might be cheaper; it looks pretty reasonable, but you have to have two silos. Now in these reports we are far from an ideal system for feeding, and yet they are feeding nothing but bran for the grain ration and are not feeding any corn where they ought to be feeding more corn. Cut it down as cheap as possible. I agree with Mr. Roberts there, we don't all do that. With a pure bred herd the man sells young stuff and the milk is really a side issue with him. He is selling young stuff at high prices and making lots of money, at least he buys a farm once in a while and pays for it and he makes his money out of the young stuff more than he does out of his milk; he does not care if he just comes out even on the milk proposition; he still would be ahead because his young stuff helps him out and he is trying to produce milk alone, he is trying to make money out of the milk and live stock both together. (Lots of these people here on the state farm speak for themselves, largest percent of the dairy products are produced by the diver - ri farmer who has a few cows in connection with the rest of his i so that he can feed the by-products; nobody doubts that. But e men who are running intensified dairying have a better market their product by having something else that reimburses them so </seg>

And this question about the silos, I nope, is clear. Now t this report of the cow testing- association; these men are get* their returns out of the profit on their milk, but we cannot show figures from some of our associations that will put a new light he thing entirely, so I want to call on Mr. Nelson and ask for a figures from the report of his association. Mr. Nelson: I have a comparison here for ;i number of years; some three years ago there was a herd of common cows in our asso - ciation which gave a net profit in six months of £60.00. There was also in this association the leading herd of high producing pure breds which gave a net profit in the same time of $900.00. We have at our farm a cow that we think very much of that ate at one time as high as twenty-five pounds of grain in one day and for the first six months in this year she has given us a net profit of $100.50. We were not trying to get an economical amount of feed for, us you will notice, by comparing the enormous amount of grain we were feeding, she would give as much net profit in six months as these .sixty head of cows. I believe it is high time to educate the dairyman how to feed his cow. Mr. Hunter: I want to say a few words in regard to feeding th&lt; dairy cow for economic production, and a few words in regard to the red cow for the fanner. I have fed some dairy cows here at the sta - tion, and we have pure bred cattle at home. I had charge of the sta - tion here for a year and a half and I want to say in regard to the kind of feeding the experiment station is advocating, that it is the kind we have always found brought the best results. Mr. Coon and I used to go over the matter together and he would say, "Give your cows every pound of grain they will take," and these were fed with a view of getting a balanced ration most economically and at the same time a ration that was returning a good deal more per dollar for every pound of grain that we fed them than the cow that was roughed along on alfalfa. I never feed a pound of grain to a growing heifer, a common heifer; I don't think she returns it. But the dairy heifer at some time in her career will return more dollars and cents on that grain than any average cow that I was feeding. We can't expect to develop and raise a good dairy heifer and expect her to do the best and give the best results from the time she freshens if she is not fed grain. I feed her the same way I expect to feed her when she becomes a cow. tin regard to the record on an animal, we have to have both a rd and a history of that animal and what he is apt to do, or we d have no idea what the offspring of that cow would be. Those </seg>
            <seg id="p130">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 127 cows don't go on and breed this fine type of offspring nnliMt they have a record back of them for generations. Once in a while we have a poor cow coming from wonderfully well bred stock; there is something wrong; her offspring may be a wonderful improvement over the cow. It is the blood back of the cow $hat counts; a pure bred cow with a registration is the only means we have for telling what this cow is. except as we find it with the Babcock tester and scales. Of course the ration doesn't mean that she must be maintained any more than the red cow if she doesn't produce, but the average cow that produces milk and cream in Nebraska is the red cow. Can we afford in this of Nebraska to go on breeding those kind of cows whose average III pounds now? The best thing for Nebraska today is this Experi - t Station which is sending out information, advocating the best hods for feeding, breeding, producing and raising the best kind of le for the state. The interests of this Experiment Station are all the farmers and for bettering his condition and helping him. They t want to advocate anything that will make him become poorer year, but they want to increase his income year by year. t Professor Frandsen: I realize it is getting late, but after all it a serious thing because if you wait until after the students have bed you can get a much better dinner. Mr. Roberts and I had a t discussion on this matter last night. He says — and I don't know we can disagree after all — Professor Woodward gave him the figures E&gt; u.-ed, and we agree in pretty nearly every particular. If you back a year you will find that less than 1'', of those who were na in New York, that is, less than 7&lt;^ of the men were engaged lling just one product and breeding pure bred stock. Now the successful farmers, the large percent of them, are the tie who do something else besides dairying. They are raising and ing hogs and making the best possible use of the skimmed milk. Roberts is a good natured fellow and we often have these dis- Kons and much good comes from them. I am reminded of a story: were talking on cow testing at one place when one fellow said ' wasn't a bit of money in dairying; another fellow said there was ■ lot of it; so it was difficult to know how the situation should be checked up. One person said it reminded him of an experience he had one time when he was talking: A lady said, "I want to have a talk with you, as I am doing everything you say and if you will come back here after the meeting I will show you my book. I have every item of expenditure." He said he would be glad to do so, so after the meeting she produced her book. She had $3.60 for groceries; $3.14 for tw hat, bought at a bargain sale; some dr goods, and an item . K. He passed over the account, and found another grocery bill something else, and another item H. O. K. $7.00, so he went on to the bottom of the list and said, "That looks very fine, but there Ee item there that puzzles me. She said. "What is that?" He I "don't know what H. O. K. means?" She said, "Oh, dont yon what that is? That means heaven only knows what that was </seg>
            <seg id="p131">128 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION P." So while we agree with Mr. Roberts and believe that he tely right on this generalized dairy business and that it is for us here, yet if we are going to take up dairying with t cows because we can't get men sufficiently intelligent to i of them, and who do not feed them intelligently, I think jly knows how we are going to make money out of the dairy in this state where we have so many good advantages. There is one thing that Mr. Roberts and everybody else ought to understand, and Mr. Roberts does, perfectly, because he is familiar with our work, that is, that everything is divided up into departments. No matter how we want to dq we have to follow certain conventional lines; we have our history department, our husbandry department, our agricultural department and others and naturally each department has to stay in its own boundaries. Anything we buy has to be bought at the actual, natural, market price. We tell all of our students to raise everything they can on their home place; we can't do that because the state has not dealt liberally enough with us with land. We have to buy in the market and we increase the cost over what any cow testing association has where the things are figured on the basis of the actual cost of growing them. I expected you would be immensely interested in this question of the cost of producing milk, and 1 was so glad that Mr. Roberts opened this discussion, as we gave him those figures to get all of the fun out of the discussion we could. Nobody is more anxious to get figures on the actual cost of milk production than your dairy department here; I hadn't intended to say anything about it. I believe you are all aware that Dean Burnett is trying various ways to see if we can't get a little money so we can put a man out to spend his entire time gathering statistics on the actual cost of producing milk. That man would also gather figures under actual farming con - ditions and not under our conditions. When in town you like to be up in style and we have to have more help than you do, so these figures on milk production should not be gathered at a station where labor and everything is high and we have to have everything in show con - dition. Most of these cows are used for experiments. Here we give experiment rations and try out new things and the average experiment is a losing thing. Here we can afford to carry out certain experiments at a loss, which, if divided up on every cow, makes the cost very small, but it is a mighty expensive thing for ever department to ex - periment on. That is the reason I am not in favor of paying much attention to what it costs to produce milk in any state institution be cause the buildings are very expensive and you have to have some cows that are not profitable. So these figures on the actual cost of milk production must be under actual farming conditions and we hope we will get enough money to secure a man to go from farm to farm and get the actual figures on practical dairy farms. Just as Professor Propps is trying to tell you how to feed and breed and weed out your poor cows, so you know the work he is doing is a good work. It is as good work as we can do and it would be better if we knew exactly </seg>
            <seg id="p132">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 129 what it costs to produce milk under various conditions in this state; then we can talk in a more practical way and that is why I am glad Mr. Roberts brought out the points he has. Mr. Severe: There is one thing I wish to corroborate in Professor Frandsen's statement and help Mr. Roberts out a little. As a dairy - man I look to Professor Frandsen to do this experimenting for me, I expect to pay for it. He has an opportunity that I don't have and I come here to hear about it year after year and expect to benefit myself by the experiments carried on by this state. Many of them will be expensive and I cant' afford to do it, but after they have been tried out here in the State Farm, I can see the results and I immediately take hold of it. Now in regard to brother Roberts, he and I are good friends, and as he stated, I have had quite a little experience. I used to feed cattle but was driven out of my business and went to dairy - ing. I was partly driven out from the fact that I couldn't get enough hay from my neighbors to feed my steers without paving an exorbitant price for it. First, I got 200 acres of corn and run it through the shredder and I solved the roughage problem in a .- hort time; some of my neighbors looked down their noses and said that man was going to starve. There is no question but that thousands of acres of good feed is left standing in the field that could be used to great advantage, even for producing milk if properly take care of, the grain extracted, and the cows allowed to use it through the winter partially as a feed. I can't agree with all that has been said. I believe that a cow that labors eleven months under good feed ought not to be starved one month to lessen the cost. I think she has earned it and I am robbing her if I don't give it to her. I can put that roughage that stands out here in the field and is partly going to waste to better advantage than the average farmer is doing it I want to tell you of a little expe - rience I had this year: We had an early frost and I had seventy acres of corn and part of it I intended to cut and run through my shredder, but there came a big rain and the binders would not run and we had a whole lot of other work and I said, "Here is 130 acres of alfalfa in the stack and in the barn and I don't particularly need it so when the boys cut off the corn I will turn the cows in there and feed it up." We did that for four weeks and what was the result? At the end of four weeks my herd was producing twenty gallons of clean milk less per day than when I started in. I know that for the week after I quit feeding my cows the alfalfa and was keeping them at home and in the shape I did before they came back again, I know that was responsible for it. There is another thing, I believe in feeding my calves. I want my calves to keep growing from the time they are born until they freshen. I want a big cow and I believe it pays. Mr. Roberts: The only reason I put that question in here was because I wanted to get this discussion on what I think is the real point of issue. I am not used to making public speeches, I can't always think fast enough and I give a false impression very often. I was not here for the purpose of knocking on the instructions given at the </seg>
            <seg id="p133">130 State Farm. I am knocking on the question of feeding to the extent that we should have specialized products for feeding, when we have and ought to use the things on the farm and not let the things that we have go to waste, and when you can get such a side issue as that of dairying by that method. Now it has been said that all of your corn should be put in the silo, but I am in favor of feeding alfalfa and I am not in favor of starving your cattle. I am in favor of using the stuff on the place that is otherwise going to waste. That is special - ized fanning when we are raising nothing else to feed on certain acres of ground and that is what we will come to if we dont have anything else to feed but alfalfa, corn, grain, silage and pasture. That is what I meant rather than giving any knocks on the instructions given at the Farm, when I said if you follow those methods of fanning and didn't use any feed except that which is produced specially for your milk cows. I am figuring milk product at the price the average farmer Kfor his milk. I am figuring the butter fat at the price for which can afford to make it into butter. I say there is little enough pay you in the length of your life to take any chances of your cows g badly like the fellows usually have. IThe whole industry has changed a great deal in the last few years, cost of grain has doubled since I went into the milk business, and makes a big difference. We used to have no other purpose than lilk the cows where you could make use of the feed created as a roduct and grain farming; and that is exactly the discussion I ted to thresh out in the case of specialized dairying. I may have n the impression that the methods of taking care of the cows wasn't the most effective, but I want to say I heard them here and I used them, and I would do it again. I don't mean to say that I (*t learn right here how to produce milk and get the high pro - ion of milk. I used that information to the best advantage, but luldn't say that it isn't good. Yet the method of using feed costs money for every pound you use, and the method and practice of farmers that is losing ground in this state is decreasing and the production is increasing on the other line. That is exactly what eant to convey here and not to give out the impression the way I. I think some people have tried to shoot at my remarks by setting omething I didn't mean to be shot at. C. J. Carlson: Something especially comes to my mind in regard to this discussion we have heard from this gentleman from Wisconsin that seems to me is not right. I read years ago that they had silos up there and their corn was cut in the same manner and put in the silos as we are doing here now. I don't know whether the statement was true but I found out that it was not the proper way to do and we quit siloing and put up what we call the stover, that is, cutting the stalks. They use the stocks the same as in the silo and it has proven, according to the statement that I have heard, that it was the cheapter way of doing. If that is true, then it would be better to do that. I think I will try some of that myself. It is an advantage over shred- </seg>
            <seg id="p134">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 131 ■ ling because you can save the fodder and it doesn't spoil. In my neighborhood shredding, a few years ago, was all the go but they found out they couldn't save it. If you put it up in shocks or in pile* like they do in New York and probably in Wisconsin, they claim that that silo as compared with the stover lost a certain percent of its digestive nutritive. If that is the case, I should think the best way would be to use the stover where the silo is not profitable. I have cut up corn and helped nil silos and when I figure the expense and look at the conditions I have come to the conclusion that at the pres - ent prices of grain the silo is a losing proposition; it can never be made to pay. I don't care how they feed it under the present prices. What the cow will make, depends altogether on the grain you feed her. I would like to find out whether that discussion on the experiment in regard to Stover and the silo is true or not. t Professor Haecker: My experience has been that the men who n't a silo are inclined to tell us that it doesn't pay. Now, here is an from Wisconsin and they have used it for thirty years. The that haven't silos are piling it in the shock because they don't ■ the money to spend for silos. I move we adjourn. The time for adjournment having arrived, a recess was taken until 2:00 o'clock this afternoon. STATE FARM. LINCOLN, NEBRASKA, FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, 1916 Afternoon Session, 2:00 O'clock P.M. The President: Ladies and Gentlemen: We have endeavored to plan the program in this way that the last numbers should not be the least by any means, and we have reserved until now a number which we think is of very great interest to a great many members, and a matter of great curiosity to many of our members. The dairy - man is always looking for something modern and for new ideas for carrying on their business, so we have arranged to have a talk on milking machines by a man who has had, and is having practical work - ing experience with the help of a milker. I know that the people milking any considerable number of cows are interested to know how he is getting along, and what he has to say, is going to influence them a great deal, no doubt. I am sorry that we haven't more of our members back this afternoon, for I am sure they would like to have been here. We will now hear from Brother Severe, of Palmyra, on the subject of "Pro and Con of the Milking Machine." Mr. Severe spoke as follows: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen I think they made a mistake to call on me for a public speech, as I am no speaker. However, I have had a little experience with the Sharpies Milker, but I want to state that I am not here to advocate the merits of the Sharpies Milker any further than that I have had actual experience with it. I don't know a single thing about any </seg>
            <seg id="p135">132 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION other machine, as I have had no experience with them. As I under - stood it, when our secretary called on me, he asked for my experience and I am going to give it right to the mark. It doesn't matter where the chips fall, and if it hurts he can utilize it. I am that kind of Ei. I don't want to mislead the young men of this association, here for their interest. My days will soon be gone and I want ve something behind me that will benefit the future generation. To start out with, I will say that I installed a Sharpies milker about fifteen months ago and kept a man there for two weeks to instruct me, and I even asked him when he was about to go why it was that he left his guages about two inches below the requirements of the instruction book. "Well," he said, "that is all right." Well, I didn't know a thing about it and I called on a nephew of mine, a grad - uate from the University of Missouri as a mechanical engineer, to help me out last winter. He came, and he didn't know anything about the machine. I want to say right here before I go any further, that I would just as soon discard the binder on my place as to discard my milking machine, but don't understand me to say that the milkinp machine isn't very complicated. It requires better judgment, and more care and looking after than the binder. It has a different mechanism on which to work — you take a binder and run it against a thorn or bosh and knock a section out and it don't make much difference, but if I put my teat cups on a valuable cow and find her teats swelled up for the full length, I know I have done something wrong, and if I dont know how to remedy it, it will cost a lot of money to find out, because the company, as I say, had failed to do their duty. In the first place the boys running the machine said, after the man was gone: "The instructions say that the guage should stand at seventeen and it is only fifteen." We were getting along fairly well but I could notice a little trouble at the ends of a few of the cow's teats, which is very noticeable and easy to detect after a man has had a little experience. "Well," said I, "we are doing pretty well and we had better let well enough alone," and I held them down for two weeks. Finally my son came down and said, "Pa, there Ls the instructions and there is the guage; why don't you go according to instructions?" The boys were having some trouble with the teat cups dropping off. And I found that my pressure was just as much out of line as my vacuum, and I am very thankful that it was so, because it was my only salvation. If the pressure hadn't been so you couldn't turn it on and off, I would have ruined my whole herd. When I let them weight that vacuum down until it registered seventeen that is all that saved me. Out of thirty -two cows, as I lemember that we were milking, in the four days that they were weighing it, I had twelve cows with their udders swelled up, two ruined and with two I lost a quarter with the best care I gave them. Then my foot went down and I pulled them off. There was something wrong and I said. "I am going to appeal to the company," which I did, an&lt;l the same man came back that installed the machine. When he installed it </seg>
            <seg id="p136">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 133 he had no tester with him. He simply put the guages up there that the company sent. I supposed they were right, but I believe he was convinced for he seemed to be a gentleman, and he was a good me - chanic and did his work well and I was perfectly satisfied. But there is where he fell down. When he came back the second time he had a couple more vacuum guages and he put one on the line, and there was nine inches of difference after I had taken those weights off. It is a wonder — it is simply a wonder — that I didn't ruin the whole herd. All that saved me was carrying all the pressure that the ma - chine was capable of carrying — that saved me from a worse trouble that I would have gotten into. I put one on and it showed that there was better than six — three different testers of nine inches. Now I hold the company for that. I think they are doing wrong in that respect. The man that installed the milking machines was an ex - perienced man and should have put them on correctly. They did the same thing with my son this fall. The machine was installed before he got his stanchions and he couldn't try it before, so he had the same experience with his machine. He called me up one night and said, "How is it?" I said, "You have too much vacuum, you can tell just as quickly as you take the teat cups off whether the machine is working properly or not. It is the little end of the teat head. The farther up it is, the more natural it will run. But it threw the cows off their feed and made them sick in two or three cases. I believe I have had as much to discourage me in the milking machine business as any man in the state when I got up against a proposition of that kind; they couldn't have done worse under any circumstances. I wrote back to the company and said: "These two guages you sent here with you installer don't agree, and I want another. I have tried five on my line and they don't agree. There is a difference of from nine down to one and one-half inches of variation, so I can't depend on them " I didn't know it at first but I know now. I put the machine to working and I run my thumb up in the teat cup and I could tell, with a little experience, when I had enough. I thought it was hugging a little bit too tight, so I set my valves with my thumb and I laid my guages on the wall for an ornament and for others to look at, and I didn't pay any more attention to them. When I go into the barn and start the machine I see that those guages are working properly and perfectly and see that my register up there on the guage is fifteen {■■toad of seventeen, but I am here to say that a fellow who has a machine that he is running at seventeen, if he will put my guage on his machine and run it at seventeen on his herd of cows will ruin some of them very quickly. Seventeen inches of vacuum on the aver - aire herd in our country is more than they will stand. »Now the operator must be a man of considerable judgment. I use units in my plant and I have two boys who handle them. I am nd of a go-between. I watch them every time — I know my cows, when I see them milking a cow easier than another I follow them </seg>
            <seg id="p137">134 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION iand say, "I guess I will strip this one," and if I notice the least of a lump in the end of the teat I show it to them, and I have boys trained so that I can come up and show them. I have one I believe is an expert and I would like to send him out there hat man who went down and in two weeks ruined his herd. I &gt;ve he could fix him up so he would be all right I Now they say the teat cups will drop off, but it is an easy matter x that. We use a strap hung on one end with holes in the other, if a cow is liable to drop her cups on the front teats frequently will drop out of the others a little. With this strap you can tort them and they will hold them up. You can go right on and lappy and know how to get the milk, and you won't get any . iirt ., either. It requires, as I have already stated, better judgment and morv care in taking care of milkers than any other machine I ever tried. The pulsator is a delicately constructed machine. The ax is filled with holes and grooves, and a little chunk of dirt may make a great difference in either the air or vacuum but, by the sound, one who has become accustomed to it can tell whether it is working all right or not. There is just as much danger in running your pulsator too fast as in running it too slow. You don't give the pressure time to do its duty — say that fifty-five is about the proper number of times it should pulsate. If you run it too slow the same result will follow. so there is danger, and it must constantly be watched; and the man that don't want to watch it isn't fit to handle the machine. He had better milk his cows by hand all his life rather than undertake to use a milking machine and expect good results. He never can have them. I have had quite a lot of trouble in getting men that were con - sidered first class. I really only have one now, but if you have a good one he will hold the other fellows up to a great extent. Take it on a cold morning, when the thermometer registers 22 and the vapor from the milk will freeze the valve on the lead; you can do nothing if you are not careful. One of the boys went right along and had no trouble: the other one froze up his machine and could do nothing, and th - first boy had already gotten through. I said, "Louie, take that ma - chine and go over and help Conny out," and he did so. I say it take - more tact and more judgment to run a milking machine than any other machine I know of, but I would sooner dispense with any other machine on my place than with the milker. I The President: We will hear further along this same line froai W. L. Hunter, of Lincoln, who will give us his experience and rvation of the matter. Mr. Hunter spoke as follows: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: We are here in the interest of the dairy industry of the state Nebraska. It is going to be one of the most important industries </seg>
            <seg id="p138">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 135 Nebraska, and a good dairy cow is the greatest factor in the dairy industry in this state. As we go out through the state, one of the drawbacks we hear of towards keeping cows is the trouble to milk them. For years and yean people of a mechanical turn of mind and manufacturers have been working and trying to solve this problem with a mechanical milker, and in making it they have had the hardest proposition of any form of implement with which to deal, for they have had to deal with nature. They have had to supplant the action of man in taking this milk from the cow in such a way that they could do it efficiently, that is, in a short time, and at the same time keep the cow perfectly i-ontented: no cow gives the best results unless she is contented; you can feed her any way you want to but if she is discontented you will get results, and that was one of the hardest things to overcome, the production of a machine that wouldn't make the cow nervous, so That she would keep calm and would respond to it. tThat has been a good many years ago and we now have a good \ types of machines; it has only been within the last ten years we have had a milking machine that was anywhere near a suc - and that would bring the milk from the cow in such a way that would take to the machine. §In 1906 I attended the First National Dairy Show at Chicago, had our herd of cattle and there was a milking machine on the ml in the Coliseum building. So we took our cows there to milk &gt; twice a day for ten days, and we came back very much enthused that proposition. The only drawback was we handled two cows at a time and each cow is an individual, you can't handle them in bunches. Following that in 1907 or possibly in 1906 the Experiment Station put in a milking machine. They kept it here nearly two years, and we watched it and saw the results. The results, as we figured them at the Station, were like this: The machine wasn't very efficient. They didn't get quite the results from the cows as they did by hand milk - ing. In some cases they got more and in some less, but covering an average of about fifty pounds less of butter fat. One thing in which they lacked efficiently, they didn't milk as fast; the machine was on each cow from nine to fifteen minutes in taking the milk. We decided that the milking machine wasn't what we wanted. A few years later they came to us and said, "Here is a machine that handles each cow separately and takes the milk in from three to five minutes." It was a new machine on the market, and we waited awhile and watched the development of it. Two years ago in February I went back to Illinois. I went to Chicago and to Mendota, and spent a week in that country where they were using a good many milking machines, so we bought and installed one on our home place at Raymond and we operated it for about nine months. Then it got to be a question of efficiency, not of the machine. Whether it was efficient, with a pure bred herd where we wanted to weigh and keep each cow's milk separate and make a record, and unless the machine was making better time than we </seg>
            <seg id="p139">136 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION did by hand-milking we couldn't afford to waste our time. What we wanted was to make it a labor saver, and if it wasn't it would not be any advantage to us. It was just as much work to run the milking machine as to do it by hand in the period of time we were milking with this machine, and we found out this much: that it takes a good man to run a milking machine, but it takes less of them. Another thing, if you are running a milking machine the efficiency of the ma - chine depends on the size of the herd. A man on an eighty acre farm could take eighteen or twenty cows and do his own milking while it would be quite a drag to do it by hand milking, but in a commercial dairy where there has to be so much help anyway, unless the dairy runs up to fifty or sixty cows, I don't believe a machine will pay; they are more efficient than hand-milking where they are milking from thirty cows up and in that case I think the labor and time saved pays more than the depreciation on the machine. As a result we weighed the cows' milk apart from each at every milking and finished out the test. One instance that I could give: we had a heifer who freshened in eighteen months and five days. We milked her about half by hand and finished with the machine, and the last lactation period was as large as any time during the period and during her eleventh month was her high period. When she had milked five months on the machine it was her highest; as high, I am satisfied, as it would have shown in the later period of her lactation. Of course, we don't weigh the milk as carefully as they do at the Station, but we raised these cows and we had been with them day after day and knew them as well as any member of the family. We knew just about what to expect of them, as we have milked them very nearly a year by hand and are perfectly satisfied as far as the results are concerned. We got as good results as the average hand milker, and as good as we could get under the best conditions of hand milking. If a man has to hire a good deal of his milking done he is fortunate if he finds good milkers right through; milkers that will go in and take the cow's milk, and take the amount they should. That is the trouble, they will milk a few milkings and they sit there and the cow doesn't give down her milk. The milking machine makes it uniform and takes the same amount each and every time, providing the man operating the machine will look after it and keep it working in that kind of a condition. Another thing about the milking machine: If 1 were feeding a herd of cattle I would rather have the machine than the average hand milker, but if I was taking care of a herd of sixty cattle it would depend on the man I would have rather do it, for I could personally t after each and every cow's udder. I would know whether each was being milked each time; I could see better than if I had four ve milkers by hand, for how would I know whether this or that was milking his cow clean? You can't insert the machine after and have it strip the cow, for it makes him sore to have you go nd strip after him. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 137 Another thing about the machine: they say yon have to strip after it and that you can't milk your cows clean, but that is not true. I don't want a man to go into my barn and milk my cows and me never say anything about it. A man is interested in his own cattle and the only way you can know whether they are all right or not is to get down under them and find out. You can't treat an organi - zation like a dairy cow or a piece of machinery. One trouble is that the manufacturers of milking machines can't furnish a set of brains with each of their machines. A great many people seem to think you can milk a cow by pushing a button and you have it ready to go out in the wagon. The milking machine won't do that. I had a little experience in Wisconsin this summer. 1 was there weeks and I found, incidentally, where machines had been used nuously for seven years. The men with whom I talked are getting r results than we did, the average milkers. I said, "can you milk?" said, "I don't know whether I can milk with a machine or not, I know I can get better results than I could with the average milker." I Another thing, Mr. Severe says he had trouble in putting in his tine. We were fortunate, as we didn't have the trouble he had. ; evening I was talking with Mr. Ball of Albion, Nebraska, who after he had his machine in seven days he had eight cows ruined laving large and inflamed udders. I "The trouble with our machine," he said, "was in the installing .." Just what the trouble was is hard to say, and, of course, Mr. is naturally very bitter against milking machines. iWe have a pure bred herd in the vicinity of Lincoln and father taken a good deal of personal interest at all times in this herd, aid only repeat what we were talking about the other day in regard lilking machines. He did a good deal of stripping, and after nine :hs stripping after the milking machines he was convinced that machine at least never hurt the cows. I The President: Further, with regard to this discussion, we have us the representatives of three manufacturers of milkers. All 1 asked permission to talk milking machines a little and we have ted a pledge from them that they are not to state who they are whom they represent. They are just to talk from the broad stand - t of milking machines, and tell the people about them and what can do. I will first call upon Mr. Bowles of the Empire people. Mr. Bowles spoke as follows: Mr. Chairman and Dairymen of Nebraska: It was most gratifying I think to the other representatives of the various manufacturers, or was to me at least, to sit here and listen to both of the gentlemen who preceded me speak and relate their ex - periences as regards the mechanical milkers. K didn't come here prepared to discuss at any length the milking lea; in fact I simply was informed last night while in Omaha meeting of this kind was being held, and my company sated </seg>
            <seg id="p141">138 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION me to come here and listen to your remarks and make any remark - in reply that you might desire. In the manufacture of the mechanical milker as stated by the previous speaker, the manufacturers of thest - machines had things with which to contend that manufacturers of machines for other purposes did not have. For instance, we are work - ing on human beings, or rather not human beings but cattle, which ar&gt; to some extent subject to every little condition such as feed, environ - ment and so forth. In the first place the one thing that made the greatest difference in the operation of a milker was to get something that most anyone could operate without having any great trouble, and without any great effort be able to operate it under all conditions. For instance, it is a known fact to every dairyman that feed affects th« - glands and udder of the cows to a large extent. t[ will relate to you a little instance that happened about two months where I had occasion to sell a milker. I put the milker in an 1 him we would guarantee it to do all we claimed for it, and not jure the cows in any respect, which we do. After running the &gt;r for a period of about two weeks or so I happened to be in neighborhood and stopped to see the user of that machine. He highly pleased with it so far and informed me that if it continued ) the work as it was doing at the time, it would be entirely satis - ry. Of course, as this was the first machine going into this section rere very much interested in it and didn't want any little technical error on the part of the user to give us a black eye in that section. At the end of thirty days I again happened in that section and went out to see that man and he came to me with tears in his eyes and said. "I am using the milker but I have eight cows to the bad. and it M doubtful, but I may lose two or three quarters." I have been in the milk business three years and have been up against all kinds of con - ditions. I knew that the machine was not responsible, yet I appreciated that man's condition of mind and I proceeded to investigate. So after looking over the dairy and the stable I saw a door opening into a silo. There were two large silos built of concrete, which he had built him - self. I climbed down in and I said, "What kind of feed is this?" He said, "Silage." I got down into the silo and looked all over it and took some of the silage up and smelled of it, and then looked at the man and said, "What do you think of your silage, do you think it is all right?" He scratched his head and said, "I can't see why it isn't." But it didn't smell just right to me, but if I had put that up as an argument right there that man would have been skeptical and would naturally have assumed that I was endeavoring to protect myself; but he was a man who was honest, as most men are, and after I got out of the silo I stood in the door talking with him with regard to the situation, and he said, "Would it make any difference if that silo had not been empty last year and I was feeding silage two years old?" Well, I told him frankly that I thought it would, in fact I was quite positive of it. I think any dairyman will agree with me that if yon </seg>
            <seg id="p142">139 THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION It in the bottom and leave it there and put other on top of it and ■ the alcohol in the corn to settle there, it would contaminate the to such an extent that it would have an effect on the cows, es - lly in the fall when the frost was coming on. I told the man :ly that I thought that was the trouble and I was convinced of it. aid, "If you say so, I will continue to use it." I said, "Use it by all is." There were two cows in that herd that lost quarters and the came around all right, and that man is using that machine today prizes it more than any other machine he has on his farm. In 1 years' experience that is the only case I have met with, and I him frankly what the trouble was or the cause of the trouble. i()f course the previous speakers have referred to the machines ; compliacted. Some are and some are not, but the principle aim 11 manufacturers is to get them as simple as possible, and get &gt;thing that the southern negro, who is the poorest mechanic of can operate; that is what we have to contend with. It is my anal belief that of the four or five milkers manufactured today by K&gt;anies of any size, all of them will work and it is only the case of man who is operating them. Some men can work some milkers some can't, but the principle aim is to get a machine that will ate with as little left to the judgment of the operator as possible. for instance, I believe one gentleman referred to the length me it required to milk the cows and stated that with their outfit E quired from nine to fourteen minutes, which r.o doubt was true. at the present time for all of the four leading milkers on the et. I think they figure about five or six minutes, sometimes four, it depends on the cow. As the gentleman stated, you can't have your pulsator too fast or too slow as that regulates the squeeze, but it should go about fifty-five times a minute. If it goes too fast it does not allow the teat of the cow to fill, and if it goes too slow it leaves a steady suction on the teat for a period of time which should not be there. The aim, of course, is to keep the circulation in the cow's teats in their normal condition, and if the milk of the cow was all in the udder when it was brought into the stable and all we had to do was to go and get it out of the udder, all the manufacture of a mechanical milker would have to do would be simply the task of getting a machine which would excite the nervous system or that part of the nervous system which enters into it; but as you see the machine massages the teats and excites the nerves and in the period of milking it comes out of the system of the cow and is separated from a part of her blood and the whole aim of the manufacturer is to get a machine that will reproduce that effect and yet not excite the cow's whole nervous sys - tem. The four or five leading manufacturers today, I am convinced, have milkers that will operate and do the work without injury to the cows; it is simply the matter of choice of the man who is buying as to which in his mind is the simplest and will be the easiest to operate. IMr. Imrie: I want to correct the statement of the gentleman who spoke in regard to the silage. Many and many a silo in oar state </seg>
            <seg id="p143">140 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION is used for summer feeding and is ready to fill again in the fall and there oftentimes is some left in these which is bright and clean and we simply fill it right on top of that. He made the statement that the alcohol in the silo would run down into the lower part. I think Professor Haecker and also Professor Frandsen will bear me out in this statement that if our corn is cut in an immature state there will be a large percentage of sugar in the corn and if there is over 3% there is a certain bacciliae which takes hold and changes the sugar into alcohol. This is where the gentleman made the mistake, he said it was left there by the alcohol, but another set of bacci!iu&gt; - takes hold and changes it into acetic acid or vinegar and if there is too much acetic acid it is called sour food, but in the process, if the corn has a large percent of sugar, it turns to acetic acid and then we have less than Vi oi sugar in the corn; if the bacciliae takes hold and changes the sugar left into alcohol, and the next set into lactic acid and the next set into acetic acid. Professor Haecker: While that statement is approximately cor - rect, we know that silage has alcohol in it but from three weeks old it has never been known to possess it in all the analysis I have ever heard of. It is true there may have been too much acetic acid in it and it may have been that the silage was at the point of division when he arrived there. In Wisconsin I saw in a barn a man feeding silage four years old; that often happens in Wisconsin and New York, but it was the best silage I ever saw. The man said the cattle were doing splendidly on it. The way they did that was by putting new silage on top of the old, but they see to it when they put the new silage on top of the old that the old, rotten silage is thrown out until you come to the bright, new silage and then you will have no difficulty. Professor Frandsen: I am glad that this explanation about ai cohol came up, because after I came here — -of course we have been push ing the silo proposition quite extensively — a delegation of the W. C. T. U. came here. They had been carrying on a campaign for prohibition, and they expressed the profoundest regard for the babies; that we ought to be doing something here for the babies of the state in regard to the habit forming that would develop in the children doinjr the milk - ing. We had a good time convincing them there was no alcohol in the silage and that it was vinegar and lactic acid just the same as you get in milk. Mr. Lindgren has just cleaned up a silo which ha. - silage four years old in it. There is a story they tell down in Kansas: they had a campaign there against silage when the county was dry. A man put in a silo and when he got down to the bottom, as the story gw, the farmer found liquor in it and he took considerable pleasure in partaking of it. His neighbors got to watching him, and, as the story goes, there were ninety more silos put in the county the next I Mr. Imrie: Sometimes we don't get just what we are looking for that makes me think of a story I heard not long ago. A fellow he name of Sim Simmons, who was a nice fellow, but. who, when </seg>

He got to be pretty noisy and was entertaining everybody and finally a policeman came along and said, "You will have to go with me to the chief's office." That excited him and when he got into the chief's office the chief wm busy but finally looked up with a jerk and said, "What is your name?" Sim, being excited, tried to give his name but stuttered awfully. He said, "S-s-s-i-i-m-m S-s-s-i-i-m-o-n-n." The chief said, "Officer, what is that man charged with?" The officer said, "Soda water, I guess." Kte President: Further, with regard to the milking machine dis - i, we have Mr. Kindrett of the Sharpless people who has also to talk to us. We will listen to him now. tFrom the Audience: He was here this morning but had another gement for this afternoon and was unable to remain longer. He to have spoken this morning and stayed until we adjourned for er and had to leave. I am with the Sharpless people, but I am connected with that particular line of work, so you will have to that; he is the milker man and expected to give the talk. IThe President: Then we will listen to Mr. Rockwell, with the Imen people. t.Mr. Rockwell: Mr. Chairman, I believe it will be much better to a man who has used the machine to talk to you. I believe there two or three here who are using our machine and would prefer you would call on them. ■ The President: If you will give us the name of one of them we be glad to call upon him. Mr. Rockwell: Mr. A. M. Templin, of Palmer, Nebraska, is one. LThe President: .Mr. Templin, will you give us a few words about experience with the milking machine? Mr. Templin spoke as follows: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I want to state to this audience that I am not a speaker, but in order to understand the conditions I would have to go back a little and state to you that I am running a Jersey farm at Palmer, Nebraska. 1 have my herd up to fifty head. I told my man on the place last spring whenever he could milk fifty head we would hire a man to run a machine and we would pay him half and half out of the company check. Soon after that he got the required fifty head and I had an opportunity to look into the milking machines. I talked to my Ger - mans about it after Mr. Rothwell had been down to my place, and I said to these Germans, "If we can buy a machine for so much money, we will milk our cows in about an hour with three or four of you. and what is the use of six of you consuming more time to milk those cows? Wouldn't it be cheaper for us to buy a milking machine and do away with this extra hired man? You have to board him, but I have nothing to do with that; it is up to you." Well, we sent for a man who represented the company and he came up there and Charley — that is one of the Germans — two of those boys were right from the </seg>
            <seg id="p145">142 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION old country, that is, one has been here about a year and the other three yean — and Charley said, "If I can pick out the cow and he can milk her with that machine, we will buy one, and if he can't, we won't." So I said, "All right, that is pretty good business." So Mr. Rothwell took his machine and milked the cow; it was her first calf and she milked pretty hard, but at that time Mr. Rockwell didn't know that he was milking the hardest milker in the herd, but I want to say this: he milked the cow satisfactorily and we bought the machine sometime in May, I believe perhaps the last of May. The first evening we had six milkers and we milked the fifty cows. I should judge we had twenty-five pure bred heifers coming in last year and we had two or three cows that had teats that long (indicating about 8 inches) and we didn't get the right size cups for those big cows, but we attached those the best we could and started the machine and there was only one cow in the bunch that ever raised a foot. She raised her foot two or three times and kicked and then was still and that was all there was to it; the young heifers appeared very amusing — they chewed their cud and turned their head around, wondering what was going on. Now as to the machine, as I said, I was up against it. I told the boys if I couldn't get something to milk these cows, we would quit at fifty cows. I wanted to get my herd up to 100; that was my am - bition to have 100 cows all the time. When I saw these machines do the work, I felt all right, and these boys were on my place until the middle of September. I said to Charlie, the oldest of the two boys. "Now Charlie, you are going away and I want you to tell me just what you feel and think about these milking machines." He said, "Well, sir, if I had to milk twenty cows I wouldn't buy one, but if I had to milk more, I would." I Now here is one thing I noticed. Mr. Severe told us a story and elieve he told it truthfully. I don't know a bit more about the rpless than any other machine as I never saw anything but a Hind i, but as to the sore teats, we worked that machine all summer never had a cow that was the least bit sore. These two or three s that had the large teats couldn't give down their milk and when came to investigate we found that the cups didn't go up far enough t to the udder; they would only go up a little way on the teat and course they wouldn't give down their milk, but after we got that listed they gave down their milk. II want to say this; you understand I am not running these cows, I have got to go by what the other men on my farm have done. ' got so the three of them with the six units would milk from to sixty cows in an hour and twenty minutes and strip them. I Now, about the middle of September, these Germans that I had re sold out to another party who came well recommended but I beautifully bitten. Some gentleman had told him that I had hung the milking machine and wasn't going to use it any more. Now I say that part of that is true as to not using it, for about the e this man was on the place four months he turned down the milkers </seg>
            <seg id="p146">143 THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION and I cautioned him that he was making a mistake. He wasn't there three weeks until he came to me one day and said, "Mr. Templin, I don't understand it. but we have sixteen cows that went dry, and we can't keep them from going dry." I said, "That is your own fault; you quit the milking machine when I tried to get you to keep it going. You can't get half a dozen men to go into the barn and milk like a milking machine, because these young cows were taught prac - tically by the milking machine and with the machine every time they are milked exactly alike. Can't you see where the trouble is? The out - i-ome is we have sixteen dry cows, and we have never before had more than five or six; we have lots of cows that milk clear up to the time they come fresh. So the story is out that I quit using the machine, but I got Mr. Comstock — some of you members know Ned Comstock — and we got some new cups. I think we have about twelve or fourteen sets of cups now, but one of the arms broke during this cold weather and he hasn't been using the machine lately, but he will start using it in a few days and he says when he does he is going to keep right along with it. He milked with the machine several times before it broke and he says he has confidence in it and believes it will do the work. So Mr. Comstock will use the machine and we expect the very best results, but as long as those German boys were there — you know the Germans are great workers, but they haven't much ingenuity about them — we got along all right, but when you are talking about the milking ma - chines being very intricate, I want to say that after you start your gaso - line engine there is only one thing for you to learn. It doesn't make any difference what kind of a machine you are running, you are going to have a little trouble until you find out what to use best. You will find out with a little experience what size cups she takes: it will take you longer to milk the cows while you are learning that and then there is no trouble in milking with the machines. We milk sixty cows, four of them with six units in an hour and twenty minutes. I think that is all unless Mr. Rockwell has some questions to ask or anyone else. I want to say that we are perfectly satisfied with the milking machine and that whenever the story goes out that we threw away our machine, it it false and nothing to it. tThe President: We are pleased to get this information from these &gt;le. I think the only exception anyone will take to the remarks of last speaker is as to the ingenuity of the Germans. I think all world will admit that they are pretty ingenuous. Agent for Sharpless Milking Machine: I want to take away a little of the sting left by Mr. Severe in his talk and wish to state that after all the trouble he told about he bought another one for his son and they are both using their milkers today and are apparently satisfied. You noticed in his remarks that he recommended the milker although he said it was intricate. I noticed also by his talk that he didn't report any trouble at all until after he began operating one machine himself and that they didn't operate it according to the instructions </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 144 in the book, although he charged the man who installed the machine with the trouble, and Mr. Hunter is using the Sharpless milker. These are facts that I have gathered since I have been here. I am not prepared to give a talk, it is not in my line of work and I don't have any history about these deals, but perhaps a little later I might get in a little deeper. I didn't know the meeting would take this turn and that the representatives of the machines would be given the privilege of talking to you. BThe President: We are really surprised that your man passed lis date. 1 Sharpless Agent: In explanation to that 1 will say that he had ippointment for this afternoon that he couldn't very well break his talk was to have been given this morning. He waited until before he left. Ehe President: We will now proceed to the matter of unfinished 88, and the first thing on the program is the report from the ating committee by the chairman, Professor Haecker. REPORT OF NOMINATING COMMITTEE Mr. President: KWe, your Nominating Committee, have canvassed the situation ; thoroughly among the members of our Association and in order ave all branches represented recommend the following officers an-1 rtors for the year 1916: J. H. Frandsen, President, Lincoln, Nebraska. O. A. Severe, Vice-President, Palmyra, Nebraska. R. W. McGinnis, Secretary-Treasurer, Lincoln, Nebraska Directors E. W. Badger, Central City, Nebraska Fred Caldwell, Lincoln, Nebraska. Paul Hunter, Lincoln, Nebraska. W. Righter Wood, Omaha, Nebraska. Signed, A. L. HAECKER, W. RIGHTER WOOD W. C. ANDREWS, Nominating Committee I move that these names be balloted upon for our officers for the next year. Seconded by H. C. Young. Motion was put by the president, vote taken and carried. The President: This motion having carried, the candidates are declared by the Chair to have been elected, and I think it is high time that the next president of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association get out and say something to us in that capacity. Professor Frandsen. Professor Frandsen spoke as follows: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I think I am like the young lady who said, "This is so sudden." </seg>
            <seg id="p148">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 145 Pk 1 will tell a story about another young lady for I am aa uuboos -ve you as she was, aa the story goes. Some colored man called id said, "Is this Miss Susie Smith?" She said, "Yes, sir." He "I just called up to ask if you would marry me." She said. Ta* Who is this, please?" Without knowing any thing about the trials and tribulations of the office or its requirements, I accept, but I want to assure you that I feel it a distinct privilege and pleasure to have the opporuniy of serv - ing 1 you for he next year, yet I really believe that the office ought not to come to us because there are so many of you people actively en - gaged in the work all along the cow line or the creamery line, but if willing to try this experiment for a year, I shall endeavor to • your interests in every way I can. I thank you. Professor Haecker: I want to say just a word about our gavel as the Dairymen's Association is very proud of this. Professor Frandsen will probably have an opportunity to knock on the table with it, and possibly on something else. This gavel is made up of six or seven different kinds of wood grown in Nebraska; it was made down here ut the University. It has a band of solid silver around it, and on this silver band is engraved the names of all the presidents of the asso - riation for the last twenty-five years. We got clear around it and there isn't any more room and we want another band around it which will hold about twelve more names. We hope our new president will take this gavel and see that it has a new band put around it. I will say that 1 see something very beautiful about this band. When I was president I wanted all of the names of our presidents put down so I sent out the word to all the old presidents, and some of them were pretty old man ,as it was an association twenty-five years old. I told them what we were going to do and that it would cost about one dollar apiece. In about ten days I had a dollar from every one and with it a nice letter. This is one of the historical features of the Dairy Association, and we are now thirty-one years old and it is one &gt;f the best associations in the state. I hope next yeai to see a big band iround the middle of this handle. The President: The next in order will be the report of our Audit - np Committee, of which Mr. H. C. Young is chairman. Mr. Young reported for the committee as follows: REPORT OF AUDITING COMMITTEE We, the Auditing Committee, after carefully examining and check - ing the report of the treasurer, find that all of the accounts listed are correct Signed, H. C. YOUNG E. G. WOODWARD. J. E. VOGEL. The President: What shall we do with the report? </seg>
            <seg id="p149">146 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Professor Haecker: I move that the report be adopted, duly -•■&gt; onded and motion put by the Chair and declared carried. The President: We would like to ask our worthy and beloved secretary if he is willing- and will accept and serve for another year. We ought to have his consent at least. Secretary McGinnis: Mr. President, I regret that you called on me for I may say some things that you don't like, but I certainly appreciate this honor, brother members and sisters, and assure you that if it was done as a reward for (rood, hard, conscientious work I appreciate it all the more. Those who come here annually to our meet - ings and get enthused, and more enthused and still more enthused so that they would almost miss an ordinary dinner after they elect their officers, allows enthusiasm to die down and for the balance of the time your secretary attends to the work. I certainly enjoy this kind of work and I have made a study of dairying, ice cream and different lines of work that go with this, and I have taken a great interest in it and want to assure you that we are just getting nicely started and I will do all I can to help, aid, and assist in promoting this great :in&lt;l glorious work we are engaged in. I Now one thing about our out-going president. I want to tell you s that he is the meanest man I ever worked for. If he saw me ding still a minute, or if I was resting he would study up sonic g that he wanted me to do, and I want you to know what 1 have to put up with this past year. I didn't expect that from Pro - or Frandsen as we were on a special train for two weeks, talking cow gospel clear up to the state line, and they told us if we talked h cows any more they would shoot us, but they didn't, and the only g he did was to steal my clothes. The President: The next on our program is the butter maker Secretary: I am very sorry to report that among the butter mm and one who took a great deal of interest in our association every year, and who came out to the Farm during the short course, and was looked upon as one of the leading butter makers of the state, pmcd away last Wednesday morning, Brother Thomas Culp. I think the resolution committee should pass a proper resolution covering his death. I want to say to all of you present that your president and I took upon ourselves the duty to go down to one of the florist stores and spent $5.00 and sent a bouquet to Mrs. Culp. If there is any dissenting voice and you think we didn't do right, we will play 50-50 and pay it ourselves. I Now on the butter contest this year, which was sort of a starter, nt out a circular letter under the instructions of our president to y creamery in Nebraska, asking them if the association decided ave a butter scoring contest this year if they would agree to send - in the butter. I think I received replies from thirty-seven out of y-eight butter makers, so at the meeting of the directors they de - 1 to have the butter scoring contest and we appropriated the funds </seg>
            <seg id="p150">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 147 to pay the premiums. Professor Frandsen got so enthused that he spent $25.00 of his hard-earned money and bought this loving cup (introduces silver cup) to be presented to the butter maker scoring the highest and to be held one years and then returned the next year to our association meeting and to be given to the butter maker who then makes the highest score, and if the same man scores the highest, he can keep it for another year, but he will return it at the next meeting of the association and again compete. If he is a good enough butter maker to get the highest score the third year he keeps the cup and I suppose the professor would have to buy another one. Now on account of last week being the coldest weather we have had this winter — the creamery and ice cream people have had poor weather — the cream all came in frozen and we had the greatest effort to secure the number of entries, but we had a few to start with and I think we can get to going. I will now read the scores which are as rER SCORES AM) PLACINGS AT THE NEBRASKA DAIRY MEN'S ASSOCIATION— 1915 Marie Stelk, Grand Island _ 91 B. L. Kearns, Lincoln M John Jungles, Ravenna 9© 1 * H. G.

This butter will be sold — Professor Frandsen is going to sell it to the highest bidder and the returns will be made to the respective butter makers after we take out one dollar for their membership fee. Now I don't want to hold you too long, but we are almost through. Dont forget to take out a membership, it only costs you one dollar. This year we had printed some very elegant membership cards; we have one kind for the honorary life members, another for the life members and then another for the honorary members, such as our good friend, Mr. Imrie, from Wisconsin, for whom it was some effort to come out and help us. Then we have some regular membership cards which I believe are so neat and nobby that if you got on the street car or a railroad and present them to the conductors they will say, "Where do you want to go?" and will carry you right through. How- ever, I can't guarantee that. .1. M. Healy, Lincoln _ </seg>

This is ething that has only happened — we have only five men living — six ■s in thirty-one years, but this year, the golden year of the dairy ness, I want to place in nomination for your consideration two men m I think stand as peers in the national dairy business. Men who very large in their sympathies; men who would be an honor to any ciation, and who are liberal and giving of their time and money </seg>

W. Marsh of Waterloo, Iowa. Professor Frandsen: I want to call your attention, among other things, to one man who has rendered dairying a great service and who died the other day— Mr. J. H. Muir. I make the additional suggestion of his name and also of one of the pioneers in this state and one who, perhaps, has done as much as anyone for the dairy work and who is now practically on his death bed. I think he is also entitled to this honor; I refer to J. H. Rushton of Omaha, and with Professor Haecker's consent, I would like also to include his name. Professor Haecker: I gladly second that. I know the man and his work; he stands as a peer. While he hasn't figured particularly, yet I know this is a hall of fame. I know of a time when the state was young, and long before I ever knew anything about dairy business, that this man was laboring. He often got kicks and knocks, he was doing a great work, probably for himself, but at the same time it was a great work and the work of this man will be remembered where he labored in Nebraska for forty-five years. I remember the first time he got up and stated that we would come to the hand separator sys - tem. He told absolutely of the conditions we are under today; he told it like a prophet. He said a man who had spent thousands of dollars in skimimng stations would see them all closed. I second the nomination. Professor Frandsen : Mr. Embrea just spoke of another. I am sure it is an oversight on our part and I am sure that Mr. S. C. Bassett is entitled to membership in the hall of fame. Mr. Christ has just told me of something that hapepned twenty-five or thirty years ago. He said that Mr. Rushton not only took the lead in promoting dairying, but in alfalfa too; that he came down to the meetings and preached the gospel of alfalfa long before the Experiment Station was opened; those are men of large vision and we will do well to put them on our roll of honor, two from our own state and two from other states. Secretary: I am getting up pretty often, Mr. President, but I know it its near the end of your administration, and I want to mention a very good friend of Professor Haecker's. The professor is a very modest young man, but in all sincerity I want to say that he is one of the jjreat dairyman, that we look up to today. You can tell it if you will come up to my office and read the Minnesota reports, and what he has done for Minnesota. He did one of the grandest acts of his life when, he gave us Professor A. L. Haecker and while we are placing these men in our hall of fame, I would like to add the name of Professor T. L. Haecker. Mr. H. C. Young: I second the motion. The President: If there are no further remarks I will put the motion. Motion put and declared carried unanimously. Professor Haecker: I move that the secretary be instructed to write a letter to these gentlemen telling them they have been placed </seg>

Secretary: Coming out on the car, Mr. Allen or someone told me they were making an effort up in Wisconsin to have some sort of a Quadricentennial on account of Doctor Babcock giving the world the Babcock tester, and it might be worth our while to take some action here. We might want to send someone down there to represent Ne- A Member: I want to say that I received a letter from Professor Beckendorf of Chicago, saying that from the 7th to the 9th at Madison, Wisconsin, they were going to do something in recognition of Doctor Babcock for giving us the Babcock tester. You will remember what Mr. Bassett said yesterday that they used to measure one pound to the inch on the griass and after we got the Babcock tester we saved 25' i. This is a sort of a celebration given in honor of Doctor Babcock for something he gave to the world free gratis, that is one of the benefits these great Universities and all of us have derived. This cele - bration is from the 7th to the 9th and he thought lots of people would like to know it. The President: Mr. Woodward has an announcement he woi to make. ■ Mr. Woodward: Mr. Young, would you make the announcement me? iMr. H. C. Young: At a meeting of the State Dairy Cattle Breed - Association officers were elected for the ensuing year; this organ - ion is an auxiliary of the State Dairymen's Association and it is desire of the breeders that have a pure bred bull to become member* list him, so we can get in touch with them and s&gt;ee what they want my or sell. Any member of the State Dairymen's Association can •me a member. Mr. Woodward is secretary and treasurer and wil' rlad to take your fifty cents which it costs to become a member. 1 Professor Rouska: I think it would be fitting if we passed a reso n of esteem of Doctor Babcock as an appreciation of his work ' seconded. KThe President: You have heard the suggestion that a resolution passed congratulating Doctor Babcock and showing our esteem for i and his work. Motion put and declared carired and the resolution committep in structed to prepare such a resolution and forward it to Doctor Babcock The President: I might enquire what the association thinks of the propriety of going ahead and choosing someone to go there, provided they feel sufficiently patriotic to go at their own expense. He is a mighty man in dairying and I would like to hear what you have to say about this. Professor Frandsen: Might it not be well to investigate and ascer - tain just what the other associations are going to do and let our execu - tive committee be empowered to take such action as they deem MMMary? </seg>

These figures are about 5,000,000 short of the production for the year 1913-14. The creameries in Nebraska are of the highest type of any in the United States, as they are not only better equipped, but the business is better handled from every viewpoint, and Nebraska butter sells today the world around. Not only is the state producing the amount of butter as listed in the table here- with given, but it is also supplying much cream for factories at Denver. Boulder, Concordia, St. Joseph, Council Bluffs and Sioux City, all outside the state. When the amount sent to these places is added to that of &gt;ur own Nebraska creameries it will give about 10,000,000 pounds more. Adding then to this the amount of butter consumed on the farm and sold in local communities by the farmers, which amounts to another 10,- 000,000 pounds, we have a grand total of about 95,000,000 pounds of actual butter produced from Nebraska farms every year.

            <seg id="p178">THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL CONVENTION 175 Minutes of the Animal Convention of 'UK NEBRASKA DAIRY CATTLE BREEDERS ASSOCIATION The Nebraska Dairy Cattle Breeders' Association was organized January, 1916, as an auxiliary of the Nebraska State Dairymen'.- Asaociation. The prevailing spirit of this association is an absolute confidence in Nebraska dairy cattle breeders, in Nebraska bred dairy little, and in the future of Nebraska dairying. Nebraska has the eed and the markets but she needs more cows. This association is ryinjr to keep Nebraska bred stock in Nebraska. ''Why buy elsewhere en Nebraska breeds the best?" has been adopted as a slogan. The aims of the association are: 1. To organize the dairymen of Nebraska in i rder that dairying ay be promoted to best advantage in this state. 2. To foster dairying in Nebraska and thereby increase the pros - #rity of the state. 3. To encourage the use of pure bred dairy bulls among farmers hereby encouraging permanent agriculture. 4. To put the Nebraska buyer in touch with the Nebraska breeder, ereby encouraging home trade to the mutual benefit of the buyer and ar. An active membership campaign is being carried on, to which the tallymen of Nebraska are responding with enthusiasm. Up to June first, one hundred members have enrolled, representing five different ireeds. These men own approximately 3,500 dairy cattle, of which more than half are pure bred. The association carries an advertisement in one of the leading Nebraska farm papers and any prosperous buyer attracted by this ad I given the names and addresses of members of this association liv - "■_' nearest him who are offering for sale stock of the kind wanted. It has been the special desire of the association to help beginners n the dairy business to select Nebraska bred dairy cattle of the right juality. The chance for selection among the large number of cattle •wned by members of this association, together with the fact that home buying means small transportation charges, should attract favor among hose persons desiring to purchase the best in dairy cattle. This organization was perfected at a gathering of about twenty - five prominent dairymen, immediately following the annual meeting of State Dairymen's Association in January, 1916. The following officers were elected to serve one year: H. C. Young. Lincoln President A. S. Nelson, Stromsburg Viee-President K. G. Woodward, Lincoln Secretary The directors representing the different dairy breeds are: Ayrshire — A. J. Love of Omaha; Guernsey — A. Schlegelmilch, Sr., of Sewarti; Holstein — T. A. Gierens of Walton; Jersey — Paul Hunter of Lincoln. </seg>
