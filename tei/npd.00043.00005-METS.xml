            <seg id="p003">SECRETARY OF THE STATE BANKING BOARD 3 Lincoln, January 1, 1919. To His Excellency. Keith. Neville, Governor, Hon. Wm. B. Smith, Auditor of Public Accounts Hon. Willis E. Reed, Attorney General. Members of the State Banking Board. Sirs: I have the honor of submitting herewith the 26th annual report of the State Banking Department, showing the condition of each of the seventy-three building and loan associations oper - ating under state authority at the close of the fiscal year June 30. 1918. During the year one new association was chart ?red, one voluntarily liquidated and one other is in process of liquidation. Due to the war there has been less activity in building and loan operations during the period covered by this report than in either of the two years immediately preceding. But, a careful analysis of the individual reports and comparison with those submitted in former years will distlose abundant evidence of a substantial and healthful growth. As will be noted in the com - bined statement the total assets have increased during the year $2,605,915.92. Loans in process of foreclosure show a marked decrease, emphasizing forcefully the increasing care given by managing officials to the quality of loans accepted and the col - lection of periodical payments. Government securities aggre - gating more than $$900,000.00 are held by the associations. Their war activities, however, should not be measured by this in - vestment alone as every facility possible has been provided to aid their membership in the purchase of bonds, and contribution to all war funds. These institutions are rendering a distinctive service in their particular field of operation. While providing a reasonably safe agency for the investment of idle funds, their chief purpose or aim is to encourage and develop the building of modest homes. Tt is a field capable of almost unlimited development. In build - ing and loan activities Nebraska, compared with nthe* 1 states, ranks very high. In fact, the largest association in the United States is a Nebraska concern. This high plane of usefulness and safety has been attained through wise legislation, equally protecting the investor and the homebuilder. The law a-s it now stands appears to be satisfactory as a whole and there is no de - mand for material change in the Act at this time. Interest rates seem to be adjusting themselves and premium charges to bor - rowers have been almost entirely eliminated, only seven associa - tions including such charges as a part of their fixed fees. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE The larger associations as well as many of the smaller ones are to he especially commended for their most complete and com - prehensive systems of accounting and auditing. Special effort has been made by the examiner to have all adopt a system as nearly uniform as the varied conditions will permit. In this he has met with reasonable success. The value of State supervision is to be very largely measured by the efficiency of the examiner and the thoroughness with which he performs his exacting duties. During the present ad - ministration this work has been assigned to Examiner A. D. Touziilin and he is entitled to the commendation of the Depart - ment for the very satisfactory results obtained. In conclusion, permit me to thank the individual members of the Board for their splendid co-operation and helpful counsel in all matters pertaining to the Department. The members of tlie office force, composed of young women of more than ordinary attainments, have discharged their duties in a manner forcefully emphasizing a keen perception of the courteous and efficient service to which those having business with the Ranking Depart - ment are entitled. Respectfully submitted J. .1. TOOLEY. Secretary. State Hanking Department. </seg>
