            <seg id="p004">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 103 To His Excellency, Honorable John H. Morehead, Governor, and to the Honorable members of the Board of Com - missioners of State Institutions, Silas A. Holcomb, Howard Kennedy and Henry Gerdes. Gentlemen : I herewith hand you the fifteenth report of the Nebras - ka Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth, covering the bien - nial period from December 1st, 1912, to November 30th, 1914, and with it I beg leave to offer the suggestions per - taining to the operations of the Institution for the next two years. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT If success has been attained in the management of this Institution during the past two years, much of the success has been due to the wholesome advice and generous support given us by the Governor and the members of the Board. We have also been fortunate in being surrounded by loyal assistants. The officers and employees have been faithful and have worked in harmony with the Superintendent. The boys and girls for whom this Institution was built and for whom it is being maintained have been ever ready to assist in the work and have been easily governed by kindness. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">104 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF MOVEMENT OF POPULATION No. present on this date Nov. 30, 1914 No. of officers and employees Nov. 30, 1914 470 47 Total population November 30, 1914 517 The number of children present at the close of the bien - nium shows a material increase in the population during the past two years and the number of applications for ad - mission now in our hands and with the correspondence with people in the various counties relative to feeble-minded children who should have institutional care we are led to believe that with the extra room provided, as will be recom - mended later on in this report, the Institution will, at the end of the biennium just beginning, be again filled to its capacity. We are able with our corps of teachers to do much in the way of mental and physical training for the feeble - minded child. About half of the children are capable of being taught to read and write. They are also taught num - bers, a little geography and some history. The average feeble-minded child is not able to carry on school work beyond the third or fourth grade. However, the average feeble-minded child outside of institutional care is never taught even to read and write and is considered too dull for any school work whatever. Besides the regular school No. enrolled December 1, 1912 429 No. on vacation December 1, 1912 17 No. of inmates present December 1, 1912 No. admitted during the period 161 Wo. discharged (52), died (43), during the period 95 No. enrolled on last day of period, Nov. 30, 1914 495 412 No. on vacation or temporarily at home on this date 25 </seg>
            <seg id="p006">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 105 work, we teach our children the various industrial vocations. Boys do brush-making, help with the plumbing, painting, carpenter work, farm and garden work. Girls learn sew - ing, crocheting, basketry, weaving, housework, etc. There have never been at this Institution adequate edu - cational facilities. For many years the school rooms were on the third and fourth floors of the main building and many of the children who were mentally capable of learning were physically unable to go to the upstairs school rooms. In the past two years we have used one of the cottage wards for school purposes and have had all our school work on the ground floor. These quarters are cramped and unsuitable in almost every way for the purpose we are using them, but better than those formerly provided for schoool use. NEW SCHOOL BUILDING In our present school rooms we can accommodate only about one hundred children, while we have at the Institu - tion more than two hundred and fifty who should have school privileges. By far the greatest need of this Institu - tion is a new school building with four large rooms for school purposes and industrial classes, with cloak rooms and toilet rooms all on the ground floor and an auditorium on the second floor with inclines or easy stair-ways to the same. Our assembly meetings, religious services and amusements are now held in a day room of one of the cot - tages. The room is wholly inadequate for our population. We can, in this room, accommodate less than half of our children who are able to and should attend such meetings. By building school rooms and an auditorium as proposed we would be able to reconvert our present school rooms and assembly room into a ward, the purpose for which it was originally built. The present school rooms were good dormitories and without any changes can be again used for sleeping purposes for the children. By having the new building for school and industrial purposes and converting our present school rooms into ward use, we would be able thereby to make room for thirty to forty more children. With the increase of population during the biennium </seg>
            <seg id="p007">106 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF and the probability of a continued increase in the regular way and, considering the fact that there are many feeble - minded children in the State who should receive institutional care and whose presence out in society is a menace to the State and whose parents and guardians are demanding in - stitution care for these defective children, it is my opinion that another cottage should be built so that we would not be compelled to refuse admission on account of lack of room to any feeble-minded person in the State. The high grade feeble-minded child is to the casual ob - server apparently not far from normal. Physically many of them appear normal. Many of the boys and girls are good looking and, but for their mental defects, would get along well in the world. With their mental defects, how - ever, and their pleasant faces and normal bodies, unless segregated by institutional care, they would get out into the world and mingle with society â€” the mentally defective boy choosing for his mate a mentally defective girl and, by their union, bring into the world a number of mentally defective children. The mentally defective mother and the mentally defec - tive father generally raise a large family. The feeble - minded person ordinarily knows no such word as self - control, having the same desires and same pleasures as the normal person and, left to their own initiative, they would marry one of their kind. Observation teaches us that the mental defectives are prolific in propogating their kind. SEGREGATION For the sake of future generations, I want to make a plea to the Governor and to the Board that adequate pro - visions be made for the segregation of the high grade feeble - minded child. My opinion is that, if for a period of two or three generations mentally defective men and women were absolutely prevented by segregation and otherwise from propogating their kind, feeble-mindedness and insanity would be very materially decreased and, if the mental de - fectives were segregated or otherwise made incapable of propogating their kind, in the period of a hundred years, </seg>
            <seg id="p008">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 107 feeble-mindedness and insanity would almost wholly be eliminated. We have no right to allow the defects of this generation to be stamped upon the children of coming gen - erations. HEREDITY Heredity is a tremendous factor in the causation of mental defects. Statistics show that at least sixty - five per cent of feeble-minded children come from men - tally defective parents and a very small number, probably two per cent, from traumatism and that possibly five per cent is due to the influence of diseases upon the brain struc - ture, the most prominent of which we would name cerebro - spinal meningitis and infantile paralysis. Other diseases contributing a share are scarlet fever, typhoid fever and whooping cough, dangerous in the order named. HEALTH There has been no epidemic during the past two years. The health of our entire colony has been uniformly good. Early in the period there was a threatened typhoid outbreak, a few cases occurring among inmates and employees. This was an aftermath of an epidemic occurring during the for - mer biennium, and was soon gotten under control. During the past year no true cases of typhoid have appeared. The mortality rate of the Institution has been remarkably low. The cause of death in the majority of instances was either epilepsy or tuberculosis. About fifteen per cent of our pop - ulation are epileptics, some of them are of the most severe type. Tuberculosis has been prevalent among the most helpless children. Some of those who were unable to walk and who were of necessity in the house a great deal of the time have succumbed to the disease. One of our boys who contracted tuberculosis was transferred to the Hospital for Tuberculous at Kearney. Our children have been singularly free from injury and accidents. One boy was injured by slipping on the ice and breaking his leg, another fell from a wagon and broke his arm. Both made good recoveries and show no evidence of </seg>
            <seg id="p009">108 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF having been injured. At this date we have no children sick in bed. MORE LAND NEEDED Many of the boys are able to do work on the farm and in the gardens. In fact, we have more boys who are able to do such work than we have work for the boys to do. We need more farm and pasture land. The boys are better contented if given a reasonable amount of work. The State's holding given over to the Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth consists of 222 acres. The buildings, the orchard, the groves and the lots occupy about 40 acres. We have about 40 acres in pasture, 65 acres in alfalfa, 40 acres ordinarily for garden, sweet corn, potatoes, etc., the balance of the farm, about 40 acres, for corn and oats. We should have and could care very well for 100 acres of corn and half that acreage of oats. We should have also more pasture. I would recommend the purchase of from SO to 160 acres of land near the Institution. OUR DAIRY Our dairy herd consists of 26 cows and 20 heifers, the heifers most of which will become cows within the next year, some of them soon. We have, during the past two years, kept all of our heifer calves and by continuing doing so we expect in another two years to have enough cows to furnish sufficient milk for the needs of the Institution. At the present time we are not getting the quantity of milk we need. The herd at the beginning of this biennium consisted of a mixed sort of cows all of which were eight years old or over. We have added, during the past two years, six pure bred Holstein cows and a pure bred Holstein bull. All of the calves ve are now saving for the dairy are either pure bred Holsteins or high grade Holsteins. HOGS We have on the Institution farm a herd of 65 head of hogs. In 1913 cholera attacked our herd and we lost a num- </seg>

            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 109 ber of the young hogs, but fortunately saved all of the brood sows. We now have a herd of 13 aged sows and a male hog that are immune to cholera. They have raised for us during this year about 60 good shoats. They are thriv - ing, no disease having appeared among them. HORSES AND MULES The State owns at this Institution two good spans of mules, one heavy work team of horses, one medium size general purpose team of horses, two fairly good driving horses, and one old farm horse. RAILROAD SWITCH NEEDED The Institution is located three miles from the freight stations. The only mode of transportation of goods from the railroads to the Institution is by wagon route. It costs the State about $.60 per ton to deliver coal, a carload of 50 tons of coal costs the State $30.00 to deliver to the Institution. During the biennium the Institution will use about 3,000 tons of coal, it will consequently cost the State $1,800.00 to deliver this coal to the Institution. A railroad switch could be laid to the Institution from the nearest point of the rail - road yards, which is nearly two miles from the Institution, at an estimated cost of $5,000.00. The saving of drayage expenses during one biennium, I believe, would pay for the track. This is one of the Institution's greatest needs. ICE PLANT NEEDED The Institution is in need of an ice manufacturing plant with a circulating refrigerating system sufficient to keep the cold storage plant cool and also with a capacity of making about 1000 pounds of ice per day. For cold storage purposes the Institution has been depending upon ice cut from the small stream running through the Institution grounds. Bacteriological tests in the past have shown this stream to be contaminated with typhoid germs. We have endeavored to guard our food supply from direct contact with the creek ice, this being a task that requires most care- </seg>
            <seg id="p012">110 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF ful attention and, even then, there is great danger of food contamination. We have, during the past year, bought manufactured ice for kitchen use during very hot weather. I believe that it would be a wise procedure for the State to abandon harvesting ice from the polluted creek, the quality of which is always questionable and the quantity uncertain. At an expense of $5,000.00 it is my opinion that an ice plant could be installed, doing away with the dangers as above stated and giving the Institution a more wholesome supply of ice and manufactured as needed. CHICKENS During the past year this Institution became fairly well established in the chicken industry. We have hatched and raised about 2,000 chickens. The Institution has con - sumed and sold about half of those raised. We are keeping about 1,000 young hens and expect soon to be getting all of the eggs necessary for use at the Institution. FINANCES A record of the financial affairs of the Institution is in the hands of the Board, therefore we are not including it in this report. </seg>

Morehead, Governor, and to the Honorable members of the Board of Com - missioners of State Institutions, Silas A. Holcomb, Howard Kennedy and Henry Gerdes. Gentlemen : I have the honor, herewith, to present the twelfth bien - nial report of the Girls' Industrial School, covering the per - iod from November 30, 1912, to November 30, 1914. Our task being ever the same, to receive neglected, delinquent, and too often morally defective girls, to provide for them a home whose atmosphere shall be as nearly like the normal home as institutional life can make it, compels us as fast as financial circumstances allow to make such improvements as will tend to the physical well-being, moral and mental development of our wards. In the past ten years we have made a difficult but con - tinual climb. It has always been hard for the present man - agement to convince those in whose power it lay to make adequate appropriations for our maintenance. Comparison with other institutions is odious; girls cannot go into the field and plow, cultivate the land, or do manual labor which tends materially to lessen the per capita in other institutions of our State where such help may be utilized. Our girls average in age 13 years; come too often wholly untrained, uneducated and physically unsound; we must begin at the very foundation. Four and a half hours each day are de - voted to school work, four hours to industrial training, and the rest in beneficial and varied recreation. No more could be expected and I earnestly invite the closest investigation of our work and ask that investigation precede censure. The most important event of the last two years was the creating of a Board of Commissioners by an act of the 33rd Session of the Legislature. The duty of this Board was to assume charge and man - agement of all State Institutions after July 1, 1913. New life and ambition was awakened by the support and earnest co-operation of this Board, they giving special attention to </seg>
            <seg id="p030">FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF 126 the methods of care and treatment, education and improve - ment of our children and we feel that we no longer are struggling alone with our difficult and perplexing problems. REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS We have about ready for occupancy a new building 48 ft. x 119 ft. It comprizes four floors, and furnishes us with a large auditorium to be used as an assembly room, library and music hall, a dormitory that will accommodate 80 beds, a hospital, girls' dining hall, and teachers' dining room, four private suites for teachers, modern general kitchen, brick Dutch bake oven, storage room, and a three-department refrigerating room that will hold two tons of ice. The building was designed by architect Joseph W. Sal - mon and built by W. J. Assenmacher Co., Lincoln. It was completed at a cost of about $45,000.00, is a reinforced con - crete fire-proof structure built of red brick trimmed with cut stone, has five large steel trusses on which the slate roof is carried, and third floor ceiling is of concrete. The dormitory floor or auditorium ceiling is suspended from roof trusses by steel rods eliminating columns in assembly room which is 46 ft. x 72 ft. There are steel stair balus - trades, composition floors, and tile entrance. The building is heated by vapor vacuum system and first class plumbing on every floor gives perfect sanitation throughout. Tele - phone and electric wires are all carried through conduit and a tunnel 8 ft. wide, 60 ft. long and 9 ft. high connects the two buildings ; this tunnel is also heated and lighted. We repaired the administration building, removing the old lime plastering on walls and ceilings of three main floors, replastered and painted; put new flooring on three main halls, hospital C dormitory, and superintendent's din - ing room ; built a commodious kitchenette on second floor and superintendent's private office ; installed four best flush valve toilets in girls' recreation rooms ; and temporarily fitted out a department for our new family; erected four iron standards with electric lights on the grounds ; laid 2,000 feet of cement walks; built cistern 12 ft. x 20 ft., a new poultry house and addition to coal shed; partitioned </seg>

Crown water meter ; planted a small plum and peach orchard ; and fenced four acres of alfalfa hog tight. Every dollar has been made to go as far as possible and there are many im - provements to show for the expenditures. NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTION To sucessf ully carry out our work, to suitably and prop - erly furnish our departments with necessary machinery and equipment, I submit, herewith, the following conservative estimate for the coming two year* â€¢ Maintenance (which includes clothing, food, shoes fuel, electric current, water supply, furn - iture, bedding, placing children in homes, med - ical attendance, dentistry, chaplain service, feed, stock, carriages, harness, horse, musical instruments, school equipment and supplies, amusement and entertainment, dishes, ice OUR WORK AND ADVANCEMENT Until 1892 the delinquent boys and girls of Nebraska were cared for in one institution at Kearney, but by a wise act of the Legislature of 1891 a separate school for girls was established and the small population at Kearney was transferred to Geneva. Two divisions comprized the classification from this time until 1912; now we have a better defined classification and segregation according to character has been secured by the addition of another class or "family" as they are called. In this division are placed the girls of excellent record who supply) _1 $45000.00 Lepair and improvements 14000.00 iuperintendent latron 3000.00 960.00 'amily managers 4560.00 Employees' wages 8040.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p032">128 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF are free from infection and perfectly normal m every res - pect. Excellent reports are received from girls who have been paroled and discharged; we keep in touch with them regu - larly and it is gratifying to hear of their filling responsible positions as nurses, stenographers, dressmakers, milliners, domestics, and high school pupils, entering the 10th grade after leaving our institution. Our aim is to place the girls in homes where the in - fluence and surroundings will be of the best ; where they will not only be kindly treated but have real help toward leading useful lives. We are not living in an ideal world and dis - appointments sometimes occur. When homesick or dis - couraged the girl turns to the institution for which she has only the kindest feeling ; her little visit rekindles fresh courage and she goes back to her duties and the world where she has now proven herself a helpful and honest woman. Our work is so arranged that each girl receives during the year training in laundry for three months, kitchen three months, sewing three months, and general housework three months. She is obliged to attend school four and a half hours five days in the week. In connection with this, she has musical advantages â€” piano, horn, reed instrument, vio - lin and voice. Our class rooms are noticeable for their cheerful and busy atmosphere, for the spirit of helpfulness and self-con - trol. Our girls come from city schools, rural schools, and from the streets. Their previous training has been in no two cases the same; most of them have had very little, if any, interest in school, have been irregular in attendance and their advancement has not been uniform. Our problem is to meet the most urgent need of each one and our aim is, not alone to impart knowledge, but rather to develop char - acter. In this the personal influence of the teacher counts for much. In class room, kitchen, laundry, sewing room, music hall, or on recreation grounds, pride and interest must be aroused, ideals developed, evil habits and thoughts eliminated, cleanness of thought and action made desirable. Strength of character, earnestness, sympathetic under- </seg>

            <seg id="p034">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 129 standing and unlimited patience are needed for this work and the demands on the teacher are many. During the past biennium, as in other years, my corps of teachers have devoted strength, interest, skill and time to their work, have made their various departments a potent influence in the reformation of the girls, and, to me, have given loyal and intelligent co-operation. One fact, however, remains, â€” and I should like to im - press this upon the minds of our legislators, â€” that while physical and mental response is readily observable after a few months' experience in the well-regulated life of the school, moral growth is perforce a slower process. Time for the development of character cannot be reckoned in weeks or months; our training loses its effect if a girl leaves the school too young. A year or two more in the institution for many a girl is often the saving grace for her. There is less to be feared of her becoming "institutionalized" than of her being too weak to stand the temptations that beset a young girl at every turn in the outside world from the ages of 16 to 20 years. I ask that our jurisdiction be extended to twenty-one and the age of majority made the same as in the case of the boy. This is especially fair in the event that Nebraska will give woman the right of franchise.

            <seg id="p035">130 FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OK To the Superintendent, Girls' Industrial School Madam : Starting as I did less than two years ago with a small band of ten pieces at the Girls' Industrial School, Geneva, we have grown to a band of twenty-two and an orchestra of nineteen, playing a good grade of music correctly. The instruction is general and the opportunity open to all. Many pupils have made remarkable progress and our band and orchestra are now recognized as first class organ - izations. We have played at the State Fair, County Fairs and other popular assemblages before noted musicians who are all enthusiastic in their praises. The only drawback to our ambitions has been the limited fund at our disposal. It was through the most careful management and generous assistance of our friends that we have accomplished what we have. The girls have cared for tneir instruments and music in such a manner that draws from me the hierhest commen - dation. Respectfully yours, A. Albin Le Roy, Director of Music. Geneva, Nebraska, November 30, 1914. To the Superintendent, Girls' Industrial School. Madam : Preventative medicine and sanitation are the main fac - tors in maintaining the health of the inmates of any insti - tution ; a healthy body is the first aid to a healthy mind ; the two taken together make possible the reformation and train - ing of those who have been abnormal in their tendencies. At the Girls' Industrial School, since I have been in charge of the medical department, there have been no epi - demics or contagious diseases of any kind and no sickness or accidents except of very minor importance such as slight burns, sprains and an occasional off-day. Those who are contaminated with specific diseases when received are given careful and reerular treatment and are soon cured. The most excellent system of classification </seg>
            <seg id="p036">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 131 arranged by the superintendent divides the population into three grades or classes, thereby segregating these specific cases. This, not only institutes a more moral measure, but also a sanitary and hygienic control of those inmates and diseases which might be contageous. The new building now nearing completion which was badly needed will facilitate the handling of these cases and make it possible for the management to more readily carry out this classification, also, when the new hospital rooms are at our disposal we will be able to carry out aseptic meth - ods. The most important need of the institution is the dis - posal of the sewerage. This is imperative and should be im - mediate. Respectfully yours, J. Bixby, M. D. Geneva, Nebraska, November 30, 191 U. I conclude my report with thanks for your cordial sup - port of my administration, and for the splendid encourage - ment and helpfulness received from the Board of Commis - sioners of State Institutions.
