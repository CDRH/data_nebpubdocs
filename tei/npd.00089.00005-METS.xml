The above scale of rates shall alternate with the present scale of rates on the same commodities and supersede those now published in Western" Trunk Line Tariff 346j8 only in such instances as lower charges will thereby result. Upon receipt of this application vigorous protest was made by Polenske Bros.-Schellak &amp; Co., Inc., of Hastings, Nebraska. Conditional protests from other interested shippers were received. Western Brick &amp; Supply Company of Hastings, Nebraska, stated that it was agreeable to them that the proposed rates become effective as soon as possible but wished to have a formal hearing set to consider other matters, such as, minimum weights and mixtures of commodities permitted in carload. The Ideal Cement Stone Company entered complaint against omission of concrete blocks in application. The railroads thereafter amended their application to include concrete blocks which was followed by withdrawal of the Ideal Cement Stone Company's objection as they stated the ap - plication, as amended, met with their approval. By minute entry, dated May Ist, 1939, the Nebraska State Railway Commission authorized a hearing to be held May 22,1939 at 10:00 o'clock A. M. in the Commission hearing rocm. On the date and hour set for said hearing the only protestant to appear in opposition to this application was H. Lloyd Hansen, Secretary of Polenske Bros.-Schellak &amp; Co., Inc., of Hastings, Nebraska; During the course of the hearing it was developed that the application would result in decreased rates on the commodities covered by the application, and that such reduced rates would be beneficial to the Brick and Clay Products industry. It was brought out that the distance rates herein sought, while being designed to meet motor truck competition, were intended to meet motor truck competition of so-called "private carriers". It was further developed that the protestant, Polenske Bros.-Schellak &amp; C 0.,. Inc., as well as several other brick manufacturers operate their own trucks as private carriers, while certain of their competitors do not operate or use trucks to any great extent, being dependent to a great extent upon railroad transportation for shipment of their products. The rail carriers on their own behalf, stated that while the pro - posed rates were below a reasonable normal level of rates it was then belief that the proposed rates were necessay if the railroads were to participate in any movement of brink and xdap products. The present schedule of rates operated to prevent any manufacturer over 110 miles distant from any job requiring the use of brick, to bid on the job in competition with such manufacturers as may be located less than 110 miles from the job for which bids were to be received. The nearby manufacturer who is most likely to receive the bid .would very likely truck his product rather than use the rails for such purpose. The railroads contended that fey extending their motor trusk compelled rates </seg>
         <seg id="p076">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT 76 from 110 miles to 150 miles and making necessary reductions below 110 miles they would have a greater chance of obtaining part of the traffic involved. The rail carriers also admit that the proposed scale of rates is a trial proposition by which it is hoped to definitely determine the scale of rates that may actually be required to obtain the traffic sought. Upon consideration of the facts, the Commission being fully advised in the premises is of the opinion and so finds that the scale of distance rates, rules and regulations herein proposed, applicable on the commodi - ties as described is justified and should be approved for application on Nebraska intrastate traffic. We further find that an emergency exists and that the rates, rules and regulations herein prescribed shall become effective on May 24th, 1939. An appropriate order will be entered.

The widest possible latitude was given the protestants, who were not represented by counsel excevt in part, to. state their objections to: the proposed change anf^TEi lZ a™ '*Sfe Applicant testified that Bloomington is a station on the Republican Valley line, with a population of about 450, located five miles west of Franklin and five miles east of Naponee, both so-called open stations. '-Bloomington was formerly the county seat of Franklin County. Applicant testified that from an operating standpoint there </seg>
         <seg id="p078">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT was no need of an operator at Bloomington, and that the commercial telegraph business was very small. Applicant submitted a statement showing the receipts of the Bloom - ington station by months for the years 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, and the first two months of 1939. This statement showed steadily declining receipts each year, the showing for the first two months of 1939 evi - dencing a decline for the year. However, protestants pointed out that for five successive years that section had been severely hit by drouth, resulting in short crops, and a consequent decline in live stock produc - tion, that being the sole industry of that section. On the other hand the Applicant sought to show that because of declining receipts the efficient and economical management of the railroad demanded the change requested, thereby effecting a saving of approximately $1350.00 a year. Protestants produced evidence to the effect that crop prospects at this particular time were the best in several years, and that live stock production is showing a very satisfactory increase. In view of all the testimony adduced, together with the known facts, the Commission finds as follows: FINDINGS That the instant application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company to discontinue agency operation at its Bloomington, Nebraska station, and to substitute therefor a caretaker or custodian, should be denied, the Commission retaining jurisdiction, the applicant given an opportunity to renew the application after October 1, 1939, and upon the filing of such renewed application, together with proper evidence, the Commission will set an early date for another hearing. An order in conformity with the above opinion and findings will be issued. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the applicant be required to maintain agent-operator service at its Bloomington, Nebraska, station until the further order of this Commission. </seg>

This matter came on further.to be considered by the Commission on the supplemental application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Rail - road Company to substitute a custodian for its agent at Bloomington and to make said station a prepaid or closed station. The original ap - plication was set for hearing at Franklin on the Bth day of June, 1939, at which time applicant presented its evidence and testimony of several shippers and-residents of Bloomington was heard. Because of the very satisfactory prospects for good crops at that time and from the evidence the assurance that livestock was increasing in the community, making it again necessary to demand the services of an agent, the Commission in disposing of the application said: . "That the instant application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company to discontinue agency operation at its Bloomington, Nebraska, station and to substitute therefor a caretaker or custodian, shall be denied, the Commission retain - ing jurisdiction, the applicant given an opportunity to renew the application after October Ist, 19&amp;9, and upon the filing of such renewed application, together with proper evidence, the Com- </seg>
         <seg id="p080">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT mission will set an early date for another hearing. An order in conformity with the above opinion and findings will be issued." On November 17, 1939, the applicant filed a supplemental applica - tion, the prayer of which was the same as in the original application. Notices were sent to interested parties and a public hearing was held before Commissioner Swanson on December 7th, 1939, in the Court House at Franklin. A large number of shippers and citizens of Bloom - ington and vicinity appeared and testified and were represented by counsel. Bloomington, Franklin County, Nebraska, is an incorporated village of approximately 400 people located on the Kansas City-Denver line of the applicant railroad. It was referred to at the hearing as being a secondary line and from an operating standpoint is considered a main line. The station is located 4.9 miles west of Franklin and 5 miles east of Naponee, both being regular open agency stations on the Burlington. The territory tributary to Bloomington is exclusively agricultural. State Highway No. 3, a graveled, all weather road, runs east and west through Bloomington connecting with U. S. Highway 83 at Alma, approximately 19 miles west of Bloomington, which highway extends north to U. S. Highway No. 6. a hard-surfaced road running in an easterly and westerly direction across the State. Highway No. 3 also connects at Franklin with graveled State Highway No. 9 running in a northerly direction and in turn connects at Minden with U. S. Highway No. 6. The evidence revealed that Bloomington was formerly the county seat of Franklin County, Nebraska, and the Court House was relocated at Franklin along about 1923, 1924 or 1925. The move resulted in many business houses changing locations and since that time there have been quite a number of empty buildings in Bloomington; applicant's wiLness stating there were 15 vacant on December Ist and 2nd when he made an investigation, and protestants stating there were not more than 5. At the present time there are 3 grocery stores, 3 filling stations, 1 lumber yard, barber shop, insurance agency, beer parlor and a garage in the village. Applicant's witness further testified that on the date of his investi - gation there were 4 certificated common catrier trucks serving Blooming - ton, and 27 private carriers hauling in groceries, flour, fresh meats, perishable fruits and vegetables, bread, feeds, tobacco, candy, beer and beverages and other similar commodities. The statistical evidence submitted hy the applicant included a de - tailed statement showing total revenue from all sources of business credited to the station of Bloomington, including carload freight for - warded and received; L.C.L. freight forwarded and received, ticket sales, cream revenue, express earnings, Western Union revenue, amount to $10,790.67 for the year 1935; £.8,540.87 for 1936; $7,593.82 for 1937; $4,718.30 for 1938; and $3,233.69 for the first 9 months of 1939. The </seg>
         <seg id="p081">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION average yearly agency expense amounts to $1,824.00, and if a custodian is substituted it would effect an annual savings of approximately $1,484.00. Most'of the income at the station is derived principally from carload shipments, there being 23 carloads handled at the station dur - ing the first 10 months of 1939. Since the first hearing the residents of Bloomington have made a sincere effort to favor the applicant in the handling of all freight in and out in an attempt to retain the agent. The fact is, however, that the 23 private carrier trucks above teferred to handle by far the greater volume of freight formerly handled by the applicant. It is a new and different type of transportation that has superseded that furnished by the applicant, and until such carriers are placed on an equal basis with the rails and with common carrier trucks, they will, without a doubt, continue hauling; the greater share of the less than carload shipments. Because of the continued drouth in that section of the State, the good crops did not materialize since the first hearing and livestock moves generally from farm to sales ring via truck. In our opinion this was partially due to inadequate service offered by applicant for Omaha and Kansas City destinations. Applicant offers to place and! maintain a custodian at the station who will perform services which should adequately take care of the demand of the public. Passenger fares would be paid to the train con - ductors instead of to ticket agents which we believe is little or no in - convenience. All inbound freight would be prepaid or paid at the next open station which would be of some inconvenience to the few shippers who still patronize the rail carrier at that point. The custodian would order cars and would receive freight just the same as an agent al - though he would not be able to accept money for prepaid freight. The Commission is fully aware of the service conditions at custodial sta - tions and in nearly every case it proves satisfactory and no complaints are received. At the present time there are two passenger trains each way daily through Bloomington and one local way freight daily in each direction except Saturday westbound and Sunday eastbound. Only one t-ain passes through during the hours the agent is on duty. Under the circumstances, the Commission is of the opinion that the present revenue received at this point and the general conditions under which the carrier is now operating requires the applicant, in the honest, efficient and economical management of its railroad, to substitute a caretaker or custodian for its agent at Bloomington, Nebraska, and to discontinue commercial telegraph business at said station. However, if and when gtnsral business conditions reach a state of normalcy, this Commission will gladly entertain a petition asking for reinstatement of the agent. . j </seg>

Rates to expire December 31,1939. These rates to alternate with present rates on single car movements. The rate from the zone pits to Lincoln shall be understood to include the Fair bury to Lincoln rates. The proposed schedule will not cancel or supersede any bases for like application currently in effect and the present rates will alternate with the proposed basis in all cases. Applicants represent that emergency consideration is of primary importance due to the fact that the movement of sand, gravel, and crushed stone is naturally confined to that period of the year when con - struction conditions and weather conditions are most favorable. The movements of these commodities at the present time is possibly as heavy as any time during the year and unless the rail carriers are given authority to publish the proposed schedule they will stand to suffer grave losses in revenue. . Applicants feel that the Commission is fully advised of the problem confronting the carriers; however, a brief survey is opportune. The pirmary handicap to shippers of sand and gravel by rail as well as the rail carriers is the fact that the Platte River, running through the state of Nebraska from the west to the east, makes it possible for small oper - ators to set up portable pumping plants anywhere within two miles of the Platte River bed and produce sand and gravel which is transported to the job in trucks belonging to the operators. The roadside operator, of course, can set up his portable equipment at points close to the construc - tion job, whereas the rail shippers are obliged to transport their material from the nearest rail pits to a rail head close to the construction job and then truck to the actual job site. This, of course, is difficult competition for the rail carriers to meet. : Upon consideration of the facts, the Commission being fully ad - vised, is of the opinion land so finds that the application is justified and should be approved. It is further found that an emergency exists and that the proposed schedule of rates should become effective June 13, 1939. An appropriate order will be entered.

         <seg id="p086">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT charges at Albion, Crawford, Davenport, Fremont, Geneva, Hastings, Lincoln, Norfolk, Omaha, CNeil, Seward, Superior, Wahoo and York, Nebraska to $4.00 per car applicable to all commodities except grain, grain products and seeds. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company and the Union Pacific Rail - road Company filed a similar application seeking authority to establish a minimum charge of $4.00 per car for reciprocal switching services rendered in connection with shipments to and from points on the line of applicant Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, before the hearing herein. The present reciprocal switching rates range from $2.48 to $3.96 per car. This proposal therefore involves proposed increases of from 4 cents to $1.52 per carload. The proposed increases will not be borne by our shippers for reasons stated below. In addition to switching carload shipments from and to industries on its own line at particular terminals in connection with its own line haul transportation services, every railroad switches carload freight from or to industries and sidings on its line to points of connection with other railroads at the same terminal in connection with line haul transportaton services performed by other carriers. The switching charges for the latter type of service are generally absorbed by the line haul carrier under the terms of a "reciprocal" switching agreement which contemplates the establishment of identical switching charges for similar services with the result that the amount paid out to an - other carrier for switching 100 cars will be the same as the amount received for switching 100 cars for such other carrier. In such an instance the reciprocal switching charge becomes a mere bookkeeping entry. The shipper is not interested because the line haul carrier pays the reciprocal switching charge out of the line haul freight charges applicable. Such absorptions are subject to the requirement that the net revenue after paying the connecting line switching charges shall not be less than $18.50 per car in connection with shipments of sand, gravel and stone and $20.35 per car in connection with shipments of all other commodities. So understood, shippers generally do not oppose the proposed in - creases in these reciprocal switching charges. In some instances the increases may not be fully absorbed in connection with sand, gravel and stone shipments because of the low charges per car applicable but the tentative opposition of an interested sand and gravel shipper was with - drawn at the hearing. Applicants offered evidence showing that the proposed increased switching charges are reasonable. </seg>
         <seg id="p087">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION On consideration of the applications herein, as amended, and the evidence adduced, we are of the opinion and find that the proposed increase in reciprocal switching charges to a minimum of $4.00 per car is justified. Reciprocal switching charges, now less than $4.00 per car, may be increased to that amount but no other or further increase is authorized. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quiney Railroad Company, Union Pacific Rail - road Company and the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Com - pany be, and they are hereby, authorized and directed to publish and make effective a reciprocal switching charge of $4.00 per carload ap - plicable to all commodities, except grain and grain products, in Con - nection with all carioad shipments received or delivered on sidings or industry tracks of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company - interchanged with railroads, joined in this application, at the same terminal point, for line haul transportation and for application to the switching of carloads transported in line haul service by the applicant Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, which are switched by other carriers, party hereto, between points on sidings which they serve and interchange points with the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company at the same terminal; to become effective thirty days from the date of this order or, on January 17, 1940.

The same prin - ciples of reciprocal switching applicable in connection with the original matter obtain here also. Upon consideration of the facts the Commission finds that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska is in the same rela - tionship to the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company as the other Nebraska railroads involved and that the Missouri Pacific Rail - road Corporation in Nebraska should be made a joint petitioner in the same manner as applied to the Union Pacific Railroad Company, Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company and that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska should be authorized to amend its reciprocal switching charges between themselves and the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company in the same manner.

Applicant states the following facts present certain special cir - cumstances and conditions justifying the request herein made; The proposed rates mentioned above are being established to meet motor truck competition. The measure of the proposed rates are the same as currently applicable for account common carrier trucks in Nebraska as authorized in Supplement A-l of Nebraska Resolution 146. The truck minimum weight is 6000 pounds, whereas the minimum weight proposed here is 16,500 pounds. Interested shippers, being opposed to truck competition, have indicated that if the truck rates are met by rail carriers, they will favor the rail carriers with some of this traffic which is now moving via the truck lines. It is the desire of your peti - tioners that they be permitted to establish these rates in order that they might be in a position to compete for this traffic. Upon consideration of the facts, the Commission finds the proposed establishment of these rates on apples, in carloads, is justified and should be approved. The Commission further finds that an effective date of August 2, 1939 should be observed in connection with publication of these proposed rates on apples, in carloads, as described so as to prevent damage to business of citizens of the state which constitutes an emergency.

BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the Matter of the Application of All ) j Nebraska Railroads for authority to ) APPLICATION NO. 13786 ' amend exceptions to Classification on in- ) trastate traffic. ) OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This application, filed on behalf of All Nebraska Railroads, re - quests authority to amend exceptions to Western Classification ratings which apply on Nebraska intrastate traffic and are now currently pub - lished in W.T.L. (Tariff 207-H, L. E. Kipp's I.C.C. No. A-2913. The changes proposed are set forth in the rather voluminous exhibit at - tached to the application which contains the argument in justification of each revision sought.- We will not attempt to reproduce the above mentioned exhibit in this opinion and findings, but will deal separately with each change authorized in our findings below. Upon receipt of this application we requested that copies of same be furnished to twelve chambers of commerce of this state to provide for the widest possible publication of this request to the shippers of this state. The applicants furnished copy of this application to the cham - bers of commerce as requested which was followed by a letter from the rate department of this Commission in which we called attention to the statement contained in the application that this was not proposed as a revenue matter, but rather in the interest of simplification and unifi - cation of the existing interstate and intrastate exceptions. It was further pointed out that the Nebraska Railroads agree to restore the old tariff item and make a new application which can be made the subject of a hearing if the actual experience of the shippers during the six month period following the changes here requested has reacted to their dis - advantage. Replies were received from the Beatrice, Hastings and Omaha Chambers of Commerce traffic departments. Beatrice objected to the proposals unless W.T.L. Tariff 382, now subject to expiration date of December 31, 1939, is made permanent by cancellation of said expira - tion date. The Hastings Chambers of Commerce report that they have no objection to the proposal but express the desire that Section 3 of W.T.L. Tariff No. 207-H be amended so as to govern W.T.L. Tariff 262-D so that all Nebraska intrastate traffic would be subject to same excep - tion ratings as apply on interstate traffic in Nebraska. The Omaha Chamber of Commerce replied and set out some of the specific proposals to which they objected. Their main objection was directed against the fact that while ratings in W.T.L. Tariff No. 382 were generally lower there was the possibility of the expiration date of December 31, 1939 actually becoming effective which would then result in the higher classi- </seg>
         <seg id="p092">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT fication ratings becoming applicable due to the cancellations and amend - ments herein requested. These objections were transmitted to the Nebraska Railroads and they replied that they were willing to remove the expiration date on W.T.L. Tariff No. 382 and we in fact have docketed as A-13779 an application filed on behalf of All Nebraska Railroads seeking to extend the scope of that tariff and remove the expiration date in connection therewith. Due to the fact that we also have pending before us an application requesting far reaching changes in our prescribed truck rates on Nebraska intrastate traffic the Nebraska Railroads requested that we withhold action on their proposal to amend W.T.L. Tariff No. 382 until disposition of the application relating to the Nebraska truck rates has been made. It does however appear that we should require the continuance without interruption, of the ratings and rates contained in W.T.L. Tariff No. 382 until the further order of the Commission. The investigation of this application shows that the same or lower ratings are now effective in various agency or individual lines' tariffs so that the proposals herein will simplify the existing tariffs by cancella - tion of conflicting ratings or by amendments to tariff items which will be retained as simplified by those proposals. It will therefore be under - stood that where our findings show that cancellation of existing ratings are justified, the general result is merely to leave similar provisions of another tariff in effect. Upon consideration of the facts, the Commission finds that this application is justified and should be approved to the extent herein set forth as relates to the following items of W.T.L.

BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the Matter of the Application of the ) C. B. &amp; Q. R.R. Co. for authority to put ) in force arrangements and rates cover- ) ing pick-up and delivery service in con- ) APPLICATION NO. 13867 nection with shipments of milk, etc., at ) all Nebraska stations. ) OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The applicant, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, seeks authority to establish pick-up and delivery service applicable to milk, sweet cream, sour cream, butterfat, buttermilk, skim milk, con - densed milk, ice cream mix, cottage cheese and pot cheese in curd, at all stations in Nebraska and to make allowances in lieu of such service when shippers perform the service. Applicant alleges that the large butter manufacturers at Omaha and Lincoln have cream-station buyers in every town of any size in Nebraska, who buy butterfat from farmers and ship it to the butter companies in metal cream cans which are usually of ten gallon capacity. It is further claimed that some of these buyers do not have trucks in which they can deliver the full cans to the railroad station and return the empty cans to the cream buying station. Applicant has contracted with local draymen to pick up full cream cans at the cream buyer's place of business and transport them to the depot where empty cans are picked up and returned to the cream buyer to be reloaded. Generally such handling of loaded and empty cream cans is done by contracting draymen for 5 cents per can for the round trip of the loaded can from ¦earn station to the depot and the empty can in the reverse direction. </seg>
         <seg id="p099">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Applicant further states that where the "cream buyers" are in a position to furnish this pick-up and delivery service the shipper has performed a service to the railroad, in lieu of the contracting draymen, which usually cost not less than 5 cents per can and that therefore an allowance of 5 cents per can should be paid to the shipper when he delivers the loaded can to the depot and returns empty cans to his place of business. : Pick-up and delivery service is generally provided in connection with (railroad less carload freight shipments and allowance in lieu of such service have also been made by Nebraska railroads in state and interstate commerce. Milk and cream and related commodities are transported in baggage cars by passenger trains. These commodities enjoy what may be called a fast freight service by passenger train. The Nebraska Co-Operative Creameries and Nebraska Commercial Truckers protested the granting of the application. Hearing was held at Lincoln, December 5, 1939, and a further hear - ing was granted December 20, 1939. The evidence shows that for the past ten or fifteen years the rail - roads, including applicant herein, have suffered increasing losses of the milk, cream, sour cream, butterf at, buttermilk, skim milk, condensed milk, ice cream mix, cottage cheese and pot cheese business which they formerly transported in large volume in baggage car, passenger-train service.- . ';. :"' -.;¦¦'; An investigation to determine the cause of such traffic losses showed that competing truck lines picked up the loaded cans at cream buying stations and /return the empty cans to the same point. Because the railroad company's baggage rates apply to loaded cans from the railroad station only to the railroad station at destination and the return of the empty can to the station platform from which the loaded can was shipped, the shipper must truck his own loaded cans to the railroad passenger depot and return the empty cans from the depot to the cream station at his own expense, although the competing truck line accepts the loaded can at the cream station and returns the empty can thereto. Applicant was convinced that it could not recapture any of this traffic from the trucks unless the railroad service were re - modeled to make it equivalent to that of the competing truck lines. Applicants show that in every instance where they provided pick-up and delivery and allowance in lieu thereof, as proposed herein, they wore able to secure a substantial amount of tonnage and revenue from in - creased milk, cream, butterf at, etc., traffic. Representatives of large creameries at Omaha and Lincoln testified in support of the application and especially the contention that applicant cannot compete with the trucks for this traffic unless the proposed pick-up and delivery service is provided. ; : ; </seg>
         <seg id="p100">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT No testimony was offered by the protesting Nebraska Commercial Truckers. The Nebraska Co-Operative Creameries protested the granting of the application. They appeared by counsel, cross-examined witnesses for applicant and submitted evidence. Their objection is not .based on the direct interest of the co-operative creameries in the services or al - lowances proposed by applicant herein. The testimony of President Horn shows that the members of his association secure their entire supply of cream, for butter production, in the area adjacent to the plant from which trucks owned by co-operative dreameries transport it daily to the creamery. The local truck transportation service involved pro - vides for the delivery of empty cans from the creameries to the dairy farmer members of the co-operative creamery association and the pick - ing up of the full cans at the farm for movement to the creamery. No rail service in collection of this cream is possible. The co-operative creameries do not receive or ship cream via either railroad or motor vehicle common carriers. It further appeals that some ot these creameries ship their entire butter 0/ dairy products output into consuming territory by truck. Of course, these co-operative creameries are but one step removed from the farmer who is a member and who is engaged in production of milk and cream. The proposed pick-up and delivery service is confined to shippers who reside or do business within the corporate limits of the cities or villages served by applicant. If a farmer living outside such corporate limits shipped cream by railroad he would not enjoy the advantages of pick-up and delivery service or the allowances in lieu thereof. It is alleged by the Co - operative Creameries that this results in a discrimination against the farmer. These "direct" shipments of cream, made by farmers living beyond the corporate limits of cities and villages, are not subject to the truck competition which exists in connection with shipments from cream buying stations located directly on the routes served by com - mercial truckeis. Since the farmer does not enjoy direct truck service on his cream from his farm to the centralizer creamery the railroad does not face the same truck competition in connection with such ship - ments as in the cass of cream buying stations which are able co load cream directly on "over the '-oad" trucks which transport it to the centralizer creamery in competition with the railroad operating between the same points. Railroads can and do provide pick-up and delivery service applicable to milk and cream shipments from cream buying sta - tions to their depots. It is therefore proper for them to pay reasonable compensation to the shir.pjr ior lurnishing the substitute service. Since similar pick-up an 1! (kl:.v?ry service to and from the farm is not prac - tical the making of an allowance in lieu of such service is not necessary and would be doubtful propriety. Upon consideration of the facts of the record, we are of the opinion and find that the application has been justified and that applicant should </seg>
         <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAI COMMISSION be authorized and directed to establish pick-up and delivery service ap - plicable to milk, sweet cream, sour cream, butterfat, buttermilk, skim milk, condensed milk/ice cream mix, cottage cheese, pot cheese in curd at all stations in Nebraska and to make allowance in lieu of such service when shippers perform the service. We further find that the competi - tion herein above outlined involves a rate war which constitutes an emergency justifying the establishment of the proposed pick-up and delivery service and allowances in lieu thereof, effective January 1,1940.

         <seg id="p102">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT lington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company and the Union Pacific Railroad Company seek authority to establish reduced rates on hay and staaw, in carload lots when moving in carloads loaded to a minimum weight of 30,000 and 36,000 pounds. The application recites the fact that au - thority has been secured from the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish the same basis of rates on less than statutory notice, effective November 17, 1939. Applicants ask that we grant similar authority to establish such rates on less than the full thirty days notice to permit intrastale rales to be established on the same basis as interstate rates effective November 17, 1939. The authority to take such action is con - tained in Section 75-602, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, which provides as follows: "75-602. Same. Emergency Rates. Nothing in the fore - going section shall be construed to prevent the Commission from having the power, when deemed by it necessary, to prevent in - terstate rate wars and injury to the business of the citizens of the state, railway companies or common carriers, or in case of any other emergency to be judged by the commission, and it shall be the duty of the commission, to temporarily alter, amend or suspend any existing freight rates, tariffs, schedules, orders . and circulars of any railway company or common carrier, or part thereof, in this state, and to fix freight rates where none exist, which emergency rate or rates shall apply to any one or more or all railway companies or common carriers in this state, and shall take effect at such time and remain in force such length of time as may be prescribed by the Commission: Pro - vided, said emergency .rates, tariffs, schedules, orders and cir - culars shall be subject to review upon a hearing before the commission and courts of competent jurisdiction in this state, as herein provided for other schedules of rates fixed by the commission." The Union Pacific proposes to establish reduced carload rates ap - plicable to shipments of hay and straw loaded to a minimum of 30,000 and 36,000 pounds from all points on the line of the Union Pacific in Nebraska to Omaha and South Omaha. The proposal contemplates continuance of the present rates on hay and straw based on a 22,000 pound minimum carload weight and to establish rates 75% thereof when a carload weighing 30,000 pounds is offered foir transportation and a rate of 66-2/3 r/r thereof when a carload weighing 36,000 pounds or more is offered for transportation. In other words, a reduction of 25'; is pioposed in connection with a 30,000 pound minimum carload and a redu-tion of 33-1/3% is proposed as to carloads of 36,000 pounds or more. This Union Pacific proposal places all shippers on their line in this state upon the same relative basis when shipping hay and straw to the important Omaha and South Omaha markets. </seg>
         <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION . . ] The.appliCan^ l Chicaeo' Burlington and Quincy Railroad, proposes sunUar changes with-respect to all hay and straw rates applying from all stations in Nebraska to Omaha and South Omaha, exceptfng L sT fo cated north and west of Alliance on the main line to Billys and Si To'NeSl BUrlingt °n »"es north of Fremont, including the branch The applicant, Chicago &amp; North" Western Railway/proposes to make^im^r reductions applicable from all points on the Soln of So/N?

The result this proposal would be to give the producers of hay and straw located on the Union Pacific and in practically all Burling - ton territory, except that adjacent to O'Neill, reductions of 25 to 33-1/3 £?J£?^enabl^ the favored shippers to meet the compM - turn of interstate shippers of hay located in Kansas, Oklahoma and Mis - souri who at present enjoy the benefit of similar reductions by special action of the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizing the estab - lishment jrf such rates on less than thirty day's notice. The failure to provide the same reductions from points on the Burlington' and North Western producing prairie hay, which lie west and north of Norfolk Nebraska, would result in a serious and clearly unjust discrimina - tion against all of those shippers and would create a preference of the snippers in other parts of the state to whom applicants would give the full proposed reduction allowing them to meet interstate competition. In our. judgment the provisions of law quoted above are intended to give this Commission authority to prevent just such discrimination and. to prevent-the' injustices to our shippers which would be produced Lysuch a "rate war" resulting in favoritism to interstate shippers and to some shippers in this state as against others. We are informed by interested shippers that quotations or prices of hay delivered to Omaha from important hay producing sections, which reflect advantages of reduced interstate rates, have already been made and are embar - rassing Nebraska dealers in their attempt to market their produce at the important Omaha-South Omaha markets.

         <seg id="p106">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Omaha Grain Exchange, et al. ) Complainants, ) vs. )FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 829 Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R.R. ) Co., et al. Defendants. ) OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The complaint in this proceeding is filed on behalf of the Omaha Grain Exchange and its members, who are specifically named in the complaint. The defendants include all Nebraska railroads. Complainants allege that the charges published and maintained by defendants, which have been in effect since July 1, 1935, for application to the handling, switching, coopering and rental of grain doors in con - nection with set-back cans of grain at Omaha, Nebraska are, were and, if maintained in the future, will be unreasonable and unjust in violation of the provisions of the Railway Commission Act of 1907, as amended. Hearing before the Commission was had after due notice, on Oc - tober 11, 1939, at Lincoln, Nebraska. There is very little evidence tending to prove that the switching charge, generally based on $2.48 per car, assessed in connection with set-back cats, is unreasonable or otherwise unlawful. Set-back cars are carloads of grain which have been loaded for lino haul transporta - tion which must be set back to the elevator for unloading, generally because the "out"-inspection of the lading shows that it does not cor - respond to the grade of grain specified in the contract of sale. After the g-iain is loaded, it is inspected immediately to determine whether the contract grade requirements have been met which will enable the shipper to bill the car for immediate line haul movement. If the specified contract grade has not been loaded, as shown by such an inspection, the car must be switched for the loading section of the ele - vator to tiai-ks and lo:ations at iha same elevator wheie the grain may be unloaded into the elevator. For this switching operation at the elevator, incident to errors in loading line haul shipments, defendants generally charge $2.48 per car for. such "set-back switching." The set-back switching charge assailed has been considered in recent decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission and has been approved as not unreasonaLh: Merchants Exchange of St. Louis, et al., vs. Alton Railroad Company, et al., 230 I.C.C. 232, and the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the same proceeding on reconsider - ation, decided October 17, 1939. The case cited involved "interstate" charges for set-back switching services at Council Bluffs, lowa and Omaha, Nebraska. </seg>
         <seg id="p107">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION On consideration of the facts of record, we are of the opinion and find that the set-back switching charges assailed herein, were not and are not unjust or unreasonable and the complaint as to them should be dismissed. The remaining issues in this case related to the reason* bleness of charges for coopering and rental of grain doors applicable (in connec - tion with carloads of grain which are involved in the "set-back" switch - ing operations, described above. The tariff provisions involved in this portion of the complaint are published for all Nebraska railroads, in L. E. Kipp's tariff 330-E, I.C.C. A-3073 in Item 75, which is reproduced below for convenient reference: .•'¦¦-. :\ "The expense of furnishing grain doors or lum - : ber for necessary doorway barricades for protec - tion of carload shipments, in bulk, of grain, grain . products, seeds and other articles taking same lates as specified in Lists Nos. 1 to 6, Items 200 to 270, inclusive, and/or installing it in cars for crosstown movements (See Notes 1 and 2), reclaiming and reconditioning such material and returning it to owner road (when carriers ma - terial is used under option (1) or (3) below), shall be borne by the shipper under any one of the following arrangements: ;' (1) if the shipper so elects the carrier will fur - , nish the grain doora and/or lumber for neces- I sary doorway barricades and install it in all of 1 : ; . the cars shipped by him, reclaim and recondi - ' '¦¦'¦'..';¦¦ tions such, door material and return it to owner carrier at a charge of $2.48 per car against the -..'. shipper for such service; ¦ ¦'¦...¦' ; , ¦ ¦:'' ¦¦'¦ "' " ¦'- or . .¦¦¦¦/ GRAIN DOORS (2) If the shipper so elects he may furnish his OR LUMBER FOR . own material for necessary doorway barricades BARRICADING and install it at his own expense in all cars DOORWAYS OF shipped by him, provided that such material and CARS—CROSS- '.

Note I.—The designation "Crosstown Shipment" means a carload shipment from a loading point to an unloading point within the same terminal or switching district. Note 2.—The term "in bulk" used in this rule, means carload shipments of grain, grain products, seeds and other articles taking same rates as specified in Lists 1 to 6, Items 200 to 270, inclu - sive, which are loose or in mass and not in packages or cakes. Set-back Cars (4) Provisions (1), (2) and (3) of this item will also apply to set-back cars. A set-back car as herein referred to is one that is loaded at an elevator or warehouse and subsequently set-back —for any cause beyond control of carrier—and unloaded in the same elevator or warehouse. Exception—Not Applicable on Minnesota Intra - state traffic. See Item 76." The briefs of the parties discuss at length the question whether it is the obligation of defendants to furnish grain doors which aie plainly necessary to make ordinary box cars safe vehicles for trans - portation of grain in bulk. We shall not discuss or analyze the authori - ties cited by the parties on this question. For many years past the railroads serving Nebraska and other western surplus grain producing states have freely acknowledged their obligation to furnish box cars fit for safe transportation of bulk grain and, in that connection, have always provided grain doors for barricading the doois of grain cars to make fit for the safe transportation of bulk grain. The practice of carriers and shippers in this regard is so notorious that we could properly take judicial notice thereof, without formal proof and argu - ment of counsel relating thereto. In Chicago Board of Trade vs. Abilene to S. Ry. Company, 220 I.C.C. 753, the Interstate Commerce Commission considered this question as to the carriers' duty to furnish and install grain doors in connection with interstate line haul ship - ments. In the Merchants' Exchange of St. Louis, case Supra, the Interstate Commerce Commission discussed this question (232 I.C.C. 233) as follows: </seg>
         <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "The main question presented in Chicago Board of Trade vs. Abilene &amp; S. Ry.

However, the wording of the tariff : item there under attack and the language of the report are persuasive that the Commission's findings in that proceeding with respect to a reasonable charge for installation contemplate the furnishing of grain doors by the carriers without a separate charge therefor. "As indicated, the Commission in that proceeding was deal - ing with line-haul movements. It did not specifically consider the reasonableness of the charge for installing grain doors in connection with switch movements. But the duty which de - volves upon a caarier to furnish cars suitable to transport in safety traffic which it holds itself out to carry is not fulfilled when, in response to a shipper's request for a car for the transportation of grain, a car is furnished without grain doors. And this is jso whether the contemplated movement is a line - haul or merely a switching movement. Whether or'not the carriers, in establishing their line-haul rates or switching charges had in mind the expense of furnishing grain doors is beside the point. Their obvious duty when furnishing cars for the movement of grain shipments was and is to furnish cars suitable for the purpose. There is nothing of record in the instant proceeding warranting a modification of the conclusions reached in Chicago Board of Trade v. Abilene and S. Ry. Co., Supra, with respect to a reasonable charge for the installation of grain doors." In the case cited the Interstate Commerce Commission considered the reasonableness of a charge of $2.48 per car for "furnishing and installing grain doors" or as complainant terms it "coopering" grain cars at Omaha, Nebraska and Council Bluffs, lowa. In the report on further consideration in the same proceeding, the Interstate Commerce Commission said: . :": ¦'-¦.¦; ¦¦': : "In connection with line-haul movements, grain doors have always been furnished without charge in addition to the ¦ line-haul rates, only, the cost of installation being borne by the shippers. The line-haul rates ate'commodity rates specifically prescribed on this traffic; As it is the general duty of carriers to furnish (suitable cars, it follows that the line-haul rates ' contemplate'that the carriers shall furnish grain doors' without .extra cost to the shipper!" The doctrine of the original decision, quoted above, was affirmed by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the assailed charge of </seg>
         <seg id="p110">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT $2.48 per car was condemned insofar as it exceeded or exceeds a charge of 60 cents per car prior to March 28,1938 and 66 cents per car thereafter covering the installation but not the furnishing of grain doors in con - nection with "interstate" set-back switching movements of grain at Omaha, Nebraska and Council Bluffs, lowa. Defendants were required to publish a charge of 66 cents per car and to pay reparation on past shipments. On consideration of the evidence and the briefs of the partief herein, we are of the opinion and find that the charge of ?2.48 per caj for coopering grain cars in set-back switching service is unjust anr unreasonable insofar as it exceeds a charge of 66 cents per car for instal - lation of grain doors which is a just and reasonable charge to be pub - lished and hereafter applied. Complainants also assail the rental charges for grain doors anc lumber used in barricading the doors of grain cars when shippers elec' to perform the service of installing such grain doors under the thirr alternative of Item 75 in Agent Kipp's tariff quoted above. In view of the fact that it is the duty of defendants to furnish grain doors and lumber necessary to make box cara fit for safe tran? portation of bulk grain a "rental" charge for use of such doors and necessary lumber cannot be justified. This proceeding does not involv* the question whether defendants may lawfully elect to install all grain doors and lumber needed to make box cars safe for transportation of bulk grain withdrawing the provision that shippers may perform this service for themselves. On consideration of the evidence herein, we are of the opinion and find that where defendants have published "rental charges" for "use" of grain doors and lumber such exactions of a separate charge are unjust and unreasonable and they must be cancelled by, providing that ship - pers may install such grain doors and lumber used in coopering cars subject to supervision of the carriers to insure proper installation thereof.

All rates and charges for transportation services rendered by com - mon carriers in this state have been considered and approved by the Nebraska State Railway Commission before they became effective.

ATTEST: (Signed) George E. Truman Secretary. COMMISSIONERS CONCURRING: (Signed) Will M. Maupin (Signed) F. A. Good (Signed) Duane T. Swanson BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Emil Reikofski, ) Complainant ) vs. ) INFORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 8718 Chicago and North Western ) Railway Company, ) Defendant. ) OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came before the Commission for consideration upon the formal complaint of Emil Reikofski alleging inadequate service at defendant's railroad station at Foster, Nebraska, and asking that a station agent be restored at that point. The complaint was accom - panied by a Petition containing the signatures of 71 other citizens and residents of the community and further alleged that in 1936, when this Commission authorized substitution of a custodian for an agent at Foster, they were advised that if and when business warranted the agent would be replaced, and alleged further that business has so increased as to warrant an agency service at the present time. The company filed an answer alleging in part as follows: "I That the volume of business transacted at the station of Foster is so small that agency service at said point is not justi - fied and that it would be contrary to sound economic policy and to the best interests of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company to compel said railway company to assume the expense of maintaining a full time agency at Foster, Nebraska. </seg>
         <seg id="p113">! NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION II That there has been no material change in the volume of business transacted at Foster 1 since the regular agency service was discontinued on June 1, 1936, pursuant to an order of the Nebraska State Railway Commission and that the services and facilities afforded the public at Foster since discontinuance of the regular agency have been and are adequate and sufficient." After due notice given the matter was set for hearing in the Court House at Pierce, Nebraska, on September 13,1939. Foster is a town of approximately 122 people located on the Nor - folk-Wood line of the Chicago and North Western Railway 'Company in Pierce County, Nebraska. The nearest open Chicago and North Western station to the east of Foster is at Pierce, a distance of 8.8 miles and the nearest open Chicago and North Western station to Ihe west of Foster is at Plainview, a distance of 8.5 miles. Poster is not located on an improved highway but on a county maintained road. i. F ( rom Pierce, Highway No. 81, an improved gravelled highway runs north and south and at Plainview Highway No. 20, a hard-surfaced road runs east and west. - -¦¦' ¦ : ¦. '¦¦.' ¦¦ ¦ -¦¦..¦ '. ¦¦.' I . The application, (11857) of the company for authority 10 substitute a custodian for the agent at Foster, was filed with the Commission on May 15th, 1936,.and among other things stated: "In view of the general and consistent decrease in rail revenues to all rail carriers over the past several years and the remote likelihood of any change of consequence for the better; the light revenues being developed at this station; the continued expansion of improved highways in this area and utilization of these highways by rapidly expanding truck services; further maintenance of an "open" station at Foster, Nebraska, by the Chicago and North Western Railway Company is not warrant - ed; and further, we believe the withdrawal of such service will not be of great inconvenience to that community." The total revenue credited to that station for the year 1935 was $1,248.26; annual cost of maintaining- the part time non-telegraph agency was approximately $1,000.00 and under those circumstances the applica - tion was granted effective June Ist, 1936. •¦ The hearing on the instant complaint at Pierce was well attended •Ly .business men, residents and farmers of Foster and vicinity. Mr. Reikofski, the complainant, engaged in the coal, lumber, oil and grain business at Foster, is the largest rail shipper and was not in business at that point at the time the order in Application 11857 was entered. He testified to the inconvenience' caused by necessity of billing carloads and less than carload shipments from Plainview and Pierce; ordering </seg>
         <seg id="p114">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT cars; the necessity of having all freight consigned to Foster come pre - paid; the responsibility of spotting and sealing cars; inconvenience in securing grain doors and the insufficiency of telephone service from Foster to Plainview and Pierce. Other witnesses corroborated Reikofski, including a cream shipper who testified that the station was closed nearly all of the time and it was necessary for him to leave the cream shipments near the station for the train crew to load when they came through and in the return of empty cans, they were left sometimes inside and sometimes outside of the depot; that it necessitated an extra trip from his farm to the station to pick up the empty returned cans. However, he had suffered no losses either in cream or cans other than in the summer time when the cream sometimes boiled over because of the heat, From exhibits prepared by the defendant it was shown that revenues credited to Foster from all sources have increased gradually and sub - stantially since June, 1936, briefly as follows; From June to December, 1936, total revenue was $ 2,922.56 For 1937, total revenue was 6,186.79 For 1938, total revenue was 7,300.26 and for the first 7 months of 1939, total of 12,780.25 The greater portion of said revenue was derived from carload busi - ness including both inbound and outbound shipments. This revenue statement is remarkable, taking into consideration the depressed times and the drouth conditions existing in that section of the state. Testi - mony was to the effect that livestock and grain in the territory was on the upgrade with happy prospects that future business would be even better. The company officials testified that because of the working arrange - ment they now have with the Brotherhood it would be impossible to rein - stall a part time non-telegraph agency at Foster such as existed prior to July, 1936, and that the approximate annual cost of maintaining an open agency service at that point at the present time would be $1,878.60, or an additional expense over present custodial service of $1,611.60 a year; that agents at Pierce and Plainview ably and efficiently handle the business in and out of Foster and that to install an agent would be extra, unnecessary expense to the company. From the statistical evidence submitted and referred to herein, it will be readily noted that the allegations contained in defendant's answer have not been substantiated. We believe and so find that the revenues credited to the station of Foster are such as to warrant the services of an agent, at least a part time agent, if such a plan can be some way worked out. We are well aware of the fact that in the usual and ordinary case of this nature, because of the very light in and outbound freight shipments, a custodian has no difficulty in giving </seg>
         <seg id="p115">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION adequate and satisfactory service. However, with the revenue and the amount of freight moving in and out as it is at the present time at Foster, we believe that the services of a custodian are inadequate and the patrons of the Chicago and North Western Railway Company at that point are entitled to and should be given the benefit of an agent's services.. ¦¦/ &#132; ¦\ '¦ ¦ . : , / ' j ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago and North Western Railway Company be, and it is hereby,, ordered to provide an agent, non-telegrapher, at its Foster, Nebraska, station, effective November Ist, 1939.

Swanson IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEBRASKA FARMERS UNION LIVESTOCK UNION PACIFIC COMMISSION V. RAILROAD COMPANY 30266 j Filed January 20, 1939. 1. The railway commission has the power to regulate the rates and services of, and to exercise a general control over, all railroads engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers within the state. Comp. St. 1929, sec. 75-201. 2. Rates and charges duly established by the railway commission, until altered or set aside, have the effect of a legislative enactment. 3. When, in the exercise of its constitutional and statutory powers, the interstate commerce commission finds that a disparity in interstate and intrastate rates is resulting in unjust discrimination against inter - state commerce, and also determines what are reasonable rates for the interstate traffic and directs the removal of the discrimination, the car- </seg>
         <seg id="p116">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT rier is entitled to put in force the interstate rates found reasonable and to remove the forbidden discrimination by bringing the intrastate rates to the same level. 4. In such a case, where the state railway commission specifically adopts the rates and charges fixed by the interstate commerce com - mission as its own, they became the regularly fixed rates and charges 0/ the state railway commission until altered or set aside. 5. The reparations statute, section 75-510, Comp. St. 1929, does not authorize the railway commission to retroactively condemn as unlawful a rate or charge previously established as lawful by it and subject a carrier which has conformed thereto to the payment of reparations measured by what the railway commission now holds it should have decided in the earlier proceedings to be a reasonable and lawful rate. 6. A statute authorizing reparations under such circumstances is inhibited by the due process clauses of the state and federal Consti - tutions. ***** Heard before Simmons, C. J., Rose, Eberly, Paine, Carter and Messmore, JJ. CARTER, J. This is an action at law brought by certain live stock commission firms in Omaha, or their attorneys in fact, against all of the intrastate railroad carriers of live stock serving the stockyards at that point, to enforce the payment of reparations ordered by the Nebraska state rail - way commission based on the failure of the line haul or trunk railroads to absorb switching charges of the Union Stock Yards Company, or its successor, the South Omaha Terminal Railway Company, for switching car-loads of live stock from the terminals of the trunk lines to and from the loading and unloading chutes of the stockyards itself. The trial court found for the defendant railroad companies, and the plain - tiffs appeal. The record shows that, prior to 1896, the line haul carriers serving South Omaha owned their own trackage into the stockyards and no switching charges were assessed on shipments to and from those yards. Subsequently, the railroad carriers of live stock entered into an agree - ment with the Union Stock Yards Company whereby that company took over the tracks owned by the line haul carriers insofar as those tracks were within the stockyards district. Since that time the Union Stock Yards Company has operated as a common carrier, primarily for the purpose of serving the stockyards, and has established switching charges for the handling of traffic between the interchange tracks of the line haul earners and the chutes within the stockyards. As a result of this change a switching charge of 50 cents per carload of livestock was </seg>
         <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION assessed, which charge was wholly absorbed by the line haul or trunk railroads. On December 8, 1908, the railway commission authorized the Union Stock Yards Company to collect a switching charge of 75 cents per carload of live stock and ordered further that the line haul carriers absorb the whole charge. On September 16, 1910, the railway commis - sion authorized the Union Stock Yards Company to increase the switch - ing charges to $1 per carload of live stock and ordered the absorption of the full charge by the line haul carriers. On June 12, 1918, the rail - way commission authorized an increase of the switching charge to $1.50 per carload of live stock and ordered the line haul carriers to show cause why they should not absorb the whole charge. It appears, how - ever, that the control of the railroads had been taken over by the federal government on December 28, 1917, and no attempt was made by the railway commission to compel a complete absorption of the switch - ing charge by the line haul carriers. On August 27, 1920, the interstate commerce commission authorized a 35 per centum increase in all inter - state rates. The Nebraska railway commission took sfmilar action, but allowed a 25 per centum increase only on intrastate rates. On January 27, 1921, the interstate commerce commission ordered all steam railway carriers in Nebraska to comply with its order for a 35 per centum in - crease of freight rates for the reason that the Nebraska rates wera discriminatoiy as against the interstate rates, making the switching charge of the Union Stock Yards Company $2 per carload of live stock and the line haul carriers amount of absorption $1.50, leaving a balance of 50 cents per carload of live stock to be paid by the shipper or re - ceiver of the stock. On July 1, 1922, the switching rates along with all other freight rates were reduced approximately 10 per centum, making the new switching charge $1.82 per carload of live stock, $1.35 of which was absorbed by the line haul carriers and 47 cents passed back to the shippers and receivers of live stock. By a decree of the United States district court, the Nebraska state railway commission was en - joined from enforcing sections of statutes and rules in conflict with the foregoing orders of the interstate commerce commission. Thereafter, and on May 5, 1922, the railway commission vacated its order increas - ing freight rates 25 par centum, and its orders suppiemental thereto, expressly stating that the intrastate rates then in force should remain in effect until changed by a subsequent order of the commission. On May 3, 1924, the railway commission, after a complete investigation of the freight rate structure in Nebraska, entered its permissive order that-all freight charges be based on distances from the points of origin to final destination. The opinion of the railway commission accompany - ing the order states: "Distances to South Omaha stockyards shall gov - ern the rates' 1.. On September 1, 1932, the railway commission, without entering an ordei, found that the new rates to the Missouri river mar - kets prescribed in.the "Interstate Commerce Commission Docket 17000, Rata Stiucture Investigation, Part 9, Livestock —Western Division Rates", a copy of which is in the record, as reasonable maximum rates </seg>
         <seg id="p118">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT and that they should include delivery to the unloading chutes of the Union Stock Yards Company without the assessment of the additional switching charges. The effective date of this order was, upon applica - tion, postponed until November 1, 1932. It was therefore definitely or - dered under the new rates effective November 1,1932, whether interstate or intrastate, that line haul carriers were to absorb the full amount of the switching charge. It is not contended by the parties that the switching charge of $1.82 per carload of live stock is an unreasonable charge far the service and facilities furnished. The allegation of unreasonableness is based wholly upon the failure of the line haul carriers to absorb this entire charge out of line haul rates; in other words, upon the view that the line haul rates are unreasonable in amounts equal to the unabsorbed portion of the switching charge, in that they do not cover all trans - portation service to and from the loading and unloading chutes in the South Omaha stockyards. Plaintiffs further contend that the orders of the railway commission requiring the use of distances to the South Omaha stockyards necessarily contemplated the handling of stock to and from the loading and unloading chutes solely on the basis of the line haul rates. It is upon this basis that plaintiffs asked, and the railway commission granted, reparations to the extent of 47 cents per carload of live stock shipped in and out of the South Omaha stock - yards under the provisions of section 75-510, Comp. St. 1929. The period during which reparations must be paid, if liability therefor at - taches, the number of carloads of live stock shipped in and out of South Omaha Stockyards, and the amounts owing if the defendants ace liable, are all stipulated in the record. The present action was brought only for the sum of 5318.19 on a very few of the shipments involved in the order of the railway commission, these being selected in such a way as to lay the foundation for the determination of every issue involved in the commission's order. Plaintiffs estimate, and the defendants agree, that total reparations, with interest, if defendants are liable therefor, will amount to approximately $175,000.00. The question for determination in this suit is whether the trial court rightfully denied a judgment for reparations based on the order of the railway commission requiring their payment. That the stockyards company is a common carrier has been hereto - fore determined. State v. Union Stock Yards Co., 81 Neb. 67, 115 N.W. 627. Under the Nebraska regulatory act, section 75-403, Comp. St. 1929, it is not unlawful for the railway commission to allow charges in excess of the line haul rate for terminal service and facilities, the statute in part saying: "The schedules shall plainly state the places upon its road between which property and passengers will be carried, * * * stating separately any terminal charges, and any rules and regu - lations which in anywise change, affect or determine any of the aggre - gate of iuch iates, fares and charges." To like effect is the interstate </seg>
         <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION commerce act as passed by the federal congress. 49 U.S.CIA., sec. 6, par. 1. It seems to us, therefore, that the fixing of a line haul rate does not of itself include the cost of terminal services and facilities and whether it does or not must be determined from the orders of the railway commission establishing such rates. See Walker v. Keenan, 73 Fed. 755; Interstate Commerce 1 Commission v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R.R. Co., 186 U. S. 320. The source of the difficulty resulting in this litigation was the act of the federal government in taking over the control of the railroads on December 28, 1917. Prior to that date all line haul rates fixed by the railway commission on intrastate shipments included the whole of the switching or terminal charge of $1 per carload of live stock. At the commencement of federal control the switching charge on interstate shipments was $1.50 per carload of live stock, 75 cents of which was absorbed by the line haul carrier; , On June 12, 1918, the railway com - mission authorized the Union Stock Yards Company to increase its switching charges to $1.50 per carload of live stock on intrastate ship - ments and ordered the railroads to show cause by June 2A\ 1918, why they should not be required to absorb the whole of the increased switch - ing charge. Due to the fact that the railroad properties were being operated by the director general of railroads, no further! order was made with reference to the absorption of the switching charges by the line haul earners. The increased switching charge of $1.50 per carload was'duly put into effect and remained in effect all during the period of federal control which ended on February 29, 1920. During (this period the railroads absorbed $1 of the switching charge on intrastate ship - ments and ¦;75 cents of the switching charge on interstate! shipments. The balance of each charge was collected from the shipper or consignee of the live stock. r • : . :"¦ '" The period of federal control was terminated on February 29, 1920, by an act of congress which provided in part: "All ratesj fares, and charges, and all classifications, regulations, and practices, in any wise changing, affecting, or determining, any part or the aggregate of rates, fares, or charges, or the value of the service rendered, which on Febru - ary 29, 1920, aie in effect on the line of carriers subject to interstate commerce act, shall continue! in force and effect until thereafter changed by state or federal authority, respectively, or pursuant to authority of law; but prior to September 1, 1920, no such irate, fare, or charge shall be reduced, and no such classification, regulation, or practice shall be changed in such manner as to reduce any such rate, fare, or charge, unless such reduction or change is approved by the commission." 41 U. S; St. at Large, Part I, p. 464. Pursuant to the power reserved to it in this act, the interstate commerce commission, effective August 27, 1920, authorized a 35 per centum increase in rates on interstate traffic and specifically authorized such increase to apply to switching charges. On August 23, 1920, the Nebraska railway commission denied a 35 </seg>
         <seg id="p120">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT per centum increase and ordered a 25 per centum increase only. The order, however, contained the following provisions: "It is further pro - vided that (d) intrastate switching and special service (such as transit, weighing, diversion, reconsignment, storage, car rental and transfer) charges shall be increased twenty-five (25) per cent, provided that all existing absorption rules will be applied to the advances herein au - thorized." Thereupon the interstate commerce commission found that the increase of 26 per centum on intrastate traffic was discriminatory as to interstate commerce, and pursuant to the authority of section 13, par. 4, 49 U.S.C.A., ordered the 35 per centum increase of rates to be made. See, ilso, Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities Com - mission, 245 U. S. 193; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563. The order of the interstate commerce com - mission was sustained by the United States district court for the district of Nebraska and the rates therein established were made effective. Un - der this order the switching charge on intrastate carloads of livestock was $2 per car, $1.50 of which was absorbed by the line haul carrier. The switching charge on interstate carloads of livestock was $2 per car, $1.25 of which was absorbed by the line haul carriers. These rates and charges were included in the tariffs published by the defendant railroad companies, copies of which were filed with the Nebraska rail - way commission and the interstate commerce commission. On May 6, 1922, the Nebraska railway commission entered an order containing the following: "It is therefore ordered that the order made and entered in this cause on August 23, 1920, as modified by supple - mental orders hereinbefore made, be, and the same is hereby vacated and set aside, thereby leaving the intrastate rates now in effect as law - ful rates until hereinafter changed pursuant to order of this commission." On May 24, 1922, the interstate commerce commission entered its order with reference to the order of the Nebraska railway commission under date of May 5, 1922, in part as follows: "And it further appear - ing, That by order entered April, 7, 1922, as modified by order dated May 5, 1922, the Nebraska state railway commission has vacated and set aside its order of August 23, 1920, as modified, so as to authorize the Nebraska carriers to charge and collect on Nebraska intrastate traffic the full increases allowed by this commission in said docket Ex Parte 74, now in effect; and that the increased intrastate rates and charges prescribed by and established pursuant to the aforesaid orders heretofore entered Ly this commission will, if said orders of this com - mission be vacated in so far as they pertain to rates and charges for the transportation of freight, continue in effect as to the lawfully established and applicable intrastate rates and charges unless and until changes by further affirmative order of the competent authority of said state." It seems to us therefore that the Nebraska railway commission, by its order of May 5, 1922, acquiesced in and adopted the rates promul- </seg>
         <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION | gated by the interstate commerce commission and that the railroad companies ¦were at this stage of the proceedings lawfully! absorbing $1.50 of the $2 switching charge on each intrastate car of j live stock and lawfully collecting 60 cents of the charge from the shipper or consignee. This is further borne out by the decree of the United States district court sustaining the intrastate rates established by I the inter - state commerce commission, wherein it- states that the rates in ques - tion "are now lawfully in effect hy virtue of the supplemental order of the Nebraska state railway commission in Application No. 4200, dated May 5, 1922." U . ¦."'' ¦".¦:¦. .'" ¦•¦."¦:¦¦.'. '¦•¦¦;.¦¦ , On June 23, 1922, the railway commission authorized the railroads in Nebraska, effective July 1, 1922, to deoiease their freight rates to correspond with decreases which had been authorized by the interstate commerce commission as shown by its order. The interstate commerce commission had ordered that the rates in effect be reduced so they would exceed the .rate in effect on August 26, 1920, by 21.5 per centum instead of 35 per centum. In its order the railway commission said: "It is the intention of this order, and it shall be so construed, to permit Nebraska carriers, applicants in this case, to amend rates and charges on intiastate freight traffic in the same general manner and to the same extent as shall take place in complying with the findings of the inter - state commerce commission." Clearly, this order authorized an in - crease in the switching charge of $1.50 per car in effect August 26, 1920, by 21.5 per centum, thereby fixing the switching charge at $1.82. On July 1, 1922, all railroads except the Union Pacific Railroad Com - pany published.tariffs by which they absorbed $1.35 of the switching charge, leaving the remaining 47 cents to be collected from the shipper or consignee. The Union Pacific Railroad Company; provided in its published tariff of the same date for an absorption of $1.32 of the switching charge, leaving 50 cents per caiload to be collected from the shipper or consignee. On May 19, 1926, the Union Pacific Railroad Company applied for an order increasing the absorption on intrastate shipments from $1.32 to $1.35. On the same date, the railway com - mission entered its order, authorizing the increase of the amount of the switching charge to be absorbed to $1.35 per carload of live stock. There can be no question that the railway commission was fully aware of the amount of the switching charge and the amount being absorbed by the line haul carriers. The ordot of May 19, 1926, shows that the railway commission considered the switching charge and the amount of absorption ais a, fixed rate by the commission by virtue of its order of May 5, 1922, when it accepted the rates then in effect as lawful rates, and its order of June 23,1922, authorizing a reduction of intrastate rates to the.same'extent that they had been reduced by the interstate com - merce commission. The rates thus established remained in'effect until November 1, 1932, when an entirely new rate scale was established on both intrastate and interstate shipments of live stock based on the distance from the point of origin to the point of destination.) The rates </seg>
         <seg id="p122">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT prescribed, effective as of November 1, 1932, specifically provided that the ent.re switching charge should be absorbed by the line haul carrier. We conclude, after an examination of all the orders of the railway eomm.ss.on on the subject, that the amount of the switching chargl absorbed by the defendant companies here complained of was done upon the legal orders of the railway commission. Appellants contend that an order of the railway commission entered on May 3, 1924, and known as Resolution 74, required the absorption of the whole of the switching charge on intrastate shipments. It is true that this purported order stated^ that Distances to South Omaha stock yards shall govern the rates. But it w.ll be observed from a reading of Resolution 74 that it was merely permissive in character and not an order fixing a rating having the force and effect of a statute. The order states in part: "It is expected that the carriers will publish specific rates from the respective points of origin to final destination and not merely a distance scale. The scales here set forth are not intended for such rigid appli - cation as would prevent meeting short line, or reasonable cross-country competition. t f "N.°u "-f WUI be entered at this time for the reas°ns heretofore set forth. These findings are sufficient warrant for the carriers to pub - lish out on statutory notice rates in accordance with the scales attached hereto in appendix. It is expected that the rates will be published to be effective on or before July 20, 1924. If such publication is not made the commission will reopen the case for such proceedings as are appropriate." It will be noted the commission's opinion states that no order will be entered at this time and that if the recommended publication is not made the Commission will reopen the case for such proceedings as are app.opnate. The case was never reopened and no subsequent action wa ever taken thereon. It is contended that all rates and charges es - tabhshed pursuant thereto must be treated as carriers made, and if found to be unreasonable by the railway commission, the railroads could be subjected to the payment of reparations. We think this is true but the fact remains that nothing was said in the order about the absorp - tion of switching charges, and in view of the fact that the amount of the absorption was not changed by the carriers after the making of the permissive order, we are obliged to hold that it was governed entirely by the commission made order previously made. We necessarily con - clude that Resolution 74 is not an order that was binding upon the radroads as a rate or charge fixed by the commission, as we have stated it was permissive tut not an order entitled to the force and effect of To specifically set forth every contention advanced by the appel - lants in their attempt to show that the switching charges in question were never fix=d by the railway commission would require an inde" </seg>
         <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION terminable amount of space in this opinion. We must, by necessity, content ourselves with.the statement that the record and briefs have been examined as to each point raised and a finding that jthe partial absorption of the switching charges was not authorized by the railway commission cannot be sustained. The further consideration of the case must therefore be bottomed on the premises that the partial absorption of the switching charges complained of was a rate or practice approved by, and, in effect, ordered by the Nebraska railway commission. This court is committed to the rule that a rate put into effect by order of the railway commission has the force of a statute on the sub - ject. Unless held to be unreasonable and arbitrary by the courts, it expresses the only reasonable rate governing the subject-matter con - tained in the order. Central Bridge &amp; Construction Co. v. Chicago &amp; N. W. R. Co., 129 Neb.. 726, 262 N.W. 852; Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 284 U. S. 370. In other words, the ab - sorption of $1.35 of the $1.82 switching charge and the collection of the balance of 47 cents from the shipper or consignee was a legally and conclusively established legal rate or practice prior toj November 1, 1932. It is not disputed that the railway commissionjs order of November 1, 1932, requited the absorption of the whole switching charge by the line haul carriers. The question is whether, under such circum - stances, the railway commission properly allowed reparations under section 75-510, Comp. St. 1929. The reparations statute; section 75-510, Comp. St. 192E, is as fol - lows: "That if, after hearing- on a complaint under sections 6126, 6127, 6128 or 6129 or sections 6137, 6138, 6139, 6140, revised statutes of Nebraska for 1913 (75-501 to 75-504, 75-506 to 75,509), the Nebraska state railway commission shall determine that any party complainant has on and after the taking effect of this act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint paid unjust or unreasonable rates or charges to any defendant railroad or express company in this state on intrastate traffic or has on and after the taking effect of this act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint suffered damages by reason of the maintaining, publishing, demanding, charging, receiving or retaining by such carrier of any rate or rates, charges, rules, regulations, services or practices on intrastate traffic which are found ty the commission to be unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discrim - inatory, unduly preferential or otherwise unlawful, the commission shall make an order directing the railroad or express company to pay to the complainant the sum to which he is entitled on or before a day named." It will be noted from the.foregoing statute that reparations can be allowed only where it was found that the shipper had paid unreasonable or unjust ratns or when the complainant suffered damages by reason of the collection of unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential or otherwise unlawful rates or charges by the carrier. But the rate; or charge, or practice, whichever it may be in the instant case, </seg>
         <seg id="p124">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT was not unreasonable, unjust or unlawful, because the railway com - mission had by action previous to its collection determined the contrary. Its action in so doing was equivalent to a legislative enactment on the subject. This being true, the railway commission was without authority to grant reparations. There is a further reason why the plaintiffs cannot recover in this case. If section 75-510, Comp. St. 1929, could be construed to authorize the railway commission to retroactively condemn as unlawful a rate or charge previously established as lawful by it, it would amount to a taking of the property of the railroads without due process of law, a procedure inhibited by section 3, art. I, Constitution of Nebraska, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 284 U. S. 370, the court said: "Where the commission has, upon complaint and after hearing, declared what is the maximum reasonable rate to be charged by a carrier, it may not at a later time, and upon the same or addi - tional evidence as to the fact situation existing when its previous order was promulgated, by declaring its own finding as to reasonableness er - roneous, subject a carrier which conformed thereto to the payment of reparation measured by what the commission now holds it should have decided in the earlier proceedings to be a reasonable rate." In the hear - ing of the same case in the circuit court of appeals, 49 Fed. (2d) 563, the court very aptly said: "The only constitutional restriction upon the legislative power to retroactively reduce rates suggested by the ap - pellant is the constitutional prohibition against the taking of property without due process of law. That is, it is argued, the commisson, hav - ing established a legal and lawful rate, the freight charges thus fixed, allowed and collected because the property of the carrier and cannot by a retroactive law be arbitrarily taken away by legislative fiat. This position seems to be well taken. * * * That is to say, whether we regard the power of the commission in establishing a just and reasonable rate as a basis of reparations as a judicial power or as a legislative power, in either event rates established by the legislative pnwer and collected by the carrier cannot be taken from it because it is susequently de - termined to be excessive, whether the belated determination is by court or legislature, or, to use the phrases more commonly applied to the acts of the commission, whether such subsequent determination is quasi legislative, administrative or quasi judicial—in either event a rate es - tablished by law—lawful when charged, remains lawful when attacked later by the shipper. The view we have expressed is supported by all the decisions of state courts construing- laws establishing rate-regulat - ing bodies having power to grant reparations for excessive rates charged by the carrier." In T. R. Miller Mill Co. v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., 207 Ala. 253, 92 So. 797, the court said: "Such a practice would be odious to the generally established notions of justice, and would., moreover, be utterly </seg>
         <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION j subversive of the policy and utility of any system of rate regulation; for no rate could be relied upon as stable, and neither carrier nor shipper - could ever be certain of the basis upon which business was being con - ducted. For it must be observed that, under such a practice, the com - mission could just as well find that a rate approved and imposed by it years before was in fact unreasonably low, and give retroactive opera - tion to the higher rate later found to have been reasonable. Of course no such practice was contemplated, and no such power was vested in the commission." ; . ¦ ; . ¦ ¦¦..-.. .:'•¦"¦;'¦'¦¦. ¦ I Also, in St. Louis-S. F. Ry. Co. v. State, 155 Okla. 236, 8 Pac. '2d) 744, the court said: "The question before us, then, is whether or not, after the commission has made a rate, and it has been complied with by the carrier, and the goods hauled, and the collections made, it can later decide that the original rate'allowed was excessive and require the carrier to refund. Natural justice would seem to require a negative answer." ' . . In.holding portions of a Kansas reparations statute invalid, the supreme court of that state said: "And to the extent that section 4 is designed in text and terms to create a basis for cause of j action in behalf of a shipper for the exaction of a rate which the carrier was bound to charge under compulsion of statute, breaches of •which were punishable by criminal prosecution, it violates the vested rights of the carrier under the provisions of the fourteenth amendment;, it likewise offends against those orderly rules and principles for the administra - tion of justice which constitute due process of law: and it is therefore unconstitutional and void." State v. Public Service Commission, 135 Kan. 491, 11 Pac. (2d) 999. ; It seems quite apparent to us that the railway commission is with - out authority to set aside a rate or charge previously fixed by it on the ground that it is unreasonable as now viewed and proceed to grant reparations. Sush a rate or change is the reasonable, just and legal rate or charge until abrogated by the railway commission, or other competent authority, and an award of reparations based on the un - reasonableness of such rate or charge is not authorized by section 75-510, Comp. St. 1929. Appellants contend that the failure of the railroads to appeal from the reparations order made by the railway commission in which it was determined that failure to absorb the whole switching charge was an illegal practice has made that part of the commission's order conclusive. It is not necessary for us to decide the effect of the failure of the lailroad to: appeal. The fact remains that the railway commission did not have authority to grant reparations under the facts inj this case. This being true, the commission's order purporting to so do is void. When the district court was called upon to enforce the railway com - mission's order for reparations, it had jurisdiction to inquire into the </seg>
         <seg id="p126">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT power of the railway commission to enter such an older. The trial court determined that the reparations order was invalid and in this it was correct. In view of the conclusion reached, it is not necessary for us to discuss or pass upon the other points raised in the briefs by the parties to the suit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. </seg>

         <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION • BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the matter of the Application of ) the Railway Express Agency, Inc., for ) APPLICATION NO. 13433 authority to increase express rates ) CORRECTED OPINION AND and charges and to modify "Express ) FINDINGS AND ORDER. Rate Structure", (Ex Parte 126). ) . , OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: On June 8, 1938 the applicant, Railway Express Agency, Incorpo - rated, filed petitions with the Interstate Commerce Commission and with all state commissions seeking authority to modify the express rate structure by increasing rates and by reducing charges. On June 9, 1938 the Interstate Commerce Commission commenced an investigation designated Ex Parte 126 to cover this subject. State commissions were invited to join in a co-operative investigation and this was done through a committee of three state commissioners who par - ticipated in all phases of the resulting proceeding. In Ex Parte No. 126, Express Bates 1938-1939, decided February 0, 1939, the Interstate Commerce Commission and co-operating state commissioners approved the modified express rate structure proposed by the applicant herein. The testimony and exhibits offered before the Interstate Com - merce Commission were filed with us and by stipulation at the hearing on March 13, 1939 they were incorporated in the record herein. Applicant proposes an increase.of ten per cent applicable to all shipments weighing 100 pounds cr more except carload rates on fresh fruits and vegetables as to which an increase of five per cent is pro - posed. Reductions in charges are proposed in connection with packages weighing up to 55 pounds on short hauls and up to 38 pounds on long hauls. The greatest reduction is made for the small packages weighing up to 20 pounds. On short hauls a charge of 25 cents would cover packages weighing up to 6 pounds in connection with which present charges are fiom 36 to 39 cents. The reductions range from a cent or two up to 35 per cent of present charges on some small packages weighing 20 pounds or less. No increase is proposed on shipments of milk, cream and related articles. ¦! Chambers of commerce, large shippers and competing truck or - ganizations were advised concerning the general effect of the proposed express rate charges and the hearing to be held March 13, 1939 but no shipper appeared to oppose the application. Several shippers of «mall packages testified in favor of the proposed reductions and urged that they be given the advantage of the superior express service at </seg>
         <seg id="p172">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT charges approximating those applicable by parcel post. They stated that the reductions would give the Railway Express Agency, Incorpo - rated, a large number of additional shipments which cannot move under present charges or which now go by parcel post. The express rate structure applicable from Council Bluffs, Sioux City, lowa, St. Joseph and Kansas City, Missouri and Denver, Colorado into Nebraska is identical with that applicable from Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, Hastings, Scottsbluff, North Platte and Alliance to points in this state. The new interstate express rate structure will become effective April 15th with Interstate Commerce Commission approval. It will reduce charges on a large volume of small shipments from lowa, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado and Wyoming points into Nebraska. If similar reductions are not made within Nebraska our shippers will be at a serious disadvantage in competing with shippers of similar mer - chandise from points outside of this state. The Nebraska Commercial Truckers Association opposed the pro - posed reductions in charges for small packages although no specific evidence showing the extent of the competition between the trucks and the Railway Express Agency, Incorporated, was offered. It also appears that the appearance in opposition was not based on a study of the effect of any such changes on all truckers in this state. In the past certain smaller truck operators have asked us to authorize reduced minimum charges to meet parcel post and private truck competition. Such ap - plications are now pending. The decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizes the Railway Express Agency, Incorporated, to make the new express rate structure effective on less than the usual thirty day, statutory notice, in tariffs which have been prepared to become effective April 15th, 1939. Upon consideration of the facts of record, the Commission being duly advised in the premises is of the opinion and so finds: FINDINGS I That the proposed revision of express rates and charges applicable between all points in the state of Nebraska for general purpose of in - creasing rotes per hundred pounds 10 per cent except carload rates on fruits and vegetables five per cent and reducing charges on small pack - ages as set forth in the schedule of graduated first and second class express rates, of record herein, will be a just and reasonable basis of express rates and chaiges for future application between points m the state of Nebraska. n That the proposed revised Express Rate Struature should be made effective between all points in Nebraska, served by Railway Express </seg>

I During the year 1939, Certain rules and regulations were adopted by the Commission, in order to provide for more adequate policing of the motor carrier industry operating in Nebraska intrastate commerce, one of which provided for the issuance by the Motor Transportation De - partment of "Identification Cards", which describe the equipment regis - tered by the carrier under his certificate, and also outline the operating rights in brief to which he is entitled under certificates of public con - venience and necessity as a common carrier, or. peimit as a contract carrier. (See General Order No. 79 and Supplement No. 1, at page 231). The enforcement division of the Motor Transportation Department, during this year, secured numerous convictions in municipal, county! and district courts throughout the state. In practically all cases where the violation was minor, or where the inspector was of the opinion that the violation was unintentional, a recommendation was made to the court that the fines be suspended or made light. Where the violation was of a serious nature and would tend to defeat the declared purposes of the Act of the legislature, the fines would usually be more severe. The Commission, during the year 1939, acted upon a large number of motor carrier applications, both relating to property and passengers carriage for hire. Tha said applications are listed on following pages. It is felt that the ¦ work of the past two years has been highly beneficial, not only to the general public but to the industry itself, and that these yeais of experience in the general regulation of this industry have provided an excellent foundation for future regulatory steps, whether they be by the Commission or by legislative enactment. (A) MOTOR TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES Under this general classification are included motor carriers operat - ing motor vehicles foi passenger hire over fixed routes and between fixed termini in Nebraska Intrastate Commerce. The applications of these companies, where approved, authorized the transportation of passengers, baggage, mail and express in con - formity with schedules of operations which must be filed with and ap - proved by the Commission. : </seg>

Lincoln, Nebraska OPINION AND FINDINGS GOOD, COMMISSIONER: This application petitions the Railway Commission of the State of Nebraska to grant a special specific rate between Scottsbluff and Ne - braska City of 30 cents per cwt. between respective canning estab - lishments of the Otoe Foods Products Company, the main plant being at Nebraska City, with an additional and newer plant located at Scotts - bluff. The application requests that the rate be established on canned goods and such commodities as may be interchangeable between the canning factories involved. It was brought out in the hearing, that a principal interplant movement would be that of tomato pulp, unfit for human consumption until processed with macaroni, beans or other basic foods. The application comes by way of the trucker applicant, i.e. the Jelsma Freight Lines. The hearing on this petition was duly held in the Commission Hear - ing Room on March 23, 1939, at which hearing it was testified by the said Jelsma that the operations contemplated 18,000 lbs. straight loads from plant to plant, without intermediate operations. The regular truck weight on such operations according to the tariff published by the Com - mission would be 41 cents per 100 lbs. as compared to a rate of 48 cents per cwt. with a minimum of 36,000 lbs. applicable for the same movement by rail. The said applicant instanced that his operating costs are 8.27 cents per mile traveled, that he operates a ton and a half Ford truck with trailer. However, upon cross-examination, the witness testified that the item of depreciation was not incorporated into this cost item. It is held by the Commission that the rate asked for, should not be granted in full, for the particular reason that other canning and wholesale interests, notably at Omaha, would not have an opportunity to protest or demand the same rate from and to their centers, as that given the Jelsma Freight Line. However, a principal product for trans - portation is the tomato pulp alluded to, and it would appear that there is no reasonable objection to the transportation rate being allowed on that product alone. </seg>

BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the matter of the Jefferson County ) Truckers' Association for authority to ) classify sugar and potatoes, shipped in ) APPLICATION NO. 13310 bags, with grain and grain products. ) OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: &#132;.,.:.,.. • This application, seeking authority to apply grain column rates — sugar and potatoes, came on for hearing June 5, 1939, before the full Commission. The applicant, Jefferson County Truckers' Association, was not represented either by officer or individuals of the Association nor by counsel. However, Messrs. Darling and Christensen of Auburn and Grand Island, respectively, appeared in support of the application. Mt. Darling principally concerned with the fact that very shortly after prescription of rates now carried in the truck tariff and which became effective February 14, 1938, he lost to private carriers a lucrative haul consisting of sugar and potatoes which were shipped to Auburn in carload lots stored by the Darling Transfer andlater distributed upon receipt of orders from the owners'. For this service, Mr f Darling stated he had received 15 cents per cwt. Mr. Christensen of Grand Island agreed with Mr. Darling's testimony insofar as private carriers were concerned, although he had not acted in the capacity of a warehouse- </seg>
         <seg id="p212">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT man but received his tonnage from the wholesale houses located in Grand Island. Witness Ryan testified that he was not definitely committed to the fact that the classification on sugar and potatoes should be reduced to the level of the commodity rates applicable on grain and grain products, it being his thought before the Commission acted definitely on this ap - plication, additional hearings should be had at several out-state points for the purpose of obtaining additional information which would enable the Commission to determine beyond any question of doubt whether the classification rating on such commodities as sugar and potatoes should be reduced to the level of the grain and grain products rates or whether the grain and grain products rates should be increased to the level presently applicable on potatoes and sugar. Witness Ryan also stressed the fact that so-called private carriers were making deep in-roads on the business of properly certified common carriers. Witnesses Powell for Watson Brothers and Hurkman for the Union Transfer expressed a serious doubt as to the number of motor vehicle carriers of property in true bona fide private carrier operation. Witness Powell stated his experience in this particular territory was of com - parative short duration, but that in other territories with which he was familiar, a large percentage of the so-called private carriers were nothing but common carriers operating illegally under the guise of a private carrier. The Commission, therefore, being fully advised in the premises is of the opinion and so finds that the Applicant Association has not sup - ported its proposal for amendment to the tariff and that the hearing did not develop sufficient evidence to justify an order applying through - out the state and therefore the application should be denied. An appropriate order will be entered. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that Application 13310 of the Jefferson County Truckers- Association shall be and the same is hereby denied.

After receiving proper certification, applicant, at different inteivals, filed separate requests for rates on the commodity in question, none of which requests were on the same basis. Mr, Carl Schmidt, General Manager for the applicant, was personally interviewed by the Rate De - partment of the Commission on April 7, and advised the application could not be granted because of the fact there were as above stated, several varying requests for the rate.

         <seg id="p214">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT that all previous requests be disregarded and consideration given only to proposal of April 7, 1939. A check of the rail tariff, applicable on the commodity in question from Scottsbluff to Omaha disclosed the fact that there was a rate of 24 cents per cwt. at a 14,000 pound minimum, and Mr. Schmidt made the statement that he did not feel it would be fair to ask for a rate based any differently than the rail rate on the commodity in question and, as a consequence, asked the Rate Department to bring the matter to the attention of the Commission and secure, if possible, authority for publication on a basis identical with the rails, or 24 cents per cwt. at a 14,000 pound minimum. Since the applicant has complied with Commission requirements and is now certificated as a common carrier of property by motor ve - hicle intrastate in Nebraska, the rates to be prescribed under this order, will be available to common carriers generally, or any of them, properly certificated to transport property by motor vehicle intrastate from Scottsbluff to Omaha. The Commission, being fully advised in the premises, is of the opinion and finds that the application should be granted. An appropriate order will be entered.

':'. '-.)'." OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: Effective February 14, 1938 the Commission prescribed reasonable rates applicable to tiuck transportation of all kinds of freight including livestock. The livestock rates were established: after giving due con - sideration to suggestions made by a committee of livestock truckers selected from various parts of the state. • As a result of complaints from Nebraska Interior Livestock mar - kets alleging that the new iates were too high for short hauls and too low for the long hauls into Omaha, the livestock rate schedule was sus - pended, effective February 26, 1938, by Supplement 10 to Resolution .146. Hearings were held during March and April at MeCook, North Platte, Broken Bow, Grand Island, York,.Norfolk and Lincoln. A new livestock ' t rate schedule was prescribed effective June 15, 1938, in Sup - plemental, to Resolution 146. The new schedule reduced short haul rates and increased various long haul rates which were generally con - ceded to be too low. Below we have inserted a comparison of the railroad rates on cattle and hogs in carload lots from points Lexington to North Platte in - clusive to Omaha as compared with the truck rates between the same points effective June 15, 1938.

It will be seen that the present truck rates are from 5% cents to 9% cents higher than the rail carload rate on cattle and from 1 cent to 4% cents higher than the carload hog rates- After an Ex Parte hearing at which truckers from the Lexington- North Platte area complained that the new truck rates were too high and that they had lost or were about to lose their livestock business to the railroads, the Commission established an emergency truck rate of 30 cents per cwt. applying to cattle and hogs from this Lexington-North Platte territory to Omaha, effective October 17, 1938. After a hearing at Gothenburg, November 4, 1938, the Commission ordered the cancella - tion of the emergency rates. The instant application was filed by the Wilson &amp; Sons Transfer Company, Inc., January 13, 1939. It recites the history of Truck rates on livestock from the Lexington-North Platte territory to Omaha and seeks authority to establish reduced rates com - petitive with the rail basis. Hearing was had before the Commission January 26, 1939. The applicant was supported by other truckers who haul livestock from the same origin territory. The principal movement is cattle which are fed at points along and north of U. S. Highway No. 30, and the Union Pacific main line of railroad. Before any truck rates were prescribed the tiuckers hauled livestock to Omaha at rates from 2 cents to 4 cents per cwt. higher than the rail carload basis. The stock shippers and truckers who testified agreed that the present truck rates are too high, that rates on cattle and hogs should be the same, that truck rates should be 3 cents or 4 cents per cwt. higher than rail carload rates, that trailer loads of 14,000 to 20,000 lbs. can be and usually are loaded, and that such trailer loads of stock can be profitably carried at rates from ." cents to 4 cents higher than the rail rates to Omaha. The evidence shows that truckers cannot profitably carry 5,000 \b. trmkloads of live - stock from the Lexington-North Platte territory to Omaha at the pro - posed reduced rates. Trailers used in this service can easily load 14,000 lbs. or more. If we established truck rates 3 cents higher than the rail carload rates on cattle the new truck rates would be lower than the raiJ rates on hogs. The carload minimum governing Tail rates on hogs is 17,000 lbs. which is approximately the average trailer load of cattle and hogs transported by truck. We can see no justification for tru?k rates on hogs and cattle lower than the rail rates on hogs. All truck operators who testified, agreed that 5,000 lb. loads of rattle and hogs cannot be carried to Omaha from the Lexington-North Tlatte territory profitably at the existing truck rates which are the </seg>
         <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION subject of this complaint. Some of these truckers agree that a rate should be provided .for 5,000 lb. lots of cattle and hogs, on a higher basis than the rates applicable to trailer loads of stock subject to a minimum •weight of 14,000 lbs. If the present rate on cattle and hogs, subject to a 5,000 lb. minimum, were continued in effect it would permit the small grower and feeder of livestock to get truck service on the basis of rates which are relatively reasonable considering the rail carload late and full trailer truck rates, and the service performed by truck operators. If the carriers who handle these shipments in large trailers pick up the livestock at two or three farm locations in the country, such service entails additional expense for which they would receive additional compensation by application of the present rates governing the loads of 5,000 lbs. Full trailer loads composed of two or more shipments of 5,000 lbs. would produce truckload revenues comparable with that de - rived from application of the' new rates at a 14,000 lb. minimum. Be - cause of the additional service and expense involved it would also seem proper to continue the present rule, providing for a pick-up charge of 6 cents per cwt. applicable to lots of livestock less than 5,000 lbs. The continuance of the present rates, at the 5,000 lb. minimum, and subject to the 5 cents pick-up charge for smaller lots with reduced rates for 14,000 lbs. straight trailer loads would seem to provide truck rates and service which will be reasonable and take care of the varied needs of all classes of livestock shipments. On consideration of the facts of record the Commission being duly advised, we are of the opinion and find: That the existing truckload rates applicable to shipments of cattle and hogs, from points Lexington to North Platte inclusive to Omaha, Nebraska, as applied to trailer load units of not less than 14,000 lbs., are unju3t and unreasonable.

This matter was set for hearing May 4, 1939, at 10 A. M. in the Commissioners' hearing room at Lincoln, Nebraska. Neither applicant nor any one representing applicant appeared at the hearing. However, prior to hearing the applicant and also the manufacturer of said build - ings appeared at the Commission office and did have a personal confer - ence with the Rate Division of the Commission. The manufacturer stated occasionally motor vehicle operators, other than those located in Wahoo, would transport these buildings, but that the major portion of such transportation was handled by resident motor vehicle common carriers. .'•.,' . ¦ Due to the fact su:h buildings are not specifically listed in the classification, the intermediate rating is automatically applicable to such transportation. The rail classification provides for a third-class rating on portable buildings composed entirely of wood or wood, steel and iron combined and at the same time provides a fourth-class rating on grain storage bins composed of wood or wood, steel and iron combined when shipped as a fabricated or portable commodity. </seg>

Truckers' Association for authority to ) apply grain and grain products rates;to ) APPLICATION NO. 13527 alfalfa, sweet clover, red cloverj timothy ) and sudan seed, also fertilizer. ) OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: 1 Pursuant to legal notice, Application No. 13527 of the Saunders County Truckers' Association, seeking authority to apply grain column rates on alfalfa, sweet clover, red clover, timothy, sudan and kindred field, also garden seeds,'as well as plant food, more commonly known as fertilizer, came on for hearing before the entire Commission on June 1, 1939. Evidence introduced by witnesses for proponents dis - closed the fact that very little, if any, consideration should be given to the commodities in question insofar as value is concerned, due to the fact the claim experience is practically 100% favorable, no claims hav - ing been presented by dealers on account of loss or damage to alfalfa seed which, unquestionably, carries the greatest value of any of the commodities in question. These commodities, as a rule, are shipped in special grain bags, the texture of ¦ which is very resistent to damage. Applicants testified that prior to regulation, these commodities all moved oh a flat rate, no distinction whatsoever being made with reference to value. The evidence also tended to show that all of the commodities in question load very compactly, consuming the minimum of cubical space and constitute very desirable traffic. The Commission, in General Supplement No. 1 to the Official Truck Tariff, and which supplement became effective August 1, 1938, did pro - vide specific lates under the heading of grain, grain products and re - lated articles, including animal and poultry feeds and edible flour, all of which columns are subject to note H, and this note provides that the rate on grain and grain products shall be applicable to such grain as wheat, corn and oats, but did not make any distinction as to seed corn, as an example, and it is a well-known fact that many varieties of hybrid seed corn are shipped in large quantities by motor vehicle and that the value of this particular seed corn compares favorably with the value of alfalfa seed. . ; ¦'&lt;¦/'¦: Proponents introduced testimony disclosing the fact that our clas - sification on page 25 provides a 4th class rate on fertilizer and that this commodity is a by-product of packing houses, and since note H includes tankage and meat scraps, which are also by-products of pack - ing houses, it would only be reasonable to enlarge note H so that the rates under the grain, grain products and related articles columns would </seg>

         <seg id="p224">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT merits, well machines, plumbing and heating supplies between Beatrice and Omaha, came on for hearing June 1, 1939, at 2 P. M. with Don E. Weber and R. W. Bagby of Beatrice offering testimony for the ap - plicant and Peter Gilbertson offering testimony in opposition. The rail carriers did not produce witnesses for the purpose of introducing testi - mony but did stipulate as follows: "Comes now William J. Schall on behalf of the rail carriers here represented by him, the same being the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Company, Rock Island and Union Pacific R. R. Company and respectfully moves the Commission to deny the application herein made for the reason that there is no evidence in this record sufficient to sustain the same tinder the laws of the State of Nebraska as established by the statutes thereof." Evidence for the proponents was to the effect the 11 cents rate re - quested in the application was necessary to meet competition of the railroads because of rail traffic carrying provisions for a fabricating in transit privileges on articles manufactured in whole or in part of steel. Testimony as to how this transit difference, upon which the request for the 17 cent rate was based, is determined, was to the effect that the tariff provided that the highest of 3 alternatives must be used: (1) the rate on the finished product from origin of the raw material to ultimate destination, or, (2) the rate on the raw material from origin to fabricating point, or, (3) the rate on the finished product from fabricating point to ultimate destination. Using the three-way rule of the rail tariff as a basis for calculation, the testimony showed the rate on agricultural implements from Kansas City to Omaha to be 40 cents per cwt, this being the highest charge of either of the 3 alternatives. From this 40 cent rate was deducted the rate on the steel from Kansas City to Beatrice of 33 cents and to this difference of 7 cents was added the transit charge of 2% cents, making the total through rate, ac - cording to the witness, 9% cents, and to compete with this 9Yt cent rate obtained as a result of transit privileges, it was indicated the applicant must have a 17 cent rate. As a matter of fact, the testi - mony discloses that the request for a 17 cent rate between Beatrice and Omaha was not based on the transit privilege at all but was based historically. That is to say, a reinstatement of a rate of 10 cents per cwt. established from Beatrice to Omaha a great many years ago and subjected to the horizontal increases and declines during the interim, but which rate was allowed to expire June 30, 1938. The testimony further disclosed that at the present time ship - ments are moving: by rail at a 29 cent rate as published in Western Trunk Line Freight Tariff 382, L. E. Kipp, Agents I.C.C. No. A-3003, effective April 10, 1939, and made applicable on Nebraska intrastate Traffic by order of the Netraska State Railway Commission in Anpb' - cation No. 13293 of December 23, 1938. The cover page of this tariff carries the following provision: "Rates published herein are estab - lished to meet motor truk competition and will expire with December </seg>
         <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 31, 1939, unless sooner cancelled, changed or extended." This tariff was intended by the carriers to be an exact duplicate of the Official Truck Tariff published by the Commission on transportation between certain specified points, two of which points are Beatrice and Omaha. Item 165 in the truck tariff provides a volume breakdown from the regularly prescribed classification basis of rates unless specific pro - vision is made to the contrary. Page 9, General Supplement No. 1 to the truck tariff provides a column 45 rating on all of the agricultural implements listed on said page 9 in truckload minimum of 8,000 pounds at column 45 is not subject to the minimum weights or volume ratings shown in Item 165-A as carried on page 8 of said General Supplement No. 1. It naturally follows that with the restriction above mentioned, agricultural implements moving in quantities of 8,000 pounds or more are not subject to any reduction whatever in rate. Western Trunk Line Tariff No. 382, supposed to be an exact duplicate of the truck tariff insofar as it applies on agricultural implements, names a column 46 rating on straight or mixed quantities of 8,000 pounds, which is also subject to a note, but this note provides that the minimum quantities "re not subject to the rate scales shown on pages 50 and 51 of said tariff, and testimony was introduced to the effect that rail jcarrieis had placed written interpretation upon this! note to mean thatj agricultural implements moving from Beatrice to Omaha carrying a 4th class rating would be subject to the breakdown as outlined in rate scale 4 on pages 50 and 51 of-Western Trunk Line Tariff 382, which resulted in a rate of 29 cents per cwt. by rail as against a 32 cent rate applicable by truck. Witness for the opposition introduced testimony to the effect that a column 40 rate at an 18,000 minimum would produce a rate and revenus comparable with the provisions of Western Trunk Line Tariff 882. :.; ' ;--;:&gt;' :¦¦¦ ¦¦¦'-¦ \ j '¦&gt; The Commission being fully advised in the premises is of the opinion and finds that proponents did not justify the prescription of the 17 cent rate between Beatrice and Omaha. Testimony, however, of the proponents and opponents clearly [indicated the reasonableness of providing' a more comparable basis of rates applicable between the points in question, thereby placing the 2 available modes of transporta - tion on a near parity. We therefore find that an additional item should b° provided under the heading, "Agricultural Implements," as described in column 2, page 9, General Supplement No. 1 to the truck tariff as follows; . j ¦ .¦¦¦¦¦'¦¦¦' .'.-¦: -¦ .

         <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION feeds. The applicant testified he had been in the trucking business for a considerable length of time, but that he had transported the commodities in question for a period of approximately 30 days only. Any revision of the tariff as herein proposed would necessarily be ap - plicable throughout the entire state and great care should be exercised by the Commission in granting such requests because of the attendant disruption of the rate scale to points other than the one involved in this application at which similar mills are located for the production of poultry and livestock feeds. The testimony would indicate the request for the rate was based wholly, or in a large measure at least, upon Denver, Colorado competi - tion from which point the commodities in question could be delivered f.o.b. mills in Nebraska City at approximately $1.00 per ton in favor of the Denver source of supply, and to overcome this $1.00 per ton variation, which could easily be drastically reduced by market fluctua - tions, the applicant proposes a reduction of 1 cent per cwt., or 20 cents per ton, to overcome the variation between Denver and Omaha as sources of supply for the commodities in question. The applicant has never transported any of the ready mixed feeds from Nebraska City to Omaha, this movement being taken care of by a privately owned truck which is also used in transporting the ready mixed feeds to other points, such as Sioux City, Iowa; Kansas City and St. Joseph, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; from all of which points the commodities required, and which are under consideration herein, could be purchased and transported on the return movement to Nebraska City. It does not seem likely that a reduction of 1 cent per cwt., or 20 cents per ton, would successfully prevent the transportation of this material by private truck whenever possible. The Commission being fully advised in the premises is of the opinion and so finds that the application should be denied.

The facts recited in the ap - plication are undisputed. The truck loads of sugar, minimum 20,000 lbs. from Grand Island, Nebraska to Omaha, Nebraska, is 35 cents per cwt. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, and the Union Pacific Railroad Company serve the same points of origin and destination. They have established a truck competitive rate on sugar in 20,000 lb. lots which is also 35 cents per cwt. These railroads have published and made effective a carload rate of 31% cents per cwt. applicable to sugar from Grand Island to Omaha, subject to a carload minimum weight of 40,000 lbs. via the lines of the C. B. &amp;. Q. Railroad Company, and a minimum of 60,000 lbs. governing carloads shipped via the Union Pacific Railroad. The applicant states that it is unable to compete for transportation of sugar from Grand Island to Omaha at the truck load rate of 35 cents per cwt. with a railroad rate of 31% cents applicable between the same points. The applicant therefore, seeks authority to establish a rate of 31% cents applicable to sugar in truck load lots from Grand Island to Omaha, in lieu of the existing rate of 35 cents per cwt. subject to a 20,000 lb. minimum weight. A hearing was held on this application, December 8, 1939, before the Commission at Lincoln, Nebraska, at which the applicant, the in - terested shippers, the intervening Nebraska Truckers' Ass'n., and the competing C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad Company were all represented. Con - siderable testimony was submitted by the parties pro and con, with reference to the question whether truck load rates should be established on the same basis as the carload rates published by competing 1 rail - roads which are applicable to much larger loads moving in box cars. There is no occasion to determine this geneial question in this proceed - ing. It seems clear to us that there can be no single answer to such a broad question. If the carload rates of competing railroads are on a relatively high level, tru-k lines may be able to establish the same rates for truck load quantities as reasonable rates based on the pros - pect of satisfactory revenues. In the Western Classifration, sugar, in carload lots is rated fifth class. Exhibits of records show that the </seg>
         <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 31% ceni; carload rate on sugar from Grand Island to Omaha is higher than the carload and truck load rates on other fifth class commodities, such as canned goods and that the Interstate Commerce Commission has established rates on sugar in southwestern territory at 30% of first-class, which would produce a rate of 25 cents per cwt. from Grand Island to Omaha. It is contended by the applicant that his costs of operation for truck-load lots, -will compare favorably with the railroad costs for transportation of carload quantities between the same points, and that the existing railroad rate is high enough to yield attractive gross ani net earnings as applied to transportation of sugar in truck load uniis of 20,000 lbs. from Grand Island to Omaha. A 20,000 lb. minimuir truck load would yield a revenue of $63.00 for transportation of sugar by applicant from Grand Island to Omaha, a distance of 136 miles. The earnings per loaded truck mile for this movement would therefore, be 46.3 cents. The earnings per running mile on the assump - tion thas the truck would be compelled to! return from Omaha to Grand Island empty, would be 23.2 cents per mile. The applicant and inter - veners in his behalf testified that the heavy loaded movement is west bound and that loads are generally available from Omaha to Grand Island. ;The evidence makes it clear that the applicant would receive satisfactory and reasonable earnings from the transportation of sugar from Grand Island to Omaha in 20,000 lb. truck loads at the proposed rate of 31% cents per cwt. We are, thetefore, of the opinion and find that the'applicant, Sullivan Transfer &amp; Storage Company has justified the establishment of the proposed rate of 31% cents per cwt. applicable to truck loads of sugar, minimum 20,000 lbs. from Grand Island to Omaha. '.-. : ¦ The j applicant and interveners in his behalf have submitted evi - dence showing that sugar'beets in the vicinity of Grand Island have been harvested, and that the sugar factory of the American Crystal bugar Company is now at the peak of its operation for the 1939 sugar "campaign" period. As a result, sugar is moving from the factory in large quantities to various consuming and storage points in this state. In view of the facts stated we are asked to find that an emergency exists justifying and requiring the establishment of the proposed rate on one day's notice. In view, of all the facts of record concerning the need for immediate and quick movement of the commodity and the com - petition among the carriers involved, we are of the opinion and find that an emergency exists which justifies! the establishment of the pro - posed rate, effective December 16, 1939. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the volume rates on sugar in truck loads of 20,000 lbs. published in the official Common Carrier Truck Rate Tariff at page 33, and as provided in Item 165-A, General Supplement No. 1, be amended </seg>

These rules and regulations required that identification cards be obtained annually, when annual fees are paid, for each vehicle kept in service and the cards issued for the preceding year surrendered to the Commission. </seg>
         <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In many instances it would not be necessary to issue a new card each year, but if a sticker be pasted over the year as shown on the current card, containing the numerals designating the ensuing year, as for example, if a sticker containing the numerals "1940" be pasted' over the numerals '&lt;1939* on the upper right hand corner of the 1939 card, the card would then suffice as a proper identification card for 1940. The Commission therefore finds that where the said identification card for the current year is sufficient to comply with the rules and regulations of the Commission for the ensuing year except as to the designation of the year for which it is issued it shall not be necessary to obtain a new identification card, nor to surrender the current card, but that the Commission may instead, permit the carrier to retain the current card and affix, thereto a sticker as aforesaid, to be furnished by the Commission and that the rules and regulations heretofore prom - ulgated under General Order No. 79, Supplement No. 1 should be modi - fied so as to permit the same to be done.

It owns and operates a telephone system consisting of numerous exchanges and toll lines connecting these exchanges with each other and with the exchanges and toll lines ot other telephone companies. At the present time it is furnishing tele - phone service to subscribers located in the Village of Loretto, Ne - braska, and surrounding territory, by means of a switchboard located at Loretto. ¦ ¦', ,•.-:.-¦\. : -\ It is proposed to discontinue exchange service at Loretto, and pro - vide service to the present subscribers in that community and vicinity </seg>

With the application, the company submitted a petition, dated July 27, 1939, that it had circulated, and that had been signed by 17 out of the 21 Loretto rural subscribers, requesting: they be served direct from the Albion exchange at grounded rural rate of— Gross per month $1.50 Net per month 1.25 Another petition was also submitted, dated July 27, 1939, that had been signed by 7 out of the 11 Loretto village subscribers, requesting they be served direct from the Albion exchange at rates of— Gross per Net per month month Four party business, metallic line $2.75 $2.50 Four party residence, metallic line 1.65 1.40 Rural party residence, grounded line 1.50 1.25 The Commission, in executive session held on August 9, 1939, set this matter for hearing, for September 14, 1939, at 2:00 o'clock P. M. at Albion, Nebraska, and interested parties notified. On or about August 19, 1939, a letter was received from E. J. Miille advising the date of hearing was during the Boone County Fair, at Albion, Nebraska, and he, as Secretary of the Fair Association, would be unable to attend, and other interested parties would be similarly situated. On or about August 29, 1939, there was also received a petition signed by 20 of the same persons having signed the petitions previously circulated and sub - mitted by the company, requesting their names be withdrawn from any and all petitions they may have signed regarding moving of the Switch - board from Loretto to Albion, Nebraska. Owing to the absence of the Commissioners when the request was made, the date of hearing could not be changed, and the same was held as scheduled. At that hearing the applicant and only the attorney for the patrons appeared. A continuation was asked, and due to the extra - ordinary circumstances, the matter was reset for hearing, upon agree - ment and to the satisfaction of the attorneys for both the applicant and patrons, the same to take place on September 22, 1939, at 2:00 o'clock P.M. in the Commission's hearing room in Lincoln, Nebraska, and in - terested parties were again notified. Upon the appointed date and hour, the Commission sat it its hearing room for purpose of receiving testimony and evidence. No appearance was made by the protestants, and after a wait of one hour, the case proceeded on the testimony and evidence of the applicant. Introduced in evidence was a statement showing the company's in - vestment at Loretto, Nebraska, on December 31, 1938, at ?9,423.10; that </seg>
         <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the total revenues for the year 1938 were $669.42, and the total expenses $1,187.24, resulting in a deficit of $517.82 for the period. The testimony adduced further shows that the ownership and operation of the Loretto exchange, has in the past several years, resulted in a loss to the ap - plicant, and that a reduction in the operating loss can be affected by discontinuing the Loretto exchange service, and providing service to present subscribers in that community and vicinity by direct wires to the Albion exchange. • v A proposal made for the reason that revenues received failed to provide the actual cost of rendering service, without considering any return on the necessary investment, and where circumstances are such as would indicate there are no future prospects of increasing the num - ber of subscribers to the extent necessary for overcoming operating losses, and where the company will continue to furnish the community telephone service by means of direct connections to a switchboard lo - cated elsewhere, is not unreasonable so far as concerns the subscriber.

L-2 charges, service and practice of North- ) ORDER AMENDING western Bell Telephone Company, on the ) ORDER OF NOVEMBER Commission's own motion. ) 2, 1937 OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: On November 2, 1937, an order was entered in the above proceeding providing, among other things, that from and after December 1, 1937, the additional charge by the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company for hand telephone sets should be reduced from 15 cents per month per tele - phone to 10 cents per month per telephone, such charge to continue for a period of eighteen months after the installation of a hand set in sub - stitution for a desk or wall set, and to be in addition to certain change charges prescribed at the time of the substitution of the hand set for the desk or wall set. Since November 2, 1937, the Commission has had numerous confer - ences with the representatives of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Com - pany respecting the charge for telephone handsets for the purpose of determining whether said charge should be entirely eliminated. The Commission finds that a large percentage of handset subscribers have by now paid out on this surcharge of 10 cents per month, hence the number of substitutions incident to the change of instruments is minimized to a large extent. It therefore appears that a definite an - nouncement of the elimination of the monthly charge should be made at this time and that the order below is so framed as not to create an ex - c:ssive, concentrated demand on the company for this type of set. </seg>
         <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION After due consideration of all matters inherent to the change over of instruments and being fully advised in the premises, the Commission finds that the present charge of 10 cents per month applicable for a period of eighteen months should be entirely discontinued as of January 1,1940. It further appears to the Commission that the other matters of in - vestigation referred to in the original order entered in the above en - titled proceeding on the 26th day of May, 1937, cannot be advantageously pursued at the present time, but that the said proceeding, except as re - gards the subject matter dealt with in the order of November 2, 1937, and in the instant order, should be dismissed.

From the report and records, it appears that ample opportunity to participate in the matter, has been extended to all persons interested, and that the proposed System of Accounts is the result of thorough study and investigation, and the co-operative efforts of the Commission's Accounting Department, the Nebraska Telephone Association's Account - ing Committee and other parties at interest. Conceding the impossibility of preparing a System of Accounts that would be entirely satisfactory to every one, it appears that the System here under consideration will meet the requirements and pur - poses of the Commission, and those companies for whose use it is intended. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds, that the Uniform System of Accounts for Class C and D Telephone Companies, embodied in the draft which is now before us, should be prescribed, in lieu of the system of accounts now in effect, for use of telephone companies, sub - ject to our jurisdiction, having average annual operating revenues ex - ceeding $15,000.00 but not exceeding $50,000.00, and since it is desirable that said system become effective on January 1, 1940 an emergency exists.

A route map of the'!proposed lines in Application No. 13451 was offered and admitted in jevidence and was identified as Exhibit 2. A copy of this route map was included in and made a part of the Commission's order and referred to as Exhibit "A". Said route map shows a conflict between applicant's' lines in Application No. 13451 and a telephone line along the west side! of the public highway running north and south between Sections 19 and 20, T 16 N, R 5 W. The telephone line in conflict at that location is owned by the Liberty Tele - phone Company of Fullerton, Nebraska. I The Boone and Nance Rural Public Power District on November 8, 1939 filed with the Commission an j application praying "that the Nebraska State Railway Commission enter an order, as provided for in Section 86-314, C. S. for 1929, directing said Liberty Telephone Com - pany to vacate the west side of said public highway and assessing the expanse thereof in such proportions as in its judgment will best protect tho rights of all the parties interested and those of the general public". </seg>
         <seg id="p296">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT The District's application was docketed by the Commission as Supple - ment 1 to Application No. 13451 and a copy served on the Liberty Telephone Company. The Commission set this supplemental applica - tion, which hereinafter will be referred to as the application, foT Hear - ing on November 24, 1939. The Liberty Telephone Company on Novem - ber 24, 1939 before the hour of Hearing, filed with the Commission its answer to the application. The Telephone Company in its answer prays "that in case it is or - dered and directed by this Commission that the lines of this said Liberty Telephone Company be established on the east side of said north and south road, that its pole line be constructed separate and independent from that of the said Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, and ade - quate and sufficient poles, anchorage, and protection be provided and said line removed and reconstructed by the applicant, the Boone and Nance Rural Public Power District, and that this, the Liberty Tele - phone Company be saved harmless and without expense in the matter. "This, the Liberty Telephone Company further prays that the ap - plicant, the Boone and Nance Rural Public Power District be required to metallicize at its expense the lines of this the Liberty Telephone Com - pany and protect it harmless from all interference occasioned by the paralleling and or crossing of its said telephone lines by the transmis - sion lines of the said applicant Boone and Nance Rural Public Power District." The application came on for Hearing by the Commission as sched - uled on November 24, 1939. Evidence was adduced and the matter sub - mitted on the record. The Commission, in consideration of the evidence and being fully advised in the premises is of the opinion and so finds: 1. (a) That the Boone-Nance Rural Public Power District and the Boone and Nance Rural Public Power District are one and the same. (b) That the Boone-Nance Rural Public Power District, after Hearing on Application No. 13451, was authorized by the Commission to construct an electric transmission line on the west side of the public highway running north and south between Sections 19 and 20, T 16 N, R 5 W. (c) That the route of the electric lines proposed in Application No. 13451, was shown on a blue print map filed with the said application •\ i required by law and a copy of said blue print route map was fur - nished the Liberty Telephone Company approximately four weeks prior '' the Hearing on said application.

The matter under consideration has been involved and tedious, beginning with the granting of the application of the Eastern Nebraska Public Power District, Project No. 2, on August 6th, 1937, the same being an application for authority to build certain transmission lines in Saunders, Cass and Otoe Counties in Project No. 2 of the said Eastern Nebraska Public Power District. A minority commissioner filed a dissenting opinion, and a protestant, the Nebraska Power Company, appealed from the decision to the Supreme Court of Nebraska, but later dismissed its appeal. The instant matter is by way of a formal com - plaint in which it is alleged by complainant that because of inductive interference caused by energizing the said rural electric lines the tele - phone lines paralleling the power lines have become so noisy that sub - scribers have great difficulty in cairying on conversations over them. No waiver from the telephone company was received at the time the power lines were authorized. Prior to the time of the granting of this application the Rural Electrification Authority, with headquarters in Washington, D. C, had agreed to protect th 2 rights of senior occupants of the routes applied for to the extent of paying for the materials necessary to remove undue in - ductive interference fiom the said senior occupant's lines, a properly constructed grounded telephone transmission line, said senior occupant to perform the necessary labor. This arrangement was mutually satis - factory to all parties concerned, and this policy maintained for a time under order of this Commission. </seg>
         <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Later, the Rural Electrification Authority issued an order that power district authorities should no longer make such agreements, declaring that the R. E. A. would not, under any circumstances, furnish money wharewith the rights of senior occupants could be protected. It was stated by those acting under authority of the R. E. A. that if the Ne - braska State Railway Commission insisted upon its OTder that undue inductive interference should be removed at the cost, partially at least, of the applicant public power district, that there would be no more funds allocated to Nebraska for the building of said public power district electric transmission lines. It would!appear that this order was made with full knowledge of the Nebraska Statutes and the duties of this Commission thereunder. This order is in direct conflict with the Statutes of Nebraska and seemingly a virtual notice to the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission that its jurisdiction in Nebraska is subject to orders from the R. E. A. The Statutes of Nebraska in like cases is plain and mandatory. Section 86-315 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes reads in part as follows: ! . ; '¦".-.. / "The State Railway Commission shall make such orders and prescribe such terms and conditions for the location and con - struction and operation of the proposed lines as to it may seem just and reasonable and make such order in the premises as in its judgment may best protect the rights of all the parties in - terested and those of the general public." This should be clear to every mind—that it is the duty of this Com - mission to protect the rights of senior occupants whose service is ren - dered unworkable or unreasonably difficult by reason of the construction of a parallel electric transmission line. If this is not sufficient, attention is called to Section 86-313 of 1929 Compiled Statutes, reading as follows: "All lines hereafter constructed for the transmission of electric current including telephone and telegraph lines on the public highways or in other places in this state except as here' ihafter provided, shall provide sufficient clearance between such lines and existing properly constructed telephone and telegraph lines, so that reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of ex - isting lines shall not be interfered with." The argument that has been advanced to the effect that grounded telephone systems are not "properly constructed telephone systems" is utterly puerile, and not worthy of consideration by this Commission. In the application of the Loup River Public Power District, Application 12623, decided by a unanimous opinion of this Commission on October 5, 1937, it was said in part as follows: </seg>
         <seg id="p304">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT "For the first time, the question is presented to this Com - mision of what constitutes a properly constructed telephone line. In this state we have a large number of grounded telephone lines, or those with a single wire with a return through the earth. In fact, nearly all telephone lines owned and operated by fanners as mutual companies, are grounded. In a large degree this holds for other small telephone companies, and in a small degree for the larger telephone companies. Through these grounded lines, farmers are able to receive telephone service at the minimum cost. These lines are now serving the purpose for which they were intended. We are unable to conclude that a grounded telephone line, otherwise properly constructed and - maintained, is not properly constructed because it is a grounded line. These grounded lines are senior occupants of the high - way and when the owner of an electric transmission line, a junior occupant, seeks to occupy the same highway, it should leave the owner of a telephone line so that the reasonable opera - tion and efficiency of existing lines will not be interfered with. We know of no way to prevent this obvious result other than to metallicize all of the grounded line or that part which parallels the transmission lines with the use of coils. Applicant having refused to pay the cost, or any part thereof, of metallicizing the grounded lines of the Skeedee Telephone Company, we are for the first time called upon to exercise the full power and au - thority vested in us by Section 86-315 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes, by denying this application to the extent that the pro - posed transmission lines parallel the lines of the Skeedee Tele - phone Company. If and when applicant and Skeedee Telephone Company enter into an agreement in writing, duly ackowledged and filed with the Commission concerning the proposed con - struction, then the application will be granted in whole." In that case it will be observed that the resulting inductive inter - ference was avoided by a denial of the application so far as it related to parallel lines. The original order issued in this matter was dated August 6th, 1937, as before noted, but construction did not begin until much later, in fact, not until after the R. E. A. had issued a notice that it would not pay for the removal of inductive interference caused by its line. This said original order contained in part the following: "It is therefore ordered by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that application No. 12515 be and the same is here - by granted and that the Eastern Nebraska Public Power District be and the same is hereby authorized to construct the proposed transmission lines in accordance with its map, drawings and spe- </seg>
         <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION cifications thereto attached and made a part of this order, in accordance with the written agreement now on file with the Commission, and in accordance with the laws of Nebraska and the rules and regulations of this Commission, subject to the con - dition that the applicant, being the junior occupant shall dur - ing the time of construction bear all the reasonable expense that may be necessary on its own lines or existing lines to insure the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines, and if after applicant's lines have been constructed and energized the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines are interfered with, the applicant shall bear any reasonable ex - •- pense that maybe necessary on its own lines or existing lines to remove such interference. It is further ordered if the parties at interest are unable to agree on the amount of such reasonable expense, either party may make application to the Commission t for a determination of the controversy. It is further ordered that the jurisdiction of the Commission be and it is hereby re - tained for the purpose of receiving .any complaints and entering any order that may be necessary during the time of construction, and after the proposed lines are energized." A similar question was presented to the Commission in Formal Complaint No. 817, Unadilla Union Telephone Company vs. The Eastern Public Power District,, and after a full hearing' it was held in a unani - mous opinion under date of August 27, 1938, in part, as follows: "Respondent has not constructed its transmission lines in accordance .with Section 86-313 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes. It has not constructed its transmission lines to provide sufficient clearance between its lines and existing; properly constructed telephone lines so that the reasonable efficiency of existing lines were not interfered with. Respondent did not construct its transmission lines in accordance with the condition of said order. It did not, during construction, bear or offer to bear all reason - able expense on existing lines to insure the reasonable efficiency of existing: telephone lines. After its transmission lines were constructed and energized it did not bear or offer to bear any ** reasonable expense on existing telephone lines to remove such interference. Respondent now says it will not bear the ex - pense, or any part thereof, of metallicizing complainant's tele - phone lines. We have before us a copy of a letter under date of May 28th, 1937, from John M. Carmody, Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration, in which the question of induc - tive interference is discussed. This letter plainly states that the Rural Electrification Administration will not bear any ex - pense to remove inductive interference from grounded telephone </seg>
         <seg id="p306">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT lines. This letter must or should have been in the hands of the respondent at the time our order was entered on August 6th, 1937. Under these circumstances, it would have been a wise procedure for the respondent to have delayed the con - struction of its transmission lines until the Rural Electrifica - tion Administration had changed its ruling. At the time the original order was entered granting the application, we knew, and respondent knew, that the construc - tion of its proposed transmission lines would interfere with the reasonable efficiency of complainant's grounded telephone lines. We could have denied the application and would have denied it to - the extent that the proposed transmission lines paralleled the grounded lines of complainants had we then been told that re - spondent would not bear any reasonable expense of metallicizing complainant's telephone lines. The complainant interposed timely objections at the original hearing and was assured by the presiding Commissioner that the objections would be taken care of in the order. The respondent, having constructed and energized its lines under an order with express conditions there - in contained, should be bound by those conditions and should now be willing to place the complainant in status quo by de - energizing such of its transmission lines as interfere with the reasonable efficiency of complainant's grounded telephone lines." The Commission's Chief Engineer testified that he made noise meas - urements on telephone lines of complainant while electric power was turned off of the rural lines of the respondent power district. He used a Western Electric Company's No. 2A noise measuring set and testified that a telephone line testing over 400 noise units was considered such inductive interference as to unreasonably interfere with that line's ef - ficiency. His statement shows results of his test as follows: </seg>

The telephone line is metallic where paralleled by Nebraska Power Company's Line. (d) 2 miles of this parallel is with a 34,600 volt feeder line which was not de-energized. As will be readily noted from the engineer's statement the actual noise measurements revealed inductive interference greatly in excess of the tolerable limit of 400. The engineer also tested three lines by the voice method and testified that he was able to hear the party at the other end of the line. However, he explained that he used a telephone in the central office and talked over a direct line. In answer to a question, he said: ; '': ' : : .":" - " </seg>
         <seg id="p308">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT "A. Yes, I carried on a conversation over the 3 lines which you mentioned and did not experience any difficulty in hearing the party to whom I was speaking. However, I think, in all fairness, I should say I received the impression that the party on the other end was talking unusually loud. That conversa - tion was from the central office to a party on the line. If I had been on one of the rural lines speaking to a party on an - other rural line, I probably would have experienced more diffi - culty in carrying on a conversation." Other witnesses testified that they had used the lines for years and they were quiet and satisfactory before the power district energized its lines but that since that time the lines have been very noisy and at times impossible to hear the other party. That was especially true when they talked from one line to a party on another line, one or both of which parallel the power lines. There seems to be no doubt concerning the inefficiency of the tele - phone lines because of inductive interference. The main question seems to be; who is to pay the metallicizing cost. Mr. Emil Oberly, manager of the telephone company, testified that the fair and reasonable amount of money necessaTy to metallicize the lines was $1,412.43 and Engineer H. H. Henningson, for respondent, testified that he had looked over the estimated figures and said they "looked fairly reasonable" and he "didn't think they were much out of line." The remedy in this case is unfortunate for the users of both serv - ices. It would meet with our unanimous satisfaction if the rural resi - dents in the district could have electricity and also telephones. We do not believe, however, that the long established subscribers of telephone service in the district should be prevented from further enjoying that service because of the construction of the rural electric lines. We look forward to the time when this serious problem of inductive interfer - ence, which is prevalent all over the state, may be remedied and both services function at their best. It is not up to this Commission to de - cide between those who prefer one service to the other. Its sole mission in such like cases is to enforce the provisions of the Nebraska Statutes and the rules and regulations of this Commission. The Commission's sole duty in the premises is to follow the plain provisions of the Con - stituticn of the State of Nebraska and the laws enacted thereunder, an:l to issue such orders, rules and regulations as will in its judgment, best carry out the provisions of the Constitution and Statutes granting it authority and prescribing its duties. We therefore aTe of the opinion and so find: 1. That the construction and energizing of respondent's transmis - sion lines have caused such inductive interference that the reasonable efficiency of the following of compla-nant's telephone lines have been </seg>

That respondent has constructed its transmission lines in viola - tion of Section 86-313 of 1929 Compiled Statutes and in violation of the condition of our order entered on August 6, 1937. 3. That a grounded telephone line is a properly constructed tele - phone line within the meaning of Section 86-313 of 1929 Compiled Stat - utes and is, not improperly constructed because it is not metallicized. 4.

         <seg id="p310">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER GOOD, DISSENTING: From evidence adduced at hearing it appears that in early develop - ment of R.E.A. lines that the incident authority, i.e. the R.E.A. did assume to pay a portion of the expense incurred by inductive interfer - ence due to the paralleling of grounded telephone lines, said interference being removed by installing an additional wire, thus transferring the return circuit, formerly the ground, to a circuit of metal, known then as a metallicized line. It is alleged, and not disputed, that a metallic circuit is better than a grounded one. Practically all large telephone operations aTe con - ducted on metallicized lines. The rates for service, allowed by this Com - mission, are usually 25 cents per month higher on metallic than on grounded circuits. The cost of putting an additional wire, bracket and insulator on posts already in position would not appear burdensome, appreciating that the service on the line would be improved. The $3.00 per year, (25 cents per month) allowed would amortize the average in - creased investment in from 3 to 6 years. It would appear that in event that a small private or mutual company were financially unable to finance the incident expense that the necessary expense funds would be borrowed through arrangement to impound the extra service charge of 25 cents per month. The R.E.A. authority in the discontinuance of furnishing funds, al - leges that the metallicizing of a grounded line is a distinct betterment increasing the tangible value thereof, and should be borne by the enter - prise bettered. Further, they held that with their limited cash reserves, that if they metallicize all parallel grounded telephone lines that it would place serious limitations upon the number of farmers possible to serve. The present announced policy of the R.E.A. authority is that no further extension of their lines will be applied for unless waivers are filed with the Commission for any line paralleled. Recognizing that Section 86-313 reads in part: "shall provide sufficient clearance between such lines and ex - isting properly constructed telephone and telegraph lines so that the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing' lines shall not be interfered with." We may now examine the statute with intent as to its application. First, as to the meaning of the words, "properly constructed". Second, as to the implication attached to the phrase: "so that the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines shall not be interfered with". Thirdly, has rural electrification on a large scale produced a situation necessitating that a rule of reason should be assumed in statu - tory interpretation? </seg>
         <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION A home may be properly constructed in the spring or summer of a year, and if winter never came would continue to comply with a "proper - ly constructed" definition. However, when winter comes its habitation would be fraught with serious consequences and the owner would apply himself to insulate the home from the weather . A telephone line con - structed with a grounded circuit gives tolerable service until a season of rural electrification produces a less tolerable situation and means for relief or endurance becomes a new problem. The word "reasonable" is a generous term; hence there may at times be a grounded telephone line where inductive interference might render communication almost impassable. At other times, or on other lines, paralleled inductive interference might be of petty but not unreasonable annoyance. ,'.'. . : . NOISE INTERFERENCE An instrument has been designed for use in measuring noise and reg - istering noise in terms of units. It is alleged that 400 of said noise units does not create objectionable interference.

Mr. Cargo, being duly sworn, testifies as follows- BY COMMISSIONER GOOD: Q. Let me indicate, from the exhibit, say, on this line 33 which has a parallel of 7% miles and there were 4,678 noise units, did you talk over those that had 5 or 8 or 10 or 12 times as many noise units as is established as reasonable, were you able to carry on any conversa - tion when the line had 4 to 5,000 or 6,000 noise units? A. Yes, sir, I talked over line 33 which you just mentioned and did carry on a conversation over that line. Q. That has more than 10 times the noise units that are considered as reasonable noise units, yet you could carry on a conversation over that line? A. I think I mentioned before that it seemed to me/ this is my opinion, that the party at the other end was talking- in a very loud voice, much louder than is ordinarily necessary to carry on a conversa - tion over a good telephone line. Q. However, you were communicating with him and he could understand you while.you were speaking in a normal voice? A. Yes, I asked in each case if the party could hear me all right and in each case on these lines which Mr. Van Pelt mentioned, namely, line 33, 43, and 67, in each case the party said they could hear me all right. However, I was at the central office. If I had been on another farm line and had the interference of 2 of these lines added together, I could not say what the result would have been. Q. However, as far as this exhibit goes, you were able to be under - stood at each and all of those points and yon were speaking' in the natural tones? A. On those 3 lines, yes, sir. From this testimony it is reasonable to assume that when ordinary conversation may be conducted over a parallel line where registered noise units were thirteen times the allowable tolerance, that the com- </seg>
         <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION plaint of excessive inductive interference is not well buttressed by prac - tical, not machine, experience. As relates to further practical experience, there is here presented testimony of re Application No. 13496, Harold Martindale, under oath: BY COMMISSIONER GOOD: ¦i ¦ ¦•..;, ' •': ¦'; ¦¦¦;¦¦. ¦..¦.-. ¦ .¦ .- Q. You have indicated that you have built lines that parallel grounded telephone lines? A. Yes, sir. Q. Can you indicate for the record the length of those parallels? A. Well, most of them are rather long. The Ames Creek Telephone Company filed an objection and I took the manager over the Wausa lines. He climbed several poles and tapped the lines, and on our lines where it parallels there is only about a mile and a half. We will cut the rest out. After cutting in several places he was convinced that there would «ot be enough trouble on that length of parallel to monkey with. I offered to take these gentlemen over from the Menominee Tele - phone Company. I would like to have them check those parallels. Most of those are rather long parallels and the farmers over there have tnd no objection. They will continue to use them and the directors of the telephone companies are satisfied. Q. You speak of there being long parallels, will you indicate about how long they are? A. Most of them are 4 or 5 miles or longer. There happens to be one in the Bloomfield exchange around three-quarters of a mile. Mr. Cooper climbed the poles along that and he said there was not enough interference to kick about. I got the waiver after he inspected that. He had his own telephone along and used that and he stated it was the same kind that they used at the exchange and that would be no more interference than the average farmer would hear. '¦'.'¦ Q. You indicated that all of the telephone lines are grounded lines in that territory? A. That is correct. Q. Has there been any effort to metallicize those grounded lines, or have any of them been metallicized since the district was built? A. I think there was only one in that district, at Laurel, I think. At Wausa we have around 60 miles of parallel, and they don't complain any. We have around 100 R.E.A. users.; Q. How much did you indicate was .the parallel? </seg>
         <seg id="p314">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT A. We have around 60 miles that parallel around Wausa. They are all grounded except one and that is paralleling the Interstate Power on a 33,000 volt line. Q. Are the Wausa people objecting here at this hearing? A. No, they are not. We are not building any more lines in their territory. That was in our first allotment. SUMMARY OF DISSENT Admitted that paralleled telephone lines are apt to be affected by induction of electrical currents. Held that the expense incident to making the telephone lines metal - lic may be amortized in a few years by raising subscribers' rate 25 cents per month. Recognizes that a change to a metallic circuit is a betterment of the line and service and such betterment redounds to the subscriber's convenience. That the statutory words "properly constructed" are of elastic in - terpretation, as is also the word "reasonable". A Commission or court may interpret them to apply with judicial liberality. It is held by dissenting Commissioner that serious inductive inter - ference, in the instant case, is not wholly proven by testimony of the Commission's own engineer. It has appeared from evidence adduced at sundry and all hearings involving indu.tive interference, that many interested rural parties want both telephone and electric service, but in event that one must be sacri - ficed they prefer to secure electricity. However, public welfare would indicate that such adjustment should be effected to the end that rural residents might expect and receive both services. As evidence of cooperation and appreciation of the efforts of the federal government to bring electricity to the rural homes of America, I cite that afe relates to Application No. 13447, Wayne County Rural Power District whera 53 points of possible interference with grounded lines were encountered, that waivers were obtained from 48 of the companies affected, and as to the 5 other companies likewise affected, but one protest wes filed, said protest being afterwards withdrawn. They ware "good na'ghbors". The Federal Gcvernment has afforded opportunity to millions in Iheir effort to biing electricity to the farm homes of Nebraska. Co - operation of rural telerhcne companies with grounded lines as instanced in the cited Wayne County Rural Public Power District, would naturally be a token of appreciation of the Governments now matured effort. </seg>
         <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Doubtless the de-energizing of 10 of the 17 rural electric lines, as instanced in the majority order, would also necessitate the cutting out of the remaining 7 lines also. The allegation the "subscribers have great difficulty in carrying on conversations" appears to be disproven by the evidence of the Commission's Chief Engineer's testimony as herein depicted. • Recognizing that the Commission has in its earlier experience is - sued sundry rules or orders relating to inductive interference, yet a later experience might indicate that they, the said orders, be allowed to fall into innocuous desuetude as have the "Blue Laws" of the New England States, ot the tax law of Nebraska requiring that all property be assessed at actual value. For reasons herein set forth I hereby dissent from the majority opinion of my colleagues. ; COMMISSIONER DISSENTING: (Signed) F. A.

APPEARANCES For the Complainant: Clifford H. Phillips, Attorney, Blue Hill, Nebraska. Far the Defendant: C. A. Sorensen, Attorney, Lincoln, Nebraska. For the Commission: Edwin Vail, H. Emerson Kokjer, Assistant Attorneys General. OPINION, FINDINGS AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: Complainant herein filed a formal complaint with this Commission against defendant alleging excessive inductive interference caused by defendant's rural electric transmission lines paralleling' complainant's grounded telephone lines. An investigation was made by the Com - mission's engineer and after due notice the matter was set for hearing in the Commission's hearing room at Lincoln on the 10th day of April, 1939, at which time the parties appeared and the case was submitted to the Commission for consideration. The complainant, Glenwood Telephone Company, is a corporation hav - ing its principal office at Blue Springs, and consists of 10 districts: Ayr, Bladen, Blue Hill, Cowles, Guide Rock, Holstein, Lawrence, Reeves, Roseland, and Rosemont. Each district constitutes an individual unit in the system and is separately managed as to revenues and expenses, the central officers maintain.ng a supervisory control over the different dis - tricts. The system covers practically all of Webster County and part of Adams County, serving approximately 1500 subscribers. Most of the system is grounded circuit and has been in existence for 40 years or more. Section 86-315, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, provides in part as follows: </seg>
         <seg id="p319">: NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION : "The State Railway Commission shall make such orders and prescribe such terms and conditions for the location and con - struction and operation of the proposed lines as to it may seem just and reasonable and make such order in the premises as in its judgment may best protect the lights of all the parties interested and those of the general public." Section 86-313, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, provides in part as follows: , . "All lines hereafter constructed for the transmission of f electric current including telephone and telegraph lines on the ' public highways or in other places in this state except as here - inafter provided, shall provide sufficient clearance between such lines and existing properly constructed telephone and.telegraph lines, so that reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of exist - ing lines shallnot be interfered with." It therefore is apparent that it is the duty of this Commission to protect the rights of a senior occupant whose service is rendered un - workable or unreasonably difficult by. reason of the construction of a parallel electric transmission line. Defendant Southern Nebraska Rural Public Power District is a public corporation, duly created, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Nebraska for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining an electric light and power. distribution system in Adams, Kearney and Phelps Counties. On July 7th, 1937, the defendant herein filed Application No. 12517 with, this Commission requesting authorization to construct some 430 miles of electric transmission lines in its district. Consents, waivers or agreements were not .received from all interested parties owning existing transmission lines and under the law and the Commission's General Order No. 72 the matter was submitted to the Commission and hearing was concluded on August 9, 1937. On August 10th, 1937, the Commission granted said application and among other things in its order said: - ' '. /V ¦ ' :'-'" "¦ '. '¦''-'¦ . /". \.' "It is therefore ordered by the Nebraska State Railway Comimssion that Application No. 12517 be, and the same is here - by granted, and that the Southern Nebraska Rural Public Power District be, and the same is hereby authorized to con - struct the proposed transmission lines in accordance with its maps, drawings and specifications: hereto attached and made a part ux this order, in accordance with the written agreements now on file with the Commission, and in accordance with the laws of .Nebraska and the rules and regulations of this Com - mission, subject to the condition that the applicant, being the </seg>
         <seg id="p320">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT junior occupant, shall, during the time of construction, bear all reasonable expense that may be necessary on its own lines or existing lines to insure the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines, and, if after applicant's lines have been constructed and energized the reasonable safety, operation and efficiency of existing lines are interfered with, the applicant shall bear any reasonable expense that may be necessary on its own lines or existing lines to remove such interference. It is further ordered that, if the parties at interest are unable to agree on the amount of such reasonable expense, either party may make application to the Commission for a determination of the controversy. "It is further ordered that the jurisdiction of the Commis - sion be, and it is hereby retained for the purpose of receiving any complaints and entering any order that may be necessary during the time of construction and after the proposed lines are energized.' Thereafter construction was commenced by the district in pursuance of said oTder. However, actual construction did not follow the applica - tion or order of the Commission. Mr. H. H. Henningson, Engineer for the district at the hearing in this matter, testified concerning the change in construction plans as follows: "Q. There were a number of changes in the routings? A. Yes, sir. Q. What was the Teason for those changes ? A. There were many reasons, and let me again repeat, it was one of the projects of the Midwestern which we took over to finish up as the project was. We had nothing to do with the original application. The only thing we did was take over the Midwestern work and carry it through to completion. Some of the changes for the Te-routing, I think, were largely due to the farmers agreeing to take service orig - inally and later finding they could not take it on account of drouth conditions and there is the difficulty some times of getting right-of-way necessitating re-routing and, then, too, it is always the desire to co - opeTate with communicating companies and re-route wherever it can be done without too much expense." Under the original application the complainant herein was not in - volved in any parallel conflicts with defendant's proposed construction. Construction continued on said project and included numerous re-rout - ings and other changes of lines without application and without author - ization from this Commission. </seg>
         <seg id="p321">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION . On February 10th, 1939, the defendant herein filed a supplemental application known as No. 12517, Supplement 1, asking authorization for construction of the lines already completed and in operation. In said supplementary application 89 persons, firms or corporations were named as being affected by crossings, parallels, etc., in the construction of the power district's lines and included the Glenwood Telephone Company, complainant herein. Hearing on the supplemental application was held on the same day and followed the hearing on this formal complaint and no order has thus far been entered covering the so-called "minor changes" not covered by the original application. The Tecord in the instant case relates only to the Roseland and Holstein exchanges of the Glenwood Telephone Company and as it ap - pears that from the disposition hereafter made the Roseland disturbances will be eliminated, we will consider only the Holstein exchange. This does not, however, preclude complainant from submitting at a. later date further proof of interference, if any, at its other exchanges. There were also objections filed by other telephone companies to the granting of the supplemental application hereinabove referred to but we are of the opinion that any telephone companies suffering undue inductive inter - ference as a result of the defendant's rural electric transmission line should file formal complaints as did the Glenwood Telephone Company in this case. ¦ - : . . ¦ . Mr. Hugh W. Cargo, Engineer for the Commission, appeared and testified as a witness. Prior to the hearing and after complaint was filed, Mr. Cargo tested the different lines running out of the Roseland and Holstein exchanges using for that purpose a Western Electric in - strument known as a No. 2-A Noise Measuring set. His tests were made by connecting the set direct to the switch board in the two ex - changes, taking the readings in decibels and later converting them into noise units under a recognized formula. The different lines were thus tested while the power lines were energized and also after the power had been cut off and from the results obtained the witness prepared and offered the following exhibit in evidence: </seg>

         <seg id="p324">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Mr. Cargo testified that 400 noise units are generally accepted by telephone companies as not unreasonably affecting telephone conversa - tions. In using 400 noise units as a tolerable limit it will therefore be noted from the exhibit that lines 2, 5, 6, 10, 12, 19 and 26 are far in excess of such figure. Inasmuch as line No. 26 is not in conflict with defendant's lines it need not be further considered at this time. In addition to Mr. Cargo's testimony several witnesses testified to their experiences in talking oveT the several lines involved herein. Mr. Lukow testified that the noise was "pretty bad"; thai, it "was fre - quently necessary for the operator to relay the message or to repeat what one patron said to the other. Mr. Hohlfeld testified that he lives on line No. 10 and "couldn't hear nothing; just a hum." MT.'Huckfeldt, who lives one mile north of Holstein testified that he could not carry on a conversation with his sister who lives about 6 miles from him on Line No. 6 and it was necessary for him to drive over to her farm when he wished to talk to her. They all testified that service was good on the lines before the power lines were energized and had no com - plaints at that time to make. Mr. Lukow, lineman and operator for the Holstein exchange, testi - fied that there were 140 subscribers reeciving service from that ex - change and 17 of them were receiving electric power from the defend - ant. He stated that there were 17% miles of parallel grounded telephone lines with defendant's electric transmission lines; that it would take approximately 31 miles of wire and together with all other items neces - sary would cost approximately $841.45 to metallicize the parallel tele - phone lines. The problem under consideration is not new with the Commission. In the application of the Loup River Public Power District, Application No. 12623 decided by a unanimous opinion of this Commission on August sth, 1937, it was held that a grounded telephone line was a properly con - structed telephone line under the statutes above referred to and that portion of the applicati :n paralleling grounded telephone lines was denied. A case similar to the one in the instant case was presented to the Commission in Forma] Complaint No. 817, Unadilla Union Telephone Company vs. the Eastern Nebraska Public Power District, and in a unanimous opinion under date of August 27th, 1938, it was stated in part as follows: "Respondent has not constructed its transmission lines in accordance with Section 86-313 of the 1929 Compiled Statutes. It has not constructed its transmission lines to provide suf - ficient cleat ance between its lines and existing pToperly con - stiucted telephone lines so that the reasonable efficiency of existing lines were not interfered with. Respondent did not construct its transmission lines in accordance with the condition </seg>
         <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION of said order. It did not, during construction, bear or ;offer to bear all reasonable expense on existing lines to insure the rea - sonable efficiency of existing telephone lines. After its trans - mission lines were constructed and energized it did not bear or offer to bear any reasonable expense on existing telephone lines to remove such interference. Respondent now says it 'will not bear the expense, or any part thereof, of metallicizing com - plainant's telephone lines. \ ¦:..' "At the time the original order was entered granting the j application, wff knew, and respondent knew, that the construe- 1 tion of its proposed transmission lines would interfere with the reasonable efficiency of complainant's grounded telephone lines. We could have denied the application and would have denied it ¦ to ithe extent that the proposed transmission lines paralleled the grounded lines of complainants had we then been told that re - , spondent would not bear any reasonable expense of metallicizing ! complainant's telephone lines. The complainant interposed time - ly objections at tneoriginal hearing and was assured by the presiding 1 Commissioner that the objections would be taken care of in the order. The respondent, having constructed and ener - gized its lines under an order with express conditions therein contained, should be bound by those conditions and should now be willing to place the complainant in status quo by de-energiz - ing such of its transmission lines as interfere with the reason - ; able efficiency of complainant's grounded telephone lines." Again, in Formal Complaint No. 819, Eagle Independent Telephone Company vs. Eastern Nebraska Public Power District, Project No. 2, the identical question was presented for consideration.. After reviewing the cases herein referred to the Commission entered its order dated August 5 th, 1939, ordering the power district tq_de-energize its lines which paralleled complainant's telephone lines, and, antong other things, said: "The remsdy in this case is unfortunate for the users of both services. It would meet with our unanimous satisfaction if the rural residents in the district could have electricity and also telephones. We do not believe, however, that the long es - tablished subscribers of telephone service in the district should be prevented from further enjoying that service because of the construction of the rural electric lines.j We look forward to the time when this serious problem of inductive interference, which ,is prevalent all over the state, may be remedied and both serv - ices function at thsir best. It is not up to this Commission to decide between those who prefer one service to the other. Its sole mission in such like cases is to enforce the provisions of </seg>
         <seg id="p326">THIRTY^SECOND ANNUAL REPORT the Nebraska Statutes and the rules and regulations of this Commission. The Commission's sole duty in the premises is to follow the plain provisions of the Constitution of the State of Nebraska and the laws enacted thereunder, and to issue such orders, rules and regulations as will in its judgment, best carry out the provisions of the Constitution and Statutes granting it authority and prescribing its duties." We therefore find: 1. That the construction and energizing of the defendant's electric transmission lines have caused such inductive interference that the rea - sonable efficiency of the following of complainant's telephone lines has been unreasonably interfered with, to-wit: Nos. 2, 6, 6, 10, 12 and 19. 2. That defendant has constructed its transmission lines parallel - ing the above numbered telephone lines in violation of Section 86-313, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929; Commission's General Order 72 and our order of August 10th, 1937, in Application No. 12517. 3. That said electric transmission lines as affect the telephone lines herein mentioned were constructed without application to this Commis - sion and without authority, therefor. 4. That a grounded telephone line is a properly constructed tele - phone line within the meaning of Section 86-313, Compiled Statutes of NebTaska, 1929, and is not improperly constructed because it is not metallicized. 5. That the fair and reasonable cost of metallicizing the affected telephone lines is $841.45. That defendant having failed and refused to in any manner remove said inductive interference, even after a continuance was granted for that purpose upon conclusion of the hearing, an order should be en - tered herein directing defendant to de-energize its electric transmission lines which parallel the following telephone lines of complainant, to-wit: Nos. 2, 5, 6, 10, 12 and 19, all on the Holstein exchange. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the defendant, Southern Nebraska Rural Public Power District be, and it is hereby ordered to de-energize its electric trans - mission lines which parallel the following telephone lines of the com - plainant at its Holstein exchange, to-wit: Nos. 2, 5, 6, 10, 12 and 19, within 30 days from the date of this order and to keep the same de - energized until the further order of the Commission. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION (SEAL) (Signed) WILL M. MAUPIN ; ¦ ¦¦•'.'¦! . Chairman , '.": ATTEST: j : (Signed) George E. Truman ~^S...- ' i Secretary COMMISSIONERS CONCURRING: ¦;!. (Signed) Will M. Maupin | (Signed) Duane T. Swanson COMMISSIONER GOOD, DISSENTING: It is alleged and undisputed that a metallic telephone line gives better service than does a grounded line. This being an admitted fact, the making of a line metallic is a distinct betterment and increases the company's asests by an amount equal to the cost of the said betterment If the lines involved are made metallic without expense to the owners they, the owners, get something for nothing. The highways are public property. No telephone or electric line should be allowed to monopolize their use for their particular service. • The statutes quoted by my colleagues, were enacted before the ad - vent of cheap electricity for farms, and now with the advent also of governmental assistance, to the end that farmers and.their families may use and enjoy electricity, it would appear that such an enactment, if it is interpreted by the Commission as prohibiting its use, should be rele - gated to the same oblivion as has happened to the "Blue Laws" of the New England States, v, .•¦•¦' : It is held by my colleagues that inasmuch as the statutes specifies "properly constructed lines" that we, ttie Commission, must construe the words to.plainly imply that if a line is builded grounded, and ac - cepted as properly constructed 10 to 40 years ago, that per se it is always to be affiirmed; by courts and commissioners as "properly con - structed". A home may be properly constructed in spring or summer and if winter never came it would continue to comply with a "properly constructed". definition. A grounded line may give tolerable service, but-if a season of rural electrification comes the builders should insu - late it from interference the same as a summer home must be insulated from interference when winter comes. . It does not appear in the record that the Commissions engineer talked over the involved lines, but took cognizance of recorded noise units only. Attention is called to the Eagle situation (which is now </seg>
         <seg id="p328">THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT happily settled by the company asking that their complaint be dis - missed). At the hearing- incident to the Eagle complaint, Mr. Cargo, the Commission's Chief Engineer, was questioned and replied in part as follows: (taken from the record). "Q. Let me indicate, from the exhibit, on this line 33 which has a parallel of 1% miles and there were 4,678 noise units, did you talk over those that had 5, 8, 10 or 12 times as many noise units as established as reasonable. Were you able to carry on a conversation when the line had 4, 5, or 6,000 noise units?" "A. Yes, sir, I talked over line 33 (4,768 noise units) which you just mentioned and did carry on a conversation over that line." "Q. That was over 10 times the noise units that has been men - tioned as a tolerated allowance, yet you could carry on a conversation over that line?" "A. Yes, I asked in each case if the party could hear me all right and in each case on these lines 33, 43 and 67 the party said they could hear me all right." "Q. As far as this exhibit goes, you were able to be understood at each and all these points and you were speaking in a natural tone of voice?" "A. On these lines, yes, sir." From this testimony it is reasonable to assume that when ordinary conversation may be carried on over a paralleled line of 7%, 3 and 4% miles as indicated in the record and with recorded noise units of 4,678, 1,245 and 1,660, that actual operating experience is more to be relied upon than aTe machine indexes. In a very recent decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, having the same controversy before them, the court held against complainants, declaring that where rural electric progress was under consideration that a grounded system was out-moded and that in such an event it was not properly constructed. It is beyond the power of this Commission to compel the Federal government to provide funds to mak« metallic grounded telephone lines. The Commission has no constitutional ot statutory power to award dam - ages. However, the said government has afforded opportunity for the bringing of electricity to millions of farm homes and neighborly co - operation by all parties at interest should be reciprocated in kind. Of the several cases brought befoTe this Commission of an identical nature, all have been settled amiably and the petitions withdrawn, save only the instant case. In no case has the Rural Electrification Adminis - tration provided funds for metallicizing any lines, since the ruling is- </seg>
