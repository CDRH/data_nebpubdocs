CLARENCE E. HARMAN, Deputy Commissioner. Dated at Lincoln, Nebraska, December 1st, 1916. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">FOOD, DRUG, DAIRY AND OIL COMMISSION 7 REPORT To cover all matters pertaining to the operation of the Pood, Drug, Dairy and Oil Commission for the past biennium and the laws this Department has for enforcement, would serve no good purpose, therefore, this report will treat with the most important matters only and in a general way. The past two years have been very productive of results in every direction. The results obtained are not all the result of prosecutions, but are the result of constant, individual and col - lective efforts on the part of those connected with the Depart - ment and the co-operation of those engaged in business in every section of the state. New Legislation During the last session of the Legislature, several sugges - tions were made by this Department recommending changes in some of the laws then in force and in every instance these sug - gestions were incorporated into law. Changes were made in the Dairy Laws whereby this Department can make rules and regu - lations for the purchase of cream on a quality basis, but condi - tions up to this time have not seemed to warrant that such a step be taken, yet it is an assured fact that this is the proper plan to pursue in the very near future. A standard type of cream scale was fixed in the law, also the sensitiveness of the scale. This insures the accurate weighing of samples of the farmers' cream where heretofore the plan of operation was inaccurate and not on a proper basis. The Pure Seed Law was rewritten and made a separate law and now it is effectively enforced to the advantage of every farmer in the state. The Feeding Stuffs Law, which was formerly part of the Pure Seed Law, was rewritten and is known as the model Feed - ing Stuffs Law of the country. Heretofore, live stock remedies were touched on in the Feeding Stuffs Law, but a new law was passed, which requires the filing of the name of each live stock remedy and the in - gredients contained therein with this Department. A large number of concerns refused to make the filing and have with - drawn their products from this market. It is generally under - stood that these remedies that are not now on sale in Nebraska, are the ones which have brought nothing but discredit to live stock remedy manufacturers in the past. The law relating to the pay of inspectors for the Depart - ment was changed and placed on a semi-merit basis. The In- </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE speetors formerly received $4.00 per day, but under the new provision they receive $4.00 per day for the first two years and $4.50 per day thereafter. A new provision in the law was made requiring that the net weight, measure or numerical count be placed on the main label of all food in package form. Heretofore this requirement was made on but a few kinds of package food â€” now it covers all food in package form. A new provision was made covering the branding of drugs in relation to the curative and therapeutic effect. Under this provision no false claims can appear on the label of any patent or proprietary remedy of any nature. Nebraska is the first state in the union to take this long step in the interest of the purchasing public. A few changes were made in the standards of the weights and measures law, which cover the matter of Departmental jurisdiction under the law. This was occasioned by the failure of a law enforcing officer to file a complaint against a dealer, and this Department, under the then existing statute, was powerless to proceed. Now this obstacle is entirely removed. Several other changes were made of minor importance which are not necessary to enumerate here, but the net result of the new lgislation passed by the last legislature is more than gratifying as the public in general has been benefited con - siderably thereby and the laws we have for enforcement have been placed on a plane second to no other state in the union. A law was passed making it a penitentiary offense to sell meat for food purposes from an animal that had died otherwise than by slaughter. The enforcement of this law was not placed under the jurisdiction of this Commission, but was made a part of the criminal code, but if it becomes necessary a prosecution could be filed just the same as if it were a part of the food laws. The reason that we suggested the passage of such a law was that the penalty under the food law for the sale of meat of animals that had died otherwise than by slaughter, was insuffi - cient. Pure Pood Week By proclamation of Governor Morehead under date of March 11, 1916, the week of April 3rd was designated as Pure Food Week. This is a new departure and one which has since been followed by several other states. It was very generally observed by food dealers in all sections of the state and should be carried forward in the interest of pure foods and Nebraska produced foods. A copy of the proclamation issued by Gov. John H. Morehead and a copy of the notice sent out by the Department, calling attention to Pure Food Week, is incorpo - rated in this report and will be found on another page. </seg>

            <seg id="p010">10 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE Departmental Needs Not many changes are necessary in the laws under the juris - diction of the Department for the protection of the public, but it might be well to mention several changes that should be made. The constitutionality of the inspection fees for inspecting coal oil and gasoline is now in question in the Supreme Court. It is not known what the result of this litigation will be, but the fact that the Department is collecting a large sum in excess of its cost of operation, should be taken into consideration. The Department should be enlarged to cover matters not now covered, to be of service to food manufacturers and producers through the use of our Laboratory and the establishment of civil service or merit system for the inspection force in the field. Inspectors should be paid according to their term of service and their ability to render service. Six dairy inspectors should be employed the year around in place of six for the summer period as now provided for in the law. An addition of three inspectors in the weights and measures field should be made, making the total number in this work six. As matters now stand, three men are in the field and are unable to cover the entire state oftener than once in three years. With the increasing amount of work coming to our Labora - tory, two additional Chemists should be employed. This will give an opportunity to do some research work, which has been very difficult in the past on account of such a large volume of business handled. A further suggestion might be that a new law be enacted covering the sale of patent medicine in Nebraska, which would require all concerns selling their products in this market to register the same with this Department before being offered for sale in this state. Some states have taken this step and it has proved to be of great advantage as well as a protection to the public. Department Bulletins Previous to this biennium, it has been customary for this Department to publish a pamphlet containing all the laws and the rules and regulations pertaining thereto, but this was found to be an expensive as well as a bad plan. Many people write the Department for a copy of the law pertaining to a certain subject and the rulings by the Department on this subject. Under the former plan it was necessary to send out all the laws where only one was asked for. Under the present plan a bulle - tin covering each law has been issued, also bulletins covering the rules and regulations under each law. In this way when a copy of the law is asked for, the person is given full information in </seg>

Patent Medicines With the incorporation of what is known as the Sherley Amendment into our Food and Drug Laws, at the last session of the legislature, this Department was placed in position to be of great service to the public in driving out of the State all the fake cure-alls and misbranded patent medicines being sold. Two courses were open to accomplish the desired result. One was to immediately inspect all the drug stores in the state and file complaints against all druggists who had on hand misbranded patent or proprietary medicines. The other course was to go slowly and to gradually eliminate these cure-alls by working in co-operatoin with the retail druggist. The latter plan was adopted and it can be said that while some were inclined to place obstacles in the way, the greater portion of the druggists </seg>
            <seg id="p013">FOOD, DRUG, DAIRY AND OIL COMMISSION 13 in the State have been active in support of the law and are giving their earnest effort to assist the Department in placing the patent medicine business on a legitimate basis. Several prosecutions have been filed and some of the largest manufacturers in the United States have been forced to change, not only the name of their Company, but the name of their medicine from a cure-all to a remedy. This is the first state in the union to make such a clean sweep in the matter and with the results that we have had, it is very gratifying. Prosecutions It has not been the policy of the present administration to file prosecutions promiscuously or for technical violations of the law, but a policy of co-operation has been pursued all along the line and, where it has been found necessary to file prosecutions, they were filed. The record for the biennium shows that 325 cases have been filed. In all but eleven cases, the defendants were found guilty by the Court, or pleas of guilty were entered by the defendants and the fines and costs paid. Three cases were dismissed on account of insufficient evidence and in two cases the Court officer was unable to locate the defendant*. In five cases the Court decided against the State and one case is still pending. This record of successful prosecutions is without question the best record ever made by any Department of like nature in the United States and the Department also holds a good record for the size of fines levied in the larger cases. In one instance at DeWitt, Nebraska, where the town had been voted dry, a man who had been engaged in the saloon busi - ness saw his way clear to go into business and sell a so-called temperance beverage of which he bought a car load. The Depart - ment received information in regard to the matter and an in - spector was immediately sent to DeWitt to secure lawful samples of the article being sold. The State Chemist made an analysis and found the beverage contained more than 4 per cent alcohol, which proved that the article being offered was not a temper - ance beverage, or a so-called near beer, but was in fact genuine beer and was misbranded to evade the law. On a complaint filed with the County Court, the entire shipment of the beverage was seized, the Defendant fined $200 and the beverage destroyed. Some 12,000 bottles were in the shipment. The brewery located at St. Paul, Minnesota, and which maintained an office in Om - aha, was also prosecuted and pleaded guilty, paying a fine of $200 and costs. A complaint was filed against a Cold Storage concern in Omaha for having in their possession in cold storage, foods unfit for food. The Company pleaded guilty, paid a fine of $250 and costs. . Â» . </seg>
            <seg id="p014">BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE 14 Several concerns engaged in the wholesale coal oil and gaso - line business in Nebraska, asked the District Court at Omaha for a restraining order covering the matter of the collection of in - spection fees fixed in the law for the inspection of coal oil and gasoline. The Attorney General, acting for this Department, then asked the Supreme Court for an injunction against every oil company doing business in the State enjoining them from interfering in any way with the operation of the law. The in - junction was granted and this Department directed to proceed under the law to pay all the expenses of operating. The Depart - ment was instructed to turn the balance of the oil inspection fees into the Court, which has been done, pending the final adjudication of the matter. The State Fair For several years past, this Department has had a force of inspectors on the State Pair Grounds during the Fair. These inspectors have had charge of the handling and sale of food and refreshments on the grounds. Each year the matter has been handled to good advantage, but during the present year the greatest good was accomplished. The State Fair Board acting in co-operation with this De - partment, condemned several buildings which had been used heretofore as restaurants and stands. These buildings were torn down and a large modern restaurant building was built. The building was divided into five compartments and equipped to carry on the business properly. As an endorsement of the action of the Board in building the building and a further endorse - ment of the proper handling of foods by those who secured the concessions in this building, the public patronized these places to the extent that more than 30,000 meals were served in the five restaurants during the Fair. Several new departures from former methods of handling foods at the Fair grounds were placed in the rules and regula - tions by this Department. One of these was the ruling made prohibiting the sale of hamburgers on the Fair grounds. This ruling was popular with the public in general and met with very little opposition on the part of the concessioners. Those in position to know were immediately convinced that this was a good procedure and one of protection to Fair visitors. Ham - burgers are made of meats which usually cannot be used for other purposes and must of necessity be properly kept to be fit for food. On account of business at the Fair Grounds being only of a temporary nature, it is almost impossible to serve hamburger properly, therefore, it was thought the wisest plaii would be to eliminate hamburger on the Fair Grounds, which was done and which has since been adopted by several other Food Departments. </seg>

            <seg id="p016">16 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE Another new plan placed in operation by this Department was the inspection of each food and refreshment establishment on the grounds twice daily and the placing of a large sign on each of these places, showing that the place had been inspected by the Pood Inspector on that date. On the first day's inspec - tion of the establishments, not many cards were tacked up, but as soon as those engaged in the business knew that the inspectors meant business, very few places were denied the cards as they all made a big effort to comply with the law. A bulletin was issued covering the requirements of the Department for temporary food and refreshment stands and very little trouble was experienced enforcing the law. Without question, Nebraska State Fair in 1916 ranks high - est of any State in the union for the cleanliness and purity of the foods and refreshments sold on the Fair Grounds. Department Exhibit at State Fair As has been the custom during the past four years this Department placed an exhibit on the Fair Grounds showing some of the most important matters handled in the enforcement of law and the distribution of bulletins relating to the provisions of the law and other information. A special effort was made this year and a larger exhibit than usual was installed. The exhibit attracted thousands of interested visitors and it is thought that the results accomplished were worth the effort put forth in gath - ering together and installing the exhibit each year. The inter - est in pure foods seems to grow and a larger number of people visit our exhibit each year. Pure Seed Exhibit A pure seed exhibit was installed in Agricultural Hall and was in charge of Miss Louise Allen, State seed analyst. While visitors are fewer in number at this kind of an exhibit it can not be said that the effort and expense put into the exhibit were not worth while. Hundreds of interested farmers visited the booth and were given detailed information in regard to the analysis of seeds as to purity and germination. They were also given information as to the identification of foreign weed seeds and the weeds themselves, as many kinds of different weeds had been grown from the seed by Miss Allen expressly for this exhibit. A cut showing the seed exhibit will be found elsewhere in this report, and also cuts showing the Pure Food, Drug, and Dairy exhibit.

            <seg id="p018">BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE 18 average for a biennial period and represents chemical analyses of every nature. It is a departmental rule that the Laboratory be thrown open to the public and every analysis made that can be made. The original intent of the law was that the State Chemist should make only such analyses as came to the Depart - ment through the regular order of business, but there must be some place where citizens of the state can get information with - out finding it necessary to send to some chemist in Kansas City or Chicago and at the same time be required to pay an un - reasonable fee to secure the information they want, when it can and should be given them at the hands of the State, free of charge. Complaints That Pure Food Law enforcement is popular goes without saying, but the best evidence that the public believes that it should be protected under the Food Laws is th&lt;&gt; number of complaints that come to the office from every section of the State, notifying the Department of minor offenses and asking assistance or information. Quite a number of prosecutions have been the result of complaints. Just recently a housewife called the writer to the phone at his residence, and stated that she had purchased two kinds of meat at a local meat market, both of which were unfit for food. She asked what could be done to protect her in the matter. She was told that her complaint would be given immediate attention, and a visit was made to her residence at once, the meat examined, and found to be in bad condition. Complaint was filed the next morning against the meat market, the dealer entered a plea of guilty and paid a fine and costs. In another recent instance the writer was called to the phone on Sunday morning and told by a housewife that meat had been purchased the previous evening for Sunday dinner and when it arrived at the house on Saturday night, was spoiled. The dealer had been notified, but had failed to give the matter his attention. An inspector was sent to the residence, made an examination of the meat, and Monday morning a complaint was filed against the dealer, to which he entered a plea of guilty and paid a fine and costs. These are only two instances wherein the Department has been of service in small matters to housewives out of a large number of just such complaints. While all complaints do not result in prosecutions, the general effect is that the public know that this Department is here for their protection and feel that their complaints will receive immediate attention.

All permits issued under the law are issued in duplicate and in numerical order. For fees received for all items covering inspections and matters other than permits, re - ceipts are issued in duplicate and numerically. The records con - taining all permits and receipts for fees are complete in every detail. A record is also kept of the daily cash receipts and another reeord contains all the expenditures in detail. Another record shows the receipts and expenditures under the several subheads. The Department has been audited regularly during the past four years by the State Auditor's office as often as twice yearly and at each time the Auditor's report has shown the records of the office are complete and correct. Inspection Blanks and Inspections To make reports of business establishments effective, it is necessary that the matter be handled on a business basis and in a way that will attract the confidence of those engaged in bus - iness. One of the important features necessary to accomplish this, is to cover the matter of inspection intelligently and it has been found that the best plan to pursue is to have a well drawn inspection blank covering in detail all the items usually found in a place of business. From time to time changes have been made in the inspection blanks used by the Department and at this time a blank is being used which covers each estab - lishment fully. A copy of the inspection is left with the person in charge of the business, which is a new departure and one that is very productive of results. Heretofore the plan had been to make the inspection blank out in duplicate, sending one to the office and the inspector retaining one. Under this plan the business man was not given full information. Under the new plan he knows in regard to all items that meet with the approval of the Department and in what degree, and he also knows in regard to the items that meet with the disapproval of the Department. Each place of business stands for itself and it is the rule rather than the exception, that under our present plan of in - spection it is much easier to secure the co-operation of the dealers than under the old plan. For the year from December 1, 1914, to November 30, 1915. the total number of inspections made by the Department was 23,707 and for the year beginning December 1, 1915 and ending November 30, 1916, the total number of inspections of all kinds made was 28.743. making a grand total for the biennium of 52,450 inspections. This is the largest number ever made dur - ing any biennium by the Department. A table showing the </seg>

            <seg id="p022">22 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE number of inspections of each kind for each year is published elsewhere in this report. Sanitary Orders When unsanitary conditions are found to exist in places of business where foods are produced, manufactured, distributed or sold, two courses are always open to the Department. One is to file a prosecution covering such conditions as found, the other course is to furnish what is known as a Sanitary Order and which is provided for in the law. Changes have been made from time to time in regard to the form of the sanitary order and within the last year a new blank form has been adopted. In the years gone by some trouble has been experienced in securing the compliance with sanitary orders after being issued. Many reasons might be assigned as the cause of this trouble, but the main reason was that, it seemed to be impossible to impress those on whom the order was written, that the order must be complied with in accordance with the law and within the time fixed in the order. Heretofore, the order was made out, a copy left with the dealer and a copy sent to the office. Under the new plan a sanitary order is served on the dealer, his signature required in receipt of the order and a copy sent to the office. Now it is the rule rather than the exception that these orders are being complied with promptly. During the past two years this Department has issued 2,555 sanitary orders and practically everyone of them is complied with at this time. Inspectors The law provides for sixteen regular inspectors to enforce the Food, Drug, Dairy and Oil Laws. Provision is also made for three inspectors to inspect scales, weights and measures. A further provision is made for six Dairy Inspectors for five months of each year, beginning May 1. The present force in the field is well organized and well equipped to handle the duties devolving upon them. The greater portion of the inspectors now in the field have been with the Department some time and thoroughly understand their duties. As suggested in another part of this report, greater results could be accomplished if the dairy inspectors were kept the entire year and the number not decreased. In this way the regular inspectors could give all their attention to food, oil and other matters and the dairy industry would be given all possible assistance as it is one of the largest industries in Nebraska and entitled to every consideration. Under the present plan, we have an insufficient number of weights and measures inspectors and the number should be increased to at least six to give the public all the protection they are entitled to have. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">FOOD, DRUG, DAIRY AND OIL COMMISSION 23 It is a well known fact that good inspectors, who handle their work properly, cannot be hired today and discharged to - morrow, for the reason that there is no line of business that educates ?&gt;n inspector to take up this work, as inspection under our laws is peculiar in itself, and the only training that can be secured for this work is in the work itself under proper guidance. Frequently inspectors of this Department, after be - coming well acquainted with their duties, have attractive offers from business concerns at an increased compensation and it is not infrequent that these offers are accepted. The work of an inspector is attractive and interesting, not because of the compensation he receives, but because of the results he obtains. The compensation is on a per diem basis and is the only Department under state government operating under this plan. For a beginner, the pay an inspector receives is sufficient, but as the inspector becomes more proficient in his duties, he should be given additional compensation so that fre - quent changes would not be necessary and the inspector would have something to work for and look forward to. The field work of this Department is good training and it is very gratifying to the writer to be able to make the state - ment that many of those who have left the service, are now occuping positions of importance and responsibility. One former inspector is now Deputy State Auditor, another is State Insur - ance Examiner, another is manager of a large creamery; one is Deputy Internal Revenue Collector; one is field manager for a large insurance company and another is field man for a large creamery. One is now employed in the service of the railroad company, and one is operating an up-to-date retail food estab - lishment. Finance On another page of this report will be found tables showing receipts and expenditures for the past biennium for each month under the separate subheads and a recapitulation for the year. The tables will show a large increase in the receipts of the office which is the result of constant effort in every dierction to enforce the provisions of the law for the collection of fees. Up to and including August 31, 1915, the expenses of the Department were paid by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the State Auditor. On account of the ruling of the State Treasurer that the last legislature had not appropriated the fees of this office for the expenses incurred in enforcing the law, the Department was confronted with a serious condition of affairs. Two courses were open. One was to discontinue the work in the field and in the office, or to assume unprecedented responsibilities in the interset of the whole state and carry the work forward as heretofore. Governor Morehead directed the </seg>

This was done until an effort was made to restrain the Department from collecting fees for oil inspections. The matter was carried to the Supreme Court who ordered this Department to go ahead, pay all expenses and turn the balance of the oil fees into the Court, which has been done and in the neighborhood of $80,000 has been deposited with the Clerk of the Court from January, 1916, to date. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">FOOD, DRUG, DAIRY AND OIL COMMISSION 25 LAWS FOR ENFORCEMENT It is not generally understood that the laws we have for enforcement are separate and distinct in themselves, but placed under the jurisdiction of this Department and, while all the laws relate to each other in some respect, they do not cover the same subject matter. The laws that require the greatest amount of attention and effort are the ones that pertain to Food. Drug, Dairy and Oil products. Hundreds of matters might be touched on in this report that pertain to each of these laws, but space forbids going into these matters in detail. It is thought best to touch on matters in general pertaining to each law separately. The Food Law Nebraska was one of the pioneer pure food states and as the years have gone by, our Pure Food Department has gradual - ly grown in importance and the laws have been gradually brought to a higher plane at each session of the legislature until now no state in the union has a more complete and compre - hensive Pure Food Law than has Nebraska and at the same time must be noted that these laws are popular with the general public. Wholesale and retail food dealers as well as those engaged in other branches of the food business, are all found to be in favor of pure food laws and their enforcement and it would be an injustice to our food people in Nebraska if they were not given this recognition and endorsement in this report. There was a time when people engaged in the food business failed to recognize that food laws were as much to their ad - vantage as to the advantage of the consumer. As the matter stands now, all food establishments are on the same basis under the law and none have an advantage over another. Standards are fixed for cleanliness, purity and branding, so that it is up to each individual to comply with the law thereby receiving the approval of the public with their patronage. Drags There is no line of business coming under the jurisdiction of this Commission which is being handled to better advantage in the state than is the drug business. There is a reason for this. Every druggist is fully equipped to handle his business intelligently for the reason that he has educated himself to do so and we feel that he is entitled to every consideration and assistance that the Department can give him, because he is usually found to be active in the support of the laws requiring the sale of drugs in compliance with the law. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but they are very few. Due acknowl- </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE edgment must be made to those engaged in the drug business in Nebraska for their assistance, advice and co-operation during the present administration. In the enforcement of that part of the drug law relating to the proper branding of drugs and proprietary medicines, we have been active to the extent, that during the past two years we have removed from sale in the state more than 50,000 pack - ages of misbranded patent fake and cure-all medicines. We have had the hearty support of practically every druggist we have come in contact with in this successful effort, as was also the case in our campaign to eliminate the sale of fake aspirin tablets. More than 250,000 of these tablets were seized and several prosecutions were filed against wholesale concerns who had "bilked" half the druggists of the state by false represen - tation. These tablets were found to be an entirely different product from what they were branded and sold for and con - tained ingredients of a harmful nature. The Dairy Industry This state is one of the few states in the union that has a large and growing dairy industry. In the neighborhood of 45,000,000 pounds of butter is manufactured by the Creameries each year of which the greater portion is shipped outside the state. No better creameries can be found anywhere and this state can be justly proud of the fact that we not only have the largest creamery in the world, but also the largest butter manufacturing center in the world. The latest and most up-to - date methods are employed in the manufacture of butter by every creamery in the business and no better butter can be found as our butter sells on every market. It is estimated that the dairy industry in all its branches in Nebraska produces more than $40,000,000 worth of products each year. All of this has come to pass through constant effort and energy on the part of those engaged in the business and also on the part of the state for the encouragement and protection found in our dairy laws and the assistance of the Dairy Depart - ment of the State Farm. Many years ago a state Dairymen's Association was organized, which has been a potent factor at all times in the encouragement of those engaged in the dairy business and for their co-operation with those engaged in the educational branch of the work as well as that of law en - forcement. All Nebraska citizens can feel justly proud of this big industry and those engaged in the business as there is no asset that we have that is more important to the growth of the state than this big industry. They deserve all consideration and every assistance at the hands of our people. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">DEPUTY FOOD COMMISSION 27 City Milk Supply During the past biennium several surveys have been made by inspectors of this Department and State Chemist of the milk supply of the cities and larger towns in the state. To make a complete report of all the surveys at the different times would be impossible in a report of this kind, but the public should have the information that it is our opinion that the milk supply in Omaha, Lincoln, Beatrice, Nebraska City, Fremont, Grand Island, Kearney, Hastings and Norfolk is above the average found in the country over. In Omaha the matter of city milk supply is in the hands of the Health Department, and it is giving its best effort to keep the milk sold to the people there up to a proper standard and quality. We have no criticism whatever to offer on the method employed in handling this important item of public consumption in Omaha, but on the other hand, we are frank to say that no city in the country of like size has a better milk supply than has Omaha. Credit is largely due to the City Milk Inspector, who gives all his time and attention to the duties of his office. Were this Department to offer a suggestion, it would be that he be given additional assistance, but under present conditions the best results are being obtained. In the city of Lincoln, the milk supply is under the City Health officer and the people of Lincoln are being protected fully. While the field that is covered is not as large in Lincoln as it is in Omaha, a milk Inspector is employed and his work has been of advantage to the people of the city of Lincoln and a credit to his Department. The milk supply in Lincoln is greatly improved over two years ago. It should be remembered that milk is a part of the daily consumption of every citizen of the state and, therefore, it is important that this product be given the strictest attention as to its cleanliness and purity. Our Department has supple - mented the work of the city officials to the extent of its ability and feels very much gratified over the results obtained. While numerous prosecutions have been filed from time to time to cor - rect conditions, the greater part of the work has been educa - tional and co-operative to the' end that all concerned can congratulate themselves on the conditions as they exist at this time. Petroleum Products The use of petroleum products is increasing each year to a greater extent than any other product sold in the state. This is easily shown by a comparison of the fees collected for in - spection. In 1911 and 1912 the total fees collected amounted to $113,000. For 1913 and 1914, $143,000, and for 1915 and 1916, $221,657. This shows an increase for the past two years of </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE $78,657 for fees collected over the previous two years. Fees for the year 1916 alone amount to $129,107, which is $53,000 more than were collected in 1914. Inspection of petroleum products is now well in hand and every barrel coming into the state is inspected according to law. While the quality of the gasoline will not compare favorably with the quality of four years ago, it is true that with a fixed standard requiring a certain gravity test, the users of gasoline would be compelled to pay a much higher price than now. With the change in the law made four years ago removing the fixed standard of 62 degrees gravity test and permitting the sale of gasoline with the requirement that the correct test be stated on the container, a large saving was made to even- user of this product in the state. The greater portion of gasoline being sold in Nebraska at this time shows a test of 58 degrees gravity, which is of sufficient quality for use for power purposes. As a better protection to purchasers of gasoline, this De - partment ruled that gasoline below 54 degrees could not be sold in the state of Nebraska for the reason that, if it was below 54, it would not be gasoline. This effectively stopped the shipping into the state of inferior gas distillates. Linseed Oil The campaign waged during the previous biennium against the sale of adulterated linseed oil has proved to be effective and Nebraska today is absolutely free from adulterated linseed oil. Not a single barrel has been found by any inspector during the past biennium where formerly the users of linseed oil were robbed of at least $100,000 a year through this agency. Now they are getting pure linseed oil and just what they pay for. Sanitary Law The state has on its statutes the best Sanitary Food Law in existence. Its operation is in the interest of the general pub - lic for pure and clean foods and the greatest effort put forth in any direction is in the enforcement of this law. It covers every matter completely and meets with popular approval by all who are conversant with its provisions and operation. The best pos - sible evidence exists in all places in Nebraska where foods are produced, manufactured and sold, when taken into comparison with conditions that existed in the state not many years since. You will now find confectionery displayed in glass cases, meats fully protected, wrapped bread, and in fact, every article of food, no matter whether being transported or displayed for sale, to be absolutely protected from flies, dust, and dirt at all times. This is in full compliance of the law and observing persons will quickly note the difference in conditions as they exist in Ne - braska and in other states they visit. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">FOOD, DRUG, DAIRY AND OIL COMMISSION 29 Weights and Measures The legislature of 1913 passed a law known as the Stand- ards of Weights and Measures and gave its enforcement to this Commission. An effort was made to secure a sufficient number of inspectors to properly enforce this law at the last session of the legislature, but provision was only made for three inspectors, who find it impossible to cover the entire state as often as neces- sary. After working for three years with three inspectors, it has been impossible to cover the whole state more than once, so it can be readily seen that additional inspectors are absolutely necessary. The law is effective and covers all matters necessary with the exception of inspection. At first the law was unpopular, but after being in operation some time, it has become very popular among those who buy and sell commodities in trade. A summary of the inspections made and fees collected during the biennium is as follows: Summary of inspections made by the Weights and Measure Department from December 1, 1914, to November 30th, 1915: Sealed Condemned Adjusted Hopper scales 190 4 1 Weights 2,867 50 161 Counter scales 1.756 74 81 Pumps 587 25 126 Platform scales 1.433 85 38 Wagon scales 767 41 85 Stock scales 225 38 10 Measures 1.601 126 11 Automatic scales 70 7 6 7 Dormant scales 52 1 1 Track scales 1 Total 9,549* 451t 520$ Summary of inspections made by the Weights and Measures Department from December 1, 1915, to November 30th, 1916: Sealed Condemned Adjusted Hopper scales 169 11 7 Weights 2,767 52 116 Counter Scales 2,653 120 60 Pumps 1.077 63 120 Platform scales 1,948 124 136 Wagon scales 951 66 91 Stock scales 322 47 11 Measures 1.715 313 19 Automatic scales 117 1 2 Dormant scales 96 4 C Slot machines 9 5 1 Total 11,824* 806t 569* * Total number of scales, weights and measures sealed. t Total number of scales, weights and measures condemned. t Total number of scales, weights and measures adjusted. </seg>

It meets all con - ditions in a proper manner and is being effectively enforced by this Department and observed by those engaged in this class of business. As years pass the storing of food products in cold storage in seasons of plenty for use in seasons of scarcity, is constantly on the increase. Our law cannot be said to be a conservative law as some of its provisions and penalties are drastic as it is intended that the sale of cold storage food shall be made without misrepresentation.

            <seg id="p031">FOOD, DRUG, DAIRY AND OIL COMMISSION 31 There is a natural prejudice in the mind of the public against cold storage food. It is acknowledged by all that cold storage food is not as good as strictly fresh food of the same kind, but it is a well settled fact that in times of scarcity when production is light, the price would be much higher on fresh foods than it is under present conditions, as cold storage food tends to reduce the price in times of scarcity and on the other hand, increase the price to the producer in times of plenty. In this way both consumer and producer receive a benefit. The law requires that cold storage warehouses shall be in- spected by the Department each quarter and that a report shall be made by each concern operating a cold storage showing the food in cold storage at a temperature of 40 degrees or less for a period of sixty days or longer. "We have twenty-two cold storage warehouses in Nebraska in which an immense quantity of food products is in storage.

            <seg id="p033">FOOD, DRUG, DAIRY AND OIL COMMISSION 33 A BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION In harmony with the program of Governor Morehead, every effort has been put forth to place the Pood, Drug, Dairy and Oil Commission on an efficient business basis. Business methods have been installed in conducting the affairs of the Department and many practices that have heretofore been in vogue have been eliminated and while it can not be said that no mistakes have been made, an honest effort has been put forth at all times to give the people of Nebraska a fearless and practical and, at the same time, fair enforcement of the laws under the jurisdic - tion of this Department. The results that have been obtained were not secured in a day, a week, a month, nor a year, but secured by constant effort on the part of every person connected with the Department at all times. Under the law those connected with the Department in field work are not paid on a monthly basis, but are paid for each day of service rendered and for this reason each employee in the field has given full value for the money he has received during the past four years. Not a single inspector has been given a vacation at any time, but has put in his full time and energy in the service of the state. Until recently it was the practice to purchase mileage for all inspectors, but under a recent ruling no mileage is now used by any of our inspectors. Elsewhere in this report is reproduced a bulletin which was issued by the commission relating to rules and regulations gov - erning inspectors. In submitting this report, I take some pardonable pride in the showing we have been able to make during the period I have occupied the position of Deputy Food, Drug, Dairy and Oil Com - missioner. I have given my full time and attention to the duties of the office and my heart and soul have been in the work. There is no position under state government in which there is more grief, or where a greater measure of successful results can be accomplished and the record that has been made stands for itself, no matter whether it be successful in greater or less degree. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 BIENXIAL REPORT OF THE ENCOURAGEMENT Occupying a position as active head of such a Department with a large field of activities, naturally brings criticism as well as encouragement from those who come in contact with the de - partment. On the one hand there are always a few who take advantage of the political faith of the one in charge of the work and make every effort to dishearten him and destroy his usefulness and the fruits of his labors. On the other hand there are many who stand ready to encourage and co-operate in any movement for the benefit of the people of the state regardless of political affiliation. It has been my purpose to pay as little attention as possible to those engaged in political warfare and give every energy to the enforcement of laws during my entire term, and I feel that while I may not have accomplished all that I have set out to do, that I have done my utmost and feel a deep sense of gratitude to those who have seen their way clear to join hands with me in the biggest and most beneficial work under state government, "the making of Nebraska the best pure and clean food state in the Union.'' </seg>

Nebraska is one of the largest food producing states in the union and these foods are sold the world around, a fact that should be brought home to every citizen of the state. "Stand up for Nebraska" is a eood slogan, but in food nutters the world "Nebraska Foods First" should be the slogan, and every effort should be made to keep this slogan in the foreground to the extent that all the people of this state be brought to realize that the foods produced and manufactured here are second to none. In justice to our producers and manufacturers and in justice to ourselves as consumers, we should all join hands in advertising in every way possible every article of food produced or manufactured within the state, and show that our foods are superior in quality and that our supply is abundant. To accomplish the best results we must hang our banners where they can be seen and not only attract the attention of our own people but the people in other states who buy from us, as it is shown that our production is far beyond our consumption inasmuch as we produce nearly a halt billion dollars of food products each year. It would seem proper that a certain time be fixed wherein all con - cerned can take part in furthering the general welfare of the state and also of the producers and consumers of food products, therefore the week of April 3rd is hereby designated as the Pure Food Week. All organizations of commercial endeavor, all societies of public wel - fare, all business concerns engaged in selling, distributing and manufac - turing foods, and all persons engaged in the production of foods, are hereby requested to co-operate in this movement and lend every effort for its success. Believing that our citizens will agree with me in this matter and will cc-operate to help carry out the Intent of this proclamation, I hereby set apart the week of April 3rd for the purpose mentioned.

            <seg id="p066">66 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE Monthly Expense Account On the last day of each month a monthly expense account must be made out and each item of the same must be represented by a receipt showing the expenditure and what for. All expense accounts must be made out and forwarded in duplicate. Auto or Livery Hire In extreme cases only is the use of automobiles or livery permitted. The Department prefers that inspectors do not hurry matters and give sufficient time at each town to complete the work. Special instruction will be given for any other procedure, and in the absence of such In - struction, all Inspectors are to be governed by the first statement in this paragraph. Telephone and Telegraph It must be explicitly understood that telegrams or telephone calls to this Department must not be sent collect, but always paid for at the point of origin. Collection of Money Under the law each person must forward fees direct to the Depart - ment unless It is specifically stated otherwise in the law.

            <seg id="p068">68 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE Sample* of Product* Follow the law closely in the purchase of products for the purpose of analysis or investigation. Get the proper receipt and seal each pack - age with Department seals. A letter of explanation must accompany each lot of samples purchased when forwarded to the Department, and all packages of samples may be forwarded express charges collect. In sending to this Department for analysis samples of any manu - factured product, the following Information must be given on each sample: Name and location of manufacturer. If bought of jobber, the firm name and location. Be particular as to this, and write names plainly. Brand or name of article, any representation by seller as to quality or character of goods. Inspectors are instructed to give preference to original packages. In no case should the contents of a package be tampered with or a portion of the sample removed. The inspector's label should never cover an important part of the label covering the sample. If there is no place on which to attach the inspector's label, use a tag attached by means of wire or cord. When samples are sent in bulk, as spices or buckwheat flour, the inspector's label should be attached so as to seal the package. In case of samples sold in amount smaller than those required for analysis, as extracts or olive oils, it will be necessary to send double or triple samples. When samples are taken in this manner, the bottles or other containers should be wrapped or tied together so as to form one package. Perishable samples, i. e., samples showing signs of fermentation or spoiling, should be marked "Perishable," in order that they may re - ceive proper immediate attention ou arrival. Cheese and fresh meats should not be forwarded in ordinary paper wrappers or in tin boxes. Use paraffined paper or other covering that will neither absorb fat nor permit formation of mold or must. Milk and cream samples requiring preservation should not be so treated as to render valueless the results of analysis, 1. e., the amount of preservative should not be more than is necessary for keeping the sample a few days. One-quarter of the common corrosive sublimate tablet is ample for one pint of milk, and ten drops of formalin solution in the same amount of samples will be sufficient. In order to be acceptable for analysis, each sample must bear the official department label. A sample cannot be accepted: (1) If the label shows discrepancies as to number, date or de - scription of sample. (2) If the inspector's handwriting is illegible or careless. It is important in all cases to give correctly the names aud ad - dresses of retailers, manufacturers and Jobbers on cards accompany - ing samples. Whenever the name of the manufacturer cannot be given, then, if possible, give the name of the Jobber. </seg>

            <seg id="p070">70 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE Inspectors will be expected to observe strictly the above regu- lations. Sanitary Order* Sanitary orders take the place of prosecutions, and when sanitary orders are issued, the conditions to be corrected must be set forth on the order and such orders must be addressed to the owner of the business, and not to the owner of the building, unless they happen to be one and the same person, firm or corporation. The signature of the person to whom the order Is addressed must be secured in every in - stance. Always read the sanitary order to the person to whom it is addressed, and leave a copy of the sanitary law. TEMPORARY REFRESHMENT 8TAND8 August 1, 1916 At this season of the year when street fairs, county fairs, carni - vals and other celebrations are the gathering places of people seeking entertainment and recreation, the temporary refreshment stand is always found in evidence. Some of these stands serve the public well, but the greater portion of them do not. Some think that a tem - porary stand that sells either food or drink, can be handled "any old way," and also think those that patronise these places should not expect to receive their money's worth, but take what is handed to them without a murmur. There is no good reason why the public should be required to buy hamburger and other similar products which are of doubtful origin and composition, and are cooked out in the open and exposed to every form of contamination, flies, dust and dirt. Uncleanliness, in the handling of foods or drinks, Is a violation of the law, and there can be no possible excuse for such violation. It is a well known fact that the requirements of the law can not be met as easily in a temporary place of business as in a permanent place, and for this reason the following rules and regulations are offered to govern temporary refreshment stands: Rules and Regulations No. 1. Stands should be entirely screened, but must have that part screened In which cooking is done and food is kept. No. 2. Stands should not be located In the street but should be located back of the lot line. No. 3. All persons employed in such places must wear clean cloth - ing and keep said clothing clean by frequent change it necessary. Clean water and towels must be provided for the use of such persons. Provi - sion must be made for waste disposal and garbage, which must be removed at least twice daily. Waste and garbage must never be thrown on the ground near the stand. </seg>

            <seg id="p072">72 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE No. 4. All utensils used for preparing or serving foods or drink must be kept clean and a sufficient quantity of water must always be provided for this purpose. ? Â» No. 5. Food or drinks can not be displayed on counters or elsewhere unless the containers are covered by tight covers of wood, glass or metal. Cloth or mosquito bar will not serve the purpose. No. 6. Drinks should be served in individual cups of paper, but if glasses are used they must be thoroughly washed in fresh clean water immediately after being used by each patron. Glass or metal containers should be used and wooden tubs should not be used for the keeping of drinks in bulk. If dippers are used for filling cups or glasses they must be kept in the Jars or containers when not in use. The use of containers with a faucet, or spigot, near the bottom, is recommended. No. 7. Ice cream cones and lemonade straws must be kept in a well covered container until used. They must not be displayed on a counter uncovered. No. 8. Candy, popcorn, and other confections may be sold only in package form, and when such confections are prepared in outdoor stands, that part of the stand must be enclosed, so that said confection will be securely protected from flies, dust and dirt. Screening alone will not accomplish this. N. 9. Hamburger deteriorates quickly and is always of doubtful origin, and should never be permitted to be sold in temporary stands. If a supply of meat is to be kept on hand, a refrigerator with a sufficient amount of ice in it, must be installed and the meat kept in the refrig - erator. The same rule will apply to all perishable foods. No. 10. A tight metal or glass cover must be provided for griddles on which weiner wurct or other meat is cooked. The cover on the griddle may be open on the side next to the operator only. Griddles should be cleaned thoroughly and frequently. No. 11. All imitation drinks must be plainly labeled to show that they are imitation. If artificially colored, this statement must also appear. No. 12. Foods not in containers must be securely protected from flies, dust and dirt at all times. â€¢ SPECIAL NOTICE It must be understood that the foregoing rules and regulations cover all matters pertaining to the handling and sale of foods and other refresh - ments. In making inspections, inspectors will be governed by the State law in all matters. </seg>

A penalty of $10 to $100 is fixed In the law for violation of Mm*. EGGS MUST BE CANDLED Dealers must candle all eggs purchased to avoid the penalty fixed In the law. PROTECT YOURSELF Market your eggs when they are fresh as they spoil quickly and must not be aold when spoiled. Always keep out of the sun. Never allow them to be near anything with a strong smell, as they become tainted and are unfit for food. CAREFUL HANDLING An egg is the most delicate of products and will spoil quickly unless kept properly and handled carefully. Market your eggs often and avoid loss. THE NEBRA8KA EGG CROP The egg crop of this state each year amounts to more than $15,000,000. The loss from spoiled eggs amounts to over $2,000,000. Careful handling and frequent marketing will stop this enormous loss. TO EGG DEALER8 Keep your eggs In a cool dry place and in shipping them insist that they be shipped in Refrigerator Cars only. Never allow any shipment to be left on the station platform in the hot sun. It ruins them. Never hold eggs in hot weather. Ship them. All inspectors of this department are instructed to pay strict atten - tion to the enforcement of the Spoiled Food Law. Bulletins covering the matter of care and handling of eggs will be mailed upon application. NEBRASKA FOOD, DRUG, DAIRY AND OIL COMMISSION Dated at Lincoln, Nebraska By CLARENCE E.
