Losses thru improper handling, cutting, or curing may easily eliminate the profits. Handling meat successfully necessitates a close attention to many details, most of which arc very important. The following pages contain a general outline or guide for the slaughtering, cutting, curing and keeping of meat on the farm. There are various successful methods for most of these operation*. Lack of space precludes the description of all but one. The method outlined can be profitably changed under some conditions but has been selected as the one best adapted for beginners. TOOLS NEEDED Elaborate butchering equipment is too costly for the average farm butcher. At the same time a lack of certain tools is even more expensive. The following are reasonable in price and will effect a real saving both in labor and product : Beef tree (or doubletree or neck yoke) Beef pritch (or 30-inch broom handle sharpened on both ends.) W. J. I&lt;»effrl drew the diagrams for this bulletin. He has mad.- many helpful criticisms and sugiiesti mi. His cooperation Is must sincerely appre - ciated. BY K. P.

            <seg id="p005">Pork and Beef 5 comparable to that of the razor strop. "Touch up" the sharp knife on the steel quite frequently while working, but do not try to use it as a grindstone. SELECTION OF STOCK WEIGHT Hogs weighing 200 to 250 pounds will be found preferable to larger ones. They will handle more easily and yield hams, shoulders and sides of better weights for curing. The chops and steaks will also be of handier sizes for table use. Barrows ordinarily yield a sounder, smoother, firmer strip of bacon. Seven hundred to one thousand pound cattle are of most con - venient size. Heavier ones cut roasts and steaks which are too large for average family use. Seventy to eighty pound lambs cut about four chops to the pound and yield five or six-pound trimmed leg roasts. Heavier lambs give "hotel" cuts, too large for home use. AGE Young meat is tender but watery, gelatinous and lacking in flavor. Flesh from older stock carries more flavor but is often dry and tough. In general, the medium between flavor and tenderness comes when lambs and hogs are between eight months and one year old and cattle between one and two years. There is little to prove that "bob veal" (from calves under six weeks of age) is unhealthful. Older calves, however, yield a much firmer and more palatable product. CONDITION (fatnen) Tenderness, juiciness and flavor in beef and lamb depend upon marbling, i. e., the interspersing of flakes of fat between the lean muscle fibers. Sufficient marbling is rarely found ex - cept in carcasses carrying some surface fat. Excessively fat stock are "wasty cutters," but a moderate to liberal covering is desirable. Extreme condition in hogs serves mainly to increase the lard yield and decrease the quality of the bacon. QUALITY Smooth, beef-bred animals generally dress a higher percent - age, cut more of the choice back and loin, and yield a more tender and better flavored meat than coarser stock. HEALTH Meat from sick stock is unfit for food. For this reason select no animal which even looks "off." When dressing the carcass look carefully for signs of tuberculosis and cholera. This is naturally quite important. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Extension Service 6 HANDLING BEFORE SLAUGHTER Well-bled meat keeps more easily than that from stock where the drainage has been imperfect. The handling of an animal just previous to slaughter has much to do with getting a good "stick. 7 ' Stock bleeds more thoroly and dresses more easily after twenty-four hours fast. Water should be allowed freely. Running or wrestling the animal causes a temporary fever. If killed in this condition the meat is apt to be bloody and slimy (firey). Such meat looks bad. tastes bad, and spoils easily. Penning up the animal by himself tin* day before butcher - ing is recommended. Whip marks and bruises leave bloody spots which have to be trimmed out. SLAUGHTERING HOGS STICKING Shooting is dangerous and kills the hog too dead, stopping the blood flow. Knocking is often cruel. Neither are necessary. For beginners the following is the easiest method of sticking. It was developed by Prof. T. G. Paterson, of Minnesota, and has proved both teachable and learnable. Klg. 2— Keep the hog square on his back and the knife in the center. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Pork and Beef 7 Roll the live hog upon his back, one man standing astride his chest, holding the forelegs. Open the skin about three inches in front of the breast bone (the 6-inch skinning knife is long enough). Run the knife, edgedown, straight to the bone, follow - ing it down with the point to its lower edge. See Fig. 3. Push the knife under the bone and one-half to three-fourths of an inch inward. Cut down and back toward the head. Be careful to keep the knife in the center. It is both difficult and unwise to stick the heart. Let it pump out the blood as long as possible. Fig. 3 — The knife going thru positions 1. 2 and 3 will s#-v. r the bluod vessels at the forks. SCALDING Slow or "second hog" scalds are the best. Water for barrel scalding should be between 155 and 165 degrees Fahren - heit. If a steam boiler is available, hold the temperature at 145 degrees; 141 degrees is the lower limit.

When possible 165 de - grees is best as it will slip the hair without so much danger of over - heating and setting it. Scald the head end first. A bar of common soap, two handfuls of soft soap, a small shovelful of wood ashes, or a scant table - spoon of lye in the water will cut the scurf and leave the hog's hide much clean - er and whiter. Soft soap and soft water Fig. 4 — White and belted hogs scald most easily. make the best combination. After scalding, remove the hair from the feet, legs, and head. The edge of the scraper will help. Fig. o — The hair twists oft more easily when hot. </seg>

Bacon can be smoked in from 24 to :{(&gt; hours: hams and shoulders take from 60 to 90 hours, de - pending upon the size. A cool, slow smoke spread over three or four days is often better than too fast a treatment. Meat should hang at least six feet above the fire. KEEPING IN SUMMER Mt'.it keeps the best in a dry, dark, cool, well ventilated place where flies cannot get to it. The smoke house has proven a satisfactory store house until hot weather and flies set in. The standard method then is to wrap the meat in paper and muslin and to bury it in the grain bin. Good success has been had in this State from packing it unwrapped in clean, granulated rock salt. Smoked meat will absorb little or no salt from this dry pack. SUMMER CURING Light hogs may be killed and cured in hot weather. Im - mediate chilling is the important item. Kill if possible, in the evening. Cut up the carcass at once and bone out the hams, shoulders, and loins. Split the hams and shoulders flatways along the bone, instead of from the top or ham side to the bottom or skin side. Rub the meat with salt. Spread out all the pieces on a rack or roof where there is a good breeze and as low a temperature as possible. Cats and dogs will be found a nuisance at this time. Omit the sugar and use the same brine as in the winter cure. Pack the meat the next morning before the sun strikes it. One can be - gin using from the barrel at once. SALT PORK Salt pork is often made from fat backs containing little or no lean. Rub the meat with salt and let it stand over night as in starting the ham and bacon cure. Put down in a brine contain - ing (for 100 pounds of meat) : 10 pounds of salt 2 ounces salt peter 41,4 gallons water This should be boiled and cooled before putting on the meat. Keep the pork in brine until used. DRY CURED PORK For 100 pounds of ham or bacon : 5 pounds salt 2 pounds sugar (brown or cane) 2 ounces salt peter Mix thoroly Pepper may be added to suit the taste Rub one-third of the mixture into the meat every three days </seg>
            <seg id="p021">Pork and Beef ■21 Pack in tight box or barrel after every rubbing. Keep in the pack 12 to 15 days after the last of the cure has been added. Wash lightly, dry and smoke. Beginners are cautioned in the use of this recipe. It takes an ideal, cool, moist temperature and careful work to get a safe, uniform cure. Some of the famous southern cures use syrup instead of sugar. RENDERING L/- RD Leaf lard is the best, back fats next, and offal fat the strongest. Cut the lard into small pieces. Grinding is recom - mended where possible. The skin need not be removed unless quite dirty. Lean trimmings are apt to cause scorching and dis - coloration. Start the rendering over a slow fire. One or two quarts of water will assist in prev&lt; nting burning. It is dangerous to add water after the grease has begun to melt. Water in rendering lard will cause it to become rancid. Cook until it is all driven off and the cracklings brown and float. Two hundred seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit is the highest temperature that should be used. Frequent stirring is recommended. Strain the lard through muslin into jars or tubs. A vigorous stiiring or whipping with spoon or paddle just before it sets will whiten the lard and give a smoother grain. Ten per cent clean beef suet may be added without injuring the color of the lard severely. SLAUGHTERING CATTLE STUNNING It is better and safer to stun the beef with an axe than to kill with :i rifle. Halter the beef and tie the head down close to the ground. The intersection o i lines drawn from the base of each horn across to the opposite eye will show the prop - er place to strike. After stunning, re - move the halter and rope. St retell out the beef's head by bracing one foot against the lower jaw and hold back the fore-legs with the other foot and leg.

This is not serious, except as it adds to the work in washing the carcass. To thoroly drain the blood vessels stand behind the beef, place the foot in the rear flank and push the paunch forward toward the chest. Repeat until the bleeding ceases. SKINNING In skinning the carcass, rcmow the head first. Open the poll behind the horns, cutting clear across. Open the hide from the sticking place to the muzzle. Skin out one side of the head and part of the neck. Cut the skin from muzzle to horn, follow - ing along the line of the eye. Skin back the hide from the face, raise the head so that it rests on the poll and skin out the under side. Stretch out the head and neck by pulling back over the poll. Cut across the "Adam's apple" and unjoint at the "atlas" or first joint. If the back of the poll has been well skinned the head will come off easily.

Split the hide down the belly line from the brisket to the tail, holding the knife as in opening across the buttock. It will be easier for the beginner it the muscles are not cut until after the beef is "sided." SIDING "Choke" the skinning knife with the hand, letting at least the first finder extend beyond the handle onto the blade. This short "hitch'" makes the knife easier to control. With the left hand stretch the hide tightly along or beside the meat. Pulling it away at right angles is apt to cause a cut hide and ragged car - cass. There is a thin "fell" or membrane which lies between the meat and the skin.

The hide can be pulled down to a little below the stifle. Wash the hocks and rounds with clean, hot water and dry with a hot cloth which has been well wrung out. Loosen the rec - tum and pull down past the kidney. Leave as much bed fat on the carcass as possible. Raise the carcass clear from the ground and remove the offal as in dressing hogs. Skin out the back to within two or three inches of the back bone. This part should peel out easily. An upward stroke over the hooks and rump will do a smoother job than a downward cut. Loosen the hide at the tail head. The weight of the hide and a little knife work will drop it to the shoulders. Open the forelegs down the inside and skin out the legs, shoulders and neck. Use the same cutting method as in siding. One will have to go slowly here as there are many wrinkles in the hide and it is a very unhandy place to work. Split the carcass down the center of the backbone with the saw or cleaver. Careful work is needed to keep the saw in line.

            <seg id="p041">Pork and Beef 41 TESTING HAMS Bone sour in hams shows most plainly when the warm meat comes out of the smoke house. Federal inspectors use a "trier" which resembles a narrow 10" harness awl. This is run along the bone to the center of the ham both from hock and loin end. If it brings out a sweet "smoky" odor the meat is sound. If the trier smells spoiled, bone out the ham and save the parts that are still good. YELLOW WASH FOR SMOKED MEAT' See that the surface of the cured, smoked meat is dry. Wrap in parchment paper and inclose in heavy muslin or canvas. Wrap and tie the top carefully to keep out the flies. Paint with the following yellow wash: For 100 pounds of ham or bacon 3 pounds barytes (barium sulphate) 1 oz. glue 1*4 oz. chrome yellow (lead chromate) 6 oz. flour Make a smooth "gravy thickening" of the flour, finally adding enough water to make about half a pail. Dissolve the chrome in a quart of water in a separate vessel, adding this solu - tion and the glue to the flour. Bring the whole to a boil and add the barytes slowly, stirring constantly. Use cold. Stir frequently when using and apply with brush. Hang the meat so that the pieces do not touch. Do not stack in piles. Well cured meat so packed should keep indefinitely. SOAP The fat used may come from cracklings, offal fat, non-edible fat, etc. Hard Soap — The fats and greases should first be clarified by boiling with several pieces of raw potatoes, then skimmed and strained through cheese cloth. Add 2 1 /. pints of cold water in a granite iron dish and one pound of best lye. This should be done with the greatest care. The mixture becomes hot as the lye dis - solves, and it should be allowed to stand and cool until the tem - perature is about 70 degrees. Melt 6 1 /-; pounds of clarified fat, but do not boil. Stir the grease and slowly add the lye. When about the consistency of thin honey, pour into wet pans. Do not stir too long. When cold, cut the soap into cakes. White Floating Soap — Take 4 quarts fat, any kind will do; two 10-cent cans of lye, and 10 quarts of water. Put water in an 1 Farmer* 1 Bulletin 181, U. 8. Department of Agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">42 Nebraska Extension Service old boiler or scalding kettle, then the fat, and last the lye. Boil slowly three hours. When the soap becomes flaky and the liquid looks clear and boils over the soap, it is ready to skim. Line a wooden box with a piece of wet muslin, skim out the soap and put into the box to drain about twelve hours, then cut into bars. This will make twelve large bars of hard, white soap, that may be used for any kind of washing. If the soap sticks on the hand when squeezed and looks greasy, it needs a little more lye, if too flaky, more fat. The liquid can be used for scrub - bing. Soft Soap- — Seven and one-half pounds of caustic soda, 10 pounds of grease and 40 gallons of water. Dissolve soda in a pun of water, add about \' A of the grease, and heat. Stir in the remainder of the grease. Add the rest of the water gradually for several days. It will be ready for use in about two weeks. RIPENING The lean fibers of meat will soften and become more tender if left to hang after slaughter. Two weeks "aging" in a dry place at 36 degrees Fahrenheit are ideal conditions for ripening beef and mutton. Pork is generally cut up as soon as cold. Fat carcasses will stand more age than thin ones. Meat does not ripen while frozen. DRESSING PERCENTAGES Dressing percentages refer to the proportionate weight of the carcass to the animal on foot. The yield of carcass depends upon condition, type, quality and "fill." Following are the «p - proximate percentages of the different classes of stock : Hogs Cattle Sheep Range 65-85 36-70 40-65 Average 78 53 48 The good kind of stock for farm butchering will yield about as follows: Hogs, 79-81. Cattle, 54-60. Lambs, 49-52. Hogs are small middled, thick fleshed and are dressed head, feet and skin on. The yield is therefore higher than that of cattle and sheep. Sheep are thinner fleshed than cattle and pelts proportionately heavier than hides.

            <seg id="p044">44 Nebraska Extension Servick EXTRACTS Beef extracts are those substances which give meat its flavor. They are soluble in water and dissolve out of meat which stands in cold water or which is boiled without being first seared over. Dry, tough neck and shank meat are richest in extracts. Thirty - five to forty pounds of beef will make about one pound of "beef extract." PRESERVATIVES Salt — Salt preserves and drys meat. The excessive use of it will not only spoil the flavor but make the lean muscle hard and tough. Sugar — Syrup will preserve meat but when used alone give* a sickening flavor. It is used to soften the harshness of the straight salt cure. Brown or cane sugar or molasses can be used. Select that which gives the desired flavor. Salt Peter — Salt peter preserves and drys the meat as does salt, and holds the bright red color of the lean. Because of its medicinal action it should be used sparingly if at all. Pepper — Pepper adds flavor but can not be classed as a pre - servative. It floats on water so it is not used in the brine cure. CASINGS Sausage casings are made from the large and small intes - tines, the rectum, gullet and bladder. Beef intestines are cut from the fat; sheep and hog casings can be "run" with the fingiTs. Water is run thru the beef casings and the fat scraped from the outside. They are then soaked in warm water for a few minutes, turned wrong side out and "slimed." To turn, place them in warm water. With the thumb and forefinger turn back four inches of one end in the same manner that one turns the finger of a glove. This can be done more easily under water. Fill this "cuff" with water, hold it on the outside of the pan and "feed" the casing into the "cuff." The weight of the water will pull the rest of the casing thru and turn it. Cuts in the in - testines will let out the water and the operation will have to be started again at that point. A small piece of wood can be used for "sliming." It has a handle to fit the palm of the hand and a medium sharp edged "hook." The casing is pulled between the thumb and this curved edge, Jhe mucous lining stripping off clean. They are then washed, tied up in "sets," salted and packed. Casings should be well soaked, both inside and out before being stuffed. Beef "rounds," in which ring bologna is stuffed, are the small intestines. Beef "straights" or "middles" are the large intestines. They carry "big" bologna, liver sausage and </seg>
            <seg id="p045">Pork and Beef 45 the like. Minced ham, head cheese, etc., are packed in bungs and bladders. Pork sausage is stuffed in hog casings and "franks" or "weinies" in sheep casings. Cloth casings can be made from muslin. Cut two strips of cloth 2 1 -. to 3 inches wide. Stitch both sides on the sewing machine. Dampen them and stuff. After pork sausage has been packed in them they should be heated long enough to melt the outside layers of grease. Plunge them into cold water. This sets an airtight coating around the meat. CURING HIDES AND PELTS The profitable handling of hides demands a system which will prevent the spoiling and slipping of the hair and which will hold the shrinkage in weight to a minimum. Cool, damp, venti - lated, cemented cellars are ideal. Spread out the fresh hide, hair down. Split the butts of the ears with a knife. Sprinkle the hide thoroly and evenly with crushed rock (hide) salt, but do not "bury" it. Fifteen to twenty pounds of salt will cover the average hide. See that the salt reaches all parts of the head, legs, tail, etc. Commercial houses build square or rectangular packs, building up layer by layer. Alternate the rows of the thicker heads so as to keep the pack level. One-third of each hide at the edges of the pack is folded over and back. This keeps the moisture from draining out. Hides so packed will cure in about thirty days. Hides well packed and under moderate temperatures will shrink about 15 per cent in weight. Farm butchers ordinarily ship hides green. Spread out the fresh hide as in packing and salt evenly and moderately. Throw in the head, and fold in the sides enough to make the strip about two feet wide. Roll from the head end toward the tail. Tie with quarter-inch rope. No. 1 hides are allowed cuts within two inches of the edge. No. 2s, branded, grubby and bull hides sell for less per pound than No. Is. Sheep pelts are spread fleece down, salted and piled one above the other. They will cure in about two weeks. TANKAGE Commercial tankage is a packing house by-product. Con - demned meat and other waste parts carrying food value are put into pressure cookers, "tanks," and steamed until absolutely sterile. Fats and other by-products are drawn off and the rest dried and sold for hog feed and fertilizer. </seg>
