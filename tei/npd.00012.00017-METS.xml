REPORT OF TRUSTEES. 

Nebraska Institute for the Blind. 

Nebraska City, Neb., December 14, ISM. 
To the Governor: 

The Board of Trustees of the Nebraska Institute for the 
Blind have the honor to submit the following report: 

Shrough the dispensation of an all-wise Providence, Con(i. 
Ellwanger, a member of this board, was called from 
h the first day of March, 1903. Ha was appointed to the 
board by Governor E. P. Savage, his commission being dated 
April 15, 1902. Though connected with the board but a few 
months, he had evinced much interest in the welfare of the 
blind, and, had his life been spared, would have proved a 
valuable member. 

John W. Steinhart of Nebraska City was appointed by 
Governor John II. Mickey to fill the unexpired term caused 
by the death of Mr. Ellwanger. 

The term of Charles Nownes of Papillion, as trustee, expiring 
June 4, 1903, he was reappointed by Governor Mickey 
to succeed himself, while Clinton Orcutt, whose term of 
office expired May 15, 1904, was also reappointed. 

Few changes have been made among teachers and employes 
during the past two years, the work of the school moving 
harmoniously. 

The report of the superintendent, which follows, gives in 
detail the affairs of the school, and is made a part of this 
report 

Respectfully submitted, 

Clinton Orcutt, President, 

Term of office expires May 15, 1907. 
John W. Steinhabdt, Secretary, 
Term of office expires April 20, 1905. 

Term of office expires June 4, 1906.

LAND COMMISSIONERS REPORT. 

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT. 

To the Board of Trustees, Nebraska Institute for the Blind, 

Nebraska City, Neb. : 

In compliance with the requirements of law, I herewith 
present a report of the affairs of this institution covering the 
period from December 1, 1902, to November 30, 1904. 

As is well known to you, this institution has for its purpose 
the education mentally, morally and physically of the 
youth of Nebraska who may be either totally blind, or blind 
to such degree that it is impracticable to gain an education 
in the common schools of the state. It is in no sense an 
asylum for indigent blind, nor a hospital for the treatment of 
diseases of the eye. 

There were in the school November 30, 1904, fifty-seven 
pupils. The whole number of pupils enrolled during the 
biennium is ninety-two, the highest number present at any 
time being fifty-nine, and the lowest number forty-eight. 

There was graduated in 1903 one pupil, and in 1904 one 
pupil. 

Notwithstanding that the state of Nebraska expends annually 
from fl0,000 to $20,000 for the education of blind children, 
it still remains a fact that a considerable number of 
those entitled to its advantages do not know of the existence 
of a school for blind. And, what seems still more incredible, 
another considerable number who do know of its existence 
will not avail themselves of the privileges offered. 

Parents, too often, through a mistaken kindness, can not 
bring themselves to part with an afflicted child, even though 
they admit it would be for the good of the child in the end. 

To bring the work as vividly as possible to the notice of 
the people, a tour by eighteen members of our school was 
undertaken during last March, of several of the principal 
cities of the state. A program, printed in another place, 
showing the results of work accomplished in the various departments 
of the school, was rendered in some .church or 
opera house during the evening, while, through the courtesy 
of boards of education and school superintendents, brief </seg>

            <seg id="p005">
INSTITUTE FOR THE BLIND

programs and talks to school children were given in the 
earlier parts of the day. 

The itinerary included Lincoln, Peru, Beatrice, Crete, 
Hastings, Kearney, Grand Island, Columbus Fremont, 
Omaha, South Omaha and Plattsmouth. At Beatrice we were 
guests of the Institute for Feeble-Minded Youth ; at Kearney 
of the Industrial School for Boys; at Grand Island of Soldiers' 
and Sailors', Home; at Fremont of President and Mrs. 
W. H. Clemmons of the Fremont Normal School. 

To the heads of these various institutions I desire to express 
my thanks and appreciation for the many courtesies 
extended. Without such cooperation it would have been 
impossible to make the trip, as our expenses, amountiu 
more than f400, had to be met from door receipts, no state 
funds being available for the purpose. 

While it is impossible to say how much good was accomplished 
in bringing a knowledge of the school to the people, 
and awakening an interest in it, I have already had evidence 
that some of the seed sown fell in fertile soil. To those of 
our school so fortunate as to make the trip it was an education 
in itself. Dr. Johnson, Dr. Kern, Superintendent Hay- 
Kd, Commandant Askwith and President Clemmons, toler 
with their estimable wives, exerted themselves to the 
utmost to give us all an insight into the workings of their 
respective institutions, and to make our stay with them 
pleasant. Our pupils, also, rendered a musical program before 
the inmates of the various institutions, which was enjoyed 
by both audience and performers. 

The cost of maintaining this school, considering the number 
of pupils, is often commented upon, and frequently works 
a hardship in securing necessary appropriations. When the 
nature of the work done is fully understood, however, the 
expense no longer seems excessive. 

In the first place, it must be considered that a teacher 
can not efficiently handle as great a number of blind children 
as of seeing children. In our best schools for blind the number 
of pupils in a class does not exceed from eight to ten. </seg>

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

For a school of a given number this means a larger number 
of teachers than for a school of seeing children of the same 

number. 

Then, too, it must be remembered that here we have practi- 

cally three schools in one — the usual school department 
where are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, 
geography, history, literature, etc. ; a complete course iu 
music, both vocal and instrumental, and the department of 
industrial training, where boys are taught piano tuning, 
broom making, carpet weaving, hammocking, netting, etc., 

and the girls sewing, knitting, mending, cooking, etc. 

Further, we could give instruction to half as many more 
without materially increasing the running expenses of the 
school. There are about sixty in attendance at present, while 
room could be found for about ninety. For heating and 
cooking some 600 tons of coal are consumed annually. This 
is one of the big items of expense and would not be increased 
for a 50 per cent increase in attendance, nor decreased were 

the attendance 50 per cent less. 

Another reason for the greater per capita expense of this 

school, as compared with other institutions of the state, is 
found in the fact that our pupils, being without sight, can 
not be called upon to perform work that is done by inmates 
of other institutions. The boys of the Beatrice and Kearney 
institutions do a vast amount of work upon the large farms 
connected with the institutions, w r hile the patients at the 
insane asylums perform work that goes a long way toward 

their support. 

A recent report from the United States Commissioner of 

Education, from which I quote, shows the per capita expense 

of the leading schools for the blind as follows :

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

Since my last report the kitchen, for the use of the older 

girls in learning the art of cooking, has been equipi&gt;ed, and 
has thus far proven a very valuable, as well as satisfactory, 
adjunct in the education of the blind. Fourteen of the older 
girls have taken work regularly twice a week under the direr 
tion of a competent teacher. A systematic outline is followed, 

so that we know what has been done. 

nning with the simple task of washing and paring 

potatoes, several girls have gone through the successive steps 
necessary to provide a complete meal, including building the 
fire in the stove, making and baking cake, biscuit, and bread, 

performing every operation themselves. At a public enter- 

tainment one young lady described and explained the various 
chemical processes involved in the making of biscuit, together 
with the properties of the ingredients used, at the 
same time performing the necessary operations Of mixing and 
forming a pan of biscuits, which was carried to the kitchen 
and brought back in due time and sampled by members of 

the audience with many words of praise, as well as of wonder. 
I am happy to say that the pipe organ for which I asked 

in my last report, through the generosity of the legislature, 

has been secured, and has proved all that had been antici- 

pated. 

During the past four years fifty pupils have dropped out 

of school for one reason or another, but, as about the same 
number of new ones have taken their places, the result is a 

much more harmonious school. Many of those dropping out 
had already been here too long for their own good, as well 
as the good of the school. At present, with a corps of competent 
and willing teachers, our pupils are making excellent 
progress in knowledge of books, and, I trust, in the knowl- 

edge that makes good men and women.
