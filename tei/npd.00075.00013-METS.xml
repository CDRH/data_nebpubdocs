            <seg id="p002">SUMMARY 1. A comparison was made in two trials of shelled corn, whole wheat and ground wheat when fed in conjunction with alfalfa hay to fatten - ing lambs. In Trial 11, date were obtained on the value of various mixtures of wheat and corn. 2. Whole wheat was almost as palatable as shelled corn but only 85 per centas efficient in the first trial and 88 per cent as efficient in the second trial. 3. Ground wheat fed alone was distinctly less palatable than either shelled corn or whole wheat. 4. Ground wheat was more efficient than whole wheat but le«s efficient than shelled corn. Grinding wheat to be fed as the only grain will be profitable if 100 pounds of it can be ground at not more than the value of 6.8 pounds of wheat and 8.4 pounds of alfalfa hay 5. A mixture of ground corn, one part, and ground wheat, three parts, produced just as rapid and as economical gains as shelled corn Such a mixture will be more profitable than shelled corn whenever 75 pounds of wheat is enough cheaper than an equal weight of corn to pay for grinding 100 pounds of the mixture. rt,™ In , a I deta , ile d carcass study of three average corn-fed lambs and three whole-wheat-fed lambs, little difference was found in dressing yields, carcass quality, or palatability.

            <seg id="p003">Wheat for Fattening Lambs A. D. WEBER and WM. J. LOEFFEL Corn sold at a higher price per bushel than wheat during the summer of 1930. As a result of this unusual condition, many inquiries were received by the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station relative to the value of wheat for fatten - ing lambs. Coburn (I) 1 answered such inquiries in .1894 by saying, "With corn and wheat approximating the same price per bushel,- it is not unprofitable nor wicked to feed the wheat." Wheat ranks high as a hog feed. In fact there are numer - ' ous data which indicate that it is slightly superior to corn for this purpose. But Mumford (2), after feeding wheat experi - mentally to lambs for two seasons, concluded that the dry matter in wheat was less valuable for fattening lambs than the dry matter in corn. Wilson and Skinner (3, 4) also found corn superior to wheat for lambs. They observed fur - ther that grinding wheat made it less palatable. On the other hand, Cooke (5) found in one trial that wheat and corn had the same value when fed to sheep. Linfield (6, 7) reported two trials in which wheat was slightly superior to barley for fattening lambs. This, however, gives no indica - tion of the relative value of wheat and corn since it is gen - erally recognized that barley is inferior to corn. Kammlade (8) reported that lambs fed whole wheat ate practically the same amount of grain as lambs fed shelled corn but made 8.1 per cent less gain. He also found that ground wheat was less palatable than whole wheat. Baker (9) found that, based upon average daily gain and feed required for 100 pounds of gain, whole wheat was 91 per cent as efficient as shelled corn. Hickman and Rinehart (10) observed that it was more difficult to keep lambs on feed with whole wheat than with shelled corn. They also found that shelled corn was slightly more efficient than wheat. Hackedorn and his co-workers (11) found that one ton of corn equaled 2,177 pounds of whole wheat plus 388 pounds of chopped alfalfa hay. The present indications are that the world wheat supply during the next few years may at times exceed the demand for it as human food. If this proves to be true, then increas - ing amounts of wheat are likely to be used as livestock feed. Since there were no data available on the relative value of wheat and corn for fattening lambs when fed under Nebraska conditions, it was deemed advisable, therefore, to conduct the two experiments reported in this bulletin. 1 Numbers in parenthesen arc references to literature cited In the back of this bulletin. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 257 OBJECTS The objects of these experiments were: (1) to compare shelled corn and whole wheat; (2) to determine whether or not wheatshould be ground for lambs; (3) to ascertain the advisability of feeding a mixture of wheat and corn. The feeding period was 84 days in each trial. The first trial was carried on from August 4, 1930, to October 27, 1930, while io e -?no? nd one started October 21, 1930, and closed January lo, 1931. LAMBS USED The lambs used in both trials were purchased on the Omaha market. The first group consisted of black-faced Idaho lambs averaging 67 pounds at the beginning of the experiment and grading good as feeders. White-faced Wyoming lambs grad - ing good and averaging 62 pounds were fed in the second }' ; ,Jt e3e lambs were considerably thinner when started on feed than the lambs used in the first test. FEEDS USED Yellow shelled corn was fed in both trials. In the first trial it graded No. 2 and averaged 11.2 per cent moisture, and in the second trial the grade was No. 3 and the moisture 15 8 per cent. No. 1 hard, winter wheat testing 61 pounds per bushel and averaging 9.5 per cent moisture in the first trial and 9.6 per cent in the second was used. It was analyzed and found to contain 11.63 per cent crude protein. An an - alysis of a composite sample of the grade U. S. No. 2 alfalfa hay fed in both trials revealed 14,5 per cent crude protein The average moduli of fineness of the ground grains as de - termined by E. B. Lewis of the Agricultural Engineering Department were as follows: ground shelled corn 3 87 - ground wheat, 3.84. The wheat kernels were broken in from four to six pieces and the corn was ground to a similar con - dition of fineness.

An attempt was made to get the lambs to eat the same amount of grain. Ground wheat, however, was distinctly less palatable than either shelled corn or whole wheat. Figure 2 illustrates this fact in a striking manner. The grain consumption remained the same until the third week, at which time all lots were receiv - ing 0.95 pound per head daily. The lambs fed ground wheat went off feed at this point and it was impossible to get them to consume as much grain at any time during the remaining nine weeks as the other two lots consumed. Figure 2 shows that Lot 3 also went off feed during the sixth and ninth weeks.

Whole wheat, on the other hand, was almost as palatable as shelled corn. Figure 2 indicates that slightly less whole wheat than shelled corn was eaten from the sixth to the ninth week. But during the last two weeks the lambs in Lot 2 were consuming 1.5 pounds of whole wheat per head daily with as much relish as the lambs in Lot 1 consumed a similar amount of shelled corn.

            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 257 AVERAGE DAILY GAIN The lambs in Lot 1, which were fed shelled corn, made an average gain of 4.3 pounds more than those in Lot 2, which were fed whole wheat, and 6.8 pounds more than the lot receiv - ing ground wheat. FEED REQUIRED FOR 100 POUNDS GAIN As indicated in Figure 1, 28 pounds of gain was produced by 100 pounds of shelled corn, while similar amounts of whole wheat and ground wheat produced 24 and 25 pounds of gain respectively. Based upon the grain required for. 100 pounds of gain, the relative efficiency of the rations were as follows : shelled corn, 100 per cent; whole wheat, 85 per cent; and ground wheat, 89 per cent. The latter figure does not repre - sent the true value of the ground wheat and alfalfa hay ration, since less grain was eaten by this lot than by either of the other two. A considerable amount of the whole wheat passed through the lambs undigested, which probably accounts for a part of the difference between Lots 1 and 2. SLAUGHTER DATA The slaughter data in both trials were obtained through the courtesy of Swift and Company, Omaha, Nebraska. All lots in Trial I dressed satisfactorily, with the shelled-corn lot holding a slight advantage. The shrink in transit was high in all lots, probably because of excessive handling prior to shipping. For this reason, the dressing yields based on final experimental weights were considerably lower than when based on selling weights, although the rating of the lots re - mained the same. Carcass grades were secured on only 21 lambs in Lots 1 and 2 because of the fact that three lambs from each of these lots were slaughtered at Lincoln for palatability studies. The grades reveal no significant difference between the shelled - corn and whole-wheat lots. But the carcass grades for the ground-wheat lot indicate that these lambs lacked somewhat in finish. This difference was apparently not great enough to affect the selling price because the lots were sold separately at the same figure. It is also possible that there were too few lambs in each lot to obtain an accurate appraisal. EXPERIMENTAL DATA— TRIAL II The experimental procedure followed in Trial II was the same as that in Trial I, with the exception that instead of feeding gram according to appetite, all lots received the same amount. Tables 2 and 3 show that the average daily grain ration was 1.05 pounds in each lot except in Lot 4, which was </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 Wheat for Fattening Lambs fed ground wheat, where it was slightly less, or 1.044 pounds. This was due to the fact that ground wheat again proved less palatable than shelled corn, ground corn, whole wheat, and mixtures of the two grains either whole or ground. Alfalfa hay was fed to all lots at the rate of 1.44 pounds per head daily. SHELLED CORN VS. GROUND CORN— LOTS 1 AND 2 The results of this trial are in agreement with those obtained by other investigators in that there was nothing gained by grinding corn for western lambs. In fact, based upon the feed required for 100 pounds of gain, shelled corn was three per cent more efficient than ground corn. All of the lambs in this trial were somewhat lacking in finish when marketed. Additional feeding would doubtless have raised the carcass grades.

It appears, therefore, that whole wheat is less efficient than shelled corn, both when fed alone and when fed in conjunction with an equal weight of shelled corn. A MIXTURE OF GROUND GRAINS VS. A MIXTURE OF WHOLE GRAINS LOTS 5 AND 6 The lambs in Lot 6, fed equal parts by weight of ground corn and ground wheat, gained 1.7 pounds per head more than those in Lot 5, which were fed the whole grains in the same proportions. Again basing calculations upon the data given in Table 3, we find that one could afford to pay not more than the value of 7.4 pounds of grain and 9.9 pounds of alfalfa hay for grinding 100 pounds of a mixture of equal parts by weight of shelled corn and wheat. Hence, with corn at 56 cents per bushel, wheat at 60 cents, and alfalfa hay at $10 per </seg>
            <seg id="p012">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 257 ton, the charge for grinding 100 pounds of the mixture could be as high as 12.4 cents and gains could still be produced as cheaply as on the unground mixture. The mixture of ground corn, one part, and ground wheat, three parts, by weight as fed in Lot 7 was two per cent more efficient than shelled corn. This is a slightly higher value than was obtained for the ground grains mixed equal parts by weight. The difference is probably not significant. The results indicate rather definitely, however, that, based upon average daily gams and feed required for 100 pounds of gain, a mix - ture that is one-half or even three-fourths ground wheat and one-half or one-fourth ground corn is just as valuable for fattening lambs as shelled corn. It will be profitable to feed such a mixture whenever, for example, 50 or 75 pounds of wheat is enough cheaper than an equal weight of corn to pay for the cost of grinding 100 pounds of the mixture. Of course, from this standpoint a mixture of ground corn, one-fourth, and ground wheat, three-fourths, would' excel one consisting of equal parts by weight of the two grains ground. Furthermore, even a casual study of the results presented in Table 3 reveals the soundness of this analysis. For ex - ample, comparing shelled corn with the ground mixtures fed m Lots 6 and 7, we find that the gains and feed required for 100 pounds of gain are almost identical. There is certainly no significant difference in the carcass grades between the lots. The fact that all lots sold at the same price per pound is fur - ther proof that there was no difference in finish. Whether to feed wheat in such mixtures will depend, then, upon the rela - tive price of wheat and corn and the price at which grinding can be done. CARCASS STUDIES At the termination of the first test, three lambs were selected from Lot 1 and a similar number from Lot 2 for car - cass and palatability studies.

            <seg id="p013">Wheat for Fattening Lambs was used to secure lambs which were average at the beginning and had made average gains in their respective lots. All of the lambs in the experiment were graded on foot by a com - mittee of three at the termination of the test. Each lamb was graded from three standpoints: conformation, finish, and quality. Numerical grades were used: one representing choice; two, good; three, medium; four, common; and five, cull. An average grade for each lamb was computed, equal weight being attached to conformation, finish, and quality. Table 4 indicates that the lambs selected were the average of the lots, not only from the standpoint of weight and gains made but also according to live grade. The lambs for slaughter test were weighed November 4th and held off feed and water over night. They were weighed again on November 5th and slaughtered immediately in the station abattoir. The slaughter data are given in Table 5.

The dressing yield of the corn-fed lambs was higher than that of the wheat-fed lots, when calculated on the basis of both the final experimental weight and the shrunk weight. This is in accord with the dressing percentage secured at Omaha. Because of the heavy shrink in marketing, the Omaha yields based on selling weights were abnormally high.

The carcass grades in this detailed study coincide with the carcass-grade studies made in the packing house, emphasizing that little difference existed between the carcasses of wheat-fed and corn-fed lambs in quality.
