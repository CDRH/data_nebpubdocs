Aldrich, Governor: Sir: In compliance with that part of the Constitution of the State of Nebraska, relating to reports from state officers, I have the honor to submit herewith the reports of the "Board of Public Lands and Buildings for the eighteenth Biennium, beginning December 1, 1910, and ending November 30, 1912, together with reports from the Superintendents of the various state institutions. Respectfully, EdwardJB. COWLES, Commissioner. a </seg>

            <seg id="p005">FOREWORD On November 30, 1912, work of the eighteenth biennium in the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings was brought to a close, and in accordance with a requirement of law I am submitting herewith a report showing the work done in the school land department, together with statistics dealing with the various institutions belonging to the state. This report will be augmented later by those of the superintendents of these same institutions. Lin the land department proper, which department has con - ol of all lands belonging to the state, no departure was made from the ordinary routine incident to the collection of rentals and interest on contracts, the auction of forfeited lands, and the issuance of deeds where payment in full was made on cer - tificates of sale. Applications to convert lease contracts to certificates of sale, as provided for under a legislative act of 1899, have been promptly considered, and where approval of appraisement was had by the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, settlement of the terms of sale has gone forward with dispatch and to the satisfaction of the applicant. The tables which follow show the work done in this particular for the biennium. Under the provisions of the law now in force governing the sale of school lands, the owner of a lease contract issued prior to July 9, 1897, may convert the same to a sale contract by applying to the county board of the county in which the land is situated for an appraisement for sale purposes, which ap - praisement must be approved by the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, whereupon payment in full at the price agreed upon may be made and deed issued, or partial payment of not less than one-tenth of the total value may be made; in which case the residue is converted to a contract running for a period of twenty years, bearing interest at the rate of 59c &gt; payable annually in advance on January 1st, of each year. If the owner of a lease is not satisfied with the appraisement made for sale he may continue his lease contract, and upon the expiration of the twenty-five year period he may release the premises without entering into competition with the public. 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT i While the terms offered those lease owners who were for - te enough to have leased their lands prior to July 9, 1897, liberal, and make the acquisition of state lands an easy er, yet a rank injustice obtains to a large class of individuals are occupying state lands, and have built up their homes »n, from the fact that those who leased land on the nint i any date subsequent to the eighth of July, 1897, canno hase their holdings. It is true also, that such lease owners no option on releasing, but must surrender their contracts e state and compete with the public in holding improvements in many cases are the results of twenty-five years of to frugality. In other words, they must pay a premium on which their industry has produced or see the fruits of their ts pass to some person who can well afford to pay a premium mprovements which represent no expenditure of cash nor jy on his part. Lease holders of the class of 1897 have years more in which to arrange their affairs in accord with present contingency, which contemplates abandonment of jch lands to the state at the end of the lease period. The should be so amended as to permit bona fide occupants of al lands to purchase their holdings irrespective of leasing The controversy between this office and the General Lam Office at Washington, carried through several administrations beginning with that of Commissioner Follmer, we are pleases to state, is approaching a satisfactory adjustment. I refer t the seizure of certain school sections in Cherry, Grant, Hooke and Morrill counties where corners were obliterated and b general orders homesteads were erected therefrom under wha is known as the Alt Surveys. N. B. Sweitzer, Supervisor o Surveys for the General Land Office, is now in the field with corps of assistants with orders to reestablish the old survey anc thereby restore to the state, lands so long in controversy. Th action of the government in thus admitting the claim of th office, will also release to the public, lands that were contiguou to school sections and had been withdrawn from entry with view of furnishing lieu lands for the school sections out of whic were erected homestead claims above referred to. </seg>

HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE, LINCOLN The first case of insanity in Nebraska becoming a public charge occurred in the case of a female from Cass County who was sent to the Iowa hospital for insane in September, 1861, and maintained therein at the expense of the Territory. In 1863, another female from Douglas County; in 1864, a criminal lunatic from Otoe County; in 1865, six; in 1867, seven; in 1868, nine; in 1869, ten; and in 1870, ten more— in all, fifty were sent by Nebraska to the Iowa hospital. Out of the fifty, there remained December 1, 1870, twenty-two. These, with eleven taken from the jails in the state, constituted the thirty - three with which this institution, then just opened, began the year 1871. The first building was destroyed by fire on April 17, 1871. The state was fortunate in having this building insured so that there was a few thousand dollars with which to begin the work of a new building which was ready for occupation on November 21, 1872. </seg>

All correspondence relating to surveys is referred to this department, and during the biennium 950 letters have been written, and information given in a large number of telephone and telegraph messages, and personal calls from county and private surveyors, landowners and landseekers. During the biennium there have been received from the General Land Office at Washington, D. C, the following records of surveys in Nebraska, the field notes and maps of resurveys of the West Half of Township 22 North, Range 41 West. Field notes and map of survey of Sections 11, 14. 23 and 26, T. 34 N., R. 46 W., and known as the " Gates of Sheridan." </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT Field notes and map of resurvey of sections 19, 20 and 21, T. 23 N., R. 53 W. ( and survey of lots in same. Executive order dated January 11, 1912, setting apart approximately twenty-two and seven-eighths square miles of the unentered and unappropriated Public Lands to be known as the Niobrara Reser - vation, for the Protection of Native Birds. It is expected that within the next few months there will be received, field notes and maps of a large number of townships recently resurveyed by the government in the middle and central part of the state. The field notes of surveys west of the 6th Principal Meridian were mostly bound in a very poor thin quality of sheepskin which has so deteriorated that they must be handled with grea care to keep them from falling to pieces. The notes of survey east of the 6th Principal Meridian were bound in heavier am better leather but many of them are cracking and must be re bound. During the biennium 100 volumes have been rebounc in khaki of uniform color of those previously rebound; within the next thirty days 100 more will be ready to be sent to th bindery. The manuscript reports of the field examiners of government surveys should be bound for convenient use in search for data to assist the state surveyor in settling disputes over surveys that are referred to this office. , During the biennium, as time could be spared, the stat surveyor has been engaged in abstracting and indexing the fiek notes and maps of government surveys in the state. That part of the surveys east of the 6th Principal Meridian is now com pleted. During the progress of this work it has been found tha in numerous cases the notes of surveys of small fractional town ships, and independent surveys of islands and of sections, hav been bound out of their regular order, in both township an range and only by accident would they be found. To discove any notes of such surveys, every book is closely examined. I rebinding the volumes of notes the arrangement in the prope numerical order of townships has been preserved. In April o 1911, I visited the office of the state auditDr at Topeka, Kansa </seg>
            <seg id="p063">63 DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING who is the custodian of the field notes of the Kansas surveys, where I found similar conditions. There are about 2,000 town - ship maps that are in daily use. These are the original maps and some of them are more than 55 years old. Their constant use has a deteriorating effect by becoming cracked around the edges, and soiled. Steps should be taken to have all mounted on cloth to preserve them. They should all be copied and the originals bound in loose leaf portfolios and laid away to be used only in cases of emergency, and the copies used in their stead. Field Work According to law all disputes arising between land owners, or land owners and surveyors, over boundary lines, when applica - tions are made to the Commissioner of Public Lands and Build - ings, are referred to this department for settlement, and when a survey is had, and the field notes and maps, etc., approved by the Commissioner, certified copies thereof are sent to the county surveyors of the counties in which the surveys are made, for record, it is a final settlement of the dispute, provided, however, that any person having an interest in such survey may appeal to the courts, as provided by law. The statutes also provide that the "Commissioner ma appoint one or more deputies who shall be competent and ex perienced surveyors, who shall make such surveys as may be assigned them, and whose findings shall have the same authorit as though made by the chief state surveyor, and for his services he shall receive $5 per day and necessary expenses, to be pai&lt; by the parties interested in any dispute over surveys or boun daries." During the preceding biennium the three deputies appointed according to an Act of the Legislature of 1909, were county surveyors, but were unable to devote their entire time to the work, and the office was unable to keep up with the number of applications filed. In April of 1911, Mr. E. C. Simmons made application to the Commissioner for appointment as deputy and offering to give the matter of surveys his entire time. He was accordingly appointed. One of the deputies, Mr. H. D. Patterson, of Papillion, has been unable during the two surveying seasons to mak? any surveys on account of the large amount of caunty w&gt;rx in the </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT construction of roads, caused by the application of inheritance taxes to the improvement of the roads of Sarpy County. Deputy J. L. Paul, of St. Paul, decided at the close of last years' work to quit, and engage in the more lucrative business of operating a garage. Deputy Geo. C. Reed, of Alma, has devoted all the time he could spare from his duties as county surveyor of Harlan County. Mr. Simmons has given his entire time during the two sur - veying seasons, which has enabled the office to advance the surveys more rapidly than when the state surveyor was doing all the work, or when the deputies could only spare the time from their official duties as county surveyors. The survey of the 5th Guide Meridian through Dundy County, continued from the last biennium, has been complete&lt; and that of S. R. Hicks of Custer County, also continued from the last biennium, was cancelled to permit it to be merged in another application, embracing more territory. Forty-one new applications have been filed, and forty-five surveys made, am the completion of the 5th Guide Meridian through Dundy County, which was left uncompleted in November of 1910. There are, however, six applications, filed since 1906, tha have been carried along at the request of applicants for various reasons, generally on account of failure of interested parties t agree to share in the expense, and unfavorable crop conditions so that the work is practically up-to-date, which insures to th applicants speedier adjustment of their disputes which is o the greatest importance to the interested parties. Some of the surveys applied for either cover so much terri - tory, or are so complicated and difficult of execution that con - siderable time is often required to make the survey. Before assigning a survey to any deputy it is the rule of the office to require the applicants to deposit with the Commis - sioner an estimated sum, as an evidence of good faith, to be applied in payment of the surveyor's per diem and expenses when the work is completed. The applicants are also required to furnish information as to the cause of dispute, the location of all known government corners in the vicinity, and the notes of prior surveys by county surveyors. The necessary data from the government field notes and maps on file in this office is </seg>
            <seg id="p065">65 DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING copied, so that the deputy may have full information to assist him in the execution of the examination and survey. Usually there is also issued instructions to the deputy to guide him in general or specific matters, but a great deal must be left to his good judgment, skill and fidelity. When the field notes and maps of surveys are submitted to the office, they are carefully examined before being recommended for approval. All this requires considerable time and labor and as a partial recompense for the same a reasonable minimum fee is required, which is paid into the general fund.

In addition to the above tabulation of field work and th per diem collected and paid into the general fund of the stat treasury, this department was called upon by the attorney genera to investigate some alleged government surveys in T. 30 N., F 32 W., Cherry County, to secure information to be used in a su where the state, in an original suit in the supreme court is seek ing to quiet title to more than 100 acres of land in School Sectio 36, in said township, claimed by a party adversely to the state grant. I made one trip in November, 1911, and another la^ June, which required twelve days for both trips, without an per diem charge. The Board of Public Lands and Buildings also requested a survey of the Tuberculosis Hospital grounds which is located in Frank's addition to Kearney, which is a suburban addition, without regularity, and without permanent monuments and very little to indicate the survey, excepting the position of growing trees and old driveways. A considerable portion of the ground had been cultivated for a number of years and the monuments which were principally small wooden stakes had been cut off by </seg>
            <seg id="p068">68 the plows, so that the decayed points had to be found in th original earth beneath the cultivated soil. The official plat gav but few angles, or the curvature of the avenues or driveways so that it was mostly a matter of search for original monuments of survey; however, good progress was made, but on accoun of the prospect of the state acquiring more land within th addition, the survey was adjourned after three days work, o five days for the round trip. There was no per diem charge Preliminary to making this survey it was necessary to fine the section line or the south boundary of section 34, which was the base from which the addition was surveyed. The southeas corner of the section had evidently been destroyed by the tai race of the Kearney Power Canal. The j-section corner on th south side and the southwest corner of the section were claime( to be marked by large stone monuments, but they were covere&lt; over by the road grade, so that search had to be made, governs largely by the adjacent improvements which did not agree wit their supposed location. By removing the grade at the S. W corner of the section a small white stone weighing about a ha pound was found near the location of the decayed point of th original post. The original witness pits were also found, eas west and north of the post, although the location had bee traveled over for many years before being covered over by th grade. The corner was perpetuated by driving a heavy iro pipe and a hole dug two or more feet deep around it and fille&lt; with concrete. This corner is the southeast corner of the ground of the Boys' Industrial School, belonging to the state. The \ section corner, a half mile east, was also found and identified under similar conditions and perpetuated by setting a large iron pipe in a concrete base, deep in the ground. In all of my calls to survey lands belonging to the state institutions, I have found their boundaries difficult to define the monuments generally of a perishable nature and difficult to identify; I would, therefore, suggest and advise that the neces sary steps be taken to survey the grounds of all the state in stitutions by the state surveyor during the next biennium an&lt; erect durable and conspicuous monuments, and a complete record of survey made. If made by the state surveyor there would be no per diem charges. Should the office deem it neces sary to make a per diem charge the money would flow back to </seg>
            <seg id="p069">69 the general fund as fees collected. Therefore, the only rea expense would be the surveyors necessary expenses, pay o assistants, and cost of material for corners. This office has often been requested to make resurveys ir the sand hill region, where the surface indications of the corner have become obliterated, but before doing so refer the partie - to the General Land Office for relief, as a resurvey by the govern ment would be on an extended scale and paid for by governmen appropriations and would thus save the settlers a heavy expense It has been our experience for many years that under equa conditions of the original surveys it is much easier to find origina corners made in the sand hill country thirty, forty or fifty year ago, than in the clay country where the land is now worth $1(X to $150 per acre, and all of the deputies prefer assignments o applications for surveys in the sand hill country. In the matter of resurveys this department has steadilj adhered to the rule that the first important step to be taken i to find the original corners and to insist upon a rigid inquir&gt; of the knowledge of such corners and upon a thorough and care - ful investigation of the physical evidences of their existence It is not regarded sufficient for an interested person, or a witness to claim the existence of a corner at a certain place, but a thoroug examination of the ground must follow to discover the evidenc of its alleged existence before the deputy can form an opinio of its character and be able to certify as to its identity. Th deputy in making up his notes for record in the office is require* to describe in detail what he finds, the methods pursued in makin his survey, and his conclusions. A History of Some Surveys In my report of 1910 I gave a somewhat detailed statement of an examination of the 5th Guide Meridian through Dundv County, where I assisted the government for forty days to dis - cover the original line, the difficulties encountered, the falsifica - tion of a remeasurement by R. B. Keyes and Geo. W. Fairfield deputy surveyors in 1872, of the west nine and a half miles ol the Nebraska-Kansas line, run in 1859, and the south si&gt; miles of the Nebraska-Kansas line, run in 1869, of the finding of three original corneis on the Guide Meridian, which enablec us to prorate the measurement for the reestablishment of tht </seg>
            <seg id="p070">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 70 corner of Townships 1 and 2 North, and of the restoration of the north eighteen miles, and that the south six miles, or the line through Township 1 North, was left for me to resurvey. In May, 1911, I returned to Haigler and resurveyed the above six miles, making use of the three government corners previously found. I had an order from Mr. N. B. Sweitzer, Assistant Supervisor of U. S. Surveys, for the necessary iron corners. I was unable to find any three inch posts and therefore had to perpetuate the section corners with the two inch iron posts. I was appointed U. S. Transitman, so that the complete notes of the entire Meridian could be returned to Washington and finally become a part of the records of this office as part of the records of U. S. Surveys. Recently I have been requested to replace the two inch iron posts with three inch posts, so that the posts of all section corners will be uniform. Application No. 89 was for an examination and resurvey of the line between Townships 22 and 23 North, Ranges 54 and 55 West, near Scotts Bluffs. In this case it was claimed there were two township lines about sixty rods apart. I had known of this dispute since 1894, and during the interval, land became very valuable, litigation ensued, and the U. S. Reclamation Service had attempted an adjustment of the difficulty when an appeal was made to this office. I went to Scotts Bluffs to make the examination June 12, 1911, but was stricken with heat prostra - tion, and after a week under medical care, I called Deputy Simmons, who had just completed work in Keith County, to take charge of the field work, who after an examination of the two lines and of adjacent lines on the north and south, reported the finding of corners on the south line that practically agreed in topography, description of corners, and of finding the remains of the lower end of red cedar stakes in the southeast pits at section corners, as described in the government notes, and of his findings in favor of the south line. After a review of his examination and of the maps of the first Reclamation Service engineers, together with the findings of the later engineers, and of the early county surveyors, this office came to the conclusion that the south line was the line actually established by the government surveyor, and that the north line was either made by locators, or by Geo. W. Fairfield, the subdividing deputy of Townships 22 and 23 North, Range 54 West, and W. E. Hardin, </seg>
            <seg id="p071">71 DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING the subdividing deputy of Township 22 North, Range 55 West who had no authority to rerun township lines, excepting unde certain conditions, and their notes under oath made a part o their returns, which was never done. The findings of the sur veyor were reported to the applicants; later Deputy Simmons received instructions to return to Scotts Bluffs and perpetuat all the original corners found on the south line with durabl monuments, and to restore all corners not found by prorat measurement and perpetuate them in the same manner. Applications Nos. 131 and 133 were filed by the authorities of McPherson and Grant Counties for a survey of the west boundary of their respective counties, which is the 25 degree of West Longitude from Washington, D. C. Confusion had existed since 1895, when a bill passed by th legislature undertook to make the 5th Guide Meridian or lin between Ranges 40 and 41 West, the line between these counties and old Deuel County, in violation of the state constitution am supreme court decisions, which expressly declare that the lin between counties cannot be changed without first having th proposition submitted to the electors of both counties an&lt; receiving a majority vote at the election when submitted, whic was never done. The west boundary of Keith County had presumably been run on said degree of Longitude, but the in formation received as to how it had been established, was so meager and indefinite that it was concluded to begin a Tru Meridian at the northeast corner of Colorado, by observation on Polaris, and run the same north a blank line checked b observations to an intersection with the 4th Standard Paralle and there establish the S. W. corner of McPherson County from which point the line was continued north to the 5th Stam ard Parallel, checked every few miles by Polaris observation and at its intersection with each of the section lines a concret monument, with eight inch base and six inch top by 3 to 4 fee long, owing to the character of the ground, was erected, market with the number of the mile on the south side "McPherso County" on the east, and "Garden County" on the west sides From the monument erected on the 5th Standard Parallel common to both counties, the line was continued north in the same manner eighteen miles to the line between Townships 23 and 24 North, which is the north boundary of Grant County.

            <seg id="p072">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 72 Office at Washington, D. C, has been engaged for the last five years in resurveying many townships in the sand hill country of northwest Nebraska, where the original corners have become so obliterated that it would require an expert surveyor to find them, after much hard labor and great cost to parties seeking to make entries. These surveys are made in harmony with the law governing the restoration of lost and obliterated corners of the public surveys by proportionate measurement, which gives to 2ach section of the township its proportionate share of the excess or deficiency shown in the measurement of the resurvey, thus enabling the entryman to file on the same numbered tract that he would have done under the original survey, thus avoiding the confusion, uncertainty and litigation caused by the arbitrary method put in practice about eighteen years ago and abandoned six or seven years later as being contrary to law. Many of the county surveyors of the state have continued :he old arbitrary and illegal method of subdividing sections into ;heir legal subdivisions by running a portion of the lines without attempting to follow the government law for determining the center of sections and quarter sections and of distributing the ?xcess or deficiency in the fractional sections of the township by proportionate measurements. I The legislature should enact a law declaring all such surveys the future absolutely void, without the benefit of the law of litation. kThe supply of the "Circular of Instructions to County eyors," issued by this office in 1903, is long since exhausted, there is a continuous demand for copies by surveyors, attor - and land owners and a second edition should be printed. Additional to the duties of the state surveyor, the legis - ature of 1911 made an appropriation of $2,000 for the purpose )f assisting in the procuring of suitable monuments to mark the Oregon Trail" in the State of Nebraska, and that said monu - nents were to be erected under the supervision of the state sur - veyor of Nebraska, the state regent of the Daughters of the Ymerican Revolution in Nebraska, and the Secretary of the State Historical Society. In the division of the work among the three members of the Commission, the greater portion assigned the state surveyor, iside from field work, has been done outside of regular office tours, so as not to retard the regular office work. </seg>
            <seg id="p073">SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION 73 REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS December 17, 1912 To His Excellency, Chester H. Aldrich, and the Honorable Board of Public Lands and Buildings, Lincoln, Nebraska: Gentlemen: It will be the object of this report to give a brief resume of the entire work covered during this biennium in the way of buildings and repairs at the different state institutions, the scope of which is so large that it is practically impossible for one individual to entirely cover the ground in a satisfactory manner. Had it not been for the earnest co-operation of the members of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, it would have been impossible for me to properly attend to all of the work that has been under way almost the entire time. They have individually looked after certain parts of the field, thus making the inspection more complete and the result has been the erection of all of the buildings contracted for in a very satis - factory manner, and the extensive repairs have been done at a lower cost and in a more substantial manner than has been in the case heretofore. All of the work done in the way of new buildings and repairs to the old buildings will stand the closest scrutiny. Skilled workmen have been employed all of the work contracted, and this in itself has resulted in a saving to the state of a great amount of money in the substantial manner in which all of the repairs and buildings have been done. In the superintending of the repairs and buildings there has been a saving of thousands of dollars to the state in the added value assured, in the insisting that the work be done in a proper manner and according to the plans. Another thing is that practically all of the work has been completed, and that within the time set in the contracts. When one stops to consider that the in - stitutions of this state are situated in fourteen different cities and then considers the great volume of work, including new buildings and repairs under way at one time, and the great amount of traveling and attention in order to be in touch with all of the different phases of the work required strenuous effort, but, fromjthe results which we have obtained, it is evident </seg>
            <seg id="p074">74 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT that we have at least obtained a reasonable showing. I wish again to speak of the exceedingly high standard of the members of the board, and the earnest efforts which they have made to bring to a successful conclusion the work at hand. I shall take up in this report a general review of the work done in each institution. I shall also make certain recommendations under each of these reports, which I consider necessary to the welfare of each individual institution. I have considered all of these matters from a purely economical standpoint, without regard to the opinion of others. I think, however, that anyone who is conversant with the ideas of sanitation, and on the conditions for the utility of buildings will entirely agree with me. There are a great many repairs still necessary in the different institu - tions. The board has not been able to have these done for the lack of funds; however, it is impossible to do all of the neces - sary repairs in one biennium. In some of the institutions there are buildings which are in such a condition of decay, that I con - sider it a waste of money to try to put them in modern condition. These buildings will be referred to later, and I think that it will be found the most economical way to handle them, would be to tear them down, and erect new buildings in their place. It seems to me a shame to put in such a great quantity of money as would be required to put these buildings in the proper shape, when, with a reasonable amount added to the appropriation, new and fireproof buildings could be erected. I think that these matters should be considered from a purely business standpoint, and I feel confident that if these buildings to which I refer, were situated in any city that had comprehensive building laws, that they would be torn down. In making these statements I am not casting any reflections upon the legislature, or past members of the board, because heretofore they have not been in a position to have advice upon these matters, and I think that they have had all they could do to see that the repairs were properly done. There is one item which I consider of vital im - portance to each of our institutions, and that is the proper care of sewage. In towns where a public sewer is not available septic tanks can be used in lieu of same. I think that this should be done in every case, because the cesspool is a source of contamina - tion and never can be made anything else. The board has installed some septic tanks which have given relief from these </seg>
            <seg id="p075">SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION 75 conditions and will always do away with this nuisance. Anothe thing which I consider of great importance is the sanitary con dition of all plumbing. There has been a great quantity of the plumbing remodeled this year, but there still remains a grea deal to do along this line, for wherever the plumbing of an in stitution is not in a sanitary condition, the inmates are con tinually open to disease. I am stating these facts so that you may include them in your report to the legislature, and I hope that they will be lenient in the appropriation for this purpose I find that a great portion of the plumbing in our different in stitutions was put in before the idea of ventilation of plumbing was used generally, therefore, it makes it imperative that every bit of plumbing in any institution which is not properly ven tilated should be so arranged, and at the earliest possible moment State Hospital for the Insane, Norfolk, Nebraska I In this institution the new building which was not finished, been completed and is in use. A new tunnel was installed necting this building to the main tunnel, the heating plant been remodeled and is in first-class condition. There has n a great amount of repairs to the old buildings. A new ice nt has been installed, and some of the plumbing in the old ldings have been remodeled. I think there still remains some mbing that should be replaced with modern fixtures. The mbing generally, however, throughout the institution, with exception of the new building, I found in fairly good con - on. In the new building the entire plumbing was gone over roughly, and reventilated, and the many things necessary complete this building has been done. The old smoke stack &gt; entirely remodeled, and the height of same made sufficient all present needs. The conditions generally about this ;itution were excellent, and there has been entire co-operation ween the superintendent and all concerned in carrying out a successful completion the necessary work here. In the / of new buildings for this institution, I find that they are ch in need of one which would be suitable for amusement poses. Outside of this and general repairs the institution is jxcellent condition. State Hospital for the Insane, Hastings, Nebraska This institution being the largest of its kind in the state, requires a much greater amount of work than is necessary at </seg>
            <seg id="p076">76 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT • he other institutions, however, upon my first inspection, I ound generally speaking, the condition of the repairs in this in- Hitution were excellent, of course it has been necessary to do a :reat deal of remodeling in order to keep pace with the added acilities needed, but this has been done to a great extent by the use of the great number of inmates available for this work. I i/ish here to state that the manner in which the superintendent if this institution has handled this great volume of repair work II a great credit to him, of course this is a large institution and he men available for this sort of work is greater than at any Ither institution, but it also requires considerable ability to l.andle it in the proper manner, and I can safely say that the Itate has saved thousands of dollars through the manner in i/hich Dr. Kern has succeeded. It would make this report to oluminous to give each item separate, so I will just mention «nerally here what has been done. The buildings have been horoughly painted, the bathrooms have been tiled, a great nany changes have been made in the conditions of the different /ards, and wherever repairs were needed to the buildings this as been done. There has also been built in this institution ,600 feet of reinforced concrete tunnel. This is one of the best unnels in the country, and was very much needed. A new lundry building has been completed, and I do not think that here is an institution in the country of this sort that has a 'Uilding as complete and sanitary as this. A number of the ut-buildings have been remodeled and put into condition so I they can be used for different purposes. There is, at this itution, a great need for a proper building for the care of •rcular patients, there is also need for a suitable cottage for care of nurses. A septic tank, to carry away the sewage at institution, is an absolute necessity, and should be installed he earliest possible moment. State Hospital for the Insane, Lincoln, Nebraska The general conditions existing in this institution I found xcellent, although there has been a great amount of repairs one this biennium. The boiler room has been remodeled, new oilers and stokers have been added, the smoke stack has been and made considerable higher, a new top has been ut upon the tunnel, and many other things in the way of general </seg>
            <seg id="p077">77 SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION repairs have been done. Two new buildings have been com - pleted, costing $100,000, but these buildings are not as yet occupied on account of the failure of the last legislature to appropriate the necessary money for equipment. These build - ings are entirely fireproof, and being of reinforced concrete construction, will last for many years without any need of repairs; in fact, they are equal to the very best institution buildings in the country. There are some of the small out-buildings of this institution which should be torn down, as the brick used in the construction of these buildings was shale brick, which has disintegrated so rapidly that the walls have been eaten nearly through in places, they are, however, not large and could be torn down from time to time and replaced with such buildings as might be needed. I find that there is much need of a good substantial barn at the present time. It should be made thor - oughly up-to-date. Of course there are many small items which would come under general repairs, which I will not numerate. The superintendent of this building has co-operated in every way, and has shown marked ability in carrying out to a success - ful conclusion of this work. Soldiers' Home, Grand Island, Nebraska While a great deal has been done to remedy the unsanitary conditions and fixing over as far as possible the old buildings, I wish to state frankly that there still remains a great quantity of work to be done before it will be put in anything like sanitary condition. As the greater part of the inmates of this institu - tion are either sick or infirm, almost the entire institution is given over more or less to hospital work; this must be taken into consideration in preparing the building for their care. One of two things must be done, either all of the buildings should be one story in height, or else suitable elevator service should be maintained to permit these inmates reaching their quarters, which are situated above the first story. A new hospital build - ing was erected this year, which is all on one floor. This is a splendid building, and is very satisfactory for the use, for which it was intended. The main building, however, or portion of same, which is used for administrative purposes, is in a serious condition. I have examined this building carefully with a view to repairing same, but, I have come to the conclusion that the </seg>
            <seg id="p078">78 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT cheapest way in the end would be to tear down this building and erect a new and modern building instead of same. In this building the walls are badly cracked, and they have been fastened together with rods to prevent them from falling down, and the action of the wind has caused the walls to bend at the point of contact with the rods. The plumbing of this entire building is in an extremely bad shape, and should be entirely taken out and replaced. If the building is used at all, it might be possible to take off one story, and that with entire remodeling of the entire structure would put it in condition, so it would be reasonably secure for several years, but in doing this you must consider that so much time and money would be expended, that it would be cheaper to add to it, and give a substantial structure. I would respectfully recommend, however, if this is not done, that the needed repairs ot this building are undertaken, and suitable elevator service installed that will allow these old people whc are scarcely able to go up two or three steps, to be taken to their floors. There is a portion of this building at the present time, that cannot be used for this reason. There is considerable more plumbing in the other buildings that also must be repaired, before they will be anywhere near sanitary conditions. A new laundry building is much needed, as the present one is inadequate to take care of the needs of the institution. New boilers have been installed, a new smoke stack built, stokers added, the heating plant is in good condition, with the exception that some new radiation is badly needed, and I tust that you will not hesitate to recommend to the legislature the appropriation of a sufficient amount to put this institution on at least sanitary basis. The commandant has co-operated in every way and has accomplished a wonderufl amount of work with small means. Soldiers' Home, Milford, Nebraska The general conditions of this institution I found as good as could be expected with the buildings in the condition that they are. The kitchen was remodeled, the heating plant has been remodeled to a certain extent, and is in fairly good con - dition, and some needed repairs have been done in the boiler room, but there still remains a lot of work on the older buildings here, to put them in proper shape. The new dining room ad - dition has been completed. </seg>
            <seg id="p079">SI I'KKVISION OF C'ONSTKl CTION 79 The same condition practically exists here, as dot Grand Island. In regard to the difficulty in taking care of th old and infirm people without elevators to take them to th higher stories. The plumbing in the largest building, which also the oldest building, is in a fearful condition, and it will be practically useless to try to remedy it without the entire plumb ing being removed and remodeled. As a matter of fact, ther is more plumbing in this building than needed, and none of it fit to use. I think, however, that if it was confined to less room and made modern, the results would be very good. The heatin pipes also in this building will have to be gone over, and the&gt; two items in themselves will take considerable money. A elevator should be installed in this building, and the interio thoroughly renovated, and put in proper condition for huma beings to live in. The balance of the building seems to be i fairly good condition, with the exception of some minor repair which are usually needed. The stand pipe has been repaira and a new concrete base added which now makes it perfect! safe. The management is doing everything possible to make pleasant for the inmates, but little or nothing can be done unti these conditions are remedied, especially in the older building I think that in this institution the money should be expended for the items I have mentioned, and I am not aware that ther are any new buildings needed, unless it should be a laundr building. The general condition of this institution is good, but a grea many repairs have been done during this biennium. A grea many of the ceilings have been replaced with steel ceiling, which is a great improvement, and the interior has been thor oughly painted, the wiring has been entirely remodeled, and pu in a safe condition. Some of the plumbing has been replace* and most of it at the present time is in a sanitary condition One of the things which has been done here was the installatio of a septic tank to take care of the sewage. This is an excellen thing, and will do away with the dangers of open sewers and th trouble derived from cesspools. There is, however, some wor to be done to the exterior of these buildings, the mortar in th brick work has disintegrated to such an extent that the moistur goes clear through the walls. We have come to the conclusio Industrial Home, Milford, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p080">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 80 that the best remedy for this would be to cover the entire brick work with a good coat of cement plaster. This will put these buildings in good shape, and they would be suitable for use for many years to come. There are still a few minor repairs to be made, but outside of these items, the institution is in excellent condition, and I wish to commend the ability shown by the superintendent, Miss Ward, in the handling of this work. Institute for Feeble Minded Youths, Beatrice, Nebraska This institution is perhaps one of the most difficult to handle, on account of the typhoid epidemic which extendet over a considerable period. This necessitated the entire re - arranging, and tearing out of a great portion of the water works system, and also the plumbing. A great part of the plumbing however, was in such a condition that it had to be replaced but a great volume of the balance of the work was caused en tirely by the epidemic. The conditions here are much better than they were. New wells have- been driven, and the use o water from the creek entirely abandoned. A great part of the plumbing is not in a sanitary condition, and this will not add to the health of the inmates. The buildings have been repaira and decorated, as far as possible. The low grade buildings have new cement floors, and both rooms and a new dining room addition has been put on this building. The administration building has been repaired as far as was possible under the conditions, and the kitchen has also been very greatly improved. The heating plant is practically new, and new stokers have been added. There still remain considerable repairs to do at this institution before it will be in proper condition. I wish again to speak of the administration building, I still consider it to be in an unsafe condition, and I trust that the board will recommend to the legislature that something be done in reference to this matter. I would recommend anyhow, at least to take off the upper story and the roof, thus reducing the strain upon the walls, which I afterwards found to be hollow; thus, account - ing for the vibrations and cracking of the walls in the wind. I do not believe that it is practical to handle the matter this way, the entire building really should be torn down, but for the present this would put it in at least a safe condition, and would not cost as much money. The very unsatisfactory conditions existing here, due to the epidemic, make it extremely difficult for the board and those concerned to accomplish as much as </seg>
            <seg id="p081">SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION 81 might have been done under normal conditions. I think, how ever, that the money expended here has been well invested, as in the case of every other institution where repairs have been made. The money expended has been used in the very best manner possible, and the state has received full value, as can be demonstrated by inspection at any time. Industrial School for Boys, Kearney, Nebraska This is another institution where through lack of appropria - tion in the past the condition of the buildings were so bad that the amount required to put them in proper shape, was greatly in excess to the amount appropriated. In fact, the amount appropriated for repairs at this institution was not more than one-third as much as was really needed. The condition of the buildings generally have been greatly improved, excepting in regard to sanitation. The plumbing in the entire institution was unfit for use, and was simply a source of disease. This has been replaced with modern fixtures, skilled labor being used, and all of the fixtures have been properly ventilated and arranged so that there will be little trouble from them in the future. The grade buildings have been decorated and remodeled to a certain extent, and the administration building has been thoroughly gone over, the basement cemented, and the kitchen and dairy rooms made sanitary. A new ice refrigerator installed and many other things that were necessary have been accomplished. The heating plant has been entirely remodeled, and stokers added. There is, however, one thing which must be done, and that soon, and that is the building of an entire new tunnel to take care of the heating pipes. The old tunnel has been built for many years, and is twenty feet under ground, part of it has no lining, and where lining occurs it consists of only one layer of brick, which will withstand so little pressure that the slightest cave-in will demolish it and the water pipes. It is not practical to try to utilize this tunnel in any way, as it is so far underground, that it is dangerous to work in it. At any rate the tunnel should be near the surface of the ground, so that it may be available for entrance at any time, and the cost of a new tunnel would be much less than the cost of repairing of the old one. The old shop building has been repaired, a little, but I do not consider this building to be worth spending any money to a great extent, because it is in such an extent of decay, that it can never be made </seg>
            <seg id="p082">82 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT habitable unless as much money is expended upon it, as would build a new structure that would entirely answer its purposes I think that with the means at hand that this board has accom plished a great deal of work at this institution. There are man\ other items which have been completed under the head of repairs which would be useless to mention, but the necessity of th items which I have above mentioned being taken care of soon is imperative, and I trust the board will recommend same. Tubercular Hospital, Kearney, Nebraska I This institution is one of the most important in the State o braska, and I consider that in the purchase of this buildin I grounds the state has saved a great amount of money. Th 7 hospital which has just been completed is one of the fines its kind in the country, and the conditions here are of th t. However, there are a few minor repairs to be made upo old building, but the need for the present is for more room the patients. The present hospital can be extended to ac lodate more patients, and there is great need for an infirm for patients in the last stages of the disease. Additiona ;hen room should be given to take care of the patients, am s imperative that a new laundry should be furnished, am n, because it is impossible to have the work done outside, am laundry should be segregated and built upon extremel itary hospital lines. I might also add that it will be necessar consider a small ice house near the lake, so that ice may be up during the winter for the use of this institution. Gener ' speaking, this institution is in an excellent condition, and 1 1 managed, and for the amount of money expended upon i . great saving to the state. Penitentiary, Lincoln, Nebraska The needs of this institution are great, and although many things have been done during the present year to better con - ditions, the buildings generally are still in the need of a great deal of repairs before this institution can be put in what might be termed a sanitary condition. A new heating plant has been installed, and many repairs needed generally, but the funds available were entirely insufficient to even make a start at the many things to be done. In the first place, I personally consider </seg>
            <seg id="p083">SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION 83 the plumbing to be out of date; this should be gone over en tirely and made sanitary, and up-to-date in every particular The dining room, as we all know, is not in a suitable place, am there should be a new dining room, kitchen and chapel added to this institution. Having visited several of the best prisons in the country, and having made a deep study of the necessities fo the sanitary handling of an institution of this sort, I do not a this time recommend the extending in any way of these ok buildings further, than the adding of the items which I hav mentioned. I believe that an entirely rew intermediate prison should be built in some other portion of the state, if possible locality where material for building can be obtained, and tha the institution should be built along modern lines, such as has been suggested by the Prison association. This, of course, i only my personal view, but it is taken from observations mad at other institutions, and suggestions given by men who an entirely conversant with the handling of prisons. In the firs place, these buildings have been situated upon ground which i entirely too low, and in order to make them so that they wouk always be sanitary, would require a great expenditure of money because during the flood season the water comes in to a con siderable depth. I think that whatever additions should be made ought to be put on higher ground, if possible. Every available effort has been made in doing everything possible t put this institution in better repair, but it is always necessar to have funds with which to work; therefore, I think that every effort should be used in securing the proper amount necessary to make the repairs, and additional rooms built. There ar many minor items which I will not mention. I will say in con elusion that the facilities at this institution are not considers up-to-date, and no matter how excellent the management is, is very difficult to get the results desired with these conditions Industrial School for Girls, Geneva, Nebraska The general condition of this building was found to be good with the exception of a few minor repairs, which have been made during the year. The heating plant has been fixed, a new tunnel was built for the heating pipes, and a new septic tank installed to care for the sewage, which was an extremely difficult thing at this institution, owing to the old cess pool. However, </seg>
            <seg id="p084">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 84 as soon as the septic tank is in working order these conditions will be entirely sanitary. The burning of the barn required un looked for expense at this institution, and outside of this anc the necessary repairs done, things have been accomplished in very satisfactory manner. There are several items of repairs to this institution that are necessary, one of which is the installin of an entirely new refrigerator. The one which is being used a present, is a waste of money, and is not such as is desirable a an institution of this sort. The plumbing generally is in fai shape, although some of it should be replaced. I think that th floors in the kitchen should be made entirely new, as there an old cement floor, and it is not a good thing for a kitchen On account of the crowded condition of this institution it wi be necessary to erect another building at the earliest possibl moment. I believe that this has been already asked for by th superintendent, and I heartily agree with her that it is a necessity The superintendent I found to be very competent, and has shown marked ability in the handling of the many necessary repairs. Orthopedic There are a great many things in the line of repairs at thi institution, although considerable has been done during th present year, including the building of a new tunnel. Thi building is also in the need of a new building, as the facilitie at present are entirely inadequate. Good work is being don here, and as everything connected with this institution is alon hospital lines, there is a great necessity for a liberal allowance for it is necessary to put everything in sanitary condition, believe the new building required will cost in the neighborhoot of $60,000. The Southwestern Agricultural School, Curtis, Nebraska As this institution is a new one and has not as yet been occupied there is very little report to make in connection with the same. I will say that the buildings are all on a very high order, and are a credit to the state. They will also rank among the finest in the country, and will bear the closest of inspection in every regard. This work will, no doubt, be entirely com - pleted very close to the first of the year. . </seg>
            <seg id="p085">SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION 85 The State Capitol, Lincoln, Nebraska There has been considerable repairing done about the pitol building, a great part of which was made necessary by ? lack of room for the state officers. The basement has been lodeled to make room for the State Board of Education. The urance department and the Agricultural department rooms re been fitted up in modern shape, with cement floors, vaults 1 steel ceilings, and in two of the cases with stairways leading the rooms above. Other minor repairs have also been made, luding the painting of the dome, and the decorating of the late chamber, and the House. Nebraska is very much in ■d of a new capitol building, as is generally understood. How - r, if it does not seem favorable to erect an entirely new build- , as room for the library is so much needed at this time, a wing Id be added to the south side, which could be entirely modern svery respect, and this could form a portion of what would ntually be the new capitol building, and could be designed h this in view. It would perhaps cost $300,000. The east g will eventually have to be torn down, on account of the ling on the southeast corner, which is of a serious nature, o not anticipate that there is any immediate danger to the Iding from this. It would require a great expenditure of ley to put this in what might be called modern condition, I have not gone into this matter to any great extent, up to present time. Only the necessary things have been done, heating plant has been put in good condition to take care he present needs. REPORT OF CONSULTING ENGINEER Omaha, Nebraska, December 21, 1912. Board of Public Lands and Buildings, Mr. E. B. Cowles, Chairman, Lincoln, Nebraska: Gentlemen: I have the honor to present to your con - ration a report of the work done by me as consulting engineer mnection with the steam power, heating and electrical plants he various state institutions under your charge. </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT Under a resolution adopted by your honorable body i December, 1911, I was authorized to prepare plans and specifics tions for certain improvements, and superintend the installatio of the same; also to make such tests of boilers, engines and otht equipment as in my judgment were required for determinin the efficiency of the various installations, and instruct in th operation of the various equipments for the purpose of obtainin better service and higher efficiencies. At the time of taking charge of the work there were i process of construction the resetting of, boilers, installation &lt; new boilers and automatic underfeed stokers at the State Pen tentiary, at the Institute for Feeble Minded Youth, at th Soldiers' and Sailors' Home, Burkett, Nebraska, and the Ii dustrial School, Kearney, Nebraska. In order to determine the status of the work then under wa; a preliminary survey was made by me of the work at the Pen tentiary, Lincoln, at Beatrice, at Grand Island, and at Kearne As a result of this, the work was stopped at Kearney an Beatrice, for .the following reasons: At Kearney the stoker installation under the Marine boil would not work on account of insufficiency of draft, owing ( the breeching being too small and being so badly out of repa that air leakage was present to such an extent as to impair tl draft in the furnace; also the combustion chamber of the boil had been reduced to an extent as to make the operation of tl boiler difficult and inefficient. The old boilers were at once put in condition to enab their operation through the winter. Owing to the dilapidated condition in which the plant wsj the incompetency of the men employed to do the firing, and tht questionable willingness to execute orders and follow instru tions, it is rather surprising that any service was rendered at a both at Kearney and Beatrice. It was later decided to replace the Marine boiler by 72"xl6' tubular boiler, making the installation uniform. Plans and specifications were prepared and the entire boil plant was reconstructed. This comprised the installation of two new 72".xl8' tubui boilers, three automatic stokers of the Jones Underfeed typ </seg>
            <seg id="p087">CONSULTING ENGINEER 87 wo new boiler feed pumps and a new system of steam, exhaust ind water piping. The 50 K. W. 220 volt generator and engine was removed rom Kearney and shipped to Beatrice, as per orders of the )oard. The boiler and steam work at Kearney up to the present ias not been accepted by me owing to non-compliance with the pecifications by the contractor. The operation and management of the steam plant at earney is poor, as the plant is left in charge of boys sentenced o the institution, the engineer and his assistant are kept on ther work for the greater part. Under such conditions fuel conomy must become a negligible factor. The heating mains in the tunnels are in questionable con - itions and should be reconstructed and the tunnels should be epaired or a new system of ducts should be installed. Grand Island Two new boilers were installed and one reset at Grand sland and equipped with automatic stokers. A new Breeching nd new steam heater were installed. These two new boilers ook the place of three old and worn out smaller boilers. A new tack was erected, the old stack being of insufficient capacity to arnish the draft for the plant. The piping system in general and steam mains in particular eed reconstruction as leaks exist everywhere, the pipes have ot been properly insulated and have been placed so as to make difficult to repair them. The electric wiring of the main building was condemned eing a serious fire hazard. See my report. Boiler tests were made after equipment with automatic okers, the results of test were forwarded at the time and were ighly satisfactory, giving a high evaporation per pounds of lei and increased boiler capacity. The management of the plant was found satisfactory, lgineers and fireman being diligent and attentive to their ork. State Penitentiary When taking charge of the work two 72"xl8' tubular boilers id one 150 H. P. Marine boiler had been equipped with stokers. </seg>
            <seg id="p088">88 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT Owing to cross drafts and a poor combustion chamber and th tubes being in bad condition on the Marine boiler, it was decide to cut it out, and install a 72"xl8' tubular in its place. Also c account of the importance of the plant furnishing light to th state capitol and other public buildings, it was decided to insts a duplex blower system for draft. There are now five boilers of 150 H. P. each installed, s being operated with automatic stokers. A new steam headi was designed and put in place. Owing to the water containing a large percentage of magnes considerable trouble has been experienced from bagging boile and leaky tubes. During the summer, on account of two boile being out of commission, the boilers were crowded and could n&lt; be taken care of as well as they should. This has caused coi siderable trouble and expense. I made arrangements for tl putting into service of an older heater at the Penitentiary whic when connected, will overcome some of the trouble experienct from bad water. The piping system of the Penitentiary needs a thorouj overhauling and remodeling. An additional boiler feed pun - should be installed and a new breeching should be placed. It is also recommended to change the electric plant. Tl engines are very inefficient and should be replaced by either Corliss engine or a four valve equipment. Switchboard shou be changed from its present location and arranged to run machii in multiple. A synchronizing outfit was ordered for this purpo which has been shipped recently, but has not been installed j far. The electric wiring should be gone over and all wirii placed in accordance with approved methods. Under the conditions the management of the plant is goo The engineer to a great extent is handicapped by the help fu nished him. Beatrice A contract for resetting the boiler plant and equipping with automatic stokers was let to McAlpine of Lincoln. Tv boilers were set and equipped with stokers upon my first inspe tion. The work done was such that I ordered the work stopp - at once. Plans and specifications were prepared at once a» the plant was installed in accordance with them. </seg>
            <seg id="p089">89 CONSULTING ENGINEER The work done at Beatrice is as follows: Reset four boilers, stalled new steam header, rebuilt the entire pipe system in iler and engine room, built new foundation for old engine d dynamo, built new foundation for Kearney engine and nerator, and installed them. Laid new concrete ffoors in boiler house and engine room, ilt new cistern, made required changes in boiler house and H^ne room. Rebuilt approximately eighty feet of pipe tunnel, modeled steam heating mains, steam piping to kitchen, laun - i, etc., and also hot water supply mains and returns. Recon - ucted electrical feeders in tunnels and installed new wiring laundry, overhauled wiring in buildings. The plant installation and boiler setting, as remodeled, are • best of any institution, and the plant should give the highest ciency with intelligent and careful management. The condition of the plant when first visited by me was &gt;lorable and dangerous. As to the management of the plant I decline to comment. Norfolk Insane Asylum II stoker equipment was placed for the three boilers at this ition, the feed piping for boilers and the pump settings changed. On account of surface water entering the boiler plans were prepared for the proper drainage of the building. Boiler tests were made at Norfolk, both with hand firing i when equipped with stokers. Reports of these tests are on with the board. hThe electric wiring at Norfolk should be gone over to some it, especially in the power house. Conditions as to management of the plant are now good. ) Lincoln Insane Asylum a Boiler tests were made at this institution and the results .'good. Plans and specifications were prepared for connecting the buildings with steam, water and sewer system, but on \ I unt of lack of funds the work was deferred. Inspection of I lg of the two new buildings was made and a vacuum cleaning I 'm designed and installed under contract. I The management of the plant is satisfactory, the engineer ? diligent in the performance of his duties. </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT Observations and Recommendations My observations of the modus operandi followed at th various institutions, convinced me that the system of handlin the power and steam end needs considerable improvements, an&lt; unless all the institutions are placed under one permanent heac a chief engineer, with authority to select his own men who sha operate these plants, and empowered to fire anyone for goo and sufficient reason, no lasting result can be expected, competent chief with a good staff under him can save froi 30 to 50 percent of the present annual cost of maintaining tY power plants. The practice of placing the inmates in charge of the boil* plant can hardly be considered good, although I have four that the inmates in so far as the firemen at one institution a concerned, although they are considered feeble minded, we as efficient and diligent and perhaps more so, than the ma hired to direct them. Each institute should be thoroughly inspected once evei three months. The boilers should be inspected regularly ai a complete record kept of each installation and each inspectio A daily log should be kept at each institution. This shou indicate the work done, coal and other supplies used by ea« shift. Amount of coal and other supplies received. Repairs and alterations made and reason therefor A complete record of the performance of the plant, such steam pressure per hour, steam used, and for what purposes. Amount of water used per shift, for which reason a go - pistonmeter should be installed in the boiler feed pipe. Temperature of feed water. A recording draft gauge should be installed at each ! stitution, as well as recording steam pressure gauge. Keep record of voltmeter and ammeter readings, etc. T 1 * will give a complete check upon the work done and also v afford a comparison between the various institutions. Furnace and evaporative tests should be made once evq three months of all the installation to determine the conditidj of coal and plant. Minor repairs should be made by engineer in charge, q </seg>
            <seg id="p091">CONSULTING ENGINEER 91 I i « I &gt;r the purpose of alterations and changes the chief engineer lould have not less than two mechanics in his employ to take ire of the plants. In this manner all repairs would be made i a systematic and proper manner, and the installations would it be butchered up, as is being done by hiring men here and lere to do, in some instances, thousands of dollars of work, who we not the least conception of even the remotest principles volved governing such work. The chief requisite is system, hich today is absent in all the institutions, in so far as the echanical end is concerned. Mechanical Stokers My report would be incomplete without a few remarks as the mechanical stokers which the board had installed during e past year. Some unfavorable criticism has been given them by some rsons in the employ of the state. Such criticism can be only nstrued to either as ignorance of the subject, or else tc their rn inefficiency of management and lack of co-operation. re stokers installed are no doubt a good investment, as easily proven by the test on file with the board. P^ests at the Penitentiary under the most unfavorable con - s gave an evaporation, with Kansas steam slack, of eight Is of water per pound of fuel and enabled us to carry the load three boilers, whereas four boilers would have been neces - •y to do the same amount of work under hand fired conditions. At Grand Island even better results were obtained, the load mg carried with one boiler, whereas under hand firing two d to be used. The results obtained at the insane asylums at Lincoln i Hastings all speak in favor of the mechanical stoker. Tests made at Norfolk under hand fired conditions showed !y 4 1 pounds of water evaporated per pound of fuel, using h priced Illinois lump coal, whereas, after the installation of • stokers 85 pounds of water were evaporated per pound of nsas steam slack. These are matters of record. I would suggest the dismissal of any engineer not producing </seg>
