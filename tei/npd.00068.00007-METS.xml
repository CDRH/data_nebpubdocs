Graham, who passed from this life at 9:15 p. m., June 10, 1929. He died on duty, having done a strenuous day's work and looking forward to the morrow filled with duties. He was honest, conscientious, a tireless worker, practical and sejf-sacrif icing at all times that he might be helpful to others — a true servant of the state and the school interests. His memory and high ideals will live on. </seg>

This report is made for His Excellency,. the Governor of the State of Nebraska, the members of the State Legislature, and the public Whatever success the department has had during the two years is due to the earnest cooperation of the department heads and their able corps cf assistants. The State Superintendent assumes full responsibility for mistakes which the department has made. Any credit really belongs to the directors who have worked for the state unceasingly. The men and women acting as division directors have given unstintingly of their service to the work of their several divisions. The . reports under the division headings represent primarily the best thought of the division directors with the criticism, approval, and suggestions of the State Superintendent himself. Education, its activities, personnel, organization, and administration have come to be one of the most important parts of our everyday life. There is direct relationship between education and wealth. It is abso - lutely impossible for an uneducated nation to be wealthy, to use and enjoy the things that are to be found in everyday use in a nation of educated people. The nations outstanding in their expenditures for edu - cation are the nations outstanding in the accumulation of wealth. Like - wise, the nations outstanding in illiteracy and the lack of attention paid to universal education are the nations of low economic wealth at the present time. Public opinion is moving towards a realization that the field of educational obligation to the rising generation is soon to be as large as the whole range of human activity and interest. With this en - larged concepton of the obligation of the state for the education of its youth and for the education of its citizens in general should, be mentioned the advances being made in the direction of the develop - ment of scientific technics in all phases of educational work. Public opinion is the force that is relentlessly demanding more and greater advancement and development in the field of education. Out of an enlightened public opinion come the demands for new buildings, more skillful staffs of teachers, greater educational expenditures and </seg>
            <seg id="p008">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT educational advancement in general. The very life of a democracy de - pends upon the universal and equitable education of each generation of youths as they come upon the scene of action. The State of Nebraska, as will be seen elsewhere in this report, is giving generous support to her schools. We urge all state officials to study the facts given in this report We are making an effort in the report to give a fair knowledge, a sort of bird's-eye view, as it were, of the field of education here in Nebraska. Normal Training For twenty-three years the State of Nebraska has been thoroughly committed to the program of high school normal training as a source, of supply of teachers for the rural schools. A. goodly percentage of the outstanding teachers of elementary grades in the city schools of Ne - braska are high school normal training students who started their teaching experience in the rural schools. Few people realize the large turnover of teachers in the Nebraska rural schools each year. From very accurate and careful studies in this office, it has been found that approximately two thousand new teachers are needed for the rural schools of Nebraska annually. The collegiate training institutions of the state have never in the past, and are not now in the present, turning out more than a very small percentage of teachers who can or will go into the rural school districts. The State Department of Public Instruction at the present time, therefore, is thoroughly committed to the need of continuing the work of high school normal training as an educational procedure, primarily for the benefit of Nebraska's one-room rural schools. Until such time as the institutions of higher learning reorganize and point their work as well as their faculty mind— at least partly, towards the preparation of teachers for rural schools it will be necessary, if we are to have teachers with any kind of training at all, for the normal training high schools to continue doing this work. This must not be con - sidered in any way a criticism of the management of the state institu - tions of higher learning. Their neglect to prepare teachers for the rural schools may be exactly the right policy for them. We are not interested in that discussion here. To be sure, there is somewhat of a surplus of teachers holding the Third Grade Elementary Certificate, but the turn-over is so great every year and the withdrawal from the profession of teaching so large that it would be a very short time until our rural schools would be suffering for. trained teachers were the present program withdrawn. The normal training high schools are meeting this situation now. For more detailed facts and information supporting the argument for normal training, wo ask you to refer to the Division of Secondary Education and Teacher Training, found elsewhere in this report. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Adult Immigrant Education Adult immigrant education activities have now been m operation for something less than three years. The adult immigrant education problem is a part of the general problem of illiteracy which is receiv - ing so much attention at the present time from government authorities at Washington. For a number of years, Douglas and Lancaster counties — being the largest counties m the state from the standpoint of population, were thought to be the chief centers of illiteracy conditions. From the sur - veys and studies made by this office, we are finding another rapidly growing center m the northwest part of the state, due chiefly to con - ditions occasioned by the development of the beet raising industry. During the past two bienniums we have used the largest possible proportion of the appropriation for actual instruction but the funds have been insufficient to meet the situation as it now exists. We find a very definite need for more money to stimulate and encourage this type of work, particularly to render assistance to those parts of the state where illiterate immigrant population is just now establishing itself. A common mistake on the part of superficial optimists is to say that we have no need of this kind. We often hear Nebraska people say that we have no slums m the state comparable to those to be found m ether parts of the country. We have been proud of our standing on the matter of illiteracy. We beg to call to ■ the attention of the "powers that be" that known facts m these lines are of sufficient importance to justify serious attention to this problem at once. ' We wish to express our appreciation of the fine cooperation rendered this department by school boards, school administrators, teachers and public-minded citizens m the field of adult immigrant education work. A little money will go a long way m combating illiteracy m Nebraska. Correlation of Educational Activities A very short survey would show that, there are at least seven or eight important lines of state and federal control of educational activities going on m the state. Each of these lines has its own separate governing board, its own overhead organization and expense. Some day citizens of Nebraska will awaken to the need of correlating these activities more nearly under a central and unifying control. Much over - lapping and contradictional work can be saved on the one hand, and much more definite and systematic progress on the other. What is needed from the standpoint of business efficiency and economy m state education is one centralized board of education having m control and direction all of the state-supported educational agencies m the state. Time. may not yet be ripe for such a movement. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT . Character Education and Scientific Temperance Instruction Very definite progress has been made in the state during the last biennium in the matter of emphasizing character values ■ in the whole lealm of school activities and experiences. Quite a number of the members of the teaching profession are yet inclined to disagree among themselves over the various theories and philosophies of educational procedure, but on the whole, all groups of teachers are responding nicely to the recent law that was passed four years ago, making it the duty of every teacher in the state to emphasize in her teaching and manag - ing of her pupils, common honesty, morality, courtesy, obedience to the laws, respect for the national flag and for the constitution of the United States and of Nebraska, respect for their parents and home, and the dignity and necessity of honest labor. The department has lost no opportunity to further work of this type in all the schools of the state under the mandate of the law. A coarse of study with a supplement was printed and put into the hands of every teacher in the state. Public opinion is wide awake in its de - mand for more attention on the part of the schools to this important matter. The State Superintendent realizes better than anyone else that the Department has accomplished too little in this line. The prob - lem of citizenship training towers like an overpowering need in these present times of disorganization, carrying along as they do ideas of social and economic overturn. Splendid work in character education is being done by organizations independent of the schools, such as: Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls, Citizenship Clubs, Junior Red Cross, Girl Reserves, Knighthood of Youth, Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A., 4-H Clubs and many other fine organi - zations of this type. Sections 6324, 6382, 6385, 6391, 6464, 6577, define the duties of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in providing the state course of study for the schools of the state under the various types of organi - zation. Section 6446, School Laws of Nebraska, reads as follows: "Provision shall be made by the proper local school authori - ties for instructing the pupils in all schools supported by public money or under state control, in physiology and hygiene with spe - cial reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks and other stimu - lants and narcotics upon the human system." Further attention is called to chapter 85, Session Laws of 1927, which reads: ' Section 1. "It shall be the duty of each and every teacher em - ployed to give instruction in the regular course of the first twelve grades of any public, private, parochial or denominational school in the State of Nebraska to so arrange and present his or her in- </seg>
            <seg id="p011">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION struction as to give special emphasis to common honesty, morality, courtesy, obedience to law, respect for the National Flag, the Con - stitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State of . Nebraska, respect for parents and the home, the dignity and neces - sity of honest labor and other lessons of a steadying influence, which tend to promote and develop an upright and desirable citi - zenry." Section 2. "For the purpose of this act the State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction shall prepare by September 1, 1927, an outline with suggestions such as in his judgment will best ac - complish the purpose set forth in section one, and shall incorporate the same in the regular course of study for the first twelve grades of all schools of the State of Nebraska." A careful study of the sections above cited will lead one to the following very definite conclusions: First, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction shall provide a course of study; Second, special at - tention shall be given to the teaching of the harmful effects of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics upon the human system. A questionnaire sent out by this office to the county superintendents of Nebraska revealed the following facts: First, that little or no in - struction on the subject of alcoholic beverages and other narcotics was . being given beyond the material found in the basic textbook used; Second, that most of the textbooks used in Nebraska give very little material on this subject; Third, the majority of the county superin - tendents feel that the teachers need additional material to help them in properly presenting this phase of the work. Fifty-four of the ninety - three county superintendents definitely asked that this department offer additional material and teacher helps on the harmful effects of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and drugs. As a result of this questionnaire, this department has conducted a search for material to be put into the teachers' hands to better enable them to vitalize instruction on this important topic. Our first inquiry was directed to the American Medical Association believing it to be the proper source from which this material should come. As a result, some very fine articles based on medical research are included in the bibliography, of this section. However, it is felt that the average teacher will have difficulty in securing this material and making it available for the pupils' use. Some of the other material found in the course might be questioned as coming from prejudiced sources, but the material quoted and the bibliography referred to are substantiated by the writings in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Material from' these so-called prejudiced sources is used without apology. It is most natural that such organizations should have the material that is best available at the lowest cost. It is our conviction that the material used is supported by scientific facts and is offered in our effort to "obey the laws of the State of Nebraska as we interpret them. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT We have a feeling that the health education objective should be second to none, and that the harmful effects of alcoholic stimulants, tobacco, and drugs should find a very important place m the course of study. The enactment of the 18th Amendment has not lessened the need for special emphasis m this regard. The schools of yesterday pro - duced the people who made this amendment possible. The schools of today and tomorrow must produce men and women who will create a universal public consciousness for its observance. The Professional Code of Nebraska Teachers This office is very happy to endorse and include herein a statement of "The Professional Code for Nebraska Teachers" as prepared by the Nebraska State Teachers' Association. We, the Teachers of Nebraska, realizing the value of an expression of professional ideals m terms of conduct, accept and adopt the follow - ing code as a guide m our contacts with others and among ourselves: I. With the Pupils the Professional Teacher Will: ■■ 1. Recognize that his first obligation is to develop each individual pupil to the fullest extent of that pupil's possibilities; 2. Take cognizance that development of character is more important than mental attainment; . 3. Endeavor to keep physically and morally fit, and to cultivate the virtues of sympathy, patience, justice, integrity, and serenity, recognizing that only by so doing can he render fullest service to the child. 11. With Patrons the Professional Teacher Will: .1. Recognize that teaching is made most effective by securing a close cooperation of home and school; 2. Welcome them with courtesy, treat them with consideration and candor and hold m confidence all personal information concern - ing pupils. 111. With Employer the Professional Teacher Will: 1. Leave- a position during the term of any contract only upon full release by the employer; 2. Expect sufficient compensation to provide at all times a satisfac - tory standard of living; to permit continued professional im - provement; and to make possible adequate savings for the years of retirement 3. Fulfill his contract for the best interests of the pupils, the pro - fession, and m keeping with the best educational ideals. IV. With Associates the Professional Teacher Will: 1. Seek, through cooperative effort, the realization of those educa - tional ideals not attainable through individually directed effort; 2. Recognize that true cooperation between class room teachers and administrator is founded upon respect and sympathy for each other's viewpoints; the class room teacher acknowledges admin- </seg>
            <seg id="p013">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION istration rights to leadership m school policies; the administra - tor recognizes the teacher's right to self-expression and to de - mocracy m school procedure; 3. Welcome constructive criticism and refrain from criticizing ad - versely predecessors and colleagues; 4. Seek to broaden and to deepen his educational equipment through systematic reading, study, and active membership m local, state and national teachers' organizations. V. With the Community the Professional Teacher Will: 1. Identify himself with those social, professional and civic activi - ties which the best public opinion supports; 2. So conduct himself m all his relations! to the public as to foster and increase the feeling of respect for the teaching profession. (Approved by Delegate Assembly of N. S. T. A. Dec. 7, 1929) Physical Education and Health There is a crying need for a state-wide health program. Public sentiment of the state is ready and waiting for such a program to be put on. Money is lacking, however, to provide personnel for this im - portant phase of our curricular program. Many organizations and societies are wide awake to the need of health training and health preservation. It is to be hoped that soon the State of Nebraska will be able to see the wisdom of providing for a unified state-wide pro - gram of health, including that of mental hygiene. Educators and laymen throughout the United States were astounded when, following the World War, statistics were published which re - vealed that 35 per cent of the men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-one, who were called to service, were found to be physically unfit. These statistics seemed so appalling to Newton D. Baker, then Secretary of War, that he called m the Honorable P. P. Claxton, the United States Commissioner of Education, and asked him whether or not the statistics constituted an indictment of the public school system of the United States. Secretary Baker maintained that physical "illit - eracy constituted as great a menace to the welfare of the country as would mental illiteracy. Certainly no one will contend that the respon - sibility for all of the physical defects which were found among the sev - eral million men who were examined, must be charged against the public schools. The fact that "round shoulders and contracted chests are rarely found m children of pre-school age" apparently justifies the laymen m charging the public schools with the responsibility for many of the physical defects which are found m adults today. As a nation we are committed to a program of peace. But the fact remains that, while there are hopeful signs, the time has not yet arrived when nations may safely discard all thoughts of war. There can be no reasonable doubt m the minds of any thinking person, that the' nations </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT "program for peace" is moving forward and moving apace. We shall all welcome the day when "nations shall war no more." President Her - bert Hoover and those associated with him are most certainly worthy of the nation's highest praise for their sane and constructive plan for more certainly guaranteeing the "peace of the nations for the ages to come." A strong program of physical education does appeal to intelligent citizens and to organizations who believe in preparedness, but a real program of physical education in the public schools can be defended upon other grounds than that of making men physically fit in order that they may die for their country. If it is worthwhile to develop a race of men fit to die upon the battle field, is it not much more worth - while to make them physically fit in order that they may follow arduous peace-time pursuits and in the truest sense of the word live for their country ? Thirty-five states representing 90 per cent of the population have enacted state laws setting up physical education programs. In many of these states schools are required by law to devote not less than thirty minutes per day to the physical education program and in some states the time has been fixed at one hour per day. President Hoover has conducted the first national conference on child health to be held in this country since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. He said in calling for the conference, "The ideal to which we should strive is that there shall be no child in America who has not the complete birthright of a sound mind and a sound body, and the en - couragement to express in the fullest measure the spirit within, which is the final endowment of any human being." The State Department of Public Instruction has already prepared and hopes soon to have ready for distribution a state manual of physical education. This manual will represent but a beginning and should fur - nish a basis for the development of a more scientific program of physi - cal education in Nebraska. Cooperative Enterprises There exist in Nebraska today large numbers of fraternal organ - izations and clubs that are interested in civic life and in civic betterment. Nearly all of these groups have a definite interest in education. Few people have yet dreamed of the possibilities that could be realized for the improvement of education in general if these organizations could be harmonized and correlated with the work of the schools throughout the state. They are all to be congratulated and encouraged for their interest in education. The State Superintendent in addressing the Delegate Assembly of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association in December, 1929, spoke in part as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p015">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The educational program demands a cooperative endeavor of both the taxpayer, and those who are paid by the taxpayers. As educational administrators and teachers we must not disregard the expressed sen - timents of those whom we serve, and those who represent the lay mind of the community. It is thus that any substantial progress will be forthcoming. President Glenn Frank has expressed it after this manner: "First, he is a taxpayer, and as a stockholder in a vast en - terprise which requires millions of dollars, he is naturally inter - ested in the efficiency of the enterprise. "Second, he is a parent. He has a right to ask whether the schools are training his sons and daughters for a static world which no longer exists, or for a changing world in which their for - tunes will be cast. "Third, he is a business or professional man, and has the right to ask whether the schools are turning out young men and young women who will help or handicap the various business ac - tivities and professions. "Fourth,, he is a patriot, and has a right to ask whether the schools are graduating young men and women who will make the country better or worse .because of their participation in its affairs." We recognize and hold in high esteem the various, units of educa - tional administration, supervision and teaching — meaning- by this the elementary, secondary and higher schools of our commonwealth. "We are not unmindful of the fact that we must work with and through these various units as they actually exist, not forgetting that even here change is inevitable and that while we hope for and expect a better synchronization, we must not let our educational idealism or professional zeal and our enthusiasm for these new conditions get too far ahead of what not only we as professional leaders hut what the lay mind also might call practical common sense. This means, of course, that first things must come first. If the teaching profession is to occupy the place in society that it rightly deserves it must continue to give proof of the fact that it is working, first, last and always in the interests of boys and girls, the young men and young women whom we would in - struct and inspire, forgetting our purely selfish interests as members of the profession. Those outside of the profession will follow' our lead - ership much more quickly and much more certainly if they are con - vinced that we are engaged in a single, common task and that we have no ulterior motives or purposes as such. Close adherence to these two types of cooperative endeavor will, we believe, serve the best interests of the profession. Rural Schools and Rural Parent-Teacher Associations During the present biennium the department has done everything it could in cooperating with the state and national group of parents and </seg>
            <seg id="p016">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT teachers to promote rural parent-teacher association work. A more specific report of this phase will be found later on in the Division of fiural Education. It is our belief that the schools of any community mil rise no higher than the public opinion of the community demands. There seem to be abroad three or four erroneous ideas with regard to rural education. First, there seems to be some sort of an idea that rural people are inferior to urban and city folks. Even the rural people sometimes appear to have developed an inferiority complex. Second, the idea seems to prevail that rural life is lacking in rich - ness, pleasure, profit and social values; that the rural people are totally unable to help solve even their own problems; and that somehow the poor degraded ruralist must be uplifted by a race of overwise superior beings living, of course, in the towns and cities. Third, that the ruralist is a sort of social and economic outcast who is not even vitally interested in his own welfare. And, finally, that the rural schools are uniformly inferior as com - pared with the schools of the urban and .city centers. Rural life, because of its universality and geographical spread, is naturally much less coherent and self-conscious than any other section of American life. It should not be considered as separate and apart from urban and city life, but really as an important part of, or closely related to, the rest of the body politic. That the rura) regions have always been a huge reservoir of labor, industry, genius and talent from which business and commerce have recruited many of their brightest minds should be common knowledge to all. Every city in the land, every industry is honeycombed with posts manned by individuals who have had their beginnings, their education and their character formation in the rural regions of the country. A very superficial observation of actual rural conditions in any part of the big state of Nebraska will show convincing proofs ef a rural status of living, rich in all sorts of social, economic and cultural values. It is most unfortunate that a state of mind has come into existence, apparently common to many classes of society, that places the ruralist with his problems separate and apart from other groups of our social and economic life. Instead of this, the ruralist should be thought of not as an individual, separate 1 and apart from the rest of the com - munity, but as an important part of the whole group with all his interests closely tied in ar.ri related to the interests of the other sub - :•■ : s : .ons of the whole. •ihc rura) school along with other so-called rural problems has suffered in the development of this state of mind. That many deplor- </seg>
            <seg id="p017">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ably weak rural schools are to be found in the country today no one ' will deny; but it would be difficult to find rural schools any place worse ! than can be found in almost any city of the land. Urban and city ! schools have often assumed vast superiority as compared with rural schools. On the other hand, large numbers of rural schools can be found equal to the best that any city can produce. The large number of i fine, up-to-date rural school buildings now coming into existence are eloquent proof of that statement. The predominant factor in any situation is the teaching element. Given a finely trained, conscientious and enthusiastic teacher, whether she is working in a one-room sanitary wooden schoolhouse or in some of the marble palaces of the city, you will find the results in the lives and the characters of the young - sters to be approximately equal. Nebraska is recognizing the import - ance of superior rural school teaching by presenting standards for better school teaching and awarding recognition cards to those teachers who show outstanding merit in the rural field. There has undoubtedly developed- in the last twenty-five years a tendency to judge the value and worth of schools by the large salaries of the administrative officers and by the material out of which the buildings are built rather than by that fine and delicately poised relationship that exists between the individual teacher and her little family of boys and girls. Some of these times the rural mind is going to rebel and cast off this inferiority complex regarding rural schools and rural life in general and assert itself in politics, in business and industry, as well as in education. Agriculture, and that means rural life, is and always will be the basic industry upon which all the prosperity of this country rests. Self-consciousness and self-assertiveness of the rural mind when once aroused will speedily put to rout the economic and business vul - tures of the country who may be, seemingly, perfectly willing to strangle the life out of any industry, agriculture included, in order to reap profit and larger dividends on money invested in stocks and bonds. If our hypothesis, that the standard of the American school is based upon and has grown out of public opinion, has any merit, then the best way to improve schools is to cultivate, promote and vitalize public opinion relative to the schools in any particular community. The rural school is no exception to this principle. It is the judgment of this department that the organization of rural Parent-Teacher Asso - ciations, officered and manned by the rural people themselves, is the proper place to begin to work for the betterment of the rural schools, in so far as they need betterment. We often hear of "the rural school problem." It is to be doubted whether or not there is any one rural school problem separate and apart from other school problems. Here, again, we have the inferiority complex at work. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Proper stimulation of public opinion related to rural schools within the rural districts themselves will ultimately prove the solution of whatever rural school problem may exist. This is the procedure that has always worked in the city schools, and there is no reason why it will not work with equal success in the. rural districts. State Institutions of Higher Learning Nebraska has been confronted with an unprecedented growth in her state-supported institutions of higher education. These, include the Uni - versity of Nebraska and the four state teachers' colleges situated at Peru, Kearney, Chadron, and Wayne. Additions to the physical plants are sorely needed at all of these points but the predominant need is additional money with which to hold outstanding faculty men who have already made their reputation in Nebraska and to provide for the enlargement of the teaching personnel of these institutions. Unless these institutions receive larger appropriations soon we will be facing a period not only of educational inadequacy but of lowered quality in instruction and the products of scholarship. Child Welfare We mentioned above the department's attitude with regard to the organization of Parent-Teacher Associations. Briefly speaking, the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, whether city or rural in its application, is built around the idea of child welfare. The child - hood of the nation must be conserved, preserved, protected and edu' cated if future generations are going to do for humanity what we have a right to expect of them. Each generation of children begins exactly at zero so far as education is concerned. The only chance for improvement of the race lies in our ability to make each succeeding generation better than the one preceding. The problem of education is not only to educate each generation as well as the one preceding, but in addition to this, its main concern must be to make in each generation as much progress as possible over and above the accomplishments of the generation before. Of what use to the nation is the acquisition of unlimited wealth, political power, and prestige unless each generation of citizens comes to its task with the intellectual training and character to properly deal with the problems of its time? Equalization of Educational Opportunity The philosophy underlying the thought of free universal public school education is fundamentally an attempt to equalize educational opportunities for all the boys and girls of a given state, regardless of their race, color, creed, social position, or economic standing. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION In other words, equalization of educational opportunity is not a new idea. It runs with a thread of continuity through the whole scheme of public education. It is possible that complete equalization of educa - tional opportunity will never be realized by any state. Numbers of the states are, and have been for several years past, giving serious con - sideration to this humane and democratic aim as a public school measure. Our state has been recognizing this principle ever since the beginning of its history through the handling of the state apportionment funds and state aid to weak districts. (See chapter on state aid to weak districts.) We have school districts in the state where the assessed valuation of the whole district is wholly insufficient to provide the proper educa - tional advantages for the boys and girls resident in the district. Prop - erty values in the state according to the tax records do not parallel school population centers. It is nothing uncommon to find a school district with a very large valuation of property per school child, side bv side with another school district having a very small valuation per school child. This office is thoroughly committed to the need of some form of equalization for the benefit of society as a whole We believe that society as a whole can best protect itself by paying attention to the needs of boys and girls living in such locations. Our notion is that some plan of a state-wide tax on all property in the state as a whole, to be dis - tributed back to the individual school districts by a legislative formula, would help in a large measure to remedy this situation. Such a plan would not necessarily mean any raising of the general levy of taxation. The inequality and unfairness of the present scheme of taxation are apparent to all. Farm lands, our homes, and the merchants' goods on the shelf carry an unjust proportion of the tax burden. There is, on the other hand, evidence to show that we have two billions of wealth in Nebraska not now being taxed for the support of any form of govern - mental activities. See page 263 of this report. Undoubtedly, the citizens of the state will be studying the matter of general .taxation in the years immediately before us. Any kind of a scheme of equalization of school opportunity is closely tied into the general system of state taxation. Personnel The personnel organization of the Department of Public Instruc - tion is given on one of the front pages of the report. We have pur - posely included in this biennial report activities by other state agencies than those in the department itself for the reason that the State Super - intendent of Public Instruction is ex-officio a member of the State Nor - mal Board, is secretary and executive officer of the State Board for vocational Education, and is an ex-officio member of the State Library •....rr.r.-.Sssion. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The State Superintendent of Public Instruction feels that in these ex-offieio capacities he has a measure of responsibility to the people for these activities even though he does not have direct control in them. The State Superintendent has no direct responsibility with regard to the administration of the University of Nebraska but wishes to assume an attitude of helpfulness wherever possible toward that great institution. Legislative Appropriation for the State Department of Public Instruction We would call attention of the Governor and the legislature to the fact that a small percentage of the total amount of money appropriated for this department is used for this department, itself, in the conduct of its own work. By far the larger amount of the money appropriated is for state aid and distribution to the schools of the state in various fields, and not for the use of the office itself. We speak of this matteT for the reason that reported appropriations might create a wrong im - pression that all of this money was being used by the office itself. As a matter of fact, the office has far more calls for service to the public than the office can give. We need an enlarged personnel to make the office as efficient as it should be from the standpoint of the public interest and demand. Church Schools The Department wishes to acknowledge the splendid cooperation given by the officials in charge of private and church schools during the biennium. It is the purpose of the Department to render every assistance pos - sible to private and church school officials in making their schools the best of the kind that can be made, whether they be of elementary, sec - ondary or collegiate rank. In the Nebraska Educational Directory, published by the State De - partment of Public Instruction each year, is found a tabulated report showing the accreditment, grades taught, number of teachers, pupils, daily attendance and other information, concerning the church schools of elementary and secondary rank. This directory also includes a list of the denominational colleges. The Dignity and Democracy of Labor It is just possible that many parents in the past have been ambi - tious for their children to have the opportunities of an education in order that the children might not have to work as hard as the parents have worked. The Department of Public Instruction does not take that attitude toward the whole problem of education. In a democracy like ours, the whole mass of people should be trained and educated for useful work and service to the social group as a whole. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AW of the material on curriculum and management that goes irom this office will be predicated upon this purpose of education — not . to train the rising generation away from work, but to train them toward it. Work for everybody, with a high standard of living; but industry, work, and a busy life are the greatest blessings that can happen to any man or woman. Supreme Court Decisions A number of important decisions have been handed down by the State Supreme Court on school problems. Without exception these decisions have been given from the standpoint of harmony with existing Jaws and the welfare of schools in general. One particular decision stands out in bold background as an epochal decision in denning the scope, purpose, and obligation of the public school system as a whole. The Supreme Court was unanimous. We quote from Case No. 26026: "The school system of our state recognizes the vitally impor - tant fact that education is for all persons within such school age as has been fixed by the legislature. Obviously this priceless boon cannot be regulated by the number of pupils who may attend the district school. And if by chance there should be but one pupil • of school age in any school district of this state, that pupil is en - titled to the benefit of the school privileges which the law guaran - tees for the education of all the school children of the state." We doubt if a more comprehensive statement could be made de - fining the duties and obligations of the state in the education of its youth. State Superintendent Confronted by a Lawsuit Attorney P. F. O'Gara of Hartington, Nebraska, has instituted an action in the District Court of Lancaster county in behalf of his client, School District Number Six of Cedar county, Plaintiff, against the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Defendant. This case raises the question of whether or not this office has exceeded its authority in refusing to grant approval to collect free high school tuition and the right to share in the State Apportionment to School District Number Six. This case will, no doubt, be brought to trialin the early months of the year 1931. The essential facts are as follows: Approval Refused for In June, 1929, this department refused ap- Collection of Free proval for the collection of free high school ' High School Tuition tuition to District No. 6, Cedar County, other - wise known as St. Boniface school, because of an evident violation of Article VII, Section 11, of the Constitution of Ne - braska, which prohibits giving public funds to educational institutions promoting sectarian religious instruction.

In these newspaper reports, Mr. O'Gara indicated that court action would le token to telt the validity of State Superintendent Taylor's decision. Following is Mr. O'Gara's brief and the answer of the State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction. Mr. O'Gara's brief bears no date but the letter of transmittal is dated December 10, 1929. Mr. O'Gara's Brief ; "In the Matter of School District Number Six ( B rieF in Cedar County, Nebraska. i "Question Involved: Public School District Number Six in Cedar County, Nebraska con - forming with the statute in such cases made and provided, added to the regular course of study above the eighth grade the ninth and tenth grades, in order to give to the children of school age of this and of idjoining districts the benefits of two years of high school work and under the provisions cf House Roll Number 107. Chapter 178 of the Session Laws of Nebraska for the year 1925, have received the high school tuition as therein provided, up to the present time. "Upon a complaint being filed with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in and for the State of Nebraska, allegmg that said School District Number Six is no longer a public school district, that the school taught therein is no longer a public school but a Catholic Parochial school, the county clerk of Cedar County, Nebraska, has been Eucted to withhold the levy of taxes to pay the tuition of non - resident pupils attending this high school in School District Number Six. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION "The questions raised in this issue are, (1) is School District Num - ber Six a public school district, as denned by the law of the State of Nebraska, (2) is the school maintained in said district a public school and (3) has the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, under the facts as are disclosed in this matter, the right and authority to issue the order complained of, and thus deprive this school district of the tuition of non-resident pupils. "History of School District Number Six: ■ ' Nebraska was organized as a territory by act of the Federal Con - gress in the year 1854. Cedar County, Nebraska, was organized as a separate political division of the Territory of Nebraska, in the year 1857 by the Territorial Legislature and School District Number Six of said County was organized as a public school district in the year 1866 and has continued to maintain itself as a public school district in Cedar County, Nebraska, and has maintained and supported by public taxa - tion a public school, as required by law, during all this period of time. School District Number Six is now a public school district and conducts a public school therein. "In support of the contention that School District Number Six in and for Cedar County, Nebraska, is in fact and in law a public school district and maintains a public school in said district, we herewith sub - mit a copy of the record of the proceedings" of the annual public school meeting of said school district for the year 1929, which was held on the 10th day of July, 1929, in conformity with the requirements of law gov - erning said matters, which copy is marked 'Exhibit A' hereto attached and made a part of this brief. "We have thus established the fact, which is beyond dispute, that School District Number Six of Cedar County, Nebraska, is a public school district and that, as such district, a public school is maintained. "Grounds of Complaint: School District Number Six having no public school building, occu - ' pies two rooms in a building owned by the Roman Catholic parish of St. Boniface, and it is therefore alleged, among other things, that the school conducted in this building is in fact a Catholic parochial school Section 6277 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for the year 1922 pro - vides as follows: 'The qualified voters shall also have power at any annual or special meeting to direct the purchasing or leasing of any appro - priate site and the building, hiring or purchasing of a schoolhouse, and the amount necessary to be expended the succeeding year, and to vote a tax on the property of the district for the payment of the same.' School District Number Six, through its proper officers, duly leased from the Catholic parish above named, two rooms in a building in said dis - trict owned by the parish and occupies them for public school purposes. It is provided in said lease that said two rooms are to be used ex - clusively and only for public school purposes. - ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ "In support of the above statement, we herewith attach a copy of said lease, marked 'Exhibit B' and made a part of this brief. "It is further complained that the teachers employed by School District Number Six are women connected and affiliated with the Roman </seg>
            <seg id="p024">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Catholic Sisterhood and for this reason said school is no longer a public school but a Catholic parochial school. "It is true that the two teachers employed in this school are mem- . bers of the Catholic Sisterhood. However, both of these teachers are public school teachers who hold Nebraska Second Grade High School Certificates. In support of this statement, we herewith submit copies of their certificates marked 'Exhibit C hereto attached and made a part of this brief. It also appears that these two teachers were duly hired, as by law provided, by the public school district board of said School Dis - trict Number Six. In support of this statement, we herewith submit a copy of the contract duly entered into between the public school board and the teachers marked 'Exhibit D' hereto attached and made a part of this brief. "It is further contended, as we are informed, by the complainants that these women employed by School District Number Six to teach in this school wear the religious garb of their order and consequently the school must necessarily be a Catholic parochial school. There is nothing in our law to prevent a public school board from employing a person who is a member of the Catholic branch of the Christian church to teach in the public schools of this State any more than the employment of a Methodist, Baptist, Jew, Mohammedan or an unbeliever, and, as a matter of fact, Section 11 of Article VII of the Constitution of the State of Nebraska, among other things, provides that: 'No religious test or qualification shall be required of teacher or student for admission to or continuance in any public school or educational institution supported in whole or in part by public taxation.' As to the Religious Garb Act, we shall refer to that later. "The reports of the high school inspectors who inspected this school indicate that in the two rooms used and occupied for public school pur - poses there is considerable evidence of the religious tone and character of the school, such as statuary and pictures; also calendars which indicate Catholic feast days and holy days. All of these matters as complained of and reported by the state school inspectors, may constitute irregulari - ties but in no way destroy the public school character oi the school or warrant and justify the State Superintendent in withholding the high school tuition. "The part of the building leased and used for public school purposes should not, strictly speaking, bear evidence of a sectarian character and this irregularity, if indulged in, can and should be attended to by the County Superintendent of the public schools of Cedar County, direct - ing and requiring the public school board of said district to remove all such evidence of a sectarian nature. However, none of these alleged irregularities afford a legal ground for the action of the State Superin - tendent. "The reports of the state school inspectors in reference to this mat - ter indicate that nil of the interior decorations of this particular school building are of a refined and cultural character, tending to cultivate a taste for the beautiful, to elevate the thoughts and the minds of the pupils and to impress upon their youthful and tender minds not only love for the beautiful in art, but to inculcate thoughts and sentiments of refinement, virtue and bodily purity which are inseparable from good citizenship. These refined surroundings, which should merit the appro- </seg>
            <seg id="p025">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION bation of every high minded man and woman, seem to be abhorrent and repulsive to the person or persons who made the complaint to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and, while none of these things are, strictly speaking, contrary to law, if they give offense it will be per - fectly proper, as we have above stated, for the County Superintendent of Public Schools of Cedar County to order and require their removal. Their presence as decorations, however, furnish no legal grounds or lawful reason for attempting to withhold from Public School District Number Six of Cedar County, Nebraska, the rights and benefits of the law pertaining to high schools. "Section 11 of Article VII of the Constitution of the State of Ne - braska is as follows: 'No sectarian instruction shall be allowed in any school ov in - stitution supported in whole or in part by the public funds set apart for educational purposes, nor shall the State accept any grant, conveyance, or bequest of money, lands or other property to be used for sectarian purposes. Neither the State Legislature nor any county, city or other public corporation, shall ever make any appropriation from any public fund, or grant any public land in aid of any sectarian or denominational school or college, or any educational institution which is not exclusively owned and con - trolled by the state or a governmental subdivision thereof. No religious test or qualification shall be required of teacher or stu - dent, foradmission to or continuance in any public school or edu - cational institution supported in whole or in part by public tax - ation/ There is nothing in this Section of the Constitution which can in any way be construed to empower and warrant the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in obliterating or destroying a public school district in this State, or denying to a public school district its rights under the State law. As we have heretofore stated, any irregularity occurring in the management, control or operation of the public schools of this State can and should be corrected as by law provided. Our law is ample in this regard by giving the proper officers absolute and complete control over our educational institutions. "Let us put the matter in this way. Let us suppose that the board of education of the public schools of the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, would permit someone to operate a 'speakeasy' or a gambling room in the basement of one of the public school buildings of that city. This would clearly be contrary to law but would not and could not authorize and empower the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to destroy and obliterate the public school district of Lincoln or deny the district its rights under the law. These irregularities and unlawful acts could be stopped but they could not and would not constitute a legal reason to destroy the public school district or to withhold from this district its rights, benefits, and protection of the law. "We believe that we have made ourselves plain upon this matter and that there can be no question as to the soundness of our position. "We now come to the chief and main ground of complaint as to School District Number Six in Cedar County, that is, that the teachers employed by the school board of the public school of this district are members of the Roman Catholic Sisterhood and wear the religious garb while engaged in their public school work. </seg>

            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Function of State We do not believe that it is the function of Superintendent to the State Superintendent to question the con- Interpret Until stitutionality of these statutes. In fact, it is Courts Reverse not even our function to enforce such a law if it is established as constitutional. It is merely our business to "decide disputed points" in these statutes and our de - cision is subject to reversal by the Courts. The religious garb is one of the many contributing factors which indicates the sectarian nature of School District Number Six. The whole set-up and conduct of the school, the name "St. Many Practices Boniface," the ownership of the building, the Indicate Sectarian closing the school for observation of religious Religious Intruction holidays, the textbooks, the program of studies, the decorations on the walls, the proximity to the church and the activities of the Priest in supervising the school are as wholly sectarian as any Roman Catholic parochial school to be found any place in the State of Nebraska. Should Not Expect Th:s office contends that the school violates Public Funds the constitution in giving sectarian instruction, and should, therefore, not receive any public moneys from any part of the state government. This would not only prevent their receiving approval as a high school authorized to collect free high school' tuition, but it would also prevent recognizing them when apportioning the proceeds of the State School Fund. If a majority of any religious sect in one community can, by virtue of the fact that they are in the majority in that community, through the instrumentalities of the ballot box, take possession' of the public school machinery in that district and set up completely a parochial or sectarian school for religious teaching, then a religious majority in any and every other district or community in Nebraska could do the same thing. In such a case, then, what has become of the religious rights and freedom of the minority? Rights of Any This office endeavors to treat all religious Religious Minority sects with toleration and fairness. We would Should Be Respected hp. just as quick to defend a Catholic minority if some other religious sect seemed to be in the majority and were attempting to set up its particular notion of the proper sectarian instruction. It is not our business to argue against the wisdom or constitutionality of any of the Nebraska statutes. It is rather our business to act under them as they are until such time as they might be declared unconstitutional. It is immaterial whether we like them or not. Having in mind our oath of office and the sections of the constitution referred to above, we cannot justify ourselves in allow - ing the free high school tuition funds or the state apportionment to be credited to District Number Six of Cedar County, Nebraska. In your oral argument as well as your brief, the definite suggestion is made that this office should be instrumental in preferring criminal ■ charges against the Roman Catholic nuns teach- This Office Should ing in this school. We are surprised that such Not Be Asked to a suggestion should come from a member of Prosecute Roman their own faith. For centuries the world has Catholic Sisters admired the qualities of womanhood exhibited by these holy women in devoting themselves, body and soul, to lives of labor, sacrifice, mercy and service for the ills and misfortunes of all humanity. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION We would call your attention to the fact that Nebraska Public Schools are governed locally. If these good women are to be prosecuted at the bar of justice it will have to be at the hands of local Cedar County officials who must bear the responsibility of local self-government and law enforcement in that county. So far we have not been able to defi - nitely find out that the local Cedar County officials have ever given the Sisters themselves the legal advice to which they are entitled. ■ The frankness, sincerity and willingness of the Catholic sisters in this school to give our inspectors all the facts and information asked for has made a very commendable impression on this office. Through all the ages woman has been the source of all that is unselfish and heroic in the spirit of man. We are compelled to confess that your suggestion does not appeal to our sense of chivalry, justice, or fairness toward womanhood. Whatever part the Catholic sisters are playing in this school, it is our opinion that they are merely pawns in the hands of wrongly directed leadership. It is unfortunate that the brief which you sent to this office attempts to hide behind the skirts of these holy women. Many Legally This is essentially a public school and not a Conducted Church church school proposition. Church schools for Schools in State the giving of religious instruction in all grades have a definite legal status in Nebraska. This office acknowledges the most cordial relations with all such schools, in - cluding those of the faith represented in this so-called public school. This office contends that the St. Boniface school is not a public school within the meaning of the Nebraska Constitution. Nebraska, through its Constitution, has assumed that education is a state function. It has said that no public tax money shall be spent for sectarian religious instruction. Education Is a Every taxpayer in the state has an equity Function of the State in the state school fund. The state, by with - holding state money from this district is not wrecking the St. Boniface school, in so far as it may have 1 a few formal elements of a public school. The State of Nebraska is only saying that St. Boniface is not a public school within the constitutional meaning of the term. Under the practices of the Nebraska Constitution as applied to general school management, the convictions of every religious minority are respected in a spirit of broad-minded tolera- Rroadminded tion and neighborly friendliness as befits the Religious Toleration everyday relations of a sympathetic and friendly Needed democracy. The St. Boniface community has its church school with teachers, building and equipment clearly set up. Of the ten grades represented they claim grades four to ten inclusive as public school grades. In other words, we have a mixture and a scrambling of public school and church school organization, all under the dominating and overpowering influence of sectarian religious atmosphere. For anyone to say that this community of good people, as they are, is exhibiting a spirit Constitution ' cf toleration towards the religious convictions Contemplates of tho masses of Nebraskans .as represented by Xo Such Mixture the State Constitution, seems almost childish to c Public and this office, when we see so many other communi- C'uirch School ties of the same religious faith scrupulously respecting the Constitution while supporting fine </seg>

If the position taken by this office does not finally stand, then every religious denomination in the state can go out into each of the seven thousand public school districts, make an attempt to capture the board of education positions, and where successful set up their peculiar brand of sectarian religious instruction at the expense of all the taxpayers of that school district. As far as the State of Nebraska is concerned we would then have local option as regards religious instruction. We are looking at this problem from the viewpoint of the whole state of Nebraska representing all shades of religious beliefs pleading for a course of action on your part that will give full respect and con - sideration to each and every shade of religious belief and at the same time be legally ethical and law abiding.

Respectfully yours, CHARLES W. TAYLOR, State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Copies to County Superintendent, Cedar County, and Mr. Paul Goedon, Director, District Number Six." Corrective Legislation Needed A study of the reports of the various division directors may reveal the need for some major school legislation. The discussion that will immediately follow, however, will involve minor changes of a corrective nature to enable existing Statutes to better carry out their true pur - poses. In each instance the number of the section refers to the Com - piled Statutes of 1922. Correction No. 1: Section 6272 should be amended so that the voter's oath will provide for two requirements that are already specified in Section 6271; namely, the oath should state that " you are a citizen of the United States and that you or your spouse owns real property in the district or personal property in the district or personal property which was assessed in your or your spouse's name ". Correction No. 2: The Nebraska Supreme Court has held that the change of a schoolhouse site can be effected only at the annual meeting in an Article III school under the provisions of Section 6270 and 6275. A great many emergency cases have been called to our attention until it would seem there are justifiable reasons for changing a schoolhouse site at some other time in an emergency. Many of these cases have arisen in small towns and villages where bonds were voted for a new school building, but it was necessary to wait until the next annual meeting to change the site, even though changing conditions have made </seg>
            <seg id="p033">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION the old site impracticable. This office would recommend that the site could be changed by a written petition to the county superintendent signed by a major number of the legal voters of the district. The last paragraph of Section 6275 provides that in an Article VI school the site can be changed by a two-thirds vote at a special meeting as well as at the annual meeting. The Article III schools should also have a similar privilege. Correction No. 3: We believe that Section No. 6281 passed by the Session of 1921, would automatically change the "ten mills" and "ten percent" referred to in Section 6284 to "two mills" and "two percent." If this be true the actual change should be written into Section 6284. Correction No. 4: A study of the portion of this report entitled "State Aid to Weak Districts" would indicate that there are many worthy weak districts in the state which do not meet all of the require - ments outlined in Section 6290. This matter is deserving of much study and consideration. Correction No. 5: This office receives many inquiries as to whether or not an officer of the district board may serve as janitor or truck driver. Section 6302 should, perhaps, be amended to include all em - ployees of the school district as well as the teacher. Correction No. 6: Hundreds of letters have come into this depart - ment over the question of bonding the district treasurer, the handling of funds, and the bonding of depositories. In Article XXV schools the law specifies that the treasurer must be bonded by a responsible snrety company. In a good many school districts we have been confronted by a situation where the premiums on surety bonds have been prohibitive. - Personal bonds also seem out of the question, inasmuch as old court decisions have pointed to the fact that the treasurer and his bondsmen are liable even if the money is lost through no fault of their own — through bank failure or otherwise. For this reason in a good many school districts of the state, both rural and urban, it seems to be almost impossible to secure someone who is willing to act as school treasurer. Even after this person is found it is almost impossible for him to qualify in accordance with the provisions of the law. Some corrective legisla - tion is badly needed on this subject. By some system of duplicate war - rants or other procedure the money should remain in the hands of the county treasurer as long as possible, or in the case of an emergency teachers should be paid by warrants directly on the county treasurer in order that the school program may go on in the absence of a qualified district treasurer. Correction No. 7: Section 6314 is so worded that in a good many rural districts of the state it is impossible to hire a teacher for the fal - lowing year until after the annual meeting. Such a procedure, in part, accounts for the fact that there is a large teacher turnover in the rural </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT districts of the state. A good many district officers move from one dis - trict to another during the school year, usually around March 1, and this necessitates an appointment of someone to fill the vacancy. Sec - tion 6314 requires that the contract must be signed by "all members of the district board or by two members whose terms of office extend beyond the date of the term of school contracted for." Correction No. 8: Anent the matter of normal traaining appropria - tions, Section 6411 provides that one thousand dollars per biennium shall be made available to such schools as meet all of the requirements for normal training as set up in the law and regulations provided for through the law. Unfortunately, a larger number of schools have pro - vided for normal training courses than can now be recognized to re - ceive the normal training appropriation. The Attorney General's office has ruled that in the case of insufficient funds, this appropriation cannot be pro-rated. This ruling has forced the office to rule in a manner that seems to many to be too arbitrary. We have been forced to interpret very literally many technical provisions of the law covering normal training. It would seem highly desirable that the funds now available be pro-rated in some such a manner as to adequately care for all of the schools which now conform to these laws and regulations. It would be exceedingly unfortunate did certain schools fully meet all the require - ments and then discover that there were not sufficient funds available to reimburse them in some degree at least for their efforts. Correction No. 9: Since the county certificates were eliminated by House Roll No. 353 of the 1925 Session Laws, Section 6453 has become a dead letter and at present there is, apparently, no penalty for refusal to attend institute for teachers who hold certificates other than those issued to graduates of the elementary course of the State Normals There is room for constructive legislation as regards the whole institute problem. Section 6448 to 6453 should be revised to meet changed con - ditions. Correction No. 10: This office would estimate that approximately twenty-five per cent of those who attempt to meet the provisions of Section 6524 do so to obtain a tax reduction rather than to obtain better school privileges for their children. We would recommend that those who transfer should live at least one-fourth mile nearer to the school - house in the adjoining district before such transfer should be granted. We would also recommend that some official should have discretionary power as to whether or not the transfer should be granted; that is, some official should pass upon whether it is. a bona fide request for the sake of better school privileges or whether it is a subterfuge to escape a higher tax levy. </seg>
            <seg id="p035">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Correction No. 11: If the State Superintendent were to actually attempt to enforce the provisions of Section 6524 to the letter of the law it would require an additional legislative appropriation of many thou - sands of dollars to secure the number of employees necessary to enforce Sections 6530 to 6534 inclusive. Some such penalty as losing the State Apportionment should be provided for failure to comply with these sections and several other sections of the law if they are not to be made dead letters on the Statute books. We are heartily in sympathy with the principle of local control, but we do not believe that local boards of education in exercising this control should disregard the Statutes of the State simply because no penalty is attached to such an offense. Correction No. 12: The 1929 legislature passed a very commenda - ble driver's license law, but as soon as this law was passed the offices of the State Superintendent, Attorney General and other state officials were literally flooded with letters from parents of rural children who found it necessary to drive several miles to high school in town. As the law now reads these children cannot obtain driver's licenses until they are sixteen years of age. We would not recommend a change in this license law, but we believe that a special permit should be granted worthy cases under fifteen years of age. The permit would stand in lieu of a driver's license as far as the necessary driving to and from school on school days was concerned. There should probably be an application to the county treasurer signed by the parent and approved by the county superintendent. We would not advocate lowering the age limit for drivers', licenses, but we would advocate a special permit in lieu of a driver's license in meritorious cases where the child meets all other re - quirements for a driver's license except the age. The corrections suggested above are not the only corrections that are needed in the school laws. They are merely some of the ones that, if changed, would eliminate many difficulties in the school districts of the state. . • Official Relations to Public at Large Our office has always been open to every caller. We feel that there has never been a time in the history of the state when we were more available than now. Our services have been in almost constant demand for various types of public work. Not a week rolls by but that the members of the department find themselves out in the state somewhere, speaking before various meetings of school patrons, community clubs, parent-teacher associations, teachers' institutes, commencements, and the like.

To do this, we have always sought after the best knowledge available from every source. Opinion and guesswork are minimized to an extreme. It has always been our belief that we must be students along with the men and women in the field,' constantly endeavoring to keep in step with every new development. Divisions Under each division heading an attempt has been made to give the facts and information which the Governor, legislature, and public should have bearing on that particular phase of work. We have tried to elimi - nate useless details and include only those things that are important. We shall be glad to answer any questions that may be asked and are ready to give information when requested. In responsibility for general work and routine of the office, the Deputy State Superintendent naturally stands next to the Chief. Much credit for .the routine of the Department during the biennium is due to the careful, conscientious, efficient work of the Deputy. We are particularly proud of the outstanding ability, unquestioned character, general efficiency, and the professional skill of our staff of assistants.

INTRODUCTION The financial statement, which immediately follows this introduction shows all of the fees which have been received by the Division of Certifi - cation for the past biennium. The report must of necessity begin with November 1, 1928, since the previous report ended as of that date. The registration fees represent 50c of each $1.50 which is the pur - chase price of each examination number. Every applicant who writes upon state examinations must purchase a number. One dollar of the purchase price is retained by the county superintendent of the county ■m which the number is purchased. For every certificate issued by this office, and for every institutional or life certificate validated, there is a fee of $1.00. For every examina - tion paper reviewed, there is a. fee of 50c. If the grade is altered upon Teview, the fee is returned; if the grade is sustained, the fee is kept. There are many charts which were included m the thesis dealing with certification m Nebraska which had to be omitted since available space would not permit their inclusion. The findings are based upon the opinions of some three hundred state, county and city superintendents and presidents and deans of colleges and teacher training institutions." The conclusions and recommendations are such as may be said to be m line with the majority opinion of the school executives referred to above. The author of the thesis does not insist that all of the recom - mendations would be applicable to Nebraska at this time. The pro - cedures which are recommended are presumed to constitute desirable procedures, although they may not m every case be practicable. </seg>

This Board visits the private and denominational colleges of the state in order to determine .whether or not they may be approved for the issuance of teachers' certificates, The University of Nebraska sets the standard for the four-year certificates, that is, for those certificates which are based upon gradua - tion from an institution authorized to confer the degrees of Bachelor' of Arts or Bachelor of Science.

"' The one plan calls for a statutory provision in which the number of certificates which may be issued are specifically mentioned, the quali - fications for each certificate are set forth, the authority and power to grant them together with the exact titles of the certificates, the subject or subjects for which valid and the term of years during which they will remain in force are established by law. - The second plan calls for a statutory provision which fixes or desig - nates the authority under whose direction' requirements and regulations governing certification shall be formulated, the law itself making no specific provision covering the details of certification. The latter plan has certain advantages inasmuch as it permits the State Board, the State Superintendent or in some cases the State Com - missioner designated by the board, to take into consideration the matter of surplusses or shortages of teachers, revising the rules and regulations governing certification to meet existing situations. CLASSIFICATION OF CERTIFICATES Certificates are classified in various ways. Some of the more common forms of classification are, first, according to the particular class of schools or grade of work for which they are issued and for which they are valid; second, according to the degree of scholarship which they •Excerpta from a thesis presented by Herbert L.

            <seg id="p047">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION express as determined by the earning of certain examination grades or by a certain number of years of college training; third, pn the basis of a combination of special training and the particular class or grade of •work for which the applicant is fitted, with the element of successful teaching experience frequently functioning as an important element in the .requirements for the higher ranking certificates. ■ Certificates based upon the earning of credits may be grouped as follows: first, those based upon graduation from standard colleges or universities including the required number of credits in professional courses usually referred to as "education"; second, graduation from colleges or universities with or without such professional courses; third, the completion of two years or what may be referred to as the higher courses of the normal schools; fourth, graduation from approved teacher training courses in high schools included in or in addition to the regular four-year high school course; fifth, certificates based upon examinations together with certain prescribed professional courses earned in approved normal training high schools or standard teacher training institutions such as normal schools. The examination procedure in the issuance of certificates is the oldest method in use. It dates back to the earliest laws dealing with education passed by certain Massachusetts towns as early as 1643 and 1647. In those earliest days, the teacher appeared before the board members and was examined orally. The Present Certification Agencies in Nebraska There are eight distinct agencies authorized by law to issue teachers.' certificates in Nebraska. They are the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska, the boards of education of the state normal schools, the private and denomi - national colleges of the state, the Board of Education of the School District of the City of Omaha, the Board of Education of the School District of the City of Lincoln, the State Board of Vocational Education, and the boards of regents of county high schools. At the present time seven of these agencies are actually issuing cer - tificates. The. boards of regents of the sixteen county high schools in Nebraska are not exercising their right to issue certificates. Certificates Issued by the State Department of Public Instruction The law authorizes the State Department of Public Instruciton to issue the following certificates: third grade elementary, second grade elementary, first grade elementary, permanent elementary, second grade high school, first grade high school, permanent high school, special high school, permanent special high school and special music. The general qualifications which every successful applicant for a teacher's certificate in Nebraska must possess are as follows: approved </seg>

The third grade elementary certificate is the lowest ranking certifi - cate issued by the State Department of Public Instruction. Under one plan it requires the earning of the requisite grades in the seventeen third grade elementary certificate subjects on state examination and twelve semester hours of college credit, including six semester hours in education, in some standard college. Under the other plan the requisite examination grades are required in addition to the • completion of the normal training course of an approved Nebraska normal training high school. This certificate is not renewable, but may be converted into the higher ranking certificates. The third grade elementary certificate is valid only in Article III schools. The second grade elementary certificate requires the third grade elementary, certificate or an ■ equivalent as a basis and twelve semester hours of college credit, including three hours in education, plus one year of successful teaching experience or thirty semester hours of college credit, including eight in education, in case the applicant has had no' experience. The second grade elementary certificate is legally valid from kindergarten to the eighth grade inclusive in all schools in the state. ' The first grade elementary certificate requires a basic certificate plus thirty semester hours of college credit, including eight hours in education, and three years of successful teaching experience or sixty semester hours of college credit, including twelve hours in education, in case the applicant has held no previous certificate.

The permanent elementary certificate requires sixty semester hours of college credit, including fifteen hours, in education and three years of successful teaching experience.

It is legally valid in any high school in Cho state. The first grade high school certificate requires under one plan a basic certificate equivalent to the second grade high school certificate plus thirty semester hours of college credit, including three semester hours in education, and three years of successful teaching experience. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Under the other plan it requires graduation from a standard four-year college based upon not less than one hundred twenty semester hours of college credit, fifteen of which must be in education. The permanent high school certificate requires graduation from a standard four-year college based upon one hundred twenty semester hours, including fifteen hours in education, and three years of successful teaching experience. The special high school certificate is issued for the following sub-: jects : music, home economics, commercial, art, manual training and physical education. It requires sixty semester hours of college credit, including eight semester hours in education with twenty hours in either music, home ' economics or commercial or sixteen hours in art, manual training or physical education. The permanent special high school certificate requires graduation, from a standard four-year college based upon a minimum of one hundred twenty semester hours with specialization as indicated for the special high school certificate plus three years of successful teaching experience/ The special music certificate was authorized by the state legislature of 1929. To qualify for this certificate applicants must meet the require - ments set up by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The requirements are fixed from year to year and at the present time this certificate may be issued only to those who pass certain written exami - nations and demonstrate their ability before a state board of examiners. Renewal of Certificates Issued by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction All certificates issued by the State Superintendent of Public Instruc - tion may be renewed by earning twelve semester hours of college credit in some standard college, except that the law provides that lapsed per - manent certificates may be renewed in case the applicant' has earned as a part of the twelve semester hours, three semester hours in education. Revocation of Certificates The State Superintendent of Public Instruction may revoke any certificate which he has issued for any cause which would have author - ized him to refuse to grant such certificate, if known at the time of issuance. Proper causes are listed as incompetence, immorality, intemperance, cruelty, crime against the law of the state, negligence of duty or general negligence of the business of the school. Certificates Issued by the University of Nebraska The law provides that graduates of the University of Nebraska who have completed courses prescribed by the regents and faculty, may re- </seg>
            <seg id="p050">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ceive a certificate which shall rank as a first grade state certificate. Graduates of the University in order to receive this certificate must at . the present time earn a minimum of twenty hours in education. After three years of successful teaching:, experience these certificates may be countersigned by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction as life certificates and, if permitted to lapse, they may be renewed by earning twelve semester hours of college credit, including three semester hours of education in some standard college. No authority is given for the revo - cation of these certificates. Certificates Issued by the Board of Education for State Normal Schools There are four state normal schools and teachers' colleges under the direction of the Board of Education for State Normal Schools. Those who complete certain courses in these schools may receive from the school in which the work is taken, certain certificates which- the law empowers the Board of Education for State Normal Schools to grant. The four state normal schools and teachers' colleges are authorized to issue the following certificates: rural elementary, first grade rural state, professional rural state, second grade state, first grade state based upon two years of college work, first grade state based upon four years of college work, professional life diploma based upon three years of college work and two years of successful teaching experience, profes - sional life diploma based upon four years of college work and two years of successful teaching experience. Institutional Certificates Issued by State, Private and Denominational Colleges The Nebraska law provides that private and denominational col - leges, which meet the standards set up by the University of Nebraska for the issuance of the university first grade state certificate may issue similar certificates. The State Superintendent is required to determine through personal inspection or through the inspection of the State Board of Examiners appointed by him, those colleges which meet the standards set up by the University. State, private and denominational colleges are also authorized to issue first grade state certificates of similar tenure and effect as those issued by the state normal schools upon meeting the standards set up by the Board of Education for State Normal Schools. Thus, while the University of Nebraska sets the standards for the institutional certifi - cate based upon four years of college work, it. must meet the standard set up by the Board of Education of State Normal (Schools in case it desires to issue a certificate based upon two years of ■ college work. Thus private and denominational colleges look to the University of Ne - braska for their standards for certificates based upon four years of college work and to teachers' colleges for the standards for certificates based upon one and two years of college work. </seg>
            <seg id="p051">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION At the present time there are eleven private and denominational colleges issuing first grade state certificates based upon four years of college work; seventeen issuing certificates based upon two years of col - lege work and seventeen issuing certificates based upon one year of college work. Attention is called to the fact that certificates issued by the state normal schools, the University and the private and denominational schools are all called first grade state certificates by law regardless of whether they are based on two or four years of college work. Certificates Issued by the Board of Education of the School District of the City of Omaha The Board of Education of the School District of the City of Omaha is authorized to set up the requirements for certificates valid for teach - ing in the public schools of Omaha. These certificates have but little bearing upon the matter of the state certification of teachers, except for the fact that they are occasionally presented at the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for evaluation. Certificates Issued by the Board of Education of the School District of the City of Lincoln The certificates are issued by the Board of Education of the School District of the City of Lincoln to those teachers who meet the require - ments set up by the Board of Education. These certificates are valid only in the school district of the city of Lincoln. Certificates Issued by the State Board for Vocational Education The requirements for these certificates are fixed by the State Board for Vocational Education. Teachers holding these certificates are em - ployed only in part time, continuation and evening schools. Certificates Issued by Boards of Regents of County High Schools While the law authorizes boards of regents of county high schools to issue teachers* certificates, valid in the county where such high schools may be located, there are none of these boards of regents exercising their certificating authority at present. All of these county high schools are operating as normal training high schools and their graduates in order to receive certificates must meet the same requirements as are set up for the graduates of approved normal training high schools, who are applicants for the third grade elementary certificate, issued by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Criteria for Judging Certification This chapter will present tabulated summaries of replies to the questionnaire, together with certain opinions presented by those who responded, and will endeavor to interpret the summaries in the light of the certification procedure in Nebraska. 1.

Will you list, In the space below, other desirable criteria which :i you would add to the above, or which you would substitute in lieu of any of. the above?

There should be a basis that all must attain regardless of type ■ ' : of- certificate. .' . ' A coherent and. integrated program providing for. professional ' growth and natural advance through educational training front lowest grade of certificate to highest. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION No permanent or life certificates. Original provisional (4 years or 5 years) should be .re-validated at expiration on the basis of professional success and activities, including: in the latter item ' training, reading, travel, pupil achievement, etc. Degree of specialization should not be too great. The name of a certificate should indicate its duration and the Tinit of school organization and subjects or grades for which it is valid. Should provide for growth in service and should be related closely to salary schedule. Responsibility of recommending institutions for success or failure of graduates. Credentials granted on recommendation of teacher training institutions. Certificate laws should cover only general principles. Details should be determined by a state board of education. Only those students who exhibit the qualities that go toward making good teachers should be recommended for examination and certification. Institutions from which credits are accepted should be stand - ardized in some manner so that justice and fairness may be done. Notable inferior standards should not be accepted as equivalent to those from institutions with high standards. Stimulation of further training and development after getting the first job. Correlation of normal school, teachers' college, college, univer - sity graduate school and special school facilities for training- of rural, town, city and metropolitan needs — an interchange of safe - guarding both minimum efficiencies with opportunity for maxi - mum flow toward higher positions and more completely'profes - sionalized activities. • ..

'■■' • • • .. ■•■ Applying the above criteria to the Nebraska situation it appears, first, that the plan of certification which the law sets up for the issu - ance of certificates by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction is comparatively simple in that it provides for but ten state certificates. The element of simplicity is lost only when the matter of the issuance of certificates by twenty-two state, private and denominational colleges becomes a factor. In some cases these colleges issue as many as seven distinct, types of certificates which means there are in existence in Ne - braska at the present time between one. hundred fifty and two hundred varieties and kinds of certificates. • •- ■•■■_■ ■ ■ y ■• . </seg>
            <seg id="p054">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT . The second criterion deals with recognition of the distinction be - tween responsibilities of the different teaching positions. The opinion seems to be almost unanimous that there should be such recognition. In this regard the Nebraska procedure scores very low. It is true that we have certain certificates valid in elementary schools and certain other certificates valid in secondary schools, but there are so many ex - ceptions and so many "blanket certificates" that what might first be assumed to represent a distinction represents in the last analysis "a distinction without a difference." To illustrate the following typical situations are given: an applicant for a first grade elementary certificate is required to have sixty semester hours of college credit with twelve in education. The twelve hours in education may all deal with the teaching of high school subjects and still, if they are regularly reported by the registrar of a standard col - lege, they must under the law be accepted in the issuance of the elemen - tary certificate. An applicant for a high school certificate may likewise present hours in education which relate specifically to the teaching of elementary subjects and still under the law the hours must be accepted. The holder of a high school certificate is legally qualified to teach in any elementary grade. The same condition prevails as regards certificates issued by the state, private and denominational colleges. One may graduate from the two-year course of a state normal school and receive what is known as the normal diploma which ranks according to law as a first grade certificate. It makes no difference whether the diploma indicates that the holder has specialized in music, art, home economics, manual train - ing, physical education, commercial, early, elementary education, kinder - garten, elementary or secondary, the certificate is a blanket certificate valid for the teaching of any subject or subjects in any and all grades in any and all schools of the State of Nebraska. Likewise the holder of a high school certificate may have specialized in mathematics and natural sciences and nevertheless may legally teach any subject offered in high school. There is no such thing as a special certificate for super - visors or administrators. The next criterion deals with the period of apprenticeship. The certification procedure in Nebraska does make some provision for a period of apprenticeship and such a provision seems to be desirable in the light of the opinions shown in the foregoing table. The permanent or life certificates issued by. the State Department may be secured upon the earning of three years of successful experience. Certificates issued by the state, private and denominational colleges may </seg>
            <seg id="p055">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION become permanent or life certificates after two years of successful teach - ing experience. The first grade elementary certificate under plan one requires three years of teaching experience and the second grade elementary certificate under plan one requires one .year of teaching experience. There may be some doubt as to whether the provision for a period of apprenticeship is really adequate. It is doubtful whether or not the period of experi - ence has been successful and in this event one may legitimately raise the question as to whether the provision for a period of apprenticeship is really significant. The fourth criterion deals with the matter of phrasing the cer - tificate in terms which shall be self-explanatory. The various certifi - cates issued in Nebraska meet this criterion fairly well. The chief difficulty arises from the fact that certain schools have voluntarily agreed to meet the standards set up by certain accrediting agencies. To illustrate, a second grade high school certificate is legally valid in any high school in the state, but it will not be accepted by schools accredited to the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools nor by schools accredited to the University of Nebraska. In the same way a second grade elementary certificate is legally valid from the kin - dergarten to the eighth grade inclusive in any school in the state, but it will not be accepted in a school district which maintains an approved normal training high school. The fifth criterion deals with the matter of the agencies which shall issue certificates. It will be noted that of those replying to the ques - tionnaire one hundred eighty-nine favor the issuance of certificates by one central agency. There is but one negative response. The only other criterion which is suggested frequently enough to have particular significance is one which deals with the matter of flexi - bility. Nine of those who replied suggested that a certification procedure should have this element of flexibility. In other words, that there should be no statutory provision fixing all of the details of certification. It is suggested that a state board of education of which the state superin - tendent is to be the chief executive officer, shall have authority to change requirements from time to time. ; One State Superintendent suggests that the best procedure so far as the law is concerned is "no procedure at all," so far as statutory limitations are cdncerned. He suggests that any law which will be adequate and comprehensive enough to meet present needs is likely to. be out of date five years hence. He further suggests that the supply of properly trained teachers should have a bearing upon the standards for the licensing or certification of teachers. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Chief Criticisms of Certification Procedures The chief points which I would criticise in the certification procedure of my own state are as follows: ALABAMA " "Too. many. Not simple enough. We issue thirty-nine different certificates. We are now trying to reduce this to a maximum of twelve certificates. "We grant a permanent certificate that is valid as long as a person teaches. I believe that some professional improvement should be shown every five years. Second criticism — We grant permanent elementary on basis of two years training. I believe both secondary and elementary should be on four years, if granted." ALASKA "Renewals granted with limited requirements and calling for no advanced study and no definite statement of number of times certificate may be renewed." ARIZONA "No differentiation for different high school subjects. No adminis - trators' certificates. High school certificates valid in all grades. Ele - mentary school certificates valid through the tenth grade." ARKANSAS "Too many agencies issuing certificates. Our certificates have not' become specialization ones." CALIFORNIA "Credentials issued have a blanket authorization for teaching all subjects in all grades. There are too many special certificates. "No check-up to see what teaching success is. Secondary certificates allow holder to teach in elementary, school. No guarantee of training for subject assigned to teacher in high school. "County system of certification. General secondary certificate al - lows teaching in elementary schools. Life tenure." COLORADO "Complexity. Limited to certain schools in professional work. Too indefinite in powers unstated for board of examiners. "Too many forms involves blanketing of licenses'." CONNECTICUT "Certification requirements too low.

"Illinois new and untried system. Elective state and county officers. Don't know how it will work. Looks like a big improvement. Question - able participation of the state teachers' organization.

INDIANA "On the whole, I like our Indiana plan, though I would change some - what the specific requirements, but it would take some time to explain fully the changes I would make. "Too rigid, some degree of flexibility is desirable." IOWA "One criticism is the distinction made in the certification of those prepared at a certain state institution and others completing special courses in independent institutions accredited by the State Board of Educational Examiners when requirements are met that are absolutely similar to those of the state institution. Jf Iowa blank very satisfactory, except for detailed requirement of secondary credits. Nebraska blank too detailed. "(a) Too low a requirement of hours in education for a first grade (secondary school) state certificate; only fourteen hours. "(b) Too lenient a distribution of this fourteen hours between fields of professional education. A teacher having had eight hours of princi - ples of education and six of history of education may be thus certified as fully equipped. "1. No certificate should be granted to a college graduate who has not taken at least 20 hours in education and psychology. "2. No life certificate or permanent certificate should be issued to a student who has not had successful experience. "All standards are too low. This is especially true of rural teach - ers. There is no recognition of the needs for the professional training </seg>
            <seg id="p058">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT of supervisors and administrators in addition to their training as teachers. "I am not sure that all college graduates should be entitled to a third grade state certificate even upon recommendation of the president and head of department of education. The requirements in manual training, agriculture and home economics are definite, and suitable. In other subjects the amount of specific preparation is not as yet either definite or authoritative. If superintendents or school boards will employ a teacher without his having specialized in the subject he is to teach, they may do so. Usually the teacher has specialized in one subject, but he very often in smaller schools teaches one or more in which he has not specialized, and sometimes has not studied. With our numerous small high schools the situation is difficult to meet properly. Too little ex - perience is required for superintendents. Additional preparation too should be required. In Iowa many teachers with only two years experi - ence and no additional preparation seek a superintendency. Last year there were frequently from fifty to one hundred candidates for vacant superintendences. Under such conditions it seems to me that it would be both easy and desirable to raise the standards. "Minimum requirements for elementary and rural certificates too low. High school certificates should specify the subjects the holder may teach." KANSAS "An entire revision desired. "Certification not centralized in State Department of Education. Certificates not issued for subjects. "Kansas is working out a program. It needs many changes, but it will be very workable. "1. Blanket high school certificate; teacher with a degree and eighteen semester hours of education can secure a blanket certificate which entitles holder to teach any subject in high school. "2. State Teachers' College as well as State Board can issue cer - tificates: the former need not even send in a transcript of credits to the state board.

Defects of the Present Certification Procedure Before undertaking to set up a desirable certification procedure for Nebraska, it may be well to summarize in a rather general way, in order to point put some of the apparent defects in our present procedure in the light of desirable standards for certification as revealed by this study. Present Procedure Unsatisfactory That there is something lacking in Nebraska's present procedure in the matter of the issuance of teachers' certificates seems to be admitted </seg>
            <seg id="p064">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT by practically all of the administrative agencies responsible for the is - suance of certificates. Other States Raising Standards The situation tends to become somewhat more complicated because of the raising of standards in some of the states bordering on Nebraska. Colorado, Iowa, Wyoming, Missouri and South Dakota, among the middle western states, are requiring that applicants from other states . shall present a diploma or certificate which shall clearly show that said applicant has completed the regular teacher training course in a stand - ard teacher training institution. In addition, applicants in Iowa must pass an examination in the state constitution of Iowa. The same is true of Wyoming. Applicants in Kansas must have had at least three semester hours of college work in school administration. • This means that teachers of other states with rather meager quali - fications are at present seeking or will soon seek to take advantage of the rather low standards which prevail in Nebraska. That this influx of poorly trained teachers is already under way is evidenced by the great number of applications for Nebraska certificates which are being submitted daily by former teachers in surrounding states. Weak Candidates Must Be Eliminated There must be some plan whereby applicants for admission to teacher training courses will prove their fitness for the teaching profes - sion. At the present time there is little evidence to indicate that the teacher training institutions of the state eliminate undesirable appli - cants for certification. Records for the last ten years on file in the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction indicate that approximately sixty per cent of those who have taken the normal training courses in high school have been able to pass the examinations and "qualify for certifi - cates. In many cases, those who have not been able to pass the required examinations have received an elementary certificate after attending a teacher training institution of the state for some twenty-four to twenty - six weeks. . : A Typical Case There is one case which is typical and is presented herewith in sub - stantiation of the statement just made.

Who Shall Set Up Certification Standards? There seems to be -two generally recognized procedures or plans for establishing the requirements governing the issuance of certificates. The most common of the two is the one which involves legislative enactments. The other .permits the State Superintendent of Public In - struction or State Board of Education of which the State Superintendent </seg>
            <seg id="p067">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION cr State Commissioner of Education is the exofficio secretary to alter the requirements from year to year in case changes seem to be necessary. A few of the replies received to the questionnaire which furnished the basis for this thesis indicated a preference for the last named pro - cedure. While this last named procedure seems to have an advantage in that it is easily changed to meet changing conditions it is not exactly in harmony with our democratic theory of government. It seems rather apparent that there is a tendency for any profes - sional group to lead much more rapidly than public opinion will follow. It is not difficult to contemplate what might happen if an over-zealous professional group would set up standards too far in advance of public opinion. History is full of the evidences of the dangerous reactions that follow any effort "to set up programs to which the general public is not willing to subscribe. It is to be assumed that any profession will al - ways be thinking ahead of the times. Many principles advocated by recognized leaders in governmental affairs twenty or thirty years ago, which were considered somewhat radical at the time they were advo - cated, have since been adopted in modified form. That some of these principles would have been rather disastrous, if adopted as they were originally advocated, is rather freely admitted by students of govern - ment. ■ When the standards for the issuance of certificates are established by law, they at least give to teachers and prospective teachers a definite idea as to the preparation which they must make in order to qualify for certain teaching positions. Lawmakers are usually careful to see to it that no enactments are retroactive. When rules and regulations are set up by the small administrative bodies not responsible to the public they are presumed to serve, there is always a danger that teachers will find upon completion of certain training, that definite plans which they have made come to naught because standards have changed. The author of this thesis being a firm believer in the theory that' the public should rule even though over-zealous persons of certain profes - sions may think at times that they rule unwisely, believes that the time has not yet arrived when the state of Nebraska should cease to rely upon definite legislative enactment for the setting up of standards for certification. Blanket Certificates . Without doubt the most serious defect in the present Nebraska procedure is to be found in the rather sweeping provisions of the law which permits the issuance of "blanket certificates." While rather complete statements have been made in the preceding chapters, it may be worth while to again call attention to the fact that </seg>
            <seg id="p068">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT teachers who have been specifically trained for teaching in the secondary schools will legally qualify to teach in the elementary schools and in the case of certain certificates, teachers who have been trained to teach in the elementary schools are legally qualified for teaching in the secondary schools. By the same token, teachers who have specialized in music or com - mercial or other vocational subjects hold certificates which legally qual - ify them to teach academic subjects in the secondary schools and also legally qualify them for teaching in any of the grades in the elementary schools. Conclusions and Recommendations It is scarcely practical to attempt to set up a system of certification so technical as to constitute a positive assurance that each holder of a certificate is actually qualified to fill the position for which he may be legally qualified. For this reason in this concluding chapter there are presented certain general principles rather than detailed and specific outlines of a certification plan. 1. The procedure must be simple. This means that it must be capable of being readily understood by school administrators, teachers, pros - pective teachers and board members. The various classifications should be largely self-explanatory. 2. There must be a reasonable distinction between the responsibilities of the different teaching positions. a. Certificates which entitle the holder to teach in the secondary schools should require method courses in the particular subjects which the holder is to teach. b. Certificates which entitle the holder to teach in elementary schools should require method courses in the teaching of elemen - tary subjects. • c. Certificates which entitle the holder to occupy supervisory or administrative positions should require certain courses in educa - tion which will best fit the holder for positions of this type. 3. There should be provision for •» period of apprenticeship. - a. Permanent certificates should be granted after three years of successful teaching experience. b. A year of teaching experience should be defined as nine months of twenty days each. 4. All certificates should be issued through one central office. a. This central office may be the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. </seg>
            <seg id="p069">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION b. This office may be the office of the State Board of Education of • which the State Superintendent is the exofficio secretary. 5. No distinction should be made between the years of training required for certificates valid in the rural schools and those valid in urban schools. a. This does not mean that there should not be distinction as to the curricular content of the training courses. 6. Secondary certificates should require a minimum of eighteen se - mester hours of college credit in the subjects which the holder of the certificate expects to teach. 7. Certificates should never be permanent in the sense that they become valid for life regardless of whether the holder stays in the profession or makes additional preparation. 8. Permanent certificates should lapse after three years of non-use. a. Non-use should be defined as failure to teach at least twenty-four weeks during the period for which the certificate was valid. b. Permanent certificates issued to those who have completed a four - year college course and hold a degree should lapse after six years of non-use. • c. Permanent certificates based on less than four years of college work should lapse after three years of non-use. d. Twelve semester hours of college credit, including three in edu - cation, should be required to renew a lapsed permanent certifi - cate, if renewed within five years of the date of expiration; other - wise eighteen semester hours should be required, of which six hours should be in education courses. e. At least two of the three years of experience required for the permanent elementary certificate shall have been earned in an elementary teaching position and at least two of the three years of experience required for the permanent secondary certificate shall have been earned in secondary teaching positions. 9. No certificates should be issued to applicants under eighteen years of age. 10. The present requirement regarding citizenship should be continued. 11. The present requirement regarding applicants being persons of "approved character" should be continued with some amplifications or specifications, if possible, as to just what constitutes "approved character." 12. Applicants should be required to present evidence of good physical health. . ... </seg>
            <seg id="p070">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 13. The amount of credit which may be earned through extension and correspondence courses toward either the issuance or renewal of certificates should be limited to twenty-five per cent. 14. A year of travel should be accepted as equivalent to twelve semester hours of college credit, if taken with some definite educational intent as approved by the registrar of a standard college. 15. All certificates should be subject to revocation by the agency which issues the certificate, upon conclusive evidence of incompetence, gross immorality, crime against the law of the state or physical disability. 16. Elementary certificates may be divided into the following: a. Second grade elementary or provisional second grade elemen - tary based upon two years of college work, with a minimum of twenty semester hours in education courses. b. First grade elementary or provisional first grade elementary based upon four years of college work with a minimum of twenty semester hours in education courses. .'-'■' c. Supervisory elementary certificate based upon four years of col - lege work with a minimum of thirty semester hours in education with some definite preparation for the work of supervisory. d. First grade high school certificate or provisional first grade high school certificate based upon four years of college work with a minimum of twenty semester hours of college credit in education. e. Supervisory high school certificate valid for the position of teacher, principal or superintendent based upon four years of college work with a minimum of thirty semester hours of col - lege credit in education with special courses in school adminis - tration and supervision. f. Special high school certificates for the teaching of fine arts and vocational subjects based upon four years of college work with a minimum of fifteen hours in education. g. All of the above certificates to be validated as permanent cer - tificates after three years of teaching.. 17. Since conditions are constantly changing it is recommended that before any attempt is m'ade to incorporate the above recommenda - tions and principles into the law of the state, that a conference made up of representatives of the present certificating agencies, school administrators, school board members, teachers' associations, farm organizations, and business organizations, be called to work out a practical plan which shall apply in the main to the principles and recommendations set f erth above. </seg>

The objective of the Division of Rural Education is to give partic - ular help to county superintendents, school officers, and teachers in formu - lating and developing county-wide progressive school programs that will result in improvement of rural schools, more efficient teaching, standard and superior rural schools, improved equipment, and greater cooperation of home and school for better schools. Schools in the open country are being improved by professional supervision, by better trained teachers with high ideals, and by the local leadership in the rural communities. The Rural School From the earliest colonial history of the United States down to the present time, schools have been locally self-governing units. Whatever progress the American school system has made has been brought about through this traditional plan of school organization. Our forefathers realized that the welfare as well as the preservation of our republic depended upon educated citizens. The early colonists laid the foundation for the public school, the high school, the college, and the university of today. Since almost all of our early schools were one-teacher rural schools, we are compelled to admit that our pioneer ancestors received from these schools the educational training that enabled them to build so well the foundations of our present institutions. The old district rural school was the meeting place of our pioneer communities and there were learned the lessons that were an inspiration to build America's glorious past. The rural schools have contributed to the formation of habits and ideals in the lives of men and women who have helped to build and preserve our nation. Today you may observe in Nebraska good and poor rural schools; poor, sometimes, not because of lack of effort or lack of interest on the part of the people of the district but for reasons beyond their control. For example, a district in one of our sparsely settled counties has 4% sections of land. The total valuation of the district is $25,000. </seg>
            <seg id="p072">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT This district is $1,400 in debt. There are eighteen pupils enrolled. They are voting a high tax levy. The district is too small to comply with the legal requirements for state aid. Economically it is impossible for them to have a school that will take care of the educational needs of the boys and girls. Contrastthis school with another school in a more prosperous county. It is a rural one-teacher school. The building and equipment of this school are worth $10,000 — two-fifths as much as the entire prop - erty of the other district mentioned. This $10,000 rural school is made of brick and has a fine basement neatly plastered and decorated which is used as a play room and assembly room for the community. The building is heated by a splendid furnace; the library upstairs is well equipped. The life of that community centers around the one-teacher school. The teacher is a college graduate and a community leader. There are many, many situations in the one-teacher rural schools in Nebraska comparable to the latter school described. Better Rural School Program Our great task is to take the rural school as it is and make it the best school that can be made. Our boys and girls deserve the finest educational advantages for they will become the future citizens of a free America. With the cooperation of county superintendents and rural school officials, we are working to improve the rural schools by giving them greater assistance. With more help from the county superintendent to the individual teacher, we hope to secure more efficient teaching. We are working for an increased number of standard and superior, rural schools furnished with adequate libraries and good, healthful equipment. This better rural school program may be brought about by means of greater cooperation between home and school. The result will be better trained boys and girls. More Efficient Teaching in Rural Schools The most important factor in any school is the teacher. If you have a highly trained, conscientious, and enthusiastic teacher, working either in a one-teacher, sanitary, frame schoolhouse or in one of the finest equipped schoolhouses in the city, you will find the results in the lives and characters of the pupils to be approximately equal. "As the teacher, so is the school." The influence and efforts of a good teacher cannot be sufficiently rewarded. We cannot measure the harm effected by a poor teacher. A poor teacher works incalculable injury every day she is in the schoolroom. In order to enthuse teachers with the desire to do better work, Nebraska is recognizing superior rural school teach - ing by presenting standards for better teaching and awarding recogni- </seg>
            <seg id="p073">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION tion certificates to deserving teachers. These standards take into con - sideration the professional spirit of the teacher, the program and classi - fication of the school, classroom instruction, schoolroom routine, super - vision of playground, housekeeping, community activities, character traits of the teacher, the pupil's attitude, and results as evidenced by the work the child is able to do. Recognition of better rural school teaching was awarded by the State Department to 57 teachers in 1929 and to 68 teachers in 1930. See Rural School Standards Bulletin, pages 46-57, inclusive. State Elementary Course of Study Revised "Section 6324. General Management. The district school boards shall have the general care of the schools and shall have the power to cause pupils to be taught in such branches and classified in such grades or departments as may seem best adapted to a course of study which the school boards of any county shall establish with the consent and advice of the State Superintendent. * ♦ ♦" "Section 6385. • ♦ ♦ Course of Study. ♦ * * The course of study for the first eight grades in common schools shall be composed of the following subjects: agriculture, bookkeeping, civics, drawing, arith - metic, English composition, geography, grammar, history, mental arith - metic, orthography, penmanship, physiology, reading. The State Superin - tendent with these subjects for a foundation shall lay out a feasible course of study adapted to rural school conditions keeping in view the good of a thorough education for the child in these branches rather than to the completion of the course in a given number of years. •-•••» The 1929 Nebraska Course of Study for the rural schools states clearly and definitely the nature and the amount of subject matter to be covered in each subject throughout the eight years of work. It also includes the method or methods of procedure for teaching the required units of subject matter in a way that, as one county superintendent says, "Any teacher can get across the work well if she follows the Course of Study that we now have." The State Course of Study not only takes into consideration the rural environment but it has been made expressly for the rural schools and their needs and is rural in setting and in content. The Course of Study was revised in 1929 for t&gt;.e purpose of bring - ing about a more thorough knowledge by all pupils of the funda - mentals of education and to emphasize character building in the teach - ing of all subjects. The subjects that were revised in 1929 are arith - metic, reading, health education, civics, drawing, and character educa - tion. The English course was reorganized. It was enriched by includ - ing instruction in citizenship training that is based upon the child's experiences and which may be taught by means of stories, poems, songs, games, and dramatizations. The Course of Study includes not only the </seg>
            <seg id="p074">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT essential facts and principles to be learned but it has been enriched by including suggested activities for the children while they are learning these facts and principles. Activities in health education and character education have been correlated with all other subjects of the curriculum. Farm accounting and farm problems conforming to actual farm situa - tions'and problems based on the 4-H Club work are included in the arithmetic activities listed for seventh and' eighth grades. Problems in thrift, habits of accuracy, habits of neatness and- honesty are empha - sized in the arithmetic course. The arithmetic course is related to the common fundamental affairs of life and business relationships. One helpful feature is the presentation of the fundamental processes, step by step. The work is simplified so that pupils may master the work and every effort has been put forth to prevent failure and to bring suc - cess to the child. The standards for promotion for the third grade and above are listed so that parents and teachers can check on pupils' achievements. The principle has been widely recognized that the child should have much opportunity for self -activity. He should study things rather than so much about things. Through the Course of Study this office has pro - moted vitalized teaching and the motivation of school work. We believe in the doctrine that Comenius stressed more than three hundred years ago: "In the place of dead books, why should we not open the living book of nature? To instruct the young is not to beat into them by repe - tition a mass of words, phrases, sentences, and opinions gathered from authors; but it is to open their understanding through things. We must cffer the pupils not the shadow of things but the things themselves which impress the sense and the imagination. Instruction should com - mence with a real observation of things and not with a verbal descrip - tion of them." The school work should relate the child to his environment and materials in such a way that he will work with a will, with an enthusi - asm, and a well-defined purpose. According to old methods, definitions and principles were taught and then were applied. At the present time the children discover by the guidance of the teacher rules and definitions and principles for themselves. Throughout the revision of the Course of Study, it has been at - tempted to make the course a real help and guide to the teachers. The State Course of Study is motivating and vitalizing the school work throughout Nebraska. Forty-four pages are devoted to a most excellent course in character education. The course in drawing for rural teachers aims to add to the beauty and consequent richness and contentment of the lives of boys and girls on the farm. Lessons in geography, as outlined, should make a significant contribution to the child's consciousness of what it means. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION to live together in organized society. A study of how geographic en - vironment influences life activities may result eventually in interna - tional understanding. Citizenship training may be taught in the history lesson. The biographies of our great men and stories of courage and early American history will have an influence on the lives of the boys and girls. Pupils become interested in realizing ideals of civic honor and patriotism by reading experiences which portray such, ideals. The civics course that is being taught to the fifth and sixth grades includes home training for citizenship, school training for citizenship, organization and government' of school, school maintenance, how schools are financed, duties of school boards, etc. Seventh and eighth grade civics in - cludes civics for the state for the odd year and a study of the civil govern - ment of the nation for even years. It is our purpose that the emphasis which is placed on the teaching of history and civics in the Course of Study will result in respect for, reverence for, and obedience to the supreme, fundamental law of the United States. The course in health education takes cognizance of facts and prin - ciples to be impressed, attitudes to be developed, and habits and skills to be acquired. The units worked out for the first four grades are : Nutrition; Use of Fresh Air and Sunshine; Exercise, Posture, and Play; Sleep and Rest; Care of the Skin, Hair, and Scalp; Care of Teeth and Mouth, Nose and Throat; The Healthful Home and School; Control of Infection; Safety. Special activities and activities in language, spelling, arithmetic, writing, reading, and art are listed in order that certain facts and principles may be impressed on the lives of the boys and girls. In the health education program are listed type lessons emphasizing the evil effects of narcotics and drugs. A complete course is offered for the purpose of giving to the boys and girls the information regarding alcohol and other narcotics. Nebraska schools propose that health edu - cation shall be placed on an equal basis with the other subjects of the curriculum in order that the boys and girls may develop such health habits as will make for the most complete physical efficiency. The de - veloping of a healthy personality as given in the course for the first four grades is a phase of health education that is truly building char - acter. Parents as well as teachers will be interested in the carrying out of the health education course as outlined. The immediate objectives in the teaching of reading, the habits and skills to be developed, the standards of achievement in reading, and definite helps to the teacher in the teaching of reading are all given in detail so that there should be more efficient and purposeful learning on the part of the pupils. Pride in Nebraska as an agricultural state is expressed throughout the Course of Study by its consideration of the rural environment of the Nebraska schools. To those who are interested, we would call attention </seg>
            <seg id="p076">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT to the activities listed in the course relating to 4-H Club work, the farm accounting course, the farm marketing problems, measuring of . fields, cost of painting of buildings, cost of fencing, the making of graphs for the purpose of comparing rainfall, graphs of the changes in prices, crop surveys, cost of growing and feeding livestock, suggested correlations of agriculture with English, the enriched course in practical agriculture, and the use of the agricultural bulletins. Patrons will be interested in making a study of the entire course. The Nebraska alternation plan is not complete alternation and com - bination of classes. The plan has been adjusted for the best interests of the individual pupils. Refer to the circular on "Organization of the One-Teacher Rural School" for the details of the plan. The alternation plan that is in use in the rural schools at the present time has proved to be satisfactory. It enables the teachers to have fewer and longer recitations and to devote more time to directed study. This plan gives the teacher more time for the individual pupil. The completion of the courses of study and passing satisfactorily the final eighth grade examinations under the direction of the county superintendent entitle the pupils to the privileges of the free high school law in Nebraska. .

The course of study for the high school grades shall be the Nebraska High School Manual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the 'State Superintendent of Public Instruction." In compliance with the law, the eighth grade examinations have been prepared by .the division of rural education and sent out to the county superintendents. They have been held by county superintendents on specified dates in January, April, and May. The January examina - tion is a "Special" examination in a few subjects designed to enable pupils to do better work by taking a few of the minor examinations in January so that the pupils may devote more time to the remaining major subjects. The purpose of the final eighth grade examinations is to determine the eligibility of pupils to receive free high school tuition from the county to be paid for high school instruction in public approved high schools. According to the law all eighth grade pupils, public, private, church, town, city, or rural, regardless of the school they are attending, must pass these examinations in order to be entitled to the privileges under the free high school law, namely, free high school tuition. The questions are based upon the Elementary Course of Study. Every effort has been put forth to make these examinations a fair and a reasonable test of the pupil's ability to carry on the high school work. These examinations conform with the Standards for Promotion as listed in the Elementary Course of Study. The examinations also serve as standards for the teachers to diagnose deficiencies in the pupil's work and ere helpful to the teachers in suggesting remedial measures. Standard Rural Schools Standardization of rural schools is a voluntary procedure on the part of the schools themselves. No right of self-government or control is affected by standardization. Satisfactory physical environment is considered very important to the school life, health, and progress of children, and has led to definite standards in buildings, toilets, grounds, and working equipment. All progress in education ought to be approached through the people and every effort is being made on the part of the State Department of Publie Instruction and the county superintendents to develop within our rural people, a public sentiment and consciousness for better schools. They purpose to secure the best one-teacher schools possible by complying with definite standards which are conducive to greater care in providing healthful educational advantages for rural children. </seg>
            <seg id="p078">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Poor schools are due largely to neglect and lack of personal interest and support. Boys and girls are entitled to good instruction in a clean, sanitary, well-lighted, well-ventilated schoolhouse with proper seating and heating, surrounded by attractive and well-kept school grounds. The improvement of rural schools through better buildings, better equipment,' better teaching, and definite community cooperation is being realized through standardization. Four years ago, there were 386 standard rural schools in Nebraska. The most recent report shows that today there are G74 standard rural schools. This represents an increase of 75 per cent in the number of schools maintaining these improved condi - tions. Standardization of rural schools will continue for we find every - where that local school officials and county superintendents are con - tinuing their efforts to standardize rural schools and to make them, more efficient. (See list of standard rural schools on pages 99-104.) A 64-page bulletin on Standards for Rural Schools was prepared in 1927. Fifteen thousand copies of this bulletin were printed and dis - tributed. In 1929 and 1930, ten thousand copies of a 76-page revised edition of Standards for Rural Schools were distributed. This bulletin contains the minimum requirements for standardization, the official score card for standard and superior rural schools, a general explanation of the Nebraska Rural School Standards, floor plans suitable for one and two-teacher rural schools, the law regarding our flag and flag pole, flag code, playground equipment, hot lunch equipment, library books for pupils, music helps and records, standards for recognition of better rural school teaching, and a list of Nebraska standard schools. The following are the minimum requirements of standard schools: 1. The school term must be at least nine months in length. 2. The teacher must have one year of expeiuence or the . equivalent in training. 3. School grounds must be adequate, well drained and kept clean. One or more acres of ground is. recommended. 4. There shall be a good well on the grounds or nearby and sanitary methods for the use of water must be provided. 5. The school must provide single . desks of suitable size adjusted to the needs of the children, and the room must contain at least fifteen square feet of floor space to each child. 6. The schoolroom must be lighted from, the left or the left and rear with the window area equivalent to one-fifth of the floor space. 7. The heating. must be of some approved type and the room must contain 200 cubic feet of air space for each child. </seg>
            <seg id="p079">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 8. The school must be equipped with teacher's desk and chair, dic - tionary, globe, maps, blackboards, and up-to-date textbooks. 9. Sanitary methods of cleaning must be employed. 10. Outbuildings must be placed as far apart as possible, and kept clean and free from marks. In front of each, there should be a board shield screening the entrance. When a school reaches the minimum requirements, the teacher or school officers score the school and/request the county superintendent or state department to inspect and score the school. If a school justifies a score of 75 points, it is classed^as a standard school and a standard plate is sent by the state department to the county superintendent for the school. Many states are giving special state aid to districts which have standard schools. Legislation is needed whereby the plans of a new rural schoolhouse must be approved by a school architect, working under the direction of the state superintendent. This department is not inter - ested in dictating kinds of material, the # type of roof, the size of the building, thickness of walls, and similar details that should be left to the decision of the local group but this department is interested in regard to the school building complying with the requirements of health and sanitation and is willing to say that a check should be made relative to new buildings meeting health requirements. Funds should be avail - able for the preparation and distribution of blue prints and specifications' for up-to-date standard schools. Some of our counties have promoted an outstanding school building - program. Counties leading in this work are Seward County with 16 rural and 4 town school buildings in the past four years and Platte County with 17 new schoolhouses in the past four years. Standardization Day — Standardization Day has been observed by many rural schools. Patrons were urged to visit their respective schools for the purpose of hearing their pupils in their everyday recitations. Standardization Day should stand as a milestone in the educational progress of the rural schools in this state — a day of scoring the educa - tional facilities and of setting goals for further educational progress. '."•■.: Superior Rural Schools Four schools have been recognized as superior rural schools. These four schools are located in Lancaster, Cedar, and Butler counties (see list of superior rural schools on page 99). In order to be recognized as a superior rural school, the school must meet all of the requirements of a standard school and, in addition, must have the following: </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OF. STATE SUPERINTENDENT 1. At least one acre of school yard, neatly fenced, covered with a good sod and planted with trees, shrubs and flowers, concrete or cinder -walks to the entrance and to outbuildings. 2. A well equipped with a sanitary drinking fountain within doors. 3. Besides the schoolroom, there should be a basement, -work and play room, cloak room, and a library room. 4. The library shall contain at least eighty juvenile books, ten suitable for each grade, a standard school encyclopedia, suitable dic - tionaries, and a supply of the bulletins published by. the United States Government and the University of Nebraska, useful in the school and in the community. 5. There must be in operation a Parent-Teacher Association or a community organization which secures the hearty cooperation of the parents with the school. ■ 6. When the teacher, under whose administration the school is recognized as "Superior," ceases to teach the school, it must be re - inspected to remain so recognized. The teacher should meet the re - quirements of the "Standards for Better Rural School Teaching." The teacher shall hold not less than a First Grade Elementary Certificate. The school must score 95 points. 7. In conclusion, before a school can be recognized as "Superior," it must be taught in a schoolhouse in every respect suitable to the best work; it must be equipped with everything necessary; it must be taught by a teacher of superior qualifications and. skill; the course of study must be well covered by the pupils; the people of the district must cooperate to make the school "Superior" in every respect. The work of the teacher, the pupils, and the patrons, is of first importance. Before asking for inspection with a view to being recognized as a "Superior" school, the school should be thoroughly inspected by the county superintendent to make sure that all the requirements have been met. If, in his or her judgment, the school is -meeting requirements he should arrange for inspection of the school by a representative of the state department at the time that the- high schools of the county are being inspected. - If it meets with approval, a date should be arranged for the recog - nition of the school as a "Superior" school. Approved Non-Accredited High Schools Provisions of the Law — Article IX, Section 6386: "The county supcrintvmlunt of each county where a county high school in not maintained shall within thirty (301 days after the annual meeting certify to the county board uf .supervisors or commissioner;! the number of qualified pupil* </seg>
            <seg id="p081">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION as provided in Section 6385, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, whose parents or guardians have applied to the county superintendent for free high, school tuition privileges, the amount necessary to pay the high school tuition of said pupils for the ensuing school year at the rate of three dollars (*S.OO) per week or fraction thereof, and a list of school districts which have been approved by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction as schools qualified to grant free public high school education to non-resident pupils under the provisions of this act. Upon receipt of said certificate, the said county board shall levy on all taxable property in the said county a sufficient tax to pay said high school tuition as certified by the county superintendent: Provided, said board shall exclude from said levy all the actual valuation on all of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved four year high school, shall exclude from said levy three-fourths of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved three year high school, shall exclude from said levy one-half of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved two year high school, and shall exclude from said levy one-fourth of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved one year high school. ••••••■ Purpose of Approval — Many of the smaller schools are unable to meet the standards set for accreditment to the University of Nebraska, not being able to maintain more than 9, 10, or 11 grades of work. In justice to the children who live in such districts, this department requires such standards as may reasonably be met and which may bring about greater educational progress. School districts complying with these standards may collect tuition for non-resident pupils. They are also exempt from the payment of high school tax as provided above. Approval of High Schools — Approval of high schools under the authority of Section 6386 of the School Laws is a function of the State Department of Public Instruction and is fundamentally for the purpose of providing high school privileges to boys and girls. Certain problems of approval, however, present themselves, namely, the proposition of exemption from the county-wide high, school tax on the one hand and authority for the collection of free high school tuition from non-resident pupils on the other. Quality of academic work, qualifications of teachers, equipment, ability to support such a program, and other matters natur - ally enter into such a proposition. General Plan — Applications for approval of all high schools for the collection of free high school tuition will not be made until immediately after the beginning of school in September, on or before the close of the third week of school, when the high school in its various grades is actually set up and in operation. All schools that are applying for ap - proval, either in part or in whole, should make application very soon after the beginning of school. Final approval of schools will not be given until June 1, by the State Department of Public Instruction, at which time county superin - tendents, county clerks, and county treasurers will be notified of the </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT approved schools in their respective counties. In other words, a school or added grades must be set up and in actual operation before it receives the consideration of this office for approval. Exemption from the high school tax levy or any part of the high school tax levy will depend upon the approval of the school as reported by the State Superintendent for the year just past. This seems to be the most logical course of pro - cedure under the laws as they exist in the statute books at the present time. Schools that desire to be approved shall submit reports called for by the State Department of Public Instruction; teachers shall meet the requirements of the State Department; the requirements as given in the 1927 Rural and Village High School Bulletin and the 1930 Supple - ment shall be fulfilled. Acceptance of credits of pupils from an approved high school is dependent upon the judgment of the' school authorities to which such pupil applies for admission. ' This department strongly urges all high schools in the state to admit pupils from approved high schools subject to evidence of their ability to continue their school work in a satisfac - tory manner in the new school. Such admittance does not presuppose that pupils from an approved school shall be subjected to an entrance examination. We believe the attitude of all schools should be to en - courage young people in their quest for an education. Classes of High Schools — For the purposes of approval, public high schools are divided into two classes: Accredited High Schools and Minor Accredited High Schools (refer to Report of the Division of Secondary Education). Approved Non-Accredited High Schools — In addition to those ac - credited to the University there are a number of smaller schools offering one, two, three, or four years of high school work. The schools that meet the standards required by the State Superintendent are approved as one year, two year, three year, or four year high schools, depending upon the number of high school grades taught, and are eligible to col - lect free high school tuition for non-resident pupils. (Refer to the list of approved non-accredited high schools on pages 96-99.) Of General Interest— The 1927 Rural and Village High School Bul - letin and the 1930 Supplement to the Rural and Village High School Bulletin include information regarding the free high school .tuition law; the high school approval requirements; distinction between approved and accredited high schools; suggested two-year and four-year high school programs; lists of laboratory equipment in agriculture, domestic sci - ence, general science, manual training, and physics; outlines in English including general reading lists; detailed outlines of the courses in the ninth and tenth grade subjects; and suggestions for demonstration day, achievement tests, and better study habits.. The 1929 Nebraska High </seg>
            <seg id="p083">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION School Manuals are most helpful and are distributed by the Registrar of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. No high school tuition may be paid by district, county, or state funds to any sectarian or denominational school. "No sectarian in - struction shall be allowed in any school or institution supported in whole or in part by the public funds set apart for educational purposes." — Article VII, Section 11, Constitution of Nebraska. Inspection of Approved High Schools, Conferences, and Circular and Personal Letters to Teachers of Approved High Schools — Personal letters have been sent in response to the detailed reports that are re - quired from each school and all inquiries. Circular letters and confer - ences by this office aid in the work. The rural and village high schools are inspected and approved by the Division of Rural Education. Progress of Approved Non-Accredited High Schools — Special effort has been put forth to improve the work in the approved non-accredited one-year, two-year, three-year, and four-year high schools. During the year 1929-30, there were 307 approved non-accredited high schools in Nebraska. During the past three years, 24 approved non-accredited high schools have steadily progressed and are now minor accredited schools. During this short time, eleven of the approved non - accredited high schools have added to their equipment, raised the teach - ers' qualifications, continued to improve, and have reached their goal of full accreditment to the University of Nebraska. During the last school year, there were 3,603 pupils enrolled in the approved non - accredited high schools. It is the aim of the department to encourage zealous efforts on the part of those in control of the small high schools, to make them the best schools that they can be made, and to offer good, thorough work to the high school pupils in these small schools. The boys and girls in the small high schools are entitled to the best educational advantages. The following facts gleaned from reports indicate that a large majority of the approved high school teachers are' meeting the challenge of better educational opportunities for boys and girls in small high schools. Sixty-three approved non-accredited high schools have reported that standard achievement tests were given during the school year 1929-30. These tests were based on fifteen high school subjects. The standard achievement tests have been given for the purpose of informing pupils and teachers of the achievement of pupils. These tests have proved to be good incentives for study. They have enabled teachers to diagnsse weak spots in the pupils' achievement and the points where the teachers' .instruction should be improved. Practically all approved non-accredited high schools will use the standard achievement tests this year. </seg>
            <seg id="p084">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Excellent reports have been received from the high schools that' observed school demonstration day and patrons' day during the school year 1929-30. This is another achievement indicative of progress. One county held a county-wide demonstration of the work of the two-room Schools in which seven schools participated. In another county, in - creased, interest resulted from holding the fourth annual scholastic contest. The records that have been made by pupils of the approved high schools in the accredited high schools, in colleges, and in later life, largely determine the progress that has been made and that is being, made by the approved non-accredited high schools. It is a real satisfac - tion to learn of the many honor students in the accredited high schools who have come from the small approved high schools. It is most en - couraging to find outstanding school men in the state, who have com - pleted their ninth and tenth grade work in the small approved, high schools. One advantage that the small approved high school gives to the students is personal attention, personal interest, and habits of indus - try and work. Rural Students in High Schools — The great increase in enrollment in the high schools throughout the state is of general interest. There has been an increase of 18 % per cent in the number of free high school tuition students during the past four years. During the year 1925-26, there were 17,251 free high school tuition students while in 1929 there were 20,454 boys and girls attending high school under the provisions of the free high school education law, making, a gain of 3,203 free high school tuition students or 18% per cent. The number of tuition students has almost trebled since 1919 when there were only 7,031 free high school tuition students enrolled. The total number of eighth grade graduates who finished in May,' 1930, was 12,657. The following 45 counties report 6,419 of this number: Adams, Banner, Blaine, Box Butte, Boyd, Buffalo, Butler, Chase, Chey - enne, Clay, Coif ax, Cuming, Dakota, Dawes, Deuel, Douglas, Fillmore, Franklin, Frontier, Furnas, Garden, Garfield, XJreeley, Howard* Kimball, Knox, Lancaster, Lincoln, Logan, McPherson, Madison, Morrill, Nance, Nemaha, Otoe, Platte, Red Willow, Saline, Seward, Sheridan, Sioux, Stanton, Washington, Webster, Wheeler. Five thousand one hundred and seventy-five of the 6,419 eighth grade graduates reported by the above named counties are attending high school this fall, showing that in 45 counties of the state 81 per cent of those finishing the eighth grade in May, 1930, are having their high school tuition paid this year. In the entire state last year, there were 20,454 non-resident students. In addition to this number, there was an estimated number of 8,286 rural students attending consolidated high, rural high, county high, and approved non-accredited high schools, making a total of 28,740 rural students attending approved and accredited high schools in the year 1929. </seg>
            <seg id="p085">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Importance of Rural Leadership The rural school problem of today is fundamentally a problem of local leadership. The many outstanding examples of fine rural school situations in the country demonstrate what can be accomplished by rural communities. We need to think constructively from actual basic rural conditions up to better rural schools rather than attempting to think down from some higher realm of theory. Advancement in education will come from local leadership. The sure, safe way of improving schools is to develop public senti - ment for better schools. With the public's good will, a school system can do almost anything. Without it, little can be accomplished. This office is happy to do what it can to stimulate interest in better rural schools. Our experience shows beyond doubt that the rural people in the various communities are glad and willing, in the great majority of cases, to improve their schools by their own choice as far as economic factors make it reasonably possible for them to do so. Therefore, we urge and encourage the organization of Parent-Teacher Associations, community centers, and kindred organizations that consider the interest of the home and school. Greater interest has been developed in the Nebraska schools through the community organizations, Parent-Teacher Associations, and county school board associations. The State Department is glad to encourage every community activity that results in participation by the rural peo - ple themselves for the rural life of Nebraska today has its full share of intellectual capacity, ability, and leadership to form wise judgments regarding its own affairs. It is our earnest desire that public senti - ment for better schools may be developed and that the patrons of the school may present a united body in working together for the best interests of the child in physical, mental, moral, and spiritual educa - tion. In order to realize the highest ideals in health education, worthy home membership, learning, wise use of leisure time, vocational and economic effectiveness, faithful citizenship, and ethical character, pro - gram discussion material has been prepared and distributed by this office. Discussions have been participated in by patrons in community meetings on such subjects as "Character Building," "Children's Read - ing," "Health," "Importance of Play," "Safety," "Accident Prevention," "Standards for Rural Schools," "Music Appreciation," "Thrift Educa - tion," "Art Appreciation," and "Better Films." Many improvements have resulted from these discussions.

            <seg id="p086">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Saline, Saunders, Sheridan; Sherman, Thurston, Washington, Webster, and Wheeler Counties report 788 community organizations including many Parent-Teacher Associations, and 12 County Councils in Parent- Teacher work. The following summarizes the comments that have been made by the county superintendents relating to the benefits of the community organizations to the schools. "There has been increased interest in school and increased fellowship in community. Parents now understand school conditions. We have had better schools and communities — greater progress. Parents are brought together, common interests are developed. New pianos, playground equipment, libraries, pictures, hot lunch equip - ment, and trees for the school ground have been added to the equip - ment of our schools. Now we have better understanding between par - ents and teachers. The Parent-Teacher Association is partly responsible for our school nurse. The standard of work has been raised and discipline and attendance have been aided." • School Officers' Convention A County School Board Association is one of the very best agencies for arousing interest in and securing better rural schools. Since the improvement of a school is so dependent- on the school board and com - munity, this department is interested in the organization of School Offi - cers' Associations in order that school officers may become better in - formed as to the needs of the school, educational progress and policies, school equipment, plans for modern school buildings, and financing of schools. Members of this department have addressed School Board Associations in many counties. Financial- Problems of Rural Schools The comparative study of school districts in Nebraska proves very conclusively that there is very great inequality of educational oppor - tunity, due not so much to the lack of desire on the part of people in many districts to have good schools but caused instead by inequality of distribution of economic and property values as compared with the distribution of population centers. In other words, the rural schools and small town schools are being supported in about 95 per cent of their expenditures by local taxation only. Therefore, some communities are able to maintain very good schools with comparatively low assessment while others are forced . to maintain a very poor school with a very high assessment. Then again, there is a large amount of corporation property grouped in the crowded centers of population which is not carrying any burden of school taxation at any place in the state. We need appropriations from the nation in order to get back some of the benefits of the wealth which is moving steadily T from the farm to the large financial centers. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The nation owes a great financial debt to the rural districts not only for the production of- foodstuffs but for the expenditures of the rural dis - tricts in the education of the young people who have been coming from the rural districts into the industrial and business life of the cities. It would be interesting to know the exact number of young people who have been educated in the rural districts who are now filling positions of re - sponsibility in the cities. Study of Taxation Problem Doubtless the proper approach to this question of taxation is a state tax commission created for the purpose of studying the whole prob - lem of taxation in general as it exists in Nebraska. The result of the findings of such a tax commission would be of great value to us in out - lining a plan that will work toward a gradual and definite program of taxation for the maintenance of public schools. It is well known that much of the farm property of the state is real estate. This property is paying a maximum amount of taxes at this time. Whenever the payment of taxes means confiscation of property we are in a dangerous situation as far as any individual school district is concerned. Libraries A survey last year of the libraries of 30 counties has brought lists of 35,125 books reported by 1,290 teachers or an average of only 27.22 library books in each school listing library books. Of this number, a school averaged 14.63 books of fiction. Fifty-six teachers reported that there were no library books in their schools. Three-fourths of the schools reporting, reported one set of reference books or encyclopedias. Lincoln County has a county school library and Fillmore County reported a circu - lating library. Reports from the following counties show that 275 schools used traveling libraries during the biennium: Adams, 25; Banner, 3; Blaine, 1; Box Butte, 10; Boyd, 3; Buffalo, 15; Butler, 10; Chase, 2; Clay, 22; Coif ax, 4; Dakota, S; Dawes, 10; Deuel, 3; Douglas, 3; Fill - more, 22; Frontier, 7; Furnas, 2; Garden, 5; Garfield, 3; Greeley, 4; Hall, 10; Hamilton, 5; Howard, 7; Jefferson, 10; Keith, 2; Keya Paha, 6; Kim - ball, 15; Lancaster, 20; Madison, 4; Nemaha, 5; Platte, 6; Sheridan, 10; Sherman, 3; Stanton, 4; Thomas, 2; Wayne, 1; Wheeler, 6. Cherry, Cum - ing, Gage, Lincoln, Otoe, Saunders, Seward, Sioux, and Washington Counties also report that some of their schools used traveling libraries. "Section S336. School district library.— The school board or school trustees of every school district within this state shall set aside annually.from the general funds collected for the use of the district the sum of five dollars per teacher employed within the school district as shown by the annual report to the county superintendent. The amount so Bet aside shall be known as the district library fund and shall be by the school board or school trustees of such district annually . invested in books other than the regular text books, which books so provided shall be suitable for the district school library." •' "&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p088">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The survey of the libraries demonstrates the need of the library law just quoted which provides for the enrichment and enlargement of the school library. The rural school library is a most important feature of the rural school equipment. Good reading is of real value. It gives information that will help in the school work and it brings inspiration and recreation that broadens one's life. A pupil should form the habit of reading good books that will help him during his entire life. Library books will help the boys and girls by enriching their vocabulary, by teaching them to reason and think for themselves, by teaching them the greatest funda - mental truths, by giving them the ability to get thought from the printed page and to follow printed instructions. Good books also teach them to appreciate beauty in every form of art, literature, and life. They give boys and girls ideas and food for thought. Good reading inspires and trains them and brings out the best that is in them. Good books imbue them with a love of reading so that there may be opened up to them the wonderful world of literature and the wisdom handed down to us through the ages. Good reading is an important factor in character building. When rightly presented, our best stories and poems contribute much of moral value, i Children learn to admire strength, courage, and nobility, and to censure weakness, cowardice, and evil. Through literature, the children live again the stories that they read and unconsciously set up ideals and appreciations that are lasting. Annual Conferences of County Superintendents Conferences of county superintendents were held in Lincoln on Jan - uary 29 to February 1, 1929, and oh January 28 to 30, 1930, for the purpose of presenting the educational program of the state superintend - ent's office to the county superintendents; of assisting them in organ - izing the routine work and the administrative duties of their offices; of presenting methods for improvement of instruction in the rural schools; of giving them an opportunity to exchange ideas and help in their clerical and administrative work; and for the purpose of enthusing them to become community as well as educational leaders in their counties. Themes of the conference were:. Supervision and Improvement of Teaching, Character Education and Supervision, Service to Our Schools und Community, and Service to Society through Character Education. Good supervision- will result in improvement of teaching. Good teaching contributes a great deal to the development of useful, upright, and happy citizens. Topics discussed were: Rural School Libraries — Books, Culture and Character; Helps in Supervision — Supervision of Reading, Demonstration in Second Grade Reading, Helping the Weak Teacher, What Constitutes a Good Recitation, Improvement of Instruction Through Bulletins to </seg>

The state superintendent recommended that the county board of supervisors in each county pay the expenses of the county superintendent of that county to the county superintendents' conference since the pro - gram was full of practical help and vital interest in the administration of rural schools. Group meetings of county superintendents have also been held in the state. Administrative problems and improvement of instruction have been discussed in these meetings. County-Wide Rural School Activities Character Building Clubs for the Boys and Girls The character education course includes a plan for the organization of clubs for boys and girls whose objective is cooperation with the teacher in making a true success of school work, growth in character, arid achievements and undertakings which are expressions of true citizen - ship. County superintendents have presented plans to their teachers and have organized good citizenship clubs in the schoolroom whose benefits are carried over into home and community life. Many of the </seg>
            <seg id="p090">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT schools choose their own names, for example, "True Americans," "Stu - dent Council," "The Builders," "Busy Bees," "Make a Better School Club." Some of the benefits to the children as summarized by rural teachers are initiative, originality, resourcefulness, and creativeness de - veloped in the children, responsibility of the pupils for the school, a spirit of service and friendly cooperation, true patriotism, reverence, respect, honesty, courage, assistance to the teacher, closer contact be - tween the patrons and the school, and an atmosphere which makes school pleasant for both the pupils and the teacher. Like all parlia - mentary organizations each club has a constitution and by-laws adopted by the club and signed by every member. Good Citizenship Clubs — Eight hundred eighty-six Good Citi - denship Clubs have been reported by the county superintendents. The number organized -in each county is as follows: Boyd, 50; Butler, 40; Cuming, 80; Dundy, 75; Fillmore, 87; Franklin, 24; Frontier, 24; Fur - nas, 80; Garfield, 25; Harlan, 42; Hitchcock, 62; Howard, 64; Loup, 6; Madison, 37; Morrill, 35; Nemaha, 32; Saline, 42. Brown, Cedar, Chase, Cherry, Clay, Dawes, Greeley, Hall, Kimball, Lincoln, Saunders, Sheridan, and Thurston Counties also report clubs. Junior Red Cross — In many counties the Junior Red Cross units correlate their work with the work of Good Citizenship Clubs. The Junior Red Cross aims not only to build character through their activi - ties but also to promote international friendliness and understanding. Some of the activities carried on under the Junior Red Cross leadership are the formation of citizenship clubs, making of first aid kits, carrying on foreign correspondence, filling. Christmas boxes, and exchanging port - folios with children of foreign countries. Great stress is placed on friendship, health, and service. Twenty-two counties report that they have a total of 853 Junior Red Cross units with the following number in each county: Adams, 67; Cedar, 80; Chase, 15; Clay, 131; Cuming, 70; Dawes, 79; Dundy, 3; Fillmore, 25; Franklin, 16; Frontier, 89; Furnas, 30; Gage, 5; Garden, 20; Greeley, 29; Harlan, 8; Hitchcock, 33; Howard; 2; Nance, 67; Nemaha, 21; Richardson, 12; Saline, 6; Stanton, 45. Coif ax, Deuel, McPherson, Thurston, and Cherry Counties also report Junior Red Cross units. Mr. Theodore Shank, Assistant National Director of the American Junior Red Cross, reports that the number of Nebraska chil - dren engaged in some fdrm of Red Cross work increased from 33,000 in 1928 to 54,000 in 1929. Uncle Sam's Boys and Girls Clubs — The work of Uncle Sam's Boys and Girls Clubs is being stressed in Saline County with 5 clubs, in Deuel County with 3 clubs, and in Clay, Cedar, Greeley, Dundy, Franklin, Hitchcock, Lincoln, and Nance Counties. Knighthood of Youth— The National Child Welfare Association, Inc., Educational Bldg., 70 5th Ave., New York City, sponsors a character </seg>
            <seg id="p091">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION training project, "The Knighthood of Youth." The child begins as a Page and receives a Page badge. Through adventures in character building dramatized as a journey to the Castle of Knighthood he ad - vances in rank. He receives successively a badge for the rank of Es - quire, Knight, Knight Banneret, Knight Constant, and Knight Crusader. The "Adventure Folder" recommended for each club member pictures "A Journey to the Castle of Knighthood," the roadway a child should travel. It contains a "Castle" and a "Reminder Card." On the "Castle" are recorded his Knightly Adventures, namely, his character developing activities at school and at home. The "Reminder Card" may be used as a help in his daily adventures. One school in Butler County is trying this plan. Sheridan, Cherry, and Kimball Counties are hoping to intro - duce this work. Other Club Activities — Rhythm bands are reported in Clay County, 12 health clubs are reported in Franklin County and 2 health clubs in Fillmore County; School Improvement Clubs are reported in Garfield and Banner Counties, and Good English Clubs are reported in Dawes, Kimball, Hitchcock, Garfield, Cedar, Greeley, Cuming, and Adams Counties. Four-H Clubs, Campfire Girls, Girl Scout, and Boy Scout Troops are reported in many counties. Read-More Clubs and a Nature Club are reported by Cuming County, 3 Geography Clubs are reported by Hitch - cock County, and the Willing Workers, Help One Another Clubs, and Wide-Awake Health Clubs are reported by Lincoln County. Other clubs are reported by Saunders and Saline Counties: Loup County reports that the Always Ready Helpers' Club is an outstanding student organization and has been instrumental in purchasing a radio for a Loup County school boy who was accidentally shot and who will never walk again. A few of the following comments by county superintendents may be of interest: Clay County — The schools should be definitely organized along some patriotic and character building program to be ready to combat the "Young Pioneers" and other communistic organizations. Saunders County — Teachers whom the county superintendent has interviewed are unanimous in expressing approval and say that the clubs are of great help to them in their discipline and in the general management of the school. Butler County— School clubs are by far the best medium for teach - ing citizenship that has yet been found. There is an improvement in courtesy and thoughtfulness of pupils. Dundy County — Good Citizenship Clubs are a great help in discipline. Harlan County — Good Citizenship Clubs are the big channels through which health, character, and good citizenship may be taught. </seg>

General Activities of the Division of Rural Education u ? le i )i . r ? !toP ° f Rural Education assists the county superintendents, school officials, and teachers in their work for the improvement of the rural schools. Field work in the main consists of school visitation or inspection of the approved non-accredited high schools for purposes of approving them to collect free high school tuition and to receive state apportionment. Again we are called upon to speak before county, dis - trict, and state teachers' associations and various group organizations such as the parent-teacher associations and school board associations. The work of this particular division cannot, however, be measured merely in terms of inspection or statistical data concerning buildings and grounds, libraries, equipment and personnel. The larger purpose i?. after all, the setting up of those conditions that will minister to the £?£"*/* cltizenshi P&gt; to the ennobling of character and the helping of childhood "to achieve a life of rich significance." To this end this division will continue to hold itself iri readiness to meet every new responsibility. . . </seg>

THE CHALLENGE The American experiment of providing secondary education privi - leges to adolescent youth has grown to such a prodigious extent that many are asking the question of whether or not the nation can indefi - nitely continue to pour out its vast sums of money m the support of a program that as yet has not universally been looked upon as a success. There are, here and there, notes of warning being sounded, not only by the laymen and taxpayers but by professional educators as well, that should be heeded. Secondary education m America does present a challenge. We find it comparatively easy to join with Dr. Phillip W. L. Gox of Ohio State University and ask ourselves the question, "Where do we go from here?" We are reminded by Dr. Cox that the American high school is an anomalous institution with two conflicting functions neither of which can be safely ignored. It is both and at the same time a prepara - tory institution fitting selected students for admission to higher institu - tions of learning and a "finishing" school for educating and training adolescent boys and girls to assume responsibilities as wage earners and citizens. The. development of proper "standards of accreditment" that will safeguard the best interests of those destined to continue m college and university and that will guarantee adequate educational opportuni - ties • for "all the children of all the people" whether they continue m further educational pursuits or not becomes exceedingly difficult. It is true that the latter function, relatively speaking, grows less important as the greater numbers of high school students find it possible to continue their preparation m such higher institutions of learning as the normal schools and teachers colleges, the junior colleges and the tra - ditional colleges and universities. In 1880, 4 per cent of our youth from the ages of 15 to 18 were enrolled m high schools. Today, better than 55 per cent of them are enrolled. Certainly, 75 per cent of those living m high school districts are thus enrolled. There were only 3 per cent of persons from the ages of 19 to 22 doing college work m 1880. Today, this figure has been increased to 20 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p108">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Quoting: from the writings of Dr. Cox: "The public high schools, supported as they are by universal taxation and controlled by popularly elected school boards and legislatures, have been forced to modify their purposes and practices at least in theory. They have been obliged to justify their existence in terms of human attributes rather than in terms of subject mastery. "The embattled subject-matter teachers in secondary schools and colleges are struggling determinedly against overwhelming odds. . . Parents who criticize the school for failing their children are kindly told that these youths do not belong to the public school, which is supported by public taxation but is dedicated to "high standards" Local school boards are often dominated by the academically ' elite State legislation, while not rescinding the protection given to subject - matter teaching through certification of teachers, definitions of classes of schools, and the rest, nevertheless has compelled school boards to provide for the health objective and the citizenship objective and the vocational objective more adequately than most school administrators otherwise would have done." 1 In a very real sense, such an indictment cannot be escaped by many of the so-called "academically" inclined school people. This office would voice the opinion, however, that much has been done and is being done throughout the State of Nebraska and elsewhere to bring about a more certain recognition of the more practicable implications of the "Seven Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education." Progress is being made in insuring a higher degree of physical perfection, better control of the tool subjects, finer citizenship, wiser use of leisure time, and more ideal practices as to ethical conduct. That we have not gone far enough goes without saying. Much re - mains to be done. We look forward with expectancy to the contribu - tions of the National Survey of Secondary Education. It is to be hoped that the many volumes of fact will be translated into working principles and practices capable of adoption by all the teachers, supervisors and administrators in our secondary schools. More important than all else, so far as Nebraska is concerned, is the whole-souled acceptance of responsibility by each teacher, principal and superintendent to the end that each school will become a living dynamic institution concerning itself with not only the individual and his proper development but also with the social responsibilities in creat - ing a social body of persons mindful of proper social relationships. There is a need for "the modern, creatively controlled high school." To the creation of this school are called the men and women of the profession who dare to do the undone, who dare to be brave, and who 1 "Junior-Senior High School Clearing House", October, 1930, page 68. </seg>
            <seg id="p109">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION dare to give of themselves without stint or measure. "The spirit of the emerging: high school is the spirit of youth. If it will bravely face its problems regardless of the criticism of the regressive elders, it will con - tribute richly to the welfare of our nation and of our world." The Reorganization of Secondary Education One of the major changes being effected in secondary education, and one which has and is affecting both elementary and higher institutions, is the reorganization of the secondary school as an institution. Factors responsible for these changes include these: the extension of the elective system from higher institutions of learning downward into secondary schools and even elementary schools, particularly in grades seven and eight; the organization of departmental teaching; differentiation of course offerings; individualized instruction techniques as opposed to mass teaching; the making of more flexible schemes of grading and promo - tion; and the enlarged curricular programs intended to better suit the needs and interests of ever-increasing enrollments. In the main, reorganization is tending to the shortening of the ele - mentary school program to six years, the creation of the junior high school and the senior high school of three years each and, finally, the addition in certain large and metropolitan areas of the two-year junior college. Instead of eight years of educational opportunity, we have gone to a twelve-year program and, more recently in selected communities,- to a fourteen- and sixteen-year educational program. As early as 1888, we are told, President Elliott of Harvard raised the issue of shortening. and enriching our elementary and secondary school courses and recommended a condensed school program shorter in duration and richer in content. That an eventual attainment of some such goal is not far distant is a growing certainty. There are many who now predict the eventual re - organization of elementary, secondary and higher education on a 6-4-4 basis, all of this to be topped by the specialized training provided in graduate schools guaranteeing adequate training for the several pro - fessions. . Beginning with the famous report of the Committee of Ten (1892), The Committee on College Entrance Requirements (1895), the Dewey address on "Current Problems in Secondary Education" (1901), the Com - mission of Twenty-one (1904), and The National Education Association Commission on the "Reorganization of Secondary Education" (1917-1918), we find ample historical evidence of the very early recognition of what was impending. From these studies and the many educational writings called forth by them, it is only fair 'to conclude that a reorganization of public education is imperative. Disparity within present administrative units cannot be justified. There is an excessive amount of duplication within the several units and there is in all too many instances evidence of discontinuity between the </seg>
            <seg id="p110">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT present administrative units. There is need for unification, simplification and adequate sequence, all of which suggests a fundamental problem to be attacked by all school administrators, supervisors and teachers. Educational Outcomes Recognizing in all essentials the far-reaching effects of the reports of the National Education. Association Commission on "Reorganization of Secondary Education" and admitting in theory, at least, the signifi - cance of that commission's pronouncement in re the "Seven Cardinal Principles," we are forcekl to conclude that so far as the revision of our several courses of study is concerned, we have not as yet sufficiently translated these ideals into working units of subject matter to the end that these, per se, and their presentation have been sufficiently effective in realizing in actuality the fundamental objectives so unanimously ac - cepted and hailed as worthy of our supreme endeavors. The Nebraska statutes provide that the University of Nebraska shall prescribe a reasonable course of study precedent to admission, all of which must be under the sanction of the Board of Regents. The statutes further provide that the University may admit students without examination when such students have completed courses in schools ac - credited by the University. The statutes are very specific in providing, under Section C385, that "the course of study for high school grades shall be the Nebraska High School Manual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the state superintendent of public instruction." In 1928 there was appointed, therefore, under authority of the Chan - cellor of the University of Nebraska and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, a Committee of Seven who were empowered to pro - ceed with plans looking to a revision of the High School Manual. The members of this committee were Charles W. Taylor, State Superinten - dent of Public Instruction, and George W. Rosenlof, Director of Secon - dary Education and Teacher Training, representing the State Depart - ment; Superintendent A. H. Staley, then president of the Nebraska State Teachers Association, and Principal R. M. Marrs of South Omaha High School, representing the Nebraska State Teachers Association; W. H. Morton, Principal of the Teachers College High School, H. C. Koch, Professor of Secondary Education, Teachers College, and A. A. Reed, Pro - fessor of Secondary Education and University Examiner, representing the University. Mr. Reed was designated as chairman and Mr. Rosenlof as secretary of this committee. This Committee of Seven, during its first year, did prepare a pro - gram of studies and curriculum features and reviewed and co-ordinated the work of the several committees on courses of study. The courses of study submitted were used in their preliminary form throughout the Nebraska schools for one year, were then revised and finally' adopted jmd printed in the High School Manual as of 1929. </seg>
            <seg id="p111">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The Committee of Seven was later designated as a continuous body and will soon begin upon a further revision of the Manual, fully expect - ing to completely revise the form, content, and general plan of the vari - ous courses now set up. It is the committee's hope to set up a detailed scheme by means of which each of the "many now universally accepted outcomes may be provided for through the units of subject matter out - lined in each course. With one exception the committee remains .un - changed. Superintendent C. Ray Gates of Grand Island displaces Super - intendent A. H. Staley of Hastings. At a meeting of this committee on November 15, 1930, it was decided that a thorough study be made of all existing data pertaining to funda - mental philosophies underlying secondary education, particularly those having any bearing on curriculum construction, and that this committee agree upon certain fundamental principles and policies basic to . the reconstruction of all courses of study. It was also held to be the province of this committee to welcome all fact-finding studies such as the investigation now being carried on by the Nebraska State Teachers Association to set forth the status of English teaching in the Nebraska high schools and to encourage similar studies in other fields of academic and non-academic subject matter. The State Department of Public Instruction will eontinue to offer its services in making available all of its data and records and jn coun - seling with various bodies engaged in studying the whole probiem; of objectives and outcomes and curricular offerings. The Function of This Division In the last biennial report of this office 1 we set forth what, in the main, were the chief functions, duties and responsibilities of this division. Attention is- particularly called to the fact that we "must ever be a student of the many significant and far-reaching changes that are taking place in the reorganization and redirection of the secondary school." This implies that our attention shall be directed to any investigation that lends any light to the solution of problems. Two studies have been made recently that are indeed indicative" of changes in the status of the teacher. The first of these was made in connection with an invitation from the Department of Rural Education of the N. E. A. to discuss the subject of "Rural Teacher Preparation in the Agricultural Mid-West." The second of these has just been cdm- Fleted, and reveals very clearly the status of the elementary and secon - dary school teacher in the accredited schools of Nebraska. 1 Thirtieth Biennial Report of the State Superintendent of Public In»truction Janu - ary. 1929, pp. 9S-98. «■-•;■ ■ . </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Rural Teacher Preparation in the Agricultural Mid-West 2 The United States Commissioner of Education, Dr. Cooper, speaking before the Department of Rural Education, recently stated that "the little red schoolhouse" in the light of present day conditions must be looked upon as a "necessary evil." If the expression used connotes the building: of pioneer days, with its equipments and all "appurtenances thereto," so typically called to mind in Whittier's beautiful lines: "Still sits the schoolhouse by the road, A ragged beggar sunning Around it still the sumacs grow And blackberry vines are running," et cetera, then, we should want to agree with him; but 1 am not unmindful of the fact that today the one-room rural school where it must continue to exist is rapidly taking on "new airs" and is coming into its own as a neces - sary unit of educational activity, shorn of most if not all those features that have made it the "butt" of many a rude joke and have set it up as the object of much unpleasant conversation. There are throughout the plains regions of the middle west, those regions one time referred to as part of "The Great American Desert," areas that shall always present obstacles to "consolidation" for better administrative, supervisory and instructional service. Economically, so - cially and physically it will be impossible for decades to provide for any other type of educational opportunity than that of the one- and two-room Tural school. It is true that in recent years some of our one-teacher schools have disappeared and the rate at which they continue . to cease their existence will be lessened with each succeeding year. In Nebraska, a typical midwestern agricultural state, there are today less of the one-room rural schools and the enrollments in the schools have grown less from year to year. In 1924 there were 6492 rural schools in charge of 7255 rural teachers. The enrollment in these rural schools was re - ported to be 133,896 pupils. In 1929 there were 6208 rural schools with 6382 teachers in charge of the 106,767 pupils enrolled. That is to say, there are today 284 less rural schools, 873 less rural teachers and 27,129 less rural pupils than there were five years ago. Putting it another wty, 284 school districts in 1929 did not attempt to maintain separate schools. They voted to transport their children to other districts and pay a tuition for their schooling. As a matter of fact, the statistics show that there were actually 131 more individual school districts in 1929 than in 1924. Another unusual condition in Nebraska, for example is the fact that while there are 27,000 students less in the rural schools! 'AOdreas deliroroJ by Dr. G. W. Roseniof in February. 1930. at the annual meeting at the Dcj.nrtr.ient of Rural Education of the N. E. A.. Atlantic City, N. J. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ■ it is not altogether due to urbanization, for the total enrollment in both graded urban and rural elementary schools has decreased 17,776. Industrialization and its attendant tendency to urbanization, together with improved highways and better means of transportation, are im - portant factors in the elimination of the one- and two-room rural school. In a very real sense, too, the lessened number of children of the elemen - tary school age is proving to be an important factor. Census reports for 1919 and 1929 show an increase of 25,000 practically. But for 1924 to 1929 the increase has only been 292. We cite these facts to show that for the past five years conditions have been very materially stabilized in Nebraska and that we have, apparently, reached a plateau, • so to speak, in the descriptive curve of growth and development. What is true of Nebraska, we are rash enough to suppose is quite characteristic of ■ the middle western agricultural area of the United States. Without the facts at our disposal, we can only venture an opinion.. For an army of boys and girls in the elementary schools of the middle west, almost half of whom are in our distinictly one- and two - room rural schools, there must be trained a very large number of teachers. The training of this large number of teachers has constituted and does constitute a very serious problem. Whether it is more im - portant to train teachers than to equalize the tax burden for educational purposes and thereby equalize educational opportunity is a question not unlike the question of which came first, the egg or the hen that laid the egg. Frankly, we do not know which is more important, to train teach - ers or secure funds. It is certain, both' problems must be solved and perhaps in the solution of one lies the solution of the other. The question resolves itself into this query: "From whence shall they come and to what degree shall they be trained?" The latter half of the question involves necessarily a consideration of such matters as the nature of the training to be given, the degree of specialization pro - •vided and the length of such training in terms of years or semester hours. In the States of Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Mis - souri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming — states to which we have confined our inquiries — the teachers colleges, universities, normal schools and high school normal training classes have been sharing the responsibility. In all of these states save Colorado, North Dakota and Oklahoma, and to a lssser extent South Dakota and Montana, the high school normal training classes have been and still are an important and, dare we say it, seemingly necessary agency for the training of rural teachers. </seg>
            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT . Believing Nebraska to be typical of many phases of the problem, we have made a more or less intensive study of the status of the rural teacher with a view of revealing some of the problems confronting us in the middle west and of proposing certain guiding principles by which to direct our future program. (A complete statistical summary follows this discussion.) ■ Experience ■'....■ Of 5385 teachers in one-room rural schools in 87 per cent of the 93 counties in Nebraska, 1580 are found to be teachers who are teaching their first year. This number represents 29.3 per cent or practically 30 per cent of all teachers in one-room rural schools. Add to this number 1107 persons who have had but one year of experience prior to this year and we find ourselves faced with : the fact that 50 per cent of the teachers in our one-room rural schools are and were new to the teach - ing profession last year and this year. Less than. 25 per cent of our rural teachers have taught more than four years. Slightly less than 14 per cent of some 300 teachers in the two-room rural schools and 9.5 per cent of the 95 elementary teachers in open - country consolidated schools are new to the profession, while 23.5 per cent of the teachers in the two-room rural schools and 17.9 per cent of those in open-country consolidated schools are teaching their second year. That is to say, 37.4- per cent and 27.4 per cent of the teachers in these schools are or were new to the profession during the past two years. There appears to be a considerable range in the percentage of in - experienced teachers in the several counties of the state. In two coun - ties, we find less than 15 per cent reported as new teachers, Saunders county reporting only 10.8 per cent and Hall county, 13.8 per cent. Thirty counties report from 30 to 35 per cent new teachers, while thir - teen counties report from 35 to 40 per cent new teachers. Teacher Tenure or Turnover More startling than the above figures are those dealing with teacher tenure. Of 5216 teachers included in this 'study, there were 3214 or 61.7 per cent who were new to their present teaching positions this year. Again, 1294 others, or an additional 24.8 per cent, are -teaching their second year in their present positions. Sixty per cent of our teachers are apparently changing positions annually, while 85 per cent of our teachers change positions each biennium. In the two-teacher schools the percentage of teachers new to their positions is shown to be 53.6, while in the consolidated schools it is 35.3. An additional 25 per cent are teaching in their present position for the second year. Again, we notice a high percentage of teachers of short tenure. - </seg>
            <seg id="p115">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION As to the uniformity characterizing teaching tenure, it is interest - ing to note that in 4 counties the number of persons new to their posi - tions represent 30.9 per cent to 33.3 per cent. Twenty-five counties report 50 to 60 per cent turnover this year; twenty-seven, from 60 to 70 per cent; and eighteen report more than 80 per cent turnover, the great - est being Banner county with 88 per cent turnover. Training Thirty-five and five-tenths per cent of more than 4700 rural teach - ers, representing 72 counties of Nebraska, are persons who have had the high school normal training program. That is, 1670 teachers have not had the privilege" of any college instruction but have had professional training on the high school level. On the other hand, 29.3 per cent of these teachers, or 1388, have had one year or more of college training. Almost ten per cent of the Nebraska rural teachers have met the desir - able minimum of two years of college training. Hall County and Nemaha County report less than 15 per cent of their teachers as being without any college work. At the other extreme is Morrill County with 83 per cent of its teachers without college training. Five counties reported from. 55 to 65 per cent of their teachers without college training. Twenty-one counties, it is seen, reported less than 25 per cent of their teachers without some college training. Salaries Twenty-five per cent of the 5400 teachers in one-room schools for whom we had reports are receiving less than $80 per month or $720 a year; 59 per cent of these teachers are receiving from $80 to $100 per month and the remaining 16 per cent are receiving more than $100 per month. The best available information leads us to conclude that the average salary is practically $95 per month or approximately $855 per year. Some Conclusions 1. Progress is being made in improving the status of the rural teacher in the middle west. Studies covering the past 20 years in Ne - braska bear conclusive evidence of this fact. 2. The high school normal training program has been justified not only because of its having laid the groundwork of professional training that has been most effective in the rural schools, but on the further basis that it has been and is distinctly cultural as well as professional and has stimulated in a most remarkable degree the desires of students to continue their college training as rapidly as possible. The students taking the course have almost invariably represented the best students in our high schools and colleges. When one considers that there were 1580 new teachers out of the 5385 for whom we had reports and at the </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT same time that there were 1670 reporting no college training one does not have to draw on his imagination to conclude that these people are moving on to college as rapidly as possible and are fitting themselves for more efficient teaching. It is reasonable to assume that in a very definite manner high school normal training has been and is stimulating the desire for better preparation. 3. With so large a number of teachers coining into the profession annually, our state teacher- training institutions cannot with their present facilities and equipment provide a sufficient number of teachers to meet the demand. Until such a time as these facilities are provided wej shall be forced to continue the program as now organized. 4. It is equally true that with the present reported oversupply of teachers we might be able for a limited period to care for the demands but unless the higher institutions of learning meet the problem, there would, in our judgment, come the time very soon when the rural schools would begin to suffer. It is no less true today than it was a few years ago that it is not a question of high school normal training versus col - lege training but of normal training versus no training it all. 5. That the state teachers colleges are not training sufficient teach - ers for the rural schools is shown by the fact that the four state teachers colleges in Nebraska reported for last year slightly more than 400 cer - tificates of the general elementary and rural type. Two-year certificates issued for both elementary and secondary fields numbered less than 400. 6. That a similar condition does exist in a number of our mid - western agricultural states will most surely be admitted by anyone who has gone into the problem to any extent at all. 7. So long as high school normal training does setm necessary it should be the business of those in authority to so completely organize and supervise the course as to insure that only the moist efficient pro - gram will be set up. Such a program should be directed ly teachers who are unusually strong in subject matter, both academic and professional, who have had an intimate acquaintance with problems of rural life and education and who are permitted to confine their entire time, practically, to this work. The curriculum should consist of at least one full year's work in professional training for two semester hours credit and two full years of professionalized subject matter training for four I semester hours of credit In addition to this, students should meet all other requirer ments for graduation and college entrance. - 1 8. Too little attention has been given to rural community life and to the rural home. The rural home is too often isolated, unattractive and inconvenient. Rural, life may similarly be described. Conditions, it is </seg>
            <seg id="p117">OP PUBLIC INSTRUCTION admitted, are much improved. We must not forget that agriculture is distinctly a "mode of life." For these reasons— and perhaps others— it is highly essential that young, inexperienced teachers he given oppor - tunity to study and consider such problems as a course in "Rural So - ciology and Economics" would provide. This course should extend over one semester of the year. 9. Every teachers college and normal school should most certainly recognize that its task of training rural teachers is no less important than that of training teachers and administrators for our urban elemen - tary and secondary schools. The department of rural education should be as real and as effective as any other department. It should be so or - ganized and so staffed as to become a potent force in attracting the best students to its courses. In fact, it should be the very best and most im - portant division of the entire college, so far as Nebraska is concerned. It is not enough to secure one or two instructors of more or less mediocre training, set up a few courses in rural school methods and man - agement and sociology and then say, "Whosoever will, may come!" No! We should build the institution around the three or four large re - sponsibilities the school must recognize. Rural education would be one of these and into it we would not only invite but urge our best students to go. With such leadership as this procedure would insure, we could much more quickly look to an early day when the rural communities would recognize and properly appreciate the value of the "superior teacher of college training." 10. We urge the importance of moving forward in our efforts to set -up standards by means of which our rural schools might become "Standard" or "Superior" schools. Such a program would most cer - tainly create a demand for the better trained teacher. 11. There is a considerable difference of opinion as to the justifica - tion of a "fifth year" program of normal training. Some would hold to the policy of requiring all students to complete the four year high school education and then continue a fifth year in the school in order to fit themselves for teaching. This fifth year would be an intensive training course. Others would hold that a fifth year was inadvisable but would recommend the setting up of a county normal training school in each county offering a one-year course in teacher training. Still others would propose that the junior college now coming to the fore should, among other things, train our rural teachers. And finally, others would limit it to the province of the teachers college and normal school. Those who oppose the high school as a teacher training school are in agreement with Ingles, who, in effect, says that the field of the secondary school is that of the skilled trades. Professional and semi-professional training will be given in schools of a higher grade than the secondary school. </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT • I 12. It is safe to conclude that we cannot completely overturn the program of teacher training for the rural schools, as now being pro - vided. Nebraska should provide for an official fact-finding body em - powered to study the entire question through all of its many -ramifica - tions. Such a body would make its recommendations in such a way as to provide for a gradual transition to the new program. Such a. period should not be less than five years perhaps. It is reasonable to assume that all agencies would have ample time to readjust themselves to the new order of things. And most important of all, the rural schools, the institution for whose improvement we are most concerned, would in no - wise suffer for our failure to provide qualified teachers during the interim.

And finally, it must; be borne m mind that at no time have we or do we consider the high school normal training program as an ideal plan for the training of teachers for our rural schools. We are m agreement with all those who hold that, ideally speaking, our rural teachers should come from our higher institutions of learning just as we now require our urban teachers to come from these institutions. This program must be recognized as merely an expedient and as the most effective means of solving a practical problem. We should be most untrue to our ideals were we to hold any other position. We all look forward to the time when the practical solution becomes the ideal — when the ideal program becomes practicable. High School Normal Training From the foregoing discussion, it is very clear that the Department must continue its position as set forth two years ago. There have been no -changes so significant as to justify a recommendation that the pro - gram cease forthwith. The law does not permit this office to refuse to recognize the continuance of a program where it is carried on m full compliance with the rules and regulations as now operative. The only responsibility we can assume is to discourage the continuance of the program m those communities where the evidence very clearly indicates there is no demand. A number of communities have taken action to that end within the past six months. Others will undoubtedly follow m the near future. Those schools now approved to offer normal traini»g are designated by an asterisk placed to the left of each one listed on pages 121 to 125 of this report. For a further discussion of the problem, we call your attention to our last biennial report Normal Training Statistics for the Biennium 1928 to 1930 1 1928-29 1929-30 Number of Normal Training Schools 231 232 Number of Normal Training Students Enrolled — Juniors.. 2,661 2,546 Seniors 2,399 2,290 Number of Normal Training Graduates 2,057 1,973 Number of Normal Training Schools Receiving State Aid 188 182 Number of Normal Training Schools Receiving Credit for the Course, but not Entitled to State Aid 24 34 Plus: Approved for Senior Work Only. 0 "4 Approved for Junior Work Only 8 1 Academies, Private and Parochial Schools Ap - proved for Credit, but not Entitled to Share m State Aid ■ H n 1 Sec Biennial Report of January, 1929, for data covering previous years, pp. 108-109. </seg>

Unless a graduate of an accredited school, the candidate for admission must be prepared' to take an examination in those subjects in which entrance credits are desired; provided, that graduates from non-accredited four-year high schools may be excused from taking the academic examinations by passing an intelligence test with a standing that shows ability to do the work of a college freshman. Accredited schools are such as are found to meet the standards of ac - creditment, these standards being set forth in detail in the High School Manual. There is now but one list of schools fully accredited to the Univer - sity of Nebraska. For the convenience of the smaller communities, how - ever, the University of Nebraska has. established a list of minor accred - ited schools, the graduates of which may receive fourteen units on cre - dentials, giving them conditional admission to the college. Additional credit can be secured by examination or by completing satisfactorily thirty college hours of work. By an arrangement entered into by this ■ department and the Uni - versity of Nebraska, the University Committee on Accredited Schools receives from and accepts reports of school visitation made by the offi - cials of the State Department of Public Instruction.

The object of the Association is one of establishing closer relation - ships between the secondary schools and institutions of higher learning within the group of states in the North Central areas as well as such other areas of the United States. as the Association elects to recognize. Membership is purely voluntary. There is and can be no com - pulsion. Any school choosing to become a member of the Association may make application therefor and having been examined by those authorized to make such examination and. having been found to. meet the standards as set up will be recommended for approval. To quote from the Constitution, "All decisions of the Association bearing on the policy and management of higher and secondary insti - tutions are understood to be advisory in their character." In general the standards for accreditment are in all respects higher than those now being set up and maintained ' by the University of Ne - braska. The significance of this plan of regional accreditment lies in the fact that graduates of such institutions as are accredited to the Association are admitted to most, if not all, higher institutions of learn - ing in the United States. Neither does this Association seek to control the individual schools when accredited either as regards their course of study, their curriculum, their plan of organization for administration and supervision, the personnel of their faculties, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION This Association has approved the applications of 107 public high schools and 13 private high schools in Nebraska. Schools so accredited are indicated on pages 121 to 125 and are designated by a dagger placed to the left of the name of each school. The Status of the Teacher in the Accredited School In previous pages of this biennial report, we have set forth certain statistical data relative to the rural teacher in Nebraska teaching in one-room rural, two-room rural and open-country consolidated schools. . In a similar manner, we have collected from accreditment blanks hied annually in this office data concerning the items of training, experi - ence, tenure and salaries of elementary and secondary teachers in accred - ited schools for the school year 1929-1930. At the outset, we differentitated between fully accredited and minor accredited schools, as well as those schools approved as normal training high schools, combining these later to find the status of elementary and secondary teachers separately considered in'all accredited schools. These in turn were combined to find the status of all teachers, both elementary and secondary. To this we finally added data relative to rural teacher in one-room schools and thus secured data for 10,916 teachers (including superintendents and principals). It should be pointed out that we elimi - nated entirely all data pertaining to teachers in those schools employing more than 30 teachers in grade positions. This excluded the records for some 13 of the largest cities. We have data, therefore, for better than 75 per cent of the entire teaching personnel. Because of limited space, we must content ourselves with a setting down O f only a few of the "high spots," leaving it to graduate student and those particularly concerned with research to make a more refined analysis of the figures. Throughout the following discussion, we refer to rural schools as those of throne-teacher type. Urban schools are all graded schools in Nebraska offenng twelve grades of work, there being at least two higj school teachers in each in addition to such grade teachers as are neces - sary to the successful carrying on of a program. Experience (For reference see Tables II and III) « Elementary teachers in normal training schools (fully accredited) ranged m experience from 71 with no experience to 76 with more than 20 years of experience, the median experience of 1394 teachers being t FTJ* 5 yearS and 6 m ° nths - Twen ty-°ne and six-tenths per cent had 10 years or more of experience, while 23.9 per cent had less than 3 years. </seg>

            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Elementary teachers in fully accredited schools (non-normal train - ing) were reported to range from 82 with no experience to 66 with more than 20 years, the median experience of 993 teachers being 5.3 years or approximately 5 years and 3 months. Slightly less than 25 per cent had taught 10 years or more, while 29.3 per cent reported less than 3 years of experience. In minor accredited schools, the figures are not so favorable. For 166 teachers reported, 39.8 per cent reported less than 3 years of ex - perience. At the other extremee, 16.4 per cent reported more than 10 years, the median experience being 3.9 years or 3 years and 8 months. Combining the records for all elementary teachers in all accredited schools, the reports show 170 teachers, or 6.6 per cent, with no previous experience, the median experience being 5.4 years (5 years and 4 months). Column 12 of Table II shows that 29.3 per cent of all rural teachers had no previous experience. Only 12.9 per cent had more than 4 or 5 years of experience, the median experience being 1.9 years or 1 year and 8 months. Finally, while our tables do not show the combined totals for all elementary teachers, rural and urban (Columns 8 and 12), it may be said that the median experience of 7938 elementary teachers was 2.7 years (2 years and 6 months). Slightly more than 22 per cent of the elemen - tary teachers were new to the teaching profession. Of the 1750 new teachers, 90 per cent were teaching in one-room rural schools. " Turning to the teachers in the accredited secondary schools for 90 per cent of whom we have information, we report the following con - cerning experience. In normal training high schools, 13.4 per cent, or 231, had no pre - vious experience. In fully accredited non-normal training high schools, 138, or 12.5 per cent of the total number, were new to the profession. In minor accredited high schools the percentage was much higher, being 18.5 per cent. For all secondary schools for which we have data, 13.3 per cent were new teachers without previous experience. Teachers having more than 10 years of experience in high school represent 22.6 per cent of the normal training high school teachers, 28.4 per cent of the teachers in fully accredited schools, and 18.4 per cent of those in minor accredited high schools. In all high schools, the percentage was 24.5. The median teaching experience for each group was 4.6 years or 4 years and 5 months, 4.9 years or 4 years and 8 months, 3.5 years or slightly more than 3 years and 4 months, and 4.6 years or 4 years and 5 months. Strange as it may seem, the experience record of elementary teachers exclusive of those in the one-room rural schools was higher than that of secondary school teachers. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Of the 10,916 teachers, including superintendents, principals and supervisors, 2147 or slightly less than 20 per cent were reported as having had no previous experience, bearing in mind the fact that slightly less than three-fourths of these were rural teachers. Eleven and nine - tenths per cent, or 1304 teachers, had a record of 10 years or more of experience. Three per cent had taught more than 20 years. The median experience of all teachers was practically 3 years. Tenure (See Tables II and III) When it comes to the matter of tenure within the profession, we are forced to admit that our status is at a rather low ebb. As a matter of fact, there may be progression within the profession but this is being seriously negated by the fact that more than one-third of our urban teachers are in a constant procession each year moving from one school to another. Add the rural teaching population of whom 60 per cent move annually and we find that practically 48 out of each 100 join in . the processional of educators seeking annually for "greener pastures." Looking first at the data for elementary teachers, 30.5 per cent of those in normal training schools, 35.8 per cent of those in fully accredited non-normal training schools, 40.3 per cent of those in elemenetary schools of the minor accredited group were new to their positions. Com - bining these several groups, we find that 845, or 33.4 per cent, were new to their positions. More than 75 per cent of the elementary teachers in normal training schools had a tenure of less than 5 years, the same being true of those in fully accredited non-normal training schools. In minor accredited schools, the percentage was shown to be 90.9. In all schools other than one-room rural schools, 79.2 per cent were reported as having a tenure of less than 5 years. In one-room rural schools, 59.7 per cent were new to their positions, whereas 95.2 per cent reported a tenure of less than 5 years. Of 5531 elementary teachers, 35.7 per cent were new to their positions and 81.1 per cent reported a tenure under 5 years. Those reporting more than 10 years of tenure varied from 7.3 per cent to 1.2 per cent for the several groups, for all urban groups being 6.4 per cent. The median tenure of elementary teachers in all fully accredited schools was 2.8 years or 2 years and 7 months. For minor accredited schools, it was 2.1 years or approximately 2 years and 1 month. For all elementary urban schools, it was 2.7 years (2 years and 6 months). Add to this the data for rural teachers, and we find the tenure reduced to 1.97 years. Turning now to high school teachers, including superintendents and principals, 39.1 per cent of those in normal training schools were new to </seg>
            <seg id="p132">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT . their positions. In non-normal training high schools, the percentage was 34.9, while in minor accredited schools the figure rose to 47.5 per cent. For all fully accredited schools, as well as minor accredited schools, the percentage was found to be 37.8. Teachers reported as being in their present position 10 years or more represented 4.6 per cent in fully accredited schools and 1.2 per cent in minor accredited schools. For all secondary schools, the percentage was 4.2. Still more significant was the fact that 62.9 per cent of the teachers in normal training high schools reported 2 years or less in their present positions. In non - normal training high schools (fully accredited) the figures indicate 62.1 per cent with 2 years or less in tenure. In minor accredited schools, we find that 77.8 per cent of the teachers report tenure of 2 years or less. For all secondary schools for which we had data, 63.8 per cent moved during a two-year period, while 76.6 per cent changed positions within e. three-year period, only 23.4 per cent reporting tenure of 4 years or more. The median tenure of secondary teachers in the several groups varied from 2.1 to 2.5 years, the median being 2.5 years (2 years and 5 months) for the entire number. There is very little, if any, difference in tenure of urban elemen - tary and secondary teachers, as shown by the foregoing analysis. For all urban elementary and secondary teachers, the tenure was shown to be 2.6 years (about 2 years and 6 months). Training (See Tables IV and V) The training of elementary teachers in the fully accredited normal training schools varied from one person reporting less than 12 weeks of college or normal school education to 95 persons reporting 120 weeks or more. There were shown to be 39.7 per cent of these persons with less than 2 years of college. Only 12 per cent approximately had less than one year beyond college. Better than 60 per cent of these teachers had 2 years or more. The median is estimated to be 2 years plus 6 weeks cf summer school. For the fully accredited non-normal training schools, only 2 persons reported less than 12 weeks of college, whereas 101, or 10.2 per cent of the number, reported 120 weeks or more. The percentage with less than one year was almost the same as that just noted above. Better than 56 per cent of this group had 2 years or more. The median here is estimated to be slightly more than 2 years. In minor accredited schools, 4 (2.5 per cent) reported less than 12 weeks, while 7 (4.2 per cent) reported 120 weeks or more. Thirty-six per cent of this group reported 2 years or more, the median being practically from one year to one year and 9 weeks. </seg>
            <seg id="p133">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION For all elementary teachers in urban schools, only 7 out of 2387 had less than 12 weeks. On the other hand, 196, or 8.2 per cent, had 120 weeks (degree equivalent) or more. It is shown that more than 57 per cent had 2 years or more and that 86.4 per cent reported one year or more of college. Again, the median lies somewhere in the neigh - borhood of 2 years to 2 years plus 6 weeks. The attention of the reader is called to our discussion of the training of the rural teacher on page 118. It is shown that the median here was better than 18 weeks and less than 24 weeks. For all elementary teachers, both rural and urban, the median preparation was shown to be practically 30 weeks. ■When one reflects upon the fact that our certification regulations are such that one cannot secure a third grade elementary certificate (lowest grade) on less than one year of college or, in lieu of that, on less than graduation from an approved high school normal training course of 2 years of work, we are altogether fair in assuming that, barring the fact that the latter training is not on a college level, the status of training of both rural teachers and urban teachers is much more satisfactory than the figures themselves are capable of showing. In fact, knowing the nature of the courses in high school normal train - ing, the high degree of efficiency represented in the normal training departments in our high schools, the character and quality of the stu - dents enrolled in these classes, and knowing, further, that our state examination system has operated in such a way as to eliminate a very large percentage of students incapable of passing creditably in the 17 examinations now required to be passed, we can say without any question of doubt or fear of refutation that all our teachers in the elementary schools, both rural and urban, do possess training virtually equivalent to 2 years of a specialized nature that does fit them to do a very acceptable type of work as teachers. We must not forget that more than 60 per cent of all the teachers in our urban schools have doubtless had, in addition to college, the high school normal training courses and have passed in the necessary state teachers' examinations. • It is our opinion that while figures per se do not lie that they do not necessarily reveal the whole story. There is much that is not revealed in these data just referred to. With reference to teachers in secondary grades, only 10 of those in normal training: high schools have reported less than 72 weeks of college training (about six-tenths of one per cent). The number having a degree equivalent or better represent 87.1 per cent. Only 14.8 per cent reported not having a bona fide degree. Practically 5 per cent of these held a Master's Degree. In fully accredited non-normal training high schools, there were similarly 10 persons who reported less than 72 weeks of college (about </seg>

Nine per cent of this group held an A. M. Degree. In minor accredited high schools, the percentage of those reporting less than 72 weeks was shown to be but 3.8 per cent. The percentage reported as having 120 weeks or more was 57.9. For all accredited and minor accredited schools, there were but 27 persons out of 2978 who reported less than 72 weeks of college training. Of these, only 11 had less than one year. On the other hand 84.4 per cent, or 2513 teachers, reported 120 weeks or more. Of these, 2415 held bona fide degrees, either of Bachelor's or Master's grade. There were 177 of the 2415 who held a Master's Degree. Of the total number of 10,916 teachers reported upon, only 18.6 per cent had less than 12 weeks of training on the. college level. Rural teachers alone represented 15.3 per cent of the total. More than one - fourth of the entire number, or 2742, had 120 weeks of more. Those with less than 72 weeks represented 49.1 per cent of the entire number. More than one-fifth of the entire, number held a college degree. Three out of each 100 held a Master's Degree. . Salaries (See Tables VI and VII) Finally, we come to a consideration of what is to all persons, quite naturally, an important item, viz., the size of the monetary reward for services rendered. The salaries of both elementary and secondary school teachers in the schools approved to offer normal training averaged somewhat more than those of like teachers in the fully accredited non - normal training schools. Twenty-five teachers in the elementary schools of the latter group were reported as receiving more salary than any elementary teachers in the normal training schools. Nevertheless, the median salaries seemed to favor the teachers in the normal training schools. For elementary teachers of normal training schools it was found that the median salary was $1011.94. For secondary teachers in this same group the median salary was $1410.71. For the other group, the elementary teachers received a median salary of $941.56, whereas secondary teachers received $1373.37. In the minor accredited schools the median salary of elementary teachers was $857.87, and of secondary teachers, $1213.89. The range of salaries in minor accredited schools was not so great as that of fully accredited schools. The median salary of all elementary teachers in minor accredited and fully accredited schools was shown to be $972.90, whereas that of secondary school teachers was $1394.83. Rural teachers received an annual median salary less than that of any group, viz., $847.52. </seg>

            <seg id="p139">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION For all elementary teachers included in this investigation, the median salary would if computed be found to approximate $885.27. The median salary for all teachers in the state for whom figures are avail - able was $950.74 per year. Approximately one-fourth of all those engaged in secondary school teaching or engaged in superintending or supervising the schools of the normal training group received salaries larger than $1675 per year. In the fully accredited non-normal training schools, approximately 28 per cent received more than $1675 per year. Only 10.5 per cent of those in secondary schools of the minor accredited group received more than $1675. Again,- slightly more than 10 per cent of the elementary teachers in schools approved to offer normal training received less than $875 per year. No secondary teacher in fully accredited schools received less than $875. Fourteen of the secondary teachers in minor accredited schools received from $775 to $875. As has been indicated, rural salaries averaged much less. More than 25 per cent of the rural teach - ers included in this study received less than $775. Only 15.8 per cent received more than $975 per year. Status of the Mathematics Instructor in Nebraska, 1929-30 One phase of the problem of the present status .of teachers in Ne - braska schools, to which special attention was given, was the status of the high school mathematics instructor. One of the leading mathe - maticians on the western coast, spending a few days as a special lec - turer at the University of Nebraska Summer School, in commenting upon the facts placed before him by' our office stated bhat Nebraska was to be complimented upon the high standards now prevailing as regards not only professional training but also subject matter preparation. His own state of California could not boast a better record as to subject matter preparation even though. the Master's Degree was now an essen - tial requirement of all high school instructors. The personal "Form C" reports of no less than 320 mathematics teachers in practically as many accredited high schools were carefully checked for items of college preparation, high school entrance, detailed subject matter preparation in both mathematics and physical science, teaching tenure and experience. Briefly stated, the following data are brought together: 1. Of 320 teachers, 238, or 74 per cent, report four years or more of college preparation; 54, or approximately 17 per cent, report from 3 to 4 years of college training. Only 27 report 2 to 3 years of ti-aining, while but one is reported with less than 2 years. Similarly, 239 hold an A. B., a B. Sc. or B. Ph. Degree, while 8 report an A.M. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Degree. Less than 23 per cent of those reporting do not have a bona fide degree. 2. The median subject matter preparation of these instructors is 13 semester hours of college credit in mathematics and 14 semester , hours of college credit in the physical sciences. The range of prep - aration in mathematics is found to be none at all to more than 40 hours. One hundred eighteen, or 37 per cent, report, less than 10 hours — 21 reporting no college preparation at all. Sixty report 10 to 12 hours and 162 report more than 12 semester hours of college credit. Twenty-six report more than 30 semester hours of college credit All but 20 report having had from one semester to 10 semesters of high school mathematics credit, the median preparation being 5 semester credits. Practically one-half of the number report 3 years of high school mathematics. 3. In the field of physical science, these teachers are shown to have a median college preparation of 14 semester hours. Sixty-one report no physical science training whatever. Sixty-five or about one-fifth of the entire number, have had more than 18 semester hours. 4. Three hundred twenty teachers report from no previous teaching ex - perience in the field of mathematics to more than 25 years, there being 70 new, inexperienced teachers of mathematics and, at the other extreme, 2 teachers of more than 25 years of experience. The median experience is 3 years. About one-third of the number have taught mathematics 6 years or more. 5. The total teaching experience of these persons, whether in the field of mathematics or in some other field, is reported to range from one year to more than 30 years. Thirty-five of the 320, or slightly more than 10 per cent, are new to the profession, whereas, 7 have been in the teaching profession more than 30 years. The median teaching experience of these instructors is 6 years. 6. One hundred and nine teachers, or practically one-third of the entire number, are new to their positions this year. Ninety-four are teach - ing the second year in their present position. Eleven have been in their present positions in the same school for more than 10 years. The median tenure is slightly less than 2 years. 7. Of 286 teachers reporting their annual stipend, it is found that the median salary is $1395.70, whereas the average salary is shown t» b« ?1485.00. </seg>
            <seg id="p141">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Some General Conclusions The data set forth for 10,916 teachers, including principals and superintendents employed in graded schools as well as teachers in one - room rural schools, are convincing evidences of the fact that teachers in Nebraska's schools are, in the main, better trained, more experienced and better paid perhaps than many persons have been willing to admit. It is undoubtedly true that much real progress has been made in the past ten years in the general status of our teachers as regards their training, experience, tenure and salaries. "When one has made an admission such as this, however, it must not be concluded that we have yet attained the ideal. Much remains to be done. We must accept the premise that there are certain practical bar - riers to a complete realization of desired outcomes — barriers not only professional but also economic and social that must be removed. Of recent months, much has been said concerning the problem of a surplus of teachers desiring positions in our public schools, both urban and rural. Without doubt, there is a surplus of teachers legally qualified for teaching positions. Many of these, however, represent certain spe - cific areas within the profession. That is to say, an analysis of the qualifications of the unemployed teachers will quite definitely reveal that there have been altogether too many teachers fitted for secondary than for elementary school positions. This has come about, in a very large measure, by reason of the fact that our teachers' colleges and normal schools have been forced to heed the individual demands of students seeking to be trained in the various institutions. These young people come to the teachers' colleges with the idea that they will be trained for urban positions. They have no apparent desire to enter the field of rural teaching. It is only human that an institution should provide courses in harmony with the demands of the student body. To overcome this tendency on the part of students, there is cer - tainly something, it is true, that could possibly be done. First, it is not difficult to appreciate what would be the outcome were our teacher - training institutions to make their rural teacher-training program so attractive that the students would soon find themselves, in many in - stances, turning to this field of endeavor. This department cannot and does not wish to be understood to hold teacher-training institutions altogether responsible. The fact cannot be gainsaid that one of the very large responsibili - ties of professional leaders throughout the state would seem to be that of calling to the attention of both high school and college students the possibilities that lie in the field of teacher training in our rural schools for, after all is said and done, there is no single administrative usit of control and support and physical organization which provides as much </seg>
            <seg id="p142">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT stimulus for fine, courageous and progressive educational opportunity a " does tfa e rural school. It is a truism needing no defense that the rural teacher has, in the main, always been faced with problems which she must individually settle for herself. These have always meant indi - vidual and personal growth. Faced with responsibility and charged with the task of settling difficulties without assistance from any source which is immediate and which is satisfactory to the demands, the teacher must rely upon her own personal ability. In this reliance, she has always found potential opportunity for personal growth and development in the profession. This department is .of the opinion that it would be extremely bene - ficial, not only to the professional worker but to the layman and the taxpayer as well, were we to set up an agency or agencies by means of which we could from year to year furnish for the information of the state and particularly for the teacher-training institutions data covering the whole problem of teaching needs from kindergarten to high school. There would be no necessity for arbitrary dictation. Counsel and advice supplied to proper governing bodies concerning the needs of the state will go far to regulate teacher supply in that the fields needing the greatest number of persons, as well as those needing the least number, ■will be made known to teacher- training agencies. These in turn could then determine individual policies and, in a measure, seek to control the output of their institutions. •• .•'•'. With such a program before us, there would be no such costly dupli - cation of teacher-training activities within the state— costly not only from the standpoint of oversupply in selected fields but from the stand - point of human disappointment by reason of inability to secure the type of position for which one has been trained. Why should there be ten teachers of English or mathematics or social science for each vacancy? Why should there be six hundred or a thousand teachers for elementary grade positions in graded schools when there is no need for more than five hundred, .shall we say? The training of teachers is a state's program and responsibility and as such should be subject to accurate analysis by a body authorized by the state to unify and properly co-ordinate the work of the several teacher-training agencies, not through any controls that are centrally administered but through wholesome, unbiased counsel and advice— a program of "working together" to the end that the state may look upon its task with a feeling of satisfaction, knowing that its best interests are being safeguarded by raasbn of scientific analysis and fact-finding and some sound recommendations built thereon. Such is the challenge to. which all professional groups and laymen are called. There is none more vital to the insuring of an effective' and at the same time, economic program. </seg>

The chief function of this division in connection with our responsi - bilities under the law to approve schools for the collection of free high school tuition, the collection of state apportionments, the collection of normal training appropriations, etc., is -that of school visitation. This task is one that is more important than mere inspection. It is ■ our means of becoming acquainted with what is going on in the state every day of the school year. It is our means also of bringing to the schools advice, counsel and suggestions for the perfecting of each school's pro - gram of educational endeavor. During the past biennium, every school in the state, so far as our records show, was visited once and, in ninety - eight per cent of the cases, visited twice by some representative from the office. </seg>

INTRODUCTION The desire for more knowledge and greater wisdom — the thirst for learning, is a most insatiable and deep-seated 'characteristic of a normal and intelligent human being. Only mental atrophy consequent from environment or physical need can stultify this native endowment. The universal movement among all civilized nations for the pro - motion of adult education is in harmony with the psychology of civilized life. Adult education, which means, in the accepted sense, the schooling of men and women beyond the ordinary school age, largely concerns itself with those who have not had educational advantages and with those others who desire to extend such advantages. It has become a recognized and most important phase of education throughout the world. The first world conference on adult education was held at Cam - bridge, England, in August, 1929, where 410 persons, representing 46 nations, came together. The aim and end of adult education was con - sidered to be the continued development of latent powers of humanity. The keynote of this seven-day cosmopolitan conference was "education shall be both universal and lifelong." It is a noble effort to "improve the condition and prospects of mankind through education," with an ever-increasing number availing themselves of these benefits. That this movement is attested to by many great leaders in indus - try is everywhere evident. Colonel Robert I. Rees, Assistant Vice Presi - dent of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, was one of the prominent speakers at an annual meeting of the American Association for Adult Education and spoke as a representative of corporations. He concluded his address with this statement: "We feel that the adult education movement is the greatest educational movement of today and the future." Dr. A. C. Ellis of Cleveland College, who teaches. more than five thousand adult students in classes meeting, in the main, after working hours, stated in an article published in the Journal for Adult Education in June, 1929, that, "Adults have been tested up to forty-five years of age and found to be able to learn as rapidly as adolescent children." It is furthermore evident from a reading of newspapers and periodi - cals that throughout the land there is a growing interest being mani- </seg>

Arthur Brisbane, the world-famed news correspondent, in his daily column recently wrote this: "Chicago's attendance at night schools has increased 62 per cent, attributed to lack of employment. Wise is the man, out of work temporarily, who puts his brain to acquiring knowledge. He will not remain unemployed. Oakland, one of the most pro - gressive cities in California, establishes, thanks to the University of California, the country's first 'adult educational center.' On the opening of the university for adults, students admitted in - cluded a banker, a day laborer, school teachers, two doctors, a den - tist, a photographer, clerks, bookkeeper, insurance agents, a suc - cessful merchant and two truck drivers." Dr. E. L. Thorndike, Columbia University, author of the noted book, "Adult Learning," sets forth the results of an exhaustive and scientific experiment in adult learning and, among other things, says: "These extensive experiments with adults support the general conclusion that ability to learn rises till about twenty, and then, after a. stationary period of some years, slowly declines. The de - cline is so slow (about one per cent per year) that persons under fifty should not be deterred from trying to learn .... by the fear that they are too old, and to a lesser degree this is true after fifty also. The chief reason why adults so seldom learn .... is not the lack of ability, but the lack of opportunity or desire." This work can be done. We have proved it in our schools. The adult can learn. When shown its meaning and its possibilities, the adult is eager to learn. It is not a speculation. It has been proved by science and practice. America is awakening to her responsibility for the education of all her people. It is becoming a recognized fact that ignorance is the basic cause of evil and failure. The violation of all laws and the consequences of such a violation whether they be physical or social are usually the result of ignorance — lack of knowledge, mental deficiency and defective thinking. Education is the solution— that is why we have schools. It has been found, however, with all the excellence of our public school system that we are not getting out of our schools and out of our teachers the maximum results. This fact makes «dult education all the more significant. Nebraska is one of the progressive states seeking to solve this problem through such a program. Adult Education Is an Investment The increase of educational opportunity results in better houses, more refinement in the arts, books, music, and general culture. In fact, it creates a new market for the grocer, the book seller, the clothier, the road builders, the banker. All commercial enterprises profit from the expanded vision of the educated man. From the esthetic and moral aspect, the arguments for adult education appeal to the highest ideals of our nature. Such education opens a new world to many. It touches </seg>
            <seg id="p146">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT another side of our civic life. Supplementing our splendid school sys - tem, it fills a vacancy, bridges the gulf and cements the union between literate and illiterate, the adolescent child and the uneducated parent, and promotes domestic tranquillity and happiness. He who is educated finds joy in the contemplation of the larger things — the larger, world in which he lives. To give thought to national and world subjects of universal interest gives breadth of vision, intellec - tual poise and dignity of character. We read philosophy, poetry and history, thereby enriching the store of knowledge for. practical use in daily life. This mental exercise is as indispensable for complete fit - ness and efficiency as the physical "daily dozen." The law- of mental progression or retrogression is as fixed as the law that governs the eternal stars. We speak of life as a school. If a man was born in the image of his Creator, he must have a distinct destiny in the final issue of human deeds. The very joy of existence — the thrill of life, is to know. The marvelous progress of the age, the wonders of scientific discoveries and modern inventions^an approach toward the Infinite, the source and creator of all things,- challenges human thought as never before in human history. We who are educated and are able to contemplate these marvels of modern times must stop and ask, "How about the other man of the street, the shop, and on the farm — your neighbor?" He is not moved by any of these things. He doesn't know — he is not developed. Is that to be his fxed state? Has he had what is rightfully his? Has he had his chance? We owe it to him as the keepers — the wardens holding the keys to the prison of his ignorance. We must reveal to him the primary and elementary things of life before he can comprehend the higher things. . ...-.'■ Recent Developments Two most important committees on adult education have recently been appointed and are beginning to function. One is the National Com - mittee on Illiteracy appointed by Secretary Wilber of the U. S. Depart - ment of the Interior, the other, the National Committee on the En - richment of Adult Life appointed by President Willis A. Sutton of the National Education Association and cooperating with various state committees. The Nebraska State Committee is composed of fifty-two members of which State Superintendent Charles W. Taylor is President; H. B. Simon, Vice President, and Everett M. Hosman, Secretary, and represents school officials including the chancellor of the State Univer - sity, presidents of normal schools, chambers of commerce, and various industrial interests.

            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT our desire to comply with this recommendation and prepare appropriate material for this exhibit. The plan of organization of state committees, as announced by President Sutton, seeks the cooperation of the N. E. A. Department of Adult Education, American Federation of Labor, the American Legion, the American Bar Association, the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, the Federated Women's Clubs, and other national agencies. This is exactly in line with our own state policy beginning with the adoption of our laws concerning adult education in 1927. The sponsor - ship of this influential state committee backed by the National Educa - tion Association should give renewed impetus to these co-operative or - ganizations that have been. of immeasurable help in the past. The purpose of the National Commission on the Enrichment of Adult Life is that of setting up better plans for a wiser use of leisure hours. In harmony with this purpose, it is going to be possible to provide very soon a complete program of adult education. President Sutton, sensing this, has said: . "The old theory that people do not learn after 25 has been exploded by years of research and experience. People can now see richer lives ahead of them. In proportion as we spread the knowledge of actual facts, will we add new hope in the lives of men and women and in proportion as we provide opportunities for growth, will we witness improvement and enrichment of home and community life. This is a movement to meet a great national need. The people in industry and in the professions are ready for it. Let the profession meet its opportunity and responsibility." Organization The plan has been that of setting up a uniform system of schools articulated with the public school system of the state, using the estab - lished machinery as far as possible. These schools are principally in public school buildings and under . public school teachers directed by superintendents or principals, mostly night schools, though neighborhood home classes for foreign mothers and others are a growing and import - ant part of our work. The term "adult education" has now been adopted by the National Education Association instead of "Americanization." We use the term "immigrant education" in the State Department to emphasize the immi - grant's preferred place and rights under the law, though the native born are legally entitled to equal rights. With the thousands of our alien population seeking the rights of American citizenship and those already citizens who cannot function in English, our first great task has been to reach the immigrant groups. The foreign population in Nebraska, in the main, is of a high order in character and thrift, especially in the rural sections and town communi- </seg>

How We Are "Getting!" the Adult Immigrant This problem was discussed at the National Education Association Convention meeting at Atlanta recently. We use and have been using to a large extent, the methods outlined at that meeting. In brief the following may be mentioned: 1. Arouse local interest. a. By presenting the problem of adult education as a matter of civic responsibility and pride. b. By providing effective publicity through cooperation with the local press. c. By printing timely and accurate hews stories, editorial articles, well-directed and human interest stories, etc. d. By addresses before local educational, civic, patriotic, business and fraternal organizations. 2. Be familiar with the foreign language newspapers in the community Contact the editors. 3. Use, to the fullest extent, the services of the racial leaders and or - ganizations of the various races and nations of people inhabiting the communities. 4. Know racial backgrounds familiarly enough to determine through which form of expression— music, literature, recreational and occu - pational activities— you can properly interest pupils in school at - tendance. 5. Know the foreign colonies, housing and community conditions. 6. Use, to the fullest extent, the resources of federal, state and local de - partments of education, public libraries, etc. 7. Make use of lodge rooms, community houses, public and parochial school auditoriums, factory cafeterias and lecture rooms. Present lectures, entertainments, exhibits of foreign handiwork or foods demonstrations, musicals, etc., in order to stimulate interest among and for the foreign born. In these schools for providing adult education, speaking, reading and writing the English language are the subjects generally taught with such other elementary subjects as simple arithmetic, civics, geography history and important biographical sketches covering leading facts about America as seem essential to the best interests of those being schooled. </seg>

V."".'.*/ 250.00 T0TAL ..? 4,296.00 Activities In the main, the Division of Adult Immigrant Education 'has en - deavored to expand materially the individual work of each special class or school organized. Numerically, a great number of new schools or classes have not been established. There has, however, been an in - creased interest on the part of school superintendents, supervisors and teachers, as well as boards of education, in the importance of the work. Many districts in new localities have been asking for night schools] Thus far, we have not been able to take care of any of these demands. The schools now operating show a very creditable registration of stu - dents and the average 'attendance of these students is most encourag - ing. Home classes for women have developed into a very important factor during the past biennium, particularly in Omaha and Lincoln where 22 classes have been organized in which 203 students have regis - tered. The reader's attention is called to Table No. 1, which follows, for further information concerning the organization of schools and classes throughout the state. In the aggregate, one might easily judge that the actual number of contacts established during the past two years between teachers of adult immigrant classes and students enrolled would represent a very large figure. When one appreciates the fact that these contacts are, in the mam, very individual and personal, he can appreciate the far-reach - ing influences being made possible. Local Teachers and Leaders In conducting these adult classes, leadership has always been recog - nized as an indispensable quality. The department feels that we have been exceedingly fortunate in securing teachers from the public schools who have been most efficient and devoted and particularly well trained for this type of instructional work. We are gratified to report also that the University of Omaha has organized a class for the particular purpose of training teachers for adult education. The director of this division has been in charge of this class. The course continues throughout the year, meeting once a week. In Dodge county, the county superintendent has perfected a rather unique organization composed of all the men teachers of the county. This group has given considerable attention to the problem of rural adult and immigrant education. Their influence will doubtless con - tribute much to the extension of the work. </seg>

As an evidence of the need for adult immigrant education, this division made an effort in 1928 to survey the entire state, county by county, to discover the number of persons incapable of- reading or writing in the English language. The survey was not actually put into operation until the year following — 1929. A questionnaire attached to each school census blank was replied to and these replies collected for each county. Eighty-two counties have reported, as shown in the fol- </seg>

It may be truthfully said that these data give evi - dence of a certain degree of illiteracy, using that term in the sense that one is unable to use the English language. Only information con - cerning adults was called for. It is altogether probable that there are many children in the homes of these adults who are likewise illiterate in the accepted sense of this term. For very obvious reasons, the names of counties are not listed.

            <seg id="p154">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT One can clearly see that there is a very genuine need for this pro - gram of adult education with almost four thousand persons unable to read or write the English language. 'In the interests of democracy, we can do nothing less than make, available to these people opportunities for better fitting them to communicate with their fellow citizens. . ■ • ■ . Naturalization Very naturally, one of the important outcomes of adult education has been the fitting of residents of the state .to take out naturalization papers. Many of the students enrolled have enrolled for this purpose. Upon the completion of their courses in English and citizenship, they are recommended to the United States Naturalization Examiner, and appear in his court for their final hearing and examination. In many sections of the state, these meetings have been held under school auspices, and citizenship papers have been presented. Patriotic programs sponsored by various civic and social organizations have added a very significant feature to the program. Under recent federal legislation, the process to be pursued in taking out citizenship papers has become quite complicated. Many detailed in - structions are given, these instructions having to do with the manner of securing application forms and their proper answering; directions as tc fees to be paid, and the place where applications -are to be filed, to - gether with printed leaflets, comprise a large amount of printed material. These materials are actually introduced into the classrooms and are studied and considered. In no small degree, our program of adult education has gone a long way in assisting foreigners to make out their declarations and petitions for citizenship. In the Omaha district, that is, the Fifteenth District of Nebraska, from October, 1928, to 1930, petitions for naturalization were filed by 850 male and 366 female persons. Declarations were made by 678 male and 162 female persons. By "petition" is meant those who have made application for final citizenship papers. By "declaration" is meant those who have filed their first papers. For various reasons, such as ignorance and non-appearance, and for certain other unknown reasons, 296 petitions for natularization were continued. All told, 1408 persons were made naturalized citizens. It is interesting to note the countries from which these persons -ripinally came to this country. </seg>

Textbooks Used The department furnishes all schools organizing adult education classes with the necessary organization and rating sheets to be used in guiding their placement of students. We have also provided necessary textbooks in English and citizenship, as published by the federal govern - ment, and such other textbooks as are deemed worthy of use. These books are the property of the state and are loaned to the school. Public Relations This division endeavors to keep in touch with all the new develop - ments in adult education and will furnish to all local communities the best information available. Finally, let it be said that we are constantly seeking a better means of cooperation with local communities, with higher institutions of learning, and with the leading persons throughout the state, to the end that this work may be extended and may prove effective. We want to express our appreciation of the splendid coopera - tion and consideration this department has received from all of these agencies and persons. We express, too, our appreciation of the liberal attitude of the public press in accepting so much material for publication. </seg>

Agricultural Education (a) Evening Agricultural Classes Evening classes, giving systematic instruction in Agriculture to adults who have already entered the vocation of farming, are practicable wherever there is a department of Vocational Agriculture. Methods of farming are changing constantly with the developments in machinery, discovery of new facts and the consumer's demands and standards of living. Progress depends upon the rapidity with which the farmer changes his thinking and operations to meet new conditions. His ad - justment will be in direct proportion to new knowledge gained. The Evening Class in Agriculture offers an opportunity for the farmer to obtain this new knowledge. A local school maintaining a department of Vocational Agriculture may through Evening Classes extend its influence and usefulness in the community.. The classes are organized and taught by the regular all-day agricul - ture instructor. The number of such classes is increasing. The amount of State and Federal aid is based upon the number of classes and their duration.

Trade and Industrial Education (a) Evening Trade and Industrial Classes With the inevitable shift of the balance of population towards cities, trade and industrial pursuits are becoming more important in Nebraska. To prepare ambitious men and women in these fields for lives of greater service and promotion the public schools are offering evening classes giving specific trade extension instruction — that is instruction directly re lated to their daily callings. These classes are sometimes conducted in schools, shops or industrial plants with practical men and women as instructors. They are offering instruction to persons over sixteen years of age now obliged to be self-supporting and entitled to such schooling. Courses were offered in such subjects as nurses' chemistry, nurses' dietetics, nurses' psychology, nurses.' anatomy and physiology, nurses' bacteriology, blue print reading, practical telephony, locomotive opera - tion, electricity,, ox welding, A.

Omaha is the only city having a large enough number of employed boys and girls to warrant organizing a separate part-time school. The schedule of instruction in the part-time school is not fixed, as the pupils enrolled are of varying ages and scholastic attainment. They are employed in a variety of jobs and their experiences are those of workers rather than children. Consequently, to make the school best serve their need, it is organized on an opportunity school basis to give the pupil the things he needs and can profit by most. Federal and Sch001 . .

Home Economics Education (a) Adult Home Making Classes A vocational homemaking department has not attained its maximum service in a community unless it extends its service to the homemakers as well as to the students in the high school. It is not necessary, how - ever, that a day school program be maintained in order to have home - making classes organized for homemakers. The majority of the classes meet in the afternoon. Many of them meet in the morning. Only a few meet at night! They are organized in short units of six to ten lessons in any phase of homemaking where a sufficient number of homemakers desire the work and a teacher can be secured. Classes in home management, child care, nutrition, parent educa - tion, art in home and clothing and clothing selection are discussion classes. Cooking classes, supper classes, sewing, dressmaking and home care of the sick are laboratory classes.

Rehabilitation Division The vocational adjustment of persons disabled by disease, accident or otherwise has always presented a difficult economic problem. The mechanization and speeding up of industrial and agricultural production bringing about more stringent physical requirements for workers has in - creased its seriousness. Concurrent with the increasing use of machines and faster produc - tion methods in industry and agriculture and with the introduction of the motor vehicle and greater speed in modes of travel has come a tre - mendous increase in the number of those disabled by accidents. The dependent condition of many of these people creates an eco - nomic load which Vocational Rehabilitation is designed to relieve by assisting physically handicapped persons to prepare themselves to en - gage in occupations whereby they may be self-supporting. During the past year, 53 handicapped persons have been fitted for and piaced in occupations in. which they are earning a living; 27 were prepared by school training; 10, by employment training and 16,- by the provision of artificial appliances, physical restoration and careful re-adjustment to suitable occupations. With the aid of this division, 144 disabled' persons are now preparing themselves to engage in new occupations. Applications from 150 others are pending. The lip-reading classes which have been established through the cooperation of this division with the University of Nebraska, Extension Division, have resulted in benefit to 36 hard-of-hearing people. Only 8 of these were trainees of the Rehabilitation Division. The University of Nebraska will continue to test hearing of all registrants and to make instruction in lip-reading available to those found with severe hearing" defects.

            <seg id="p168">• REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT which 10 have been enrolled by the Rehabilitation Division in definite vocational training programs. In cooperation with this division which aided in expense and direc - tion, the State Elks Association has conducted a preliminary survey of crippled children in Nebraska. They are following this with detailed community surveys, a number of which have been made. Clinics and organized local programs of care and follow-up are being established ss the needs are discovered. The State Department of Public Welfare made their records of crippled children reported through the school system during the past five years available for study. The names and addresses of 1251 crippled children were secured. The detailed survey which has been completed in one section, embracing several representative counties, ■ indicates that four times that many, or 5000, crippled children will be found. The clinical examination of cases in this district indicates that 60%, or. 3000, are in need of and can be benefited by orthopedic attention. The first year's accident survey of Nebraska which The Nebraska Press Association conducted in cooperation with this division is just completed. Every issue of each paper published in the state for the past fifty-two weeks has been carefully scanned at the association office for accident items. Information obtained was compiled by this department. 5710 people have been severely injured; 459, permanently disabled, and 781, killed by accidents- in twelve months. This is an average of more than 2 killed and 19 injured every day. The Press Association has issued bi-weekly bulletins to all state papers. It was hoped that our people would become conscious of the situation and make concerted effort to prevent a peace-time accident toll in Nebraska which annually kills and maims more of our citizens than did the World War. The formation of a State Safety Council to assist in promoting safety education and accident prevention was in response to a popular demand that "something be done about it." More than 400 reports of crippled persons, sixteen years of age and older, were received from the State Elks Association Crippled Children Survey. Reports of 459 disabling conditions were gathered from the accident survey. With 150 reports from other sources, the division has received within the year and now has pending investigation the reports of more than 1000 disabled persons. $24,628.76 per year is available in Nebraska for Rehabilitation. Half of this money is state and half federal funds. Not more than 6% of the cases pending can be aided with available funds. In nine years, it has cost the state and federal governments $186,000.00 to rehabilitate 450 disabled persons in Nebraska. This is an </seg>

While the Commission has been handicapped by lack of funds during the past biennium m rendering the service which the public expected, yet we have been very much impressed with the amount and value of work which the Library Commission has been doing and particularly with the outstanding service which it has been rendering to the schools of the state. Its service to the rural schools and schools m smaller towns and villages has been the only library service those schools have had. While many of the cities of the state have library services available to the schools of the local community, the fact remains tbat the seven thousand rural schools of the state have no library service, except that given by their own inadequate supply of library books. This is also true for many of the smaller towns and villages. Added library service is very much needed for the schools of the state outside of the larger cities. We are happy to include herewith a short resume of the work done by the Library Commission. The increasing demands and requests for the services of. the Commission speak eloquently of the need of this edu - cational factor m the progress of our state. The few pages following only high point the work of the Commission. For a more detailed report refer to the formal report of the Commission itself.

            <seg id="p174">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ACTIVITIES ' The work of the Commission is divided into the three activities of Assistance in organizing libraries, a system of loans and supervision of libraries in the state institutions under the Board of Control. . FIELD WORK The field work of the Commission consists of visits to towns hav - ing libraries and to towns about to establish them. It has always been the aim of the Commission, in fulfilment of what it considers the law regarding it, to visit periodically all public libraries and to answer as rapidly as possible all specific calls for help. In addition to the requests from public libraries there is a growing number of calls for assistance in organizing school libraries. There is a rather far cry from this aim of the Commission to its fulfilment for the field work has been materially hindered since July, 1929. Curtailment of library visits is due to a decrease in that part of the Commission appropriation which includes the travel fund. A cut of 25% from an amount already inadequate has made retrenchment of all maintenance expenditure necessary. It has been difficult to do this be - cause of constantly increasing requests from the people for Library Com - mission service. LOANS The method of loaning books by the Library Commission is set forth in the following letter of information: .'•Books are sent out by the Nebraska Public Library Commission according to two general plans. There are traveling libraries which are loaned for three months with, the privilege of extending the time. Usually a general group contains adult fiction and children's books in about equal numbers but a group consisting of only adult books or only children's books will be sent if desired. To any general traveling library non-fiction along special lines will be added on request. The number of books loaned is determined, in part, by the size of the com - munity to which they are sent. "Groups of books for special study are sent to individuals and clubs, the number of books and the time limit depending on the special needs of the case. The time is usually a month, however. In either case the only procedure is to write and ask us to send them. . "'In all loans there is no expense to the borrower except the trans - portation charges. Traveling libraries are sent by freight; special loans by parcel post. </seg>
            <seg id="p175">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION "We have no printed lists of our books but depend on our patrons to tell us what they want and we meet their wishes as far as our re - sources will allow. "A traveling library will be sent on receipt of the enclosed applica - tion card properly filled out and signed by at least three taxpayers. We are greatly assisted in our selection of books if in the space for remarks, we are told the number of pupils and grades of a school, if the library is for the. school, and something of the reading tastes of the community, if the library is for general reading." During the biennial period covered by this report, books have been sent into each of the ninety-three counties of Nebraska. Citizens of approximately 600 communities have requested and received loans. The following is a classified arrangement of the requests and loans from December 1, 1928, to November 30, 1930: Borrowers , Requests Volumes Group of Residents 352 24,703 Public Libraries 611 19,059 School and College Libraries 1,144 63,105 Study Clubs 1,179 4 | 978 Other Organizations 19 1,047 Individuals 7,339 23/718 Total 10,644 136,610 ■ TRAVELING^ LIBRARIES As shown in the classified arrangement of loans, traveling libraries are sent to groups of residents, public libraries, schools and other organi - zations. The total number of traveling library loans from December 1, 1928, to November 30, 1930, js 106,867, of which 63,105 were sent to schools. A few testimonials from interested borrowers are here given, as a refund in appreciation to those who make possible the funds for earry - ing on this part of the educational program of the state: "Very fine library," writes a superintendent of schools. A teacher says, "The material was excellent. I am looking forward to continuing the library work next September." "The children of my district have been overjoyed with the library. We shall certainly be looking forward to a new library next fall." "Last year I organized a library in a Nebraska school and we obtained a traveling library from you. The people received so much </seg>
            <seg id="p176">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT benefit that I want to secure one for this school. However, this is a Wyoming school, just on the line, though half of the children are Ne - braska citizens. As it happens the Wyoming half is more interested in pood reading than the others. The school is a community center and during the road block of the past stormy weeks, they have been be - sieging us for books. Would it be possible for us to obtain a traveling library from Nebraska ? We are anxiously waiting." "I desire to thank you for the loan of books we have had this year and I hope we may have additional volumes next year. They have been of great assistance in furthering our reading program. We feel quite ' gratified with our efforts along this line because a year or two ago it was rather unusual for the pupils to read more than a book or two a year. We thank you particularly for the assistance we have had from your department." "Thank you so much for your selection of books and your prompt - ness in sending them. The children certainly are enjoying them and I seldom have more than six on the shelves for they go out almost before I can record their return. If you could see how much they are enjoyed you would feel repaid for your trouble." REFERENCE LOANS The reference librarian has filled requests for 8,518' individuals during the past biennium, by the loan of books, magazines, pamphlets or clippings as the case might require. The persons served are from all the counties of the state. A few friends wish to speak their appreciation of the books which the state has supplied through this department. "I do want you to know how very much we appreciate your help. I cannot conceive how the service from the Commission could be more efficient. We turn to you as a last resort arid you never fail us." "I am returning the books that you were so kind to send me. It may interest you to know that the books were a great help and I have now passed my examination." . " "A thousand thanks for the wonderful book. It broadens one's out - look tremendously and was much enjoyed by us." "Please allow me to express my sincere gratitude to you for the careful attention and thorough manner in which you looked after my wants." "I am ashamed for neglecting to send the postage due, especially after all the help I received from those books. I was to write a theme and .my grade was A+, thanks to the books, you selected for me." </seg>
            <seg id="p177">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ■ ■ "One of my high school boys used this material in his preparation for a talk at a county contest and I am pleased to inform you that he took first place. Many thanks for the splendid service." NEEDS A letter from a rural teacher says: — "We are greatly in need of books. Will you please send us a traveling library at once?" Edgar and Elmer, Gladys and Lorna write to say that they hope we will send the ., books for which their teacher is asking because they need them. A friend commenting on this letter, says, "Edgar and Elmer, Gladys and Lorna need books from the state. Some day the state will need Edgar and Elmer, Gladys and Lorna." There has been no increase in the appropriation to the Library Commission for books since 1917. THE COUNTY LIBRARY The need of the Library Commission for more books is not the only need for books. There is a need for more books in every county in the state. There is no county which is serving all the people of the county with books. There are twenty-one counties which do not even have public libraries. The best way to better this condition is by the establishment of county libraries. "THE COUNTY LIBRARY COMES HOME TO THE PEOPLE" What Is a County Library? A public library system for the entire county, reaching every person in every corner of the county. ■ How Does It Distribute Books? A central library, open to all the people of the. county, serving as a base of supplies. Stations or branches in all of the towns of the county. Each station received its share of new books. Frequent exchange insures a fresh collection for each branch. Collections in all rural schools of supplementary material and books for recreation. Possibly a book truck, a branch library on wheels, for the smallest communities. Family groups of books by mail on all rural routes - books of all kinds for all the family. Parcel post service to indi - viduals for their varying needs. </seg>
            <seg id="p178">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT How May Existing Libraries Profit By It? . They may either become branches of the county system or contract for additional book service, or have no connection whatever. How Can It Be Established? According to the Nebraska law, on petition, by popular vote at a general election. How Would It Be Supported? By county appropriation, as other county departments. It costs the average taxpayer less per year than the price of one good book or magazine subscription. How Would It Be Managed? . By a county library board, serving without pay, the board appointed by the county supervisors. By a qualified librarian appointed by the library board. Is a Building Necessary? "■: No. In case of a county which has no library building, it can be maintained in the court house. This is desirable as rent and other overhead expenses are saved and more money can be put into books and service. Does Nebraska Have County Libraries? .; No. There are no county libraries in Nebraska. Good seed has been sown in various parts of the state. We believe in the produc - tiveness of the soil. Will you not look at your field? If even a small plant is visible will you not see that it is properly cared for that it may bring forth fruit? Or, perhaps you might sow some seed in your county. A county library is not an experiment. It is recognized as the most successful means of equalizing library privileges. It provides books for the most people at the least cost.

' . ■ Since 1907 Nebraska has been committed to the principle of giving aid to weak districts. Sections 6290-6291-6292 of Compiled Statutes for 1922 recognize on a small scale the principle of equalization of educa - tional opportunity. The schools that receive this aid are the schools in the sparsely settled parts of the state. The assessed valuations of these districts during the past ten years have remained stationary and the increase in property valuations and business operations has been prac - tically nothing. While the school income and standards of most of the rest of the state have gone on, these districts have stood still until now we have much more demand for aid than ever before in the history of the state. We are talking now of aid to weak one-room rural schools. These are the schools on which this money is spent. Amount of State Aid Insufficient In 1929 each of the districts that applied for State Aid received only 50,000/54,788 of the amount to which it was entitled under Sections 6291 and 6292 of the Statutes. The requests for 1930, all of which have not yet been checked and verified by further correspondence, would seem to indicate that these districts this year have requested and need about $5000 more than the $50,000 appropriated. This $50,000 available for 1930 will be pro-rated as in 1929 so that each school will receive 50,000/55,000 of the amount requested. These funds have been pro - rated in accordance with an opinion from the attorney general's depart - ment. No Funds Remaining for Mallery Act. Schools The number of districts requesting and qualifying for State Aid has continually increased. The $50,000 appropriation formerly provided sufficient funds for the districts qualifying for State Aid and also the districts qualifying under the provisions of the Mallery Act (Sections 6382 and 6577 of the Statutes). In 1927 the difference of $1,176 be - tween the $50,000 appropriated and the amount of the State Aid to Weak Districts gave the Mallery Act schools only about 9 per cent of the $13,050 to which they were entitled under Sections 6382 and 6577. In 1929 we were $4,788 short in having enough money for Aid to the Weak Districts, and there was nothing for reimbursement to the Mallery Act schools.- This shortage promises to be even greater in 1930.

            <seg id="p181">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION suming that the forty-eight schools complying with the provisions of the Mallery Act are now entitled to the same amounts to which they were entitled in 1927, the state will be short $35,888 for the current biennium in fulfilling its obligations to weak districts and to Mallery Act schools as expressed in Sections 6290, 6291, 6292, 6382, and 6577 of the Com - piled Statutes for 1922. Back in 1921-23 the legislature appropriated $75,000 for Aid to Weak School Districts, that is, the one-room rural schools, and $30,000 for the Mallery Act schools. The legislature next following lumped these two appropriations together. and increased the amount to $110,000 under one item. This was really a misnomer. The weak, one-room rural schools in the sandhill region present one kind of educational prob - lem, and the Mallery Act schools, another. The desire of the state to encourage Home Economics and Agricultural work in consolidated rural schools, which is the idea of the Mallery Act, is quite another sort of educational problem. From the legislative session of 1923 to the present time, the one appropriation, Aid to Schools, has been supposed to take care of the Mallery Act schools also. As a matter of fact, the wording of the law is such that the Attorney General has advised us to spend all of that appropriation for Aid to Weak. School Districts as long as it was demanded for such schools, with the idea of dividing what might be left among the Mallery Act schools. For three years now we have been unaable to distribute any funds to the Mallery Act schools and we have not even had enough money in this fund to take care of the weak' rural schools. In our opinion the state has a moral obligation either to appro - priate money for these Mallery Act schools or to repeal the law. These schools have made the capital outlay investment as required by Sections 6382 and 6577, and have spent other money in good faith, expecting to receive the reimbursement from the state which the Statutes promised them. On September 12, 1930, we received a letter from one county super - intendent in the state which is an eloquent argument for more money in this fund. We quote from this letter in part as follows: "The completed application for State Aid to Weak Districts is enclosed. You will note that thirteen districts are making appli - ation for aid this year. (Last year this county asked for aid to five districts only.) This is an unusually large number. Practi - cally all of the district valuations decreased this year. Reassess - ment of the real estate will account for the decrease. "There are six other districts in the county having valuations ranging from 40 to 64 thousand. These six districts are not eligi - ble. This makes a total of nineteen districts (over one-half the total number in the county) which are unable to maintain school without exorbitant levies. </seg>
            <seg id="p182">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT "This situation is growing more serious each year. If the legislature does not remedy this evil soon many children will lack adequate school facilities and proper instruction. Uniting districts will not help matters. The cost of transportation would only serve to bankrupt these same districts . . ." Eight of the Weakest School Districts in Nebraska Section 6290 provides that no district shall receive state aid unless it contains at least twelve sections of land for each school maintained. As indicated by the second paragraph of the county superintendent's letter above quoted, many deserving school districts are deprived of State Aid because they contain less than twelve sections of land for each school maintained. The legislature, in setting up the requirement of twelve sections of land' probably felt that districts containing a smaller area should unite with some other district. It is a fact that they could perhaps so unite if they were not so badly in debt that no other adjoining district would accept them. Let us picture a few con - crete examples: School District No. 24, Dundy County . . . School District No. 24 of Dundy county has an assessed valuation of $47,920 on which the levy for school purposes for the current school year is 20 mills. It has a debt of $1,992 and had twenty children en - rolled in the school last year. School District No. 193, Holt County School District No. 193 of Holt county has a 7 mill levy on an assessed valuation of $41,950. It has a debt of $593.. This district maintained seven months of school last year and had a total enrollment of fourteen children. Five School Districts in Key a Paha County School District No. 34 of Keya Paha county is in a situation which apparently can only be remedied by legislative action. Its assessed valuation is only $26,000. We quote as follows from a letter this office received from one of the school officers of this district in November, 1929: "I am writing you in regards to our District No. 34, Keya Paha county. It is a little over $2,000 in debt. The valuation is about $26,000. We are trying to have a seven months school this year, but are having trouble in selling the orders. There are seven children in the school. "We have voted 20 mills levy. Please write at once and let us know if there is any way we can get state help or any way at all to pay this debt off, as we sure need school."' </seg>
            <seg id="p183">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION i . This office wrote the county superintendent for further details con - cerning this district. His reply on November 21, 1929, reads in part as follows: "District 34 of Keya Paha county is too small to receive aid under 6291. A levy of twenty mills will not maintain six months of school and pay interest and take care of this debt within any reasonable length of time. I know of nothing to remedy the situa - tion other than by judgment levy, if that is possible. I find that it . is impossible to combine this district with any other adjoining district in the regular manner, they do not wish to assume the debt. I believe this outlines the situation. If not advise me and I will be glad to cooperate in any way that you see fit. Various local capitalists will not buy warrants from this district without excessive discount." At about the same time we received a letter from the teacher in this .district, which reads in part as follows: "I am teaching the school in District 34 in Keya Paha county. I contracted it for $75 per month, and as the district is in debt they are paying me with a warrant. I cannot get face value for my warrant. They discounted my first 10%. As yet I have not taken last month's. "Do I have to stand the discount or is there some way in which the district should make it up? Can they make it up in a separate warrant ? When I contracted the school I did not know they were . paying with warrants. I expected them to pay cash. "Please let me know what I can do about this." School children in District No. 34, Keya Paha county, are just as deserving of an education as any other child in the state under the Constitutional provision which reads as follows: "The legislature shall provide for the free instruction, in the common schools of this state, of all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one years." It would seem that the only solution to the problem in this, and other similar districts, would be that the legislature provide sufficient state aid to pay off the debt, providing the people in the district would unite with a neighboring district. We believe that the ' district could easily join with a neighboring district if the debt could be eliminated. On an 8 mill levy this district could perhaps maintain three or four months of school with the money received from the state apportionment. However, Section 6286 provides a minimum school term of six months. The penalty for a lessor term is forfeiture of the state apportionment. Of the eight very weak school districts in the state which have in - sufficient area to qualify them for state aid, five of them are in Keya Paha county. Districts 8, 30, 36, and 41 of this county have assessed </seg>
            <seg id="p184">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ' valuations ranging from $30,715 to $42,215. The debt in each case ranges from $141.35 to $1600. The number- of school children ranges from two to twenty-seven. At the present time District No. 8 is meeting its problem by trans - porting its children to a neighboring district. The other three districts have so many children that the cost of this procedure would- also be prohibitive. School District No. 34, Loup County One of the two weakest school districts in the state, containing less than twelve sections of land, is School District No. 34 of Loup county. The 1930 assessed valuation is $23,465.* Their only schoolhouse is a "sod" schoolhouse in "poor" condition. Their debt is $1,253. They are attempting to provide school for fourteen children on a twenty mill levy. The situation of this district is perhaps best described by a letter from one of -the officers of this district, which was received at this office on July 30, 1930. It reads in part as follows: "School District No. 34 of Loup County is in a heck of a shape. It is a small one — V&amp; sections of land — cheap land at that. The assessed valuation, land and all personal property, is $25,425, and we have run behind some for the last nine or ten years. Now we are in debt almost $1,255. "Now how is -anyone going to get out of debt when it takes all and some more to come even. It seems funny that the laws will help a district with 12 sections of land, and one with 4 sections and so poor that the people hardly can exist can't get any help. Come ' and see us. "I will say this much. According to my views this district never should have been. made. I am a taxpayer in this district." We have reason to believe that the eight school districts described above are the eight weakest districts in the state at the present time. However, there are a number of other districts in a large number of counties where the assessed valuation is not any larger, but due to the fact that there have been very few pupils in these districts in recent years, their load has not been so heavy. Where they had only one or two pupils they could provide transportation and tuition to a neighboring district in accordance with Section 6286 and actually maintain school cheaper than if school were maintained in the home district. In the case of a district with such a small valuation it is practically impossible to maintain school for a large number of pupils for the required length of time without running into debt. * S2S.-1G5 i a the latest 1930 assessed valuation which is almost $2,000 less than the valuation referred to in the letter from the officer of the district, which is here iiuoted. </seg>
            <seg id="p185">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The districts listed below have very low assessed valuations and ap - parently do not qualify for state aid under the present law as no request for the same has been made to this office. It is presumed that they would qualify for aid if they contained the necessary twelve sections of land. Chase, District 74; Cherry, District 28; Dundy, District 73; Fron - tier, District 107; Hitchcock, District 36; Lincoln, District 107; Logan, Districts 17, 22, and 32; Merrick, District 3; Morrill, District 98; Per - kins, Districts 25, 26 and 53; Sheridan, District 105; Thomas, District 11. \ It seems that the only .solution to the problem of all these districts, would be to unite with the neighboring district, but such union cannot materialize in the case of the districts that are already heavily in debt. On the following page- you will find the distribution of the State Aid to Weak Districts by counties for the past five years. The exact amount allowed in 1930 to the counties that are starred cannot be de - termined at the time this report goes to press, due to the fact that correspondence with these county superintendents has not yet been com - pleted. As the $50,000 available will not meet the full need, the amount actually allowed to the other counties for 1930 cannot be determined until the requests of the counties starred have been verified. Aid Under the Mallery Act (Sections 6382 and 6577) Inasmuch as there have been no funds to distribute to the Mallery Act schools -in 1928, 1929, and 1930, and since a good many of those districts which qualified have been aware of this fact, no formal appli - cations for this aid have been made. We would presume, however, that the list of schools which meet the statutory provisions for receiving this reimbursement is the same as the list which received the aid in 1927. The table which follows shows the schools which qualified for aid under Sections 6382 and 6577 in 1927 — the last year that such distribu - tion was made. Attention is called to the fact that even in 1927 these districts received only about 8% or 9% of the amounts to which they were entitled under the statutes as their pro rata share.

            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT county where more than one and less than five districts are included, we have listed only those districts which have an assessed valuation be - low $100,000. We have starred those districts which, apparently, have qualified for State Aid in 1930 under the provisions of Sections 6290-6292. The list of those qualifying for State Aid is not an exact list because all correspondence has not yet been completed with the county superin - tendents at the time we go to press. When one studies the assessed valuations of a large number of dis - tricts in the following table and notes that so few of them are actually receiving or applying for State Aid, he immediately asks himself the question why a good many of them are not receiving the State Aid. There are five chief reasons for the failure to receive State Aid: First, there are so few pupils in the district that it is cheaper for the district to transport them to a neighboring district than to maintain school in the home district. Second, some of these districts have no children desiring school privileges at the present time. Third, some of these districts may be eligible to receive State Aid but they have not made application for same. This may be due to ignorance of their rights as provided in Sections 6290, 6291, and 6292. Fourth, some of the districts may not now qualify for Aid but they may be in, or fast approaching, the same difficulties that confront School District No. 34 in Loup county and School District No. 34 in Keya Paha county whose conditions have been previously described in this chapter. Fifth, in a very few instances, the assessed valuation opposite the district may include only the portion of the district in the county named. This portion may represent the. valuation in one county while the com - bined valuation of the entire district is much larger. The department regrets that it is unable at this time to furnish a more complete statement concerning the condition of some of the dis - tricts described in the following pages. Nearly every district listed merits an individual study and complete report of its condition. Unless there has been an obvious mistake made in the county superintendent's report to this office the material is available to anyone who desires to make a more complete individual study of any or all of these districts. An insufficient staff of assistants in this office has made such a study impossible up. to the present time, but the department hopes to have a more complete report of each individual district in the next biennial report. For one who desires to make a worthwhile research contribu - tion, here is a fruitful field. </seg>
