HON. GRANT G. MARTIN, Attorney General, Members of the State Banking Board. SIRS: — I am pleased to hand you herewith the Twenty-Second Annual report of the Secretary of the State Banking Board, covering the period from November 26, 1912, to October 21, 1913, which includes tabulated sum - maries, computations and analyses of the banks under your supervision, for the year above described, showing both in summary and in detail the con - ditions disclosed by reports submitted by these banks at the close of business October 21, 1913. In submitting the following information I am placing in your hands material which 1 be'.ieve to be of practical and historical value. Ris report shows a growth and condition, both in detail and as a of the banks operating under the Nebraska banking act, that must ly satisfactory to yoar supervising body. I will deviate from the former practice of the Department in the matter of suggestions as to amendments of the banking act as it now exists, for the reason that I find the Legislature can seldom be brought to consider amendments suggested. It is gratifying to be able to report that no failures of banks under your supervision have occurred during the period covered. tl desire to extend to the members of the State Banking Board and to e Examiners and other appointees of the Department, my sincerest thanks for the loyalty and consideration given me in my efforts to carry forward the work of this Department. Very respectfully, E. ROYSE, Secretary State Banking Board. </seg>
