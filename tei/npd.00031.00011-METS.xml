            <seg id="p009">INTRODUCTION HISTORY OF THE COMMISSION EThe State Revenue and Tax Commission was appointed by ernor Morehead on June 16, 1913, under authority of Chapter of the Laws of 1913, which provides as follows: Section 1. (Taxation, revenue, commission.) Within thirty days from the adjournment of the Legislature, the Governor shall appoint a commission of five persons, residents of Nebraska, specially qualified by experience and study to deal with the prob - lems of taxation in Nebraska, and to compare conditions here with conditions and experience elsewhere, and not more than three of whom shall be of the same political party. Any vacancy which may occur in such commission by reason of death, resigna - tion or otherwise, shall be filled by appointment by the Governor. Sec. 2. (Study: report.) Said commission shall make a careful study of the subject of revenue and taxation with special reference to the problems presented in Nebraska and shall in - vestigate and study the systems of raising revenue and admin - istering the same in other states and countries. It shall prepare by July 1, 1914, a concise report in popular language, presenting to the public the principal defects of the revenue system of Ne - braska and the principal improvements suggested by experience elsewhere. There shall be prefixed to such report a brief abstract thereof containing in condensed form the substance of the com - plete report. Ten thousand copies of such report and abstract shall be printed for general distribution in the state. In case the constitutional amendment submitted under House Roll 92, legislative session 1913, shall be approved at the polls in No - vember, 1914, said commission shall prepare a bill presenting a comprehensive revenue law for the State of Nebraska which it shall recommend for adoption to the legislature. Said bill shall be prepared and submitted to the Governor on or before January Sec. 3. (Access to records: legislative bureau: assistants.) The commission herein provided shall have free access to all books and records in the several departments of the state govern - ment and in the counties, cities and villages in this state. It shall office and work in co-operation with the Legislative Refer - ence Bureau, making use, so far as practicable, of the facilities afforded by that bureau, and it may employ a stenographer and other necessary help, in the preparation of its report. KSec. 4. (Compensation: expenses.) The members of said nission shall be paid at the rate of $10.00 per day each for </seg>
            <seg id="p010">6 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission the time actually employed in preparing said report and bill, not to exceed sixty days for each member thereof. The members of the commission shall be allowed necessary expenses incurred in the prosecution of their work, which shall be paid upon pre - sentation of vouchers signed by the Governor to the Auditor of Public Accounts. Approved, April 21, 1913. I The membership of the commission as chosen by the Gover - was as follows: J. H. Grosvenor, an attorney of Aurora, •les A. Schappel, county treasurer of Pawnee county; George Virtue of the Economics department of the University of raska; Charles W. Sears, an attorney of Omaha; and Earl B. iis, a newspaper man of Lincoln. The Commission began its labors by getting in touch with tax administrative officers of the state and members of the legisla - ture who were familiar with the operation of the present law and who had suggestions for remedying its defects. It also began an independent study of the laws of other states, and the reports prepared by special and permanent commissions of other states. Later in the year 1913 it also began a series of public hearings which representatives of all interests in the state were asked to attend. These hearings were continued for several months, some one hundred and fifty men appearing before the commission during that time. These men represented the farming interests, railroads, insurance companies, county officials, merchants, stock - raisers, telephone companies, and various other activities. The commission also made a trip to Kansas to study the operation of the tax laws there and for the purpose of getting first hand knowledge of the administration of a permanent tax com - mission. This trip was of signal benefit to the commission. Various other commissions throughout the country have given material help through correspondence. I Several members of the commission joined with the National association and have kept in touch with the proceedings of body. It was represented by Mr. Charles A. Schappel at Buffalo, N. Y. meeting of that association in October 1913 at the Denver, Colorado meeting held in September 1914, Ar. George O. Virtue. For assistance rendered generously and gratuitously in carry - ing on its work of research and the preparation of its report, the </seg>

THE PROPOSED TAX AMENDMENT E"he authority of the legislature over taxation and exemption taxation is found in Sections 1 and 2 of Article 9 of the itution of 1875. The sections provide as follows: I' Section 1. The legislature shall provide such revenue as be needful, by levying a tax by valuation, so that every n and corporation shall pay a tax in proportion to the value s, her or its property and franchises the value to be ascer - d in such manner as the legislature shall direct, and it shall power to tax peddlers, auctioneers, brokers, hawkers, corn - on merchants, showmen, jugglers, inn-keepers, liquor rs, toll bridges, ferries, insurance, telegraph and express ests or business, venders of patents, in such manner as it direct by general law, uniform as to the class upon which it Ltes. I Sec. 2. The property of the state, counties and municipal orations, both real and personal shall be exempt from taxa - and such other property as may be used exclusively for cultural and horticultural societies, for school, religious, ;tery, and charitable purposes, may be exempted from taxa - but such exemption shall be only by general law. In the isment of real estate incumbered by public easement, any eciation occasioned by such easement, may be deducted in valuation of such property. The legislature may provide the increased value of lands, by reason of live fences, fruit forest trees grown and cultivated thereon, shall not be taken account in the assessment thereof." (The legislature of 1913 submitted to the electors an amend - : to be voted upon at the general election of 1914, which if ted will greatly enlarge the authority of the legislature over tion. If it becomes a part of the Constitution the legislature have power to exempt other classes of property than those exempted, to classify property for purposes of taxation, to it some other basis for taxation than the value of property, as gross earnings, and toj impose income taxes. The pro - d amendment is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p012">Report of Nebraska Tax Commission 8 "SECTION 1. That Section 1 of Article 9 of the Constitu - tion of the State of Nebraska be amended to read as follows: RiEC. 1. (Revenue.) The rules of taxation shall be uniform any given class and taxes shall be levied upon such property e legislature shall prescribe. Taxes may also be imposed incomes, privileges and occupations, which taxes may be graduated and progressive, and reasonable exemptions may be provided, in addition to those hereinafter specifically mentioned in section 2 of this article. Sec. 2. (Submission.) That at the general election in November, 1914, there shall be submitted to the electors of the state for their approval or rejection the foregoing proposed - amendment to the Constitution in the following form: 'For amendment to the Constitution providing for uniform and pro - gressive taxation,' and 'against said proposed amendment to the Constitution providing for uniform and progressive taxa - tion ' " SUMMARY OF THE REPORT S Defects of the Tax Law. — The chief defects of the present grow out of the attempt to raise nearly all the public revenues l a tax on all property according to its value. The law dis - rds all differences in the economic character of property, by ting all the citizen's possessions as equally indicative of his ity to support the government. RThe law fails to recognize the fact that many professions businesses which yield a large income require little or no erty, thus permitting many to escape their fair share of the It fails to take account of the great growth of corporate wealth by providing the means of reaching such wealth adequately once, and but once. R Other defects are due to inadequate administrative provis - . While the law has the appearance of providing a central- K control over assessments, this control is only nominal. The net assessorship, filled by election, and the absence of tive state control make the system a highly decentralized one. The present law fails because it commands the local assessor to do some things no assessor can succeed in doing, and asks them to preform other duties which can be properly preformed only by a well equipped state board of assessors. Recommendations for Reform. — In view of the fact that an amendment to the Constitution is pending which if </seg>
            <seg id="p013">9 adopted will give to the legislature larger power over taxation. The Commission has had constantly to keep in mind what can be done under the present constitution and what may be done in case the tax amendment is adopted. Our recommendations, therefore, fall under two classes, those which may be followed in case the amendimnt fails, and those which may be followed in case the amendment is adopted at the November election. (1) In Case the Amendment Fails. The recommend- ations of the Commission for changes under the present consti - tutional restrictions may be summarized briefly as follows: I The creation of a permanent state tax commission with ?r: To supervise the local assessments; to assess all public ice corporations, and in time all corporations doing business ie state; to study the operation of the revenue law; to collect publish information relating to the revenues and expenditures ; to recommend to the legislature needed changes in the law. That the office of precinct assessor be abolished, that the county assessor be made in fact as well as in name the assessor of all property that is to te locally assessed aided by as many deputies as may be required. BThat the fractional assessment (one-fifth of the actual value) .bandoned and that all taxable property unless otherwise ifically provided for shall be assessed at its true value. KThat an effective method of assessing corporations be adopted ;ially for reaching the "intangible" or "franchise" value ected with their operations. IThat the method of taxing express companies be changed by shing all local occupation taxes and imposing upon them a &gt; earnings tax to be paid into the state treasury. That similar changes be made in the method of taxing telegraph companies. That the method of taxing sleeping car companies be changed so as to reach the "franchise" value, and not merely the value of the cars used in the state; that local occupation taxes on these companies be abolished ; and that all taxes be paid into the state treasury. That the method of taxing domestic insurance companies be changed so as to place them on a footing of equality with foreign companies of the same class and that the proceeds of such taxes </seg>
            <seg id="p014">10 ■That greater publicity be given to all questions relating to tiue and expenditure, assessments and exemptions. I That the inheritance tax law be amended by reducing the iptions allowed, by increasing the rates in the second and I classes of beneficiaries, by improving the administration in matter of appraisals, etc., and by turning the proceeds of ax into the state treasury. 1(2) In Case the Amendment is Adopted. — In case the titution is amended so as to give the legislature authority :t the Commission recommends: That all the changes recommended above be enacted into KThat the sleeping car companies and other private car com - 3S be taxed on the basis of their gross earnings from intra - i business and the state's share of interstate business. (That the principles of the "classified property tax" be mized by placing intangible property in a class by itself and acting it to a low rate of 3 or 4 mills, uniform throughout the , without the privilege of deducting debts from credits allowed under the decisions of the court. KThat the distinction between land and the improvements son be recognized by making the latter assessable at a lower ?ntage of their value than the land. BThat provision be made for exempting from taxation house - goods to the value of $200 for each head of a family. IThat a suitable tax be imposed upon the manufacture and of malt and spirituous liquors and tobaccos, the proceeds to aid into the state treasury. And finally the Commission recommends for future action, but not by the next legislature, that provision be made for an income tax law. In the opinion of the Commision the attempt to enforce such a law in any other way than through an efficient state board would prove futile. The first step toward effective administration of an income tax law lies in establishing such a </seg>
            <seg id="p015">FHE PUBLIC REVENUES It is proposed to set forth in this chapter the more significant facts with respect to the revenues of the state and the local governments. It may be said at the outset that one of the greatest difficulties with which the Commission has had to con - tend is the dearth of information about the operation of the revenue laws. No one has been charged with the duty of collect - ing statistics of the public income and expenditure as a whole and of classifying them in such a way that they will tell what the in - terested taxpayer wants to know. We have attempted to collect and classify some such information from county and city officials but while some officers have given generously of their time, our appeals for information have met with but partial success. We have thus had to fall back upon census figures in many cases for the statistical data here presented. The Public Revenues. We have no means of tracing the growth of the public revenues as a whole for the state and local governments. The table which follows, compiled from the census reports, gives a general view of the sources of revenue for the state and the local governments and their relative importance as they were twelve years ago. There has been no material change in the revenue system since that time. While the public revenues have increased since 1902 they are now derived from about the same sources in approximately the same proportion as shown in </seg>

This is an ad valorem tax, that is; a laid according to the value of property. In 1902 out of total revenue receipts of $11,665,181, almost $8,000,000 ! from this source. By aid of the census figures given below an trace the growth of the taxes levied for state and local oses: B Combining these figures with the assessed valuation of erty in the state, for purposes of comparison, we have the iving: Table III Table Showing the Assessed Valuation and Total Levies of Ad Valorem Taxes for State and Local Purposes, 1860-1913 ASSESSED VALUATION TOTAL LEVIES AD VALOREM TAXES Year Rate per $100 Amount Per Amount of Assessed Per Capita Valuation Capita $7,926,949 $257 ■43,667,693 '355 90,585,782 200 1890 184,770,305 174 1902 180,091,492 168 180,091,492 168 1913 470,690,414 392 •Gold basis.

            <seg id="p020">16 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission This table shows the relative tax charge for the support of the various divisions of government and gives a rough indication of the cost of maintaining the different governments. It does not take into account, however, the revenues derived from licenses, fees, fines, investments, and special taxes. While incomplete, the table indicates fairly the relative importance of the taxes raised for the various divisions of government throughout the state. The table is instructive as showing in what political divisions the increase has taken place. In the first ten years of the period the total taxes charged increased 29.39 per cent; during the last ten years 132 per cent. But the increase has been unevenly dis- tributed. This is brought out in the table which follows: Per Cent of Increase of Taxes Charged 1894-1903 1903-1913 State 43.50 154.00 County 12.91 98.36 City 82.20 225.00 Township 63.60 116.00 Road 41.95 517.00 School 29.47 160.00 Growth of Bonded Indebtedness. — While the levies have thus been increasing, they have not kept pace with the demand for public funds. This is brought out by the table below showing the bonded indebtedness of the state and local governments less sinking fund assets for the census years 1880 and 1890, and for Table V Total Indebtedness Per Year Less Sinking Fund Assets Capita 1880 $7,439,974 $16.56 1890 15,536,772 14.67 1902 22,415,041 21.01 Since 1902 the bonded indebtedness has grown rapidly. As shown by the State Auditor's Report there were outstanding public bonds of all grades of government on October 1, 1912, amounting to $16,234,330, exclusive of the debts of Omaha, South Omaha and Lincoln.

The estimate here made for that year is based rt on the census estimates for certain classes of property, n part on the assessors' valuations. The estimate is probably r the true value. The tables show that since 1902 the tax - wealth has increased 84 per cent, while the levies have in - ed 136 per cent. As remarked above, the value of taxable &gt;rty is probably greater than $3,400,000,000; but it seeirs that taxes have grown more rapidly than the value of taxable . 1 lijr • Increasing Expense of Government. — In the absence of any central bureau authorized to collect information concerning public expenditures the means of making a comparative study for a series of years are wanting.

These facts are available as indicated by the appropriations for the state government but not for a series of years for the local govern- The State Appropriations. — Table VII, compiled by the Legislative Reference Bureau shows the total appropriations made by the legislature annually from 1867 to 1879 and bien - nially thereafter, to meet state expenditures and the percentage of these appropriations made for educational purposes, state institutions other than educational, legislative, executive and judicial expenses, and for boards, commissions and departments The detailed appropriations will be published in the Blue Book now beinsf DreDared bv the Bureau </seg>

            <seg id="p024">20 This table shows an almost constant increase of appropriations for state purposes. About 50 per cent of them have steadily been made for educational purposes if we include the federal grants and the apportionment of the school fund. The state institutions other than educational have increased in number from two in 1867 to fifteen in 1913 and have on the average required about 30 per cent of the appropriations. During the past decade they have required a smaller percentage of the appropriations than during the preceding decade; yet the appropriations for their support have increased from $1,594,320 in 1903 to $2,539,165 in 1913. Sums voted for legislative, executive and judicial expenses have almost doubled during the same period, rising from $633,336 in 1903 to $1,055,640 in 1913. Growth of Local Expenses. But the state expenditures are relatively unimportant. According to the census the public expenditures in the state for the different governments were as follows in 1902: tis, 18.28 per cent of the public expenditures were made gh the state and 81.7 per cent through the various local nments. The relative importance of state and local financial &gt;n may be shown in another way. Of the total taxes charged 13 amounting to $22,487,791, $18,816,601 or 83 per cent for local uses. No statistics are available for showing the ;h of local expenditures. They have, however, grown more ly than the state expenditures. Where the Tax Burden Falls.

            <seg id="p027">23 The table shows that real estate has constituted a fairly constant proportion of the assessments upon which the ad va - lorem taxes have been based during the whole period. This class of property has been pretty generally in the neighborhood of two-thirds of the total. Personalty has shown greater variation than either real estate or railroad property. The effect of the administrative machinery provided by the act of 1903 is notice - able. The total assessment was raised in 1904, the first year under the new act, by $106,000,000, or 56 per cent. But the increase was uneven. Sixty million of the increase was borne by real estate, an increase of 49 per cent; personal property was pushed up 60 per cent and railroad property 68 per cent. The relative proportions remained fairly constant during the next four years. The re-ad - justment in 1908, when a new real estate assessment was made, gave a markedly higher percentage to real estate and this was still further increased by the assessment of 1912. Both personal and railroad property have represented a decreasing percentage of the total assessment since 1907. Causes of High Taxes. — The increase of taxes shown in these tables is not peculiar to Nebraska. Since about 1885 there has been a marked increase in state and local revenues throughout the country and in fact throughout the western world. This growth has been especially marked during the last dozen y On every hand the complaint is made of the increasing burden of taxation. For a quarter of a century writers on public finance have called attention, sometimes with alarm, to the growth of public expenditures. In the main, however, this increase is looked upon as a natural growth. The functions of government have been constantly widening; all the old services are continued ; new ones are constantly being undertaken ; and new and old are being conducted on a higher plane than formerly. Citizens are no longer content with mere room and convenience, but demand something of elegance, in their public buildings. They are no longer satis - fied that their duty is performed toward the unfortunate wards of the state by providing them shelter and food, but feel impelled to make use of all the methods of modern science to remove their abnormalities and restore them when possible to the usual paths of life. Such expenditures, so far as they result in reformation and restoration to health, aside from humanitarian considera - tions, are properly held to be justified by their economic results. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">24 The same is true of the recent tremendous increase in expenditures for education. There is no intention of placing education on a merely utilitarian basis, but such expenditures are in large part directed toward the development of those physical and intel - lectual powers of youth upon which industrial prosperity must rest. They are therefore looked upon not merely as the satis - faction of a claim which the individual has upon society but as an investment from which society secures a return in numerous ways. There is the same sort of justification for expenditures for the preservation of the public health and numerous other activities which directly or indirectly add to the producing power of the Increase of Expenditures and the Rise in Prices. — This normal growth of expenditure due to enlarging the public services has been influenced by the change that has taken place since 1897 in the general price level. The continuous decline in the value of money has meant a "higher cost of living" for govern - ments as well as for individuals. They have had to pay higher prices for materials for construction and supplies just as in - dividuals have. Increases in public salaries have been made, though unevenly and probably not in the same degree that private salaries have risen. We have accurate data for one large class of public servants, the teachers in the public schools. There has been an increase in the average monthly wage for male teachers from $46.25 in 1900 to $79.02 in 1912; and for female teachers from $36.90 to $55.31 during the same period. This shows for the women teachers an increase of a little less than 50 per cent in average monthly wages. During the same time the index number of food stuffs has risen in the north central states of which Ne- tka is one, from 102.5 in 1900 to 170.0 in 1913. It seems prob - , therefore, that teachers' salaries have not risen as fast as cost of living, while as stated above many salaries of public ials have not risen at all. The increase of expenditures due to rise of prices will in time cease; but the conditions calling :o-operative activities through the state and local governments likely to continue. This does not mean that the continued en- largement of the functions of the state is inevitable, but unless there is a marked change in the prevailing political philosophy, and of such change there is now no sign, these functions will continue to be enlarged and they will demand a continued in- crease of the public revenues. </seg>
            <seg id="p029">25 The Outlook; Need of Reform. The foregoing statistics show what has been the course of public expenditures and the tax levies during the last thirty or forty years and indicate what may reasonably be expected in the future. Attention is called particularly to the great increase in the levies since 1902. While the population has been increasing at the rate of about 12,000 a year the ad valorem tax levies have been increasing at the rate of about $1,000,000 a year; or, to put the situation in- the form of percentages, the population has increased at the rate of but little more than one per cent a year, the ad valorem levies have in - creased at an annual average of about 12 per cent per year. The comparative growth of taxable wealth and the levies has been indicated above. Such a remarkable over-reaching of the popula - tion and wealth of the state by the tax levies cannot of course continue indefinitely. But services already undertaken will doubtless be continued and even though no others be undertaken at the public expense, the cost of maintaining this is certain In this situation two lines of action are clearly demanded: ■First, a more efficient control of expenditures in the state and ocal governments. I Second, a fairer and more equitable adjustment of the tax en. It is with the second phase of the revenue problem that Commission is especially charged; but the control of ex - litures is so closely connected with the raising of revenue a brief discussion of that subject will not be inappropriate. 1. Better Control of Appropriations. — The annount of the expenditures authorized by the various legislative bodies, state and local, vested with power to make appropriations of public funds, determines the amount of taxes to be raised. Econ - omy in financial management must, therefore, begin with the appropriations. Every one knows how difficult it is to control ex - penditures under any system where representatives are given power to determine how much public money shall be raised and for what purposes it shall be spent. It is one of the most per - plexing problems connected with the administration of the federal finances, it shows itself in every session of the legislature, and is constantly present in all the representative local govern - ments. From the point of view of organization the most im - portant defect in our financial methods lies in the great diffusion </seg>
            <seg id="p030">26 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission of authority, and therefore of responsibility, in financial matters. Thus, the responsibility for the amount and direction of expendi - tures is divided between two chambers. The appropriation bills originate in the House, not with one committee, but with eight committees, each seeking to get as much as possible for the ser - vices under its care. These committees rely upon heads of de - partments, bureau chiefs and superintendents for estimates of the needs of the various services. All these estimates pass through the office of the secretary of the treasury but he has no power to modify them for any department except his own. No person or body of persons is responsible for the estimates as a whole or for determining the relative importance of the demands made upon the treasury. This is left to be worked out by the eight com - mittees having power to prepare appropriation bills. Their con - clusions are subject to amendment by the House on the motion of any member, and the action of the House is subject to revision by the Senate. Moreover, an independent committee is charged with the task of putting into form legislation for providing the ways and means of meeting the appropriations. Consequently in the management of federal expenditures there is no such thing as centralized control, no officer or group of officers charged with the duty of keeping income and outgo together and determining the relative amounts to be expended for different purposes; in a word, no way is provided for fixing responsibility in financial matters except in the most general and ineffective way upon the "party in power" or the "administration." ' kThe state government works under the same kind of system, ther lack of system. Estimates of the amounts needed for the biennium have heretofore been filed with the State Auditor eads of departments, superintendents of institutions, heads ommissions, boards, associations, surveys and other state 1 That those connected with the management of the federal finances are awake to the serious defects of our system is shown by the repeated efforts at reform in recent years. The following from a speech in the House by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in September 1914 is signifi - cant: "It has been my opinion for years, and it is now, that the only way we can work out economy and efficiency at the same time is for the govern - ment to centralize control of appropriations in control of one committee in the House and in the Senate, or by adopting a budget system that will have control over all committees; and I believe that the day is not far distant when such a system will be inaugurated " </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Better Control of Appropriations 27 services, seventy or eighty in number, which look to the legisla - ture for support. The estimates for the state institutions will hereafter be filed by the Board of Commissions in charge of them. The function of the Auditor is purely clerical. He simply ar - ranges these estimates for submission to the legislature in such form as to make possible a comparison of the sums appropriated for the last three or four bienniums with the sums asked for. The Auditor also presents an estimate of the revenues based on existing laws. He has no power to make recommendations con - cerning either revenue or expenditures. The task, therefore, of providing for the numerous needs of the state devolves upon the legislature, meeting for a period of sixty days, overwhelmed with a mass of general legislation, to determine upon the expendi - ture of six or eight millions of dollars and apportion it to various state services often in the minutest detail. It is a task no legisla - tive body meeting once in two years for a short term can ade - quately perform. Hearings may be held, junkets may be arranged for, reports may be studied by a few; but in the end the legisla - ture is compelled to accept the recommendations of heads of departments and superintendents and the sums asked for are granted and placed at the disposal of the executive officers. This complete separation of the executive and the legisla - tive branches of government is one of the peculiar features of American institutions and is the cause of many of our financial difficulties. In many European countries financial administra - tion is organized on sounder principles. In England, for in - stance, from which our own institutions were chiefly inherited, the evolution of two centuries has brought the executive and legislative branches closer together till now they are practically one. The same situation exists in the Canadian governments both dominion and provincial. The chief heads of departments are also members of the legislature. They constitute "the government." They decide upon the needs of the public service and ask for appropriations sufficient to meet them. They also propose plans for raising the necessary revenue. This compre - hensive plan for expenditures and revenues for the year con - stitutes the budget. It is presented to the legislature by the finance minister as "the government's program for the year." While the ministry's plan is open to discussion and criticism, any important modification of the program by the legislature </seg>
            <seg id="p032">28 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission would be regarded as a vote of "want of confidence," the min - instry would resign and a new ministry would be called to present a program in conformity to the wishes of the majority. Bills carrying appropriations for public purposes are not brought in by private members at all, and only the leaders of the "opposi - tion" think of proposing amendments to the government's program. Under such a system income and expenditures are kept together with remarkable precision; all the services are looked upon as one great undertaking and a balance is preserved between them in the general public interest; and the adminis - trative officers who devise the program and carry it through the legislature are also charged with the duty of executing it. Such a centralized control over expenditures appears on first examina - tion very undemocratic; but as it operates in countries where the people are steady enough politically to use the system, it has proven very responsive to the popular will. It offers no oppor - tunity, it is true, for the individual legislator to secure an appro - priation for "his district" by log-rolling or otherwise. The government's plan must be accepted or rejected as a whole or with but slight modifications. No increase of appropriations can be made at all except on the initiative of the ministry and no im - portant decreases would be tolerated since that would require a change in the program. This system of responsible government furnishes the most efficient means of controling the finances yet devised in demo - cratic countries. If it could be adopted here it would undoubtedly remove many grave evils in our financial system. But the Ameri - can theory of a separation of the executive and legislative branches and the practice of electing officials for a fixed term, stands in the way of adopting the British system here. That system has been an evolution and any effective system of financial control that may be worked out here must come by the same process. A form of semi-responsible government is being developed in our cities through the adoption of the commission plan. Doubtless some - thing similar to the commission plan will be experimented with soon in our county governments, and proposals are not wanting for applying the principle to the state governments. 1 Meanwhile some progress has been made in Nebraska toward •alizing control over estimates for state institutions by the ;ion of the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions, </seg>
            <seg id="p033">Better Control of A\ 29 popularly called the Board of Control. Fifteen institutions have been placed under that Board. They required appropriations in 1913 amounting to $2,539,165 or 28 per cent of the total - appropriations. It will be a great gain for efficient control of the finances of these institutions if the Board shall be made the sole spokesman to the legislature for them. The same principle should apply to interests under the control of the Regents of the University and of the State Board of Education. If the zeal of members for expenditures in their district is not promptly and effectively restrained by the legislators, the value of the Board acting as an impartial body in determining the relative needs of the services under its management, will be greatly impaired. I In the search for some official upon whom to place the duty •esenting to the legislature a unified program for the admin - tion of the state government the Joint Committee on Legisla- Procedure has concluded that the Governor can best perform task. That Committee makes the following recommenda- I"The governor represents more completely than any other er the general administrative policy of the state. Upon his acter and ability more than upon any other one person de - ls the success of the state government. We believe it should nade his duty to prepare and recommend to the legislature budget of necessary expenses and income upon which he is ng to stake his judgment and reputation as the chief execu - officer of the state." Such an arrangement cannot of course be expected b complish all that is to be desired in the reform of financial admin - istration; but, that much good may be accomplished through it by energetic governors, especially by those serving a second term working in close co-operation with the Board of Control, the University Board of Regents, the State Board of Education and the heads of the various departments, can hardly be doubted. It must be remembered, however, that a governor just coming into office is as helpless as the legislature itself in passing upon details of policy and expenditure for the varied interests of the state. He can in no sense take the place of a finance minister in a genuine budget system. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">30 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission The defects of the financial organization of the state govern - ment and the proposals for reform in that field have been dwelt upon because the evils of loose administration from their spec - tacular character have attracted wide attention. But as shown above the state's expenditures are relatively unimportant com - pared with those of the local governments and opportunities for introducing economies are correspondingly small. Tested by the tax levies the local governments are on the average seven times as important as the state government; and in cities where the levies often run up to 100 mills or more of the assessed valua - tion, the local governments are fourteen or fifteen times as im - portant, from the tax-paying point of view, as the state govern - ment. The great field for economy in financial administration lies, therefore, in the governments nearest to the citizen. It is a commonplace, however, that citizens know less about the finances of these governments than they do of those farther from home. There is in fact a strange lack of interest in the local finances. This is due to a variety of causes which need not here be discussed. But it may be safely stated that efforts to check the growth of the tax burden that are not chiefly directed toward a study of local expenditures will largely fail of its end. I At the Denver meeting of the National Tax Association held jptember, 1914, the report of a committee on economy and nditures was read, the recommendations of which we give n as a conclusion of this discussion. These recommendations ; fully the approval of this Commission: "To accomplish this result (more efficient financial control) it is necessary to overcome the existing indifference of the elec - torate and then to ascertain where economies can be effected and how successfully introduced. To these ends we recommend: I First, that this association adopt a resolution urging con - i to direct the census bureau to publish annually for a se - d group of states, counties, towns, villages and cities, statis - of expenditure, taxation, public debt and wealth, including his group — similar to the registration area used in vital sties — those states and political subdivisions whose financial unts are published promptly and in such form as will permit msolidated statement. Second, that a resolution be passed urging every state legis - lature which has not already done so to require all political sub - divisions to publish annually a brief statement showing the in - crease or decrease in expenditures, receipts, taxes and public </seg>
            <seg id="p035">Better Control of Appropriations 31 I; and that to this end (a) a member of the National Tax nation be appointed in each state to work for such legisla - and (b) that this committee be continued in order to keep mch with these representatives, supply them with laws •d in other states, and such suggestions and assistance as it be possible to render. Third, to measure the governmental performance an&lt; certain where economies may be introduced. National and - governments should establish bureaus of efficiency properly manned and equipped. Their activities may wisely be supple - mented by the work of private efficiency bureaus, taxpa associations and the like. The public efficiency bureaus referred to may be associated with the legislature or chief executive de - partment or given a quasi-independent status as a separate com - mission — as the circumstances of particular times and places may require — but they should be so constituted as to have the freest access to public offices, do their work continuously, and have their recommendations treated as other than mere academic proposals. They must be made an integral and permanent part of government, bent upon reducing cost. Fourth, to make such bureaus effective modern government must be simple and the existing diffusion or power and responsi - bility corrected. A short ballot, and those modifications which logically go along with it, should be introduced. A single legisla - tive chamber, reduction in the number of elective executive officers, closer relationship between legislative and executive departments of government, a budget which emphasizes the spirit but wastes no time and effort on the form of this procedure are probably all necessary accompaniments of any movement permanently to reduce public expenditures and increase public efficiency. Fifth, to get these movements under way and overcome existing indifference, a systematic propaganda for the betterment of existing conditions along the lines named should be introduced. Such a movement can offend few, if any, persons or intt worth considering. Practically every one agrees that whatever functions the government undertakes should be performed as economically as possible. We recommend accordingly the or - ganization of a national taxpayers' efficiency association or the assumption of this work by the National Tax Association designed to awaken the people to the menace involved in the growth of expenditures, secure the publication of simple under - standable statistics on this point, point out where economies may be effected, inform civil divisions in particular of the bureaus or agencies from which they may secure expert help in reorganizing their accounts and reducing cost, and in short to spread and strengthen by concentrating the work now being developed by the public and private efficiency bureaus already in existence. </seg>

The essential task of the taxpayers' association referred to would be to awaken a demand for such work.

Such work can, profitably to the taxpayers of this country, be undertaken by this association ■Finally we recommend the adoption of tax limitation laws ar to those existing in the state of Colorado. Such laws Id contain in substance provisions similar to the following: K(a) The taxes levied by any political subdivision should xceed those of the preceding year by more than, say 5 per cent 3t in cases of emergency. ■(b) Whether an emergency exists shall be determined by independent body, such as the courts, state tax commission, &gt;ard consisting of the principal elective state officers. ■ (c) In cases of emergency an increase in taxes not to exceed, 15 per cent may be authorized by the above board or agency. B(d) But any increase beyond the limit last named must be ed by referendum vote within the political subdivisions con- 2. Adjustment of the Tax Burden. — It cannot be said, however, that the taxes in Nebraska constitute a grievous burden at the present time. The average levy of 47.25 mills for the year 1913 may on its face seem alarming. But accepting the "actual value" found by the assessors as the true value, this apparently high levy amounts to but $9.55 per thousand. It is well known, however, that the "actual value" of the assessors does not repre - sent the true value of the property listed. The rough estimate given above of true value would make the ad valorem taxes amount to but $7.40 per thousand. It is quite clear that the chief difficulty with the taxes is not that the average burden is too great, but that it is not properly apportioned. Here lies con - fessedly the most difficult problem in the realm of public finance. We make no claims of having reached a satisfactory solution of </seg>
            <seg id="p037">Adjustment of Tax Burden 33 it; but we believe that if the recommendations made in the following chapters are adopted by the legislature the result will be in the direction of a much fairer distribution of the burden of supporting the government. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">34 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission CHAPTER II THE PRESENT REVENUE SYSTEM Requirements of a Good Revenue System. — It is im- Ible fairly to consider the present revenue system of the of Nebraska, without first adverting to the general char - istics of a good revenue system. It will be conceded by all, a good revenue system should, among other things, perform ollowing functions, to-wit: 1. Provide for a fair and equitable levy. 2. Provide for prompt and economical collection of the necessary revenue. B3. Provide for direct and certain means of expenditure and ibution after collection. 14. Provide for the taking of no more than the necessary from the people, and at times most convenient to the tax &gt;rs. _ 5. It should be elastic enough in its terms as to limitations of levy, use of funds and forms of administration, not only to cover standard needs and usual demands, but also to meet or - dinary emergencies. 16. It should by its own terms, compel efficient administra - , so tempered with fairness and impartiality as to secure the itself against resentment, opposition and evasion so far as possible to do. System Prior to 1903. — Measured by the above require - ments, it is clear to most minds that the present revenue system in the state of Nebraska is seriously deficient. During the past decade, since the enactment of the revenue law of 1903, the best friend of that measure would have to confess to failure and dis - appointment in all of the above required details. The old revenue law, adopted when the state was young, was of course unfitted for the larger growth and development that followed in the first generation after its adoption. The law was poorly administered, property was taken for assessment in various counties at any - where from one-fourth to one-tenth of its actual value. The collection scheme was a failure. Tax deeds to real estate were void. Every municipality, school district and sub-division might have money in one pocket and be bankrupt in all others. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">35 Dissatisfaction, unrest unu strife developed under its operation. In 1897 and 1899, the state association of county commissioners and supervisors urged the legislature to amend the law radically for the correction of existing abuses; to provide for just and equit - able methods, and to equalize the tax burden as far as possible. The Pollard bills of 1897 and 1899 were aimed in that direction but were defeated and it was not until 1903 that a legislature was willing to give the time and labor necessary to make what may be called a complete revision of the law. Our present system consists of the Act of 1903, with a few amendments that have been since adopted. We shall proceed to consider that system as it exists at this time. ■ The Act of 1903. The chief features or characteristit present system which stand out in bold relief are about as 1. That all property not expressly exempt is subject to taxation, but while listed at its actual value, it is only asseswd at 20 per cent or one-fifth of its actual value. 2. All kinds of property are treated as of the same economic significance for purposes of taxation. 3. That the law separates the general or personal property tax from the taxes on real estate and declares the same to be a lien at a different date and provides for the same drawing interest from a different date and for different methods of enforcement. Under the present system, the taxes on real estate bt a lien against the property on October first of the year in which they are assessed, while personal property taxes do not become a lien until November first of the same year. Real estate taxes do not draw any interest whatever until May first of the year following their levy; personal property taxes draw interest from and after December first of the year in which they are 1» and the distress warrant system is used for their collection and enforcement. Under our system general taxes become the first lien on property, while special assessment or local improvement taxes are secondary liens. The administration locally, is ordi - narily through a county assessor, although the law permits the abolition of the county assessor. Two theories now have en - thusiastic adherents in the matter of making local assessment. There are many who still contend that the precinct or township assessor ought to be elected in order to preserve local autonomy </seg>

The appointive system for local deputy assessors had hardly been tried out in this state until the law was changed and required the election of deputy assessors every two years, and providing that vacancies could be filled by appointment by the county assessor and the county board. Where the local assessor is elected instead of appointed, it seems that the rule obtains that his supporters at the election expect him to see that his precinct or township is assessed on the lowest possible basis and there is therefore, a kind of competition among the assessors of the various precincts or townships in each county in which the officer seeks to merit re-election or promotion in office by convincing his constituents that they have been assessed for the lowest possible amount. It is not probable that the local man has any particular advantage in the way of knowledge or in - formation which can not readily be obtained by the appointed deputy and while the law does not place any precise penalty upon undervaluation, the local valuation and assessment will always be lacking in uniformity and fairness until the machinery is or - ganized so that each county, under the direction of a state tax commission, can obtain and if need be, compel absolute uniformity in the valuation of land and personal property. Special atten - tion was given in the enactment of the present law to the taxa - tion of insurance and surety companies, corporations, railroads and car companies and other public service or quasi public service corporations and associations. The law as it now exists is claimed to be unsatisfactory by each and all of the representatives of such interests, while on the other hand the common people and plain tax payers maintain that these interests should be taxed more heavily than they are at present.

            <seg id="p041">Objections to Present System 37 is likewise urged that the exemption of household personal property should be permitted so that the non-productive property necessary for each and every family may be relieved from taxa - tion. Under the present law there is but little exempt and this consists of the property of the state, county, the municipal cor - porations and such other property as may be used exclusively for agricultural and horticultural societies, religious, cemetery and charitable purposes. In addition to this, deductions may be made on account of easements for highways, etc., depreciating property and a further exemption is allowed in that the value arising from live fences, forest trees, etc., planted on lands shall not be taken into account. iA large portion of the tax paying public believes and signifies lesire to have at least $200 in household goods and furniture apt to the head of the family from taxation. The Commission ;ves this worthy of consideration by the legislature in the it of the adoption of the Norton amendment, which will per - reasonable exemptions to be made. 1 Another defect that should be removed is the provision for ictional assessment. There seems no sufficient reason for sing property at one-fifth of its value. Every economist and student of taxation has seemingly reached the conclusion today that real estate and personal prop - erty should be assessed at its full value and to bring that about without damage or injury under the present system, we should have an amendment to the constitution making reduction in the maximum mill levy so that excessive taxation would not be im - posed upon the increased assessed valuation when passing from a 20 per cent assessed valuation to a 100 per cent valuation. Per - sonal property taxes in the language of rrany critics should be - come a lien the same as real estate taxes, from October first, and the law ought to be amended accordingly. General criticism has been aimed at the present system on account of its requiring all taxes to be paid in one installment. Many states have success - fully adopted a law whereby taxes may be paid at the option of the taxpayer in two installments, at such times of the year as may be suitable and in accordance with the needs of the county and state for the money.

            <seg id="p042">38 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission county treasurers now remit monthly. The state law at the present time appears to provide only for remittances twice per year or when required to report by the state treasurer. We recom - mend that all county treasurers be required to report and remit by the fifteenth day of each calendar month. The powers of the county assessor, the county board of equalization and those of the state board of equalization are limited and inadequate. These powers should be greatly enlarged and strengthened by the adoption of a law which will provide for a state tax commission with powers and a jurisdiction similar to those enjoyed by the tax commission of the state of Kansas. This subject is dealt with elsewhere, and when taken in connec - tion with county assessors being permitted to appoint the local deputy assessors, would work out an administrative machinery with authority and jurisdiction sufficient to promptly meet and solve most perplexing problems of taxation. Many other criti - cisms may be justly made of the present system, but as the various chapters of this report deal with many of them specific - ally, it will be sufficient to here record the fact that the law of 1903 as amended and now in force, is not generally satisfactory to public officials, to tax payers or the people at large, and that it does not provide a fair and equitable levy; that it is inadequate as to means and methods of collection and distribution; that the machinery of administration is faulty and defective; that bookkeeping and statistics necessary to give concise information to the inquiring tax payer are not to be found and that authority is so scattered and decentralized under the present system as to eave the law itself without means of enforcement. </seg>
            <seg id="p043">Character and Theory of the Tax 39 CHAPTER III THE GENERAL PROPERTY TAX I. THE CHARACTER AND THEORY OF THE TAX The mainstay of the Nebraska revenue system is the general property tax. The Constitution of 1875 requires that all persons natural and artificial shall pay taxes in proportion to the value of their property. The rate is the same for all kinds of property. These are the essentials of the general property tax - the uniform treatment of all kinds of property regardless of its character. How great the reliance upon these uniform ad valorem taxes is will be seen by an inspection of the sources of revenue within the state. In 1902, according to the United States census figures, the total revenue receipts for state and local purposes amounted to $11,665,181. This included taxes, fees, fines, earnings of in - stitutions, interest and other commercial revenues. Of this amount $8,367,298 came from taxes; and of the tax revenues, $7,976,188, or 93 per cent, came from the general property tax. Since 1902 some new forms of taxes have been resorted to, such as the capital stock tax and the inheritance tax; but the domi - nant position of the property tax has not been materially changed. I This state is not peculiar in relying upon this form of taxa - . The general property tax developed and became firmly blished during the colonial period of our history, when there i but few kinds of property, practically all of it tangible, the burden of taxes was light. The older states inherited revenue system as they did their other institutions; and it natural for the new states as they were created to adopt the fiods of the older states for raising revenue. In due time raska adopted it and it has persisted to the present day with slight modification. 1 Under primitive industrial conditions, the ad valorem system a fairly equitable method of apportioning the tax burden, with the economic development of the country, the rise of arations with their issues of vast amounts of securities, the th of the credit system ,^the multiplication of ways of secur- </seg>
            <seg id="p044">40 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission ing an income with little or no use of property, and with the ex - pansion of state functions and the demand for increased public revenue, the general property tax has become wholly inadequate. Scarcely a tax commission or writer of repute on tax matters within the last quarter century has discussed the general property tax without condemning it, under present conditions, as wrong in theory and pernicious in practice. It is Unsound in Theory Because: 1. It assumes that tax-paying ability increases in exact proportion to the amount of property owned; while it is generally true, other things being equal, that a man's ability to bear public burdens increases more rapidly than the size of his accumulations. This principle is recognized in the taxation of incomes by making liberal exemp - tions and by applying progressive rates to the higher incomes. If taxes are to be imposed on the basis of possessions, there is no logical reason why higher rates should not be laid on large ac - cumulations of wealth; though as a matter of practice in ad - ministration small accumulations bear a heavier burden pro - portionately than the larger ones. K. The general property tax assumes that all kinds of rty are of the same economic nature. It treats land, house - goods, productive machinery, and securities as of equal cance of the owner's ability to support the government. 3. It disregards the important fact that taxes do not always stay where they are imposed; that in many cases they are "shifted" from person to person in a most uncertain way. Just as the customs and excise duties collected by the federal govern - ment are shifted to the consumer through an increase in price, so property taxes on merchandise and the machinery of produc - tion or on the privilege of carrying on business, where they are uniform and universal, are shifted to the consumer. The taxa - tion of the merchant or the manufacturer, therefore, under the conditions named, becomes essentially a convenient method of collecting "at the source," taxes on the users of commodities in proportion to the amount they consume. A tax on the value of land, on the other hand, stays where it is placed. It cannot be shifted to the renter; it cannot be shifted to the consumer of the products; for the tax does not affect the cost of production in such a way as to cause the price of the product to rise. The owner of the land must pay the tax. He cannot shift it to others. </seg>
            <seg id="p045">General Property Tar V n Practice 41 From another point of view, however, the owner of land is in a favored position: The taxes imposed on the land when he bought it is no burden whatever to him; for the price he paid wa. - than he would have paid but for the tax, by an amount equal to the tax capitalized at the current rate of interest. The land - owner must bear the burden of taxes laid while he owns the land, but previous owners cannot pass their burden on to him and he cannot pass new burdens on to future purchasers. This truth is sometimes expressed by saying that the "selling value of land is an untaxed value." Of course, this principle applies to other forms of property yielding a permanent income as, for example, a ninety-nine year bond. To sum up : A tax on merchan - dise tends to increase its price; a tax on the value of land or other permanent source of income lowers its price. 4. It assumes a constant ratio between the value of the property in a concern and its earning capacity. The falseness of this assumption is clearly seen in such monopolistic undertakings as the express business where the value of the property employed is no index of income. But in competitive businesses, wide differences exist between the value of the property used and the income derived. The recognition of this fact has led taxing authorities to seek ways of reaching the "intangible" or "fran - chise" value connected with prosperous businesses, not shown in the value of the tangible property. Again there are large classes of persons in the professions and in business, who employ relatively little capital while enjoying comfortable incomes, and under our present system escape their just share of the tax burden. 15. The general property tax assumes that securities repre - ing investment in industry are "property" in the same sense lands and factories are. Some of the most perplexing prob - in taxation have grown out of this assumption. If a property h $5,000 is mortgaged for $3,000 it is assumed that the sable wealth of the community has been increased to $8,000. uch cases or where under a corporate organization shares tock are issued, the tax paying ability of the parties con - ed is not increased as is assumed when we treat mortgages stocks as "property" in an economic sense. The General Property Tax is Vicious in Practice. — In practice the operation of the general property tax is vicious. The literature of taxation abounds in illustrations of the evils of </seg>
            <seg id="p046">Report of Nebraska Tax Commission 42 that system. Every observant person is aware of them. These evils result mainly from the attempt to raise practically all public revenue by means of ad valorem taxes, and especially from the attempt to impose the same rate upon all classes of property. When the tax burden rests on a single base, like that of the value of property, the administrative machinery is put to a severer and severer test as the burden increases. As the levies increase there is new need of full and accurate assessment. One prolific reason for complaint in this state is that improvements in methods of assessment have not kept pace with the growing need for accuracy. Many of the evils of the system may easily be remedied as experience has shown, by perfecting the machinery of taxation. This we shall discuss more particularly in connection with the real estate taxes and with proposals for administrative changes. Some evils, however, are due to inherent defects in the system, which no administrative device is likely to overcome. They show themselves chiefly in dealing with those forms of personal property which by reason of their easy concealment are called "intangibles," such as securities, money, and credits. To the consideration of the problems involved in this part of the general property tax we now turn. II. THE TAXATION OF INTANGIBLE PROPERTY I The testimony in every state where the attempt is made to intangible property at the rates imposed on other property irs that the law fails. It fails in two ways: It fails to secure e than a small fraction of the revenue designed to be secured, it fails to distribute equitably the burden of such taxes. The failure to uncover intangibles for purposes of taxation is not confined to states where there is a lax administration of the tax laws. In Massachusetts where the sense of respect for law is probably as strong, and the administration of the law is as efficient as anywhere in the Union, the special commission of 1908 estimated that not above 10 per cent of the taxable intang - ible property was placed on the assessment roll. The Tax Com - mission of Minnesota a few years ago estimated that about that proportion of intangibles was found by the assessors in that state. Similar estimates have been made elsewhere. Certainly a tax which produces only one-tenth of the revenue it was designed to produce may properly be called a failure. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">Taxation of Intangible Property 43 Consequences more serious than the loss of revenue follow such a failure. Even where the tax succeeds under such condi - tions in securing a limited revenue it fails from the point of view of justice, for where so large a volume of a given kind of property escapes taxation, the rate of return on investments in it is fixed on the basis of practical exemption. Only those of tender con - science or those unacquainted with the various devices for con - cealment pay the tax; and those who pay have the price of their property and the income from it fixed by the practice of those who do not pay the tax. A committee of the National Tax Association reporting in 1910 upon the reasons for the failure of the general property tax, in discussing this phase of the subject well said: I" The investor in securities usually pays a purchase price h is fixed in a country -wide market, and is calculated on the mption that the investment will escape taxation, and that the e income will therefore be net. Where by spasmodic en - ■irent of the law, or disclosure of personalty in a probate t, securities that bear say 4 per cent interest are made subject tax of 2 or 3 per cent on their market or face value, the moral i revolts at this practical confiscation of so large a share of ncome." |[t is little wonder that under such conditions, tax pa\ ting under a sense of injustice, evade the tax wherever pos - , or that the assessor makes the evasion easy, as he often Everybody who has given the matter serious consideration fare of the demoralizing effect of a law which drives right - led citizens to ignore it so generally that its voluntary obser - e has come to be looked upon as an amiable eccentricity, leads tax officials to wink at evasion. What is the practical out of such a situation? There are three courses that may be pursued with respect to intangibles: 1. Strengthen the administration of the law with a view to compelling disclosures. 2. Exempt such property from taxation; and E. Classify personal property, placing intangibles in a class emselves and subject them to a lower rate than is imposed her property. We shall consider each of these plans in turn. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">44 I. STRENGTHENING THE ADMINISTRATION Those who argue in favor of strengthening the administra - tion of the tax laws usually have in mind finding some way of compelling the listing of intangibles. The suggestions most frequently made before the tax commission for improving the revenue system have been in this direction: Empower the assessor to examine the books of banks with a view to reaching deposits, it is urged ; or require notes and mortgages to be stamped "tax-paid" in order to render them collectible; or authorize the employment of "tax ferrets" to uncover money and credits. Bound down as the legislature is by the present constitution in matters of taxation, it is not strange that hardly a session passes but bills looking in this direction are up for consideration. And yet no truth has been more firmly established by experience everywhere than that such devices in the end fail of their pur - pose. To be sure by means of them a temporary show of success might be made; a certain number of tax-dodgers might be "caught" and an increase of revenue secured. Everybody could see this. But not everybody would have the patience to watch the continued operation of such laws, to follow the sub - terranean methods by which business transactions would be carried on by the informed, ownership concealed, investment shifted or interest rates raised, and in the end the law brought to naught. The best illustration of the operation of stringent legislation for reaching intangibles is found in Ohio. That state has long had much the same stringent provisions with regard to declara - tion, oath, penalties, etc., which were made part of our act of 1903; and in addition since 1881 it has had, until recently, a tax ferret law which gave authority to the county commissioners in any county (since 1888) to contract with such parties as might give information leading to the placing of personal property on the tax rolls. The incentive to these so-called "inquisitors," was a share — twenty or twenty-five per cent of the taxes on the property uncovered, for doing what it was the duty of the regular tax officials to do. Many spectacular disclosures were made and many who were not attacked by the inquisitors no doubt listed property which, but for the system, they would not have listed. JDuring the four years 1893 to 1896, for example, an average of </seg>
            <seg id="p049">Strengthening the Administer 45 E $20,000,000 was added to the rolls by inquisitors. And yet w as an effective means of securing the listing of money and s proved clearly a failure. The following table covering a I when there must have been a great growth in these forms &gt;perty, shows in millions of dollars the amount of money, s and stocks and bonds listed for taxation : I These figures indicate that but a fraction of these forms of erty was secured under what has been regarded as an ex - ely severe law. The facts disclosed, and a knowledge of the ual operation of the tax led the Ohio special tax commission 108 to the following conclusion : I" The widespread concealment of intangible property, in - iing in amount year by year, is the most convincing proof of ailure of the general property tax. It shows that after more fifty years of experience, with all conceivable methods in yay of inquisitor laws, severe penalties, and criminal statutes, ned to force the owners of moneys and credits, stocks and s, to put their holdings upon the tax duplicate, not only is the ;ntage of such property less than ever before, but public ment seems to be more and more openly approving an evasion e law. Such a condition of affairs is so manifestly wrong and imical to good government that its longer continuance is a 2 injury to the state." I The experience of Iowa with the ferret system has been ter, but much the same as that of Ohio. It has been aban - d in both these states and will probably never be restored. , however, has not abandoned its purpose of compelling the ig of money and credits. In its annual report for 1912, the Tax Commission recommended a system of highly cen - sed control of assessment as a new line of approach to this other problems in the valuation of property. These recom - iations were adopted by the legislature of 1913 in the so- Year Value of All Money in Possession or on Deposit Value of Credits After Deducting All Bona Fide Debts All Moneys In- vested in Bonds, Stocks and Joint Stock Companies or Otherwise 1 $40,600,000 34,300,000 36,400,000 36,900,000 47,600,000 59,900,000 $101,100,000 107,600,000 111,400,000 106,400,000 86,900,000 77,200,000 $8,600,000 sjooiooo 10,800,000 </seg>
            <seg id="p050">46 II Warnes Law, to be discussed in another connection (p.00). ay here be said, however, that the Tax Commission has ated that the assessment of 1914 "will result in an increase proximately two-thirds of a billion dollars in the valuation ipally on intangible personal property." Whatever may e permanent outcome of the effort to reach this most trouble class of personal property, there can be no doubt of the iority of Ohio's present plan over the old ferret system. II. THE EXEMPTION OF INTANGIBLES The argument for the exemption of intangibles proceeds along two lines, the practical and the theoretical. The failure thus far to devise any means of uncovering such property fairly and adequately without serious derangement of business, it is claimed is sufficient reason for giving up the attempt. But it is argued that the chief reason why evasion is so general with respect to these forms of property is that to tax them in any manner is a rank injustice. If a full assessment of all such property were made the rate of return on the investment would rise for all and one source of inequality would be removed. But even then corporate property and encumbered property would be required to bear a double burden of taxation. The creation of a corporation, e. g. for carrying on an enterprise does not create any legitimate source of public revenue. It may be a great convenience to "incorporate" in order to build a $10,000 co-opera - tive elevator, but the division of the property into shares of $100 each and the issue of certificates of ownership therefor adds noth - ing to the wealth of the community or of the owners of the prop - erty. The owners of the elevator and of the stock are the same persons. If their assessment is to be doubled as it is where both the property and the capital stock are listed for taxation, a dis - proportionate burden is placed upon the owners of corporate property. Here is a clear case of "double taxation." This fact is recognized in some states which by law exempt shares in domestic corporations. Where the law does not specif - ically exempt such shares, the courts by judicial interpretation, or the assessors by administrative construction usually do. The Nebraska law (Sections 6313 and 6314 R. S. 1913) seems to require the taxation of shares in the hands of the stockholder unless the same have been "listed and taxed" in the principal </seg>
            <seg id="p051">47 treat shares of domestic corporations as exempt in the hands In the case of shares in foreign corporations, the most com - mon, though not universal, practice in the states is to assess them as personal property at the domicile of the owner. This is the law in Nebraska, and the practice where they can be found. In 1912 the assessors listed $2,719,700 of stocks and shares. Of this, $789,585 were returned under the head of "all shares of stock in any corporation formed outside the state; also all shares of stock in any corporation formed in state conducting business outside state"; and $1,930,175 under the head of "stock in any company or corporation, use special schedule for Nebraska companies." The assessed value was one-fifth of these sums. No doubt the practice varies as to what is included under these headings— but in the main it is as stated above. Here is one of the anomalies in American taxation, growing out of the divided jursidiction involved in our federal system. If justice requires the exemption of securities representing invest - ment in home companies, it likewise requires the exemption of securities of foreign companies. There is no economic distinction between the two. The same reasoning applies to credits. A boy buys a team to start farming and gives his note for the whole amount. The horses have been assessed, say at $500, and continue to be. The note is now assessable also for $500, though no new wealth has been created. No new source of social income exists. The note is "property" in the sense that it represents a claim upon income and has a sale value. But it must always be remembered that the income of the owner of the team and that of the holder of the note must come from the same single source, the team of horses, which before the sale was "taxed" but once. The same is of course true of notes secured by mortgage. The legislature in 1911 recognized this fact and enacted a law — not to exempt mortgages, but "for the taxation of mortgages of real property and to prevent double taxation on encumbered property in ihe state." We have discussed this law elsewhere. In operation, it results in the practical exemption of mortgages on real estate in Nebraska. But chattels and foreign mortgages of all kinds remain assessable in the hands of the owner. Yet the only </seg>
            <seg id="p052">Report of Nebraska Tax Commission 48 difference between a Nebraska mortgage and a foreign mortgage is in the location of the security. The owner of a foreign mortgage or of stock in a foreign corporation feels it unjust to have the same source of his income counted twice for taxation, even though by different states. If one is to be double-taxed, it is a matter of indifference to him whether he is despoiled by one tax - ing authority or by two. And thus it is argued that the only just method of dealing with money, credits and securities is to exempt them altogether. Whatever may be the merits of this contention, this important fact remains and must be considered in devising a revenue measure: A strong and persistent public sentiment is opposed to the socalled exemption of citizens of large means who draw their income from investments in other jurisdictions. The thing that still appeals with convincing force is that such persons benefit by the government under which they live, are able to support it, and should be compelled to do so. As long as this is the judgment or temper of the great majority of citizens, it is perhaps wise to continue the policy of taxing owners of money, credits and se - curities as such. We do not believe, however, that the intolerable inequalities that now exist and the demoralization which results from wholesale evasion by taxpayers, and widespread collusion on the part of assessors can be materially changed as long as we attempt to apply the general property rate to these forms of property. This means that as long as the present constitutional restrictions remain, there is little hope of improving this part of the revenue system. If the pending amendment is adopted, two paths lie open for effectively reaching the owners of in - tangible property : (1) Through the income tax; and (2) through the classified property tax. The first of these methods of refcrm we reserve for discussion in a later chapter; to the second we now III. THE CLASSIFIED PROPERTY TAX The most fruitful experience during recent years in dealing with intangibles has been in the direction of classifying property according to its economic character and subjecting, each class to a suitable rate. Classification thus far has consisted chiefly in making a separate class for money and credits and taxing them at a lower rate than general property; but the principle may, </seg>
            <seg id="p053">The Registry Tax 49 and doubtless will, be carried much further. The criti' against taxation by valuation are largely removed by such classification. Not all experiments in this direction com/rend themselves equally, but any of them offer a better mode of treat - ing intangibles than that of the general property tax. The Registry Tax. First as to the treatment of mortgages. New York in 1905 lifted mortgages secured by real estate within the commonwealth from the general property tax. They had previously been listed as personal property. The law of 1905 substituted an annual five mill tax uniform throughout the state. The next year this was changed to a recording tax of the same rate (50 cents per $100; paid at the time of registration. Mortgages upon which the registry tax is paid are exempt from future taxation within the state. The net revenue is divided equally between the state treasury and the county of registration. The total amount of tax collected under this law has averaged somewhat more than three and one-half millions a year. The expense of collection has been low, about one and a half per cent of the tax. The following table shows the gross income from 1906 $900,000 (estimated 1908 3,399,998 Since 1907 Minnesota has had a similar law which yields a revenue of half a million a year. In 1911 Xevv York extended the principle of the registry tax to foreign mortgages and other "secured debts," to serial bonds, notes and debentures secured by mortgage, and to bonds of other states and of municipalities. If such property is not presented for registration it is subject to taxation under the general property tax. While such a method of taxation is perhaps preferable to that of taxing such property under the general property tax, it has serious defects. The tax, if indeed it be a tax, can be evaded by those who do not care for the protection given by registration. The supreme court of Minnesota has contrued the law as imposing a tax on the right to record the mortgages and not on the debt secured by it more serious objection is that the tax bears unequally upon 1909 3,755,649 1911 3,630,092 1913 8.728,544 </seg>
            <seg id="p054">Report of Nebraska Tax Commission 50 instruments running for different terms. A mortgage which runs fifty years pays the same tax as one running for one year. For long term mortgages, such as are often issued by corpora - tions, the tax is so light as to give practical exemption. I The Annual Flat Rate Tax. — This objection is avoided by method employed in several states of imposing a low annual uniform throughout the state, upon certain forms of intangible erty. This plan has been followed in Pennsylvania for many s, and with apparent success. A flat rate of four mills on dollar of value of intangible property, uniform for the whole &gt;, is imposed. Since 1891 three-fourths of this tax has been ■ned to the several counties, the remainder going into the ! treasury. Beginning with 1914 all the tax from this source go into the local treasuries. The striking growth of these forms of property is disclosed in the following table supplied by the state treasurer: K These figures probably do not represent the full amount of kind of property owned in the state, but they are in striking rast to the figures quoted above for Ohio showing a con - dus decrease in such property. I Minnesota's Experience. — Minnesota in 1911 enacted a ar law. The statute provides for the separate listing of ;y in hand or on deposit, promissory notes and bonds other mortgages on Minnesota real estate, municipal bonds, book mits, annuities, royalties and all claims and demands for »y or other things of value. The law does not apply to money credits belonging to incorporated banks, to shares of stock, lortgages secured within the state, the latter continuing jet to the registry tax, nor to municipal bonds which are ipt. The return of moneys and credits is made on a separate iule, and it is specifically required that the taxpayer make I $159,304,729 429,751,583 575,295,999 613,927,285 673,669,421 722,864,569 882,310,195 932,688,853 1907 1908. . . . 1909 ... 1910... 1911... 1912. . 1913... . . . 1,014,757,783 . . . . 1,104,513,428 . . . . 1,141,899,627 .... 1,184,398,749 1,198,861,401 1,266,095,982 . . 1,402,511,272 </seg>

This was the first assessment under the new law. It begun only a few days after the law became effective and partly for this reason and partly no doubt because of lax habits of the assessors, many districts made lower returns than were expected. This led to a re-assessment in two hundred and ninety-seven taxing districts out of a total of twenty-four hundred, by special assessors appointed by the State Tax Commission. The results were significant. In these 297 districts, the regular assessors listed only 1831 persons having money and credits amounting to $4,602,296, "while the special assessors found 8,630 persons subject to the tax for a total assessment of $14,221,949, a gain of $9,618,653, the increase in the number of persons assessed being 370 per cent and 210 per cent in the amount of the assess- tWe quote the Tax Commission on one phase of the law: ne criticism of the law is heard because it does not permit e deduction of debts from credits.

There is perhaps as much justification on ids of equity for deducting debts from these classes of prop - as from credits, but no such deductions have ever been per - ?d under the law. In the opinion holding that debts cannot "ducted from credits the supreme court says: E" Though this result leads to a departure from the long settled y of the state to allow the deduction of debts in taxation of kind, that policy was at its inception of doubtful merit, in it extended to one class of tax payers a favor not granted to s. It permitted the tax payer holding credits to deduct his ; from the amount of his assessment, and denied the right y owner of other property who was also in debt." BThe Tax Commission in its report for 1912 concludes its dis - on of the operation of the law as follows: " While it is not claimed that all intangible property subject to taxation under the new law has been placed on the assessment rolls, the proportion that now escapes taxation is much less than it was when we attempted to tax such property with the same machinery and on the same basis as other forms of property. In addition, it will not be denied that the tax burden on this class of property is much more widely, as well as much more equitably and justly distributed than it was under the old system. While it can scarcely be claimed that two years afford sufficient time to demonstrate the success or failure of any radical departure from methods of taxation that have grown hoary with age, yet our brief experience in Minnesota with the three mill tax on money and credits justifies us in the belief that we have taken a decided step in advance. Men differ as to the wisdom of taxing property of this nature at all, but there is no difference in opinion that a burdensome or confiscatory tax drives such property into concealment. Experience in our own and every other state has demonstrated that when a tax rate con - sumes more than 10 per cent of the income from this class of property it will not be voluntarily listed for taxation. The aver - age tax rate in Minnesota this year is nearly 30 mills. With such a rate consuming, as it would, from 40 to 60 per cent of the in - come from invested credits, it would be folly to hope to reach more than a fraction of such property for purposes of taxation under the old system. I It was for this reason that the legislature passed the three tax law. We believe it is a decided improvement over the method of taxing money and credits, because it is more table and will eventually produce more revenue than the ystem did.

Experience in Other States. — Maryland has had equal success in bringing out intangibles at a low rate. Rhode Island has since 1912 had a flat four mill tax on money and credits. The operation of the law there can not be understood without considering the method of reaching the "intangible value" of corporations. It appears probable that there has not been a gain in valuation sufficient to make up the loss of revenue at the low rate, if the returns of individual taxpayers alone be considered. But mercantile and manufacturing corporations are taxed on their "corporate excess" and their money and credits as such do not appear in the tax rolls. Public service corporations are taxed on their gross receipts. Taking these facts into account, the Tax Commission says in its report of January, 1914: "The local valuation of intangibles, together with savings and participation accounts and reserve funds, the corporate excess of manufacturing, mercantile, and miscellaneous corpora - tions, the stock of banks and trust companies, and the securities of public service corporations obtained by capitalizing their gross receipts tax on a basis of $4 per $1,000.00, gives the total amount of intangibles paying taxes in this state as more than $460,000,000.00, an amount which was never even approached be - fore the enactment of the Tax Act of 1912, and which exceeds the total local valuation of the state for 1904 by more than $16,000,000. Not only has the amount of intangibles greatly increased, but also the amount of taxes paid, notwithstanding the flat rate of $4 per $1,000.00- The net increase in total revenue paid on account of intangibles, while not positively determinable, is not less than three-quarters of a million dollars, and is in all proba - bility much more." tin Iowa alone of the states that have adopted the classified for intangibles has there been a failure to secure additional nue. In that state there has been an actual loss of revenue be public treasuries estimated at $1,000,000 a year. The re of the Iowa law to bring out an increased amount of me r ey credits is explained by the Special Tax Commission of 1912 he absence of any centralized supervision and control such :ists in Minnesota and Rhode Island. ■The Situation in Nebraska. — As pointed out in a previous graph, the law as it now stands is not clear with respect to </seg>

The law as it stood prior to the revision of 1903 permitted a taxpayer "to deduct from the gross amount of credits the amount of all bona fide debts owing by such person, company, or corporation to any other person, company or corporation for a consideration received." The act of 1903 made no provision for deductions, but the su - preme court has held in a series of cases that the word "credit" as used in the act means "net credit." To arrive at which in - debtedness may be deducted from "gross credits." The term has received further interpretation bearing on the question of deductions. Credits arising in the course of trade are held to be true credits within the meaning of the statute and bona fide debts may be offset against them; while credits arising from the loaning or investing of money should be treated as "money loaned" and not as credits against which debt may be offset.

            <seg id="p062">58 It will be seen that during the first eight years of the period there was a steady increase of this class of property placed on the rolls. The high mark was reached in 1911 when the assessed valuation stood at $19,681,242, or 4.73 per cent of the total assessed valuation. The decline since 1911 is due chiefly to the operation of the mortgage tax law enacted that year. The problem before us is how to treat moneys, securities and these various forms of credit for purposes of taxation. We believe the best course with respect to these forms of property is to place them in a special class and subject them to a low rate uniform throughout the state. If the experience of other states is repeated in Nebraska, the change should result in an increase of revenue. But whether the revenues are increased or not a gain will be made by removing one of the strongest incentives to evasion with all its vicious effects, and by doing substantial justice to those who will not, or cannot, evade the present law. It is not, perhaps, an ideal solution of a difficult problem, but that it is a practical way out of an intolerable situation is shown by the experience of the states where it has been given a serious Conditions Necessary to Success. — It is not pretended that the proposed law would be self-operative. Many persons would attempt to evade a low rate just as they now evade the general property tax rate. There is reason for believing, however, that the great majority of taxpayers would not do so under a reasonably efficienct administration of the law. Taxation from its very nature rests on coercion, and effective administration is a necessary feature of every revenue law. This suggests the first condition to the success of the proposed plan: That there shall be an efficient central control of assessments such as can be exercised only by a tax commission with strong powers. If the people of the state are not willing to pay the price — not willing to submit to state supervision and to meet the expense involved — the hope of materially improving the present situation may as well be given up. A second essential feature of the proposed plan is that the fear be removed that upon listing securities under it, the taxpayer may be mulcted for back taxes for a term of years. In the third place, taxpayers must have reasonable assurance that the plan is to have a fair degree of permanence. </seg>

Provisions of the Present Law. — Since 1904 real estate has been assessed quadrennially. A crude sort of classification is made of "improved," and "unimproved," lands, and "im- proved" and "unimproved" lots, and a separate valuation of improvements is required. The improvements are, however, taxed in exactly the same way as the land itself. When improve- </seg>
            <seg id="p065">The Real Estate Tas 61 ments are made after an assessment, which increases the sale value by more than $100, the assessor, at the time of making the annual personal property assessment following, is required to increase the original valuation by an amount equal to "the true value added to such parcel of land or lots by the said im - provements." Likewise deductions are allowed in case of loss by fire or flood. Assessments are equalized by the county board and the state board, as in the case of personal property. The county board of equalization is authorized at any of its annual meetings to consider and correct "evident errors of assessment or apparent gross injustice in over-valuation or under-valuation of real property. 1 ' An amendment to Section 121 of the Revenue Law made by the legislature of 1911 seems to give power to the county board to enter upon a general equalization of real estate in alternate years beginning with 1912, without any re-ananas ment having been made. Permanent Character of this Source of Revenue. There is no question as to the propriety of the land tax such as is raised in connection with personal property taxes. The land of a country, its primary source of wealth, has always and everywhere been an important source of public revenue and everyone agrees that it must continue to be. Indeed it has been earnestly urged before this Commission that it should be made the sole source. The advocates of the system of taxing land values only are not primarily interested in fiscal reform but in a larger and more fundamental reform of economic and social conditions. Whatever the merit of such a scheme as a plan of social reform or as a reform of the revenue system, the real estate taxes will without doubt continue to occupy in the future, as in the past, an important place in the fiscal system. The great practical problem in con - nection with this class of property is to improve the method of assessment to the end that greater accuracy in the valuations may The Taxation of Improvements. Although the law requires the separate listing of land and the improvements thereon, the two elements of real estate are subject to the same rule of assessment and taxation. It is a matter of common ob - servation, however, that improved properties are assessed at a larger percentage of their true value than unimproved property. It seems clear that if any discrimination is to be made in the </seg>
            <seg id="p066">62 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission assessment it should be in favor of the improved property. It has been argued before the Commission that improvements ought to be exempted from taxation. In recent years several bills have been introduced into the legislature looking to such exemption. This is in line with the policy adopted in the western provinces of Canada by many municipalities, and with a number of attempts made in American cities. Pueblo, Colorado at the present time is in process of abolishing the taxation of im- If such a policy were adopted it would involve a reduction of valuation on the grand assessment roll by $59,359,176 as shown in the assessment of 1913, though the census bureau for 1910 found the value of buildings on farms alone was $198,807,622. Unless new sources of revenue are found the remaining property would of course have to bear a heavier burden. A large part of this increase would fall upon the land though other kinds of property would share the burden of higher levies. The exemp - tion would operate unequally as between town and country. Of the $59,359,176 of assessed value returned by the assessors as improvements in 1913, $21,312,552 was for improvements on farms, and $38,046,624 for those on lots in villages and cities. One-half of the valuation of city improvements is returned from Douglas ($14,000,000) and Lancaster ($5,000,000) counties. The relative importance of land and improvements in town and country as shown by the assessed valuation of 1913 is summarized in the following table: Value of lands $229,931,794 Value of improvements on land. 21,312,552 Value of lots 33,341,217 Value of improvements on lots . 38,046,624 tit has been proposed before the Commission and in the iature to exempt improvements on farms while leaving city ovements subject to taxation. We can see no economic fication for such a plan. But land and improvements do lg to two distinct economic classes, and may properly be i upon a different basis. Land tends to increase in value this without effort on the part of the owner, while improve - :s are subject to constant depreciation and in the end must (placed by labor. A tax on improvements tends to discourage </seg>

These differences may not warrant the disturbance roperty values that would be involved in the total exemption nprovements. But in our opinion they do warrant a dis - ination in favor of the less durable property. We, therefore, mmend that in case the pending tax amendment is adopted law be so amended that improvements shall be assessed at er cent of the value they add to land and that land shall be ssed at its true value. This would at least correct the present prevalent practice of placing a larger burden on improved, l on unimproved property. The Assessment of Real Estate. The most important problem connected with the taxation of real estate is that of im - proving the method of assessing this important class of property. It is usually assumed that the correct valuation of real estate is a very simple matter, and compared with the difficulties of assessing most personal property it is simple. Nevertheless it is no easy task if justice is to be done. It is a task which demands the exercise of skill and judgment, and this demand is becoming more and more imperative with the increase of the tax burden upon this species of property. t Unequal Assessments.

            <seg id="p070">66 The table shows in the first place a decided under- valuation. The Railway Commission's estimate of the true value of 49,717, - 600 acres of all kinds of land in the state for 1913 is $2,108,963,504, or $42.42 per acre. The assessors' "actual" value for 40,203,007 acres assessed in 1913 was $1,256,221,730, or $31.30 per acre. This is 73.79 per cent of the Commission's value based on land sales and bankers' estimates. It will be noted that the Commis - sion's figures include a larger area than the assessors' return. The latter of course took no account of the government lands, unsold school lands, those belonging to the local governments and those exempted from taxation because of the use to which they are put. If these omitted lands had been included in the assessors' figures, the disparity between the two estimates would have been increased. The law requires the assessor to list the land at its "actual value," one-fifth of which is taken for the assessed value. In practice, however, each assessor sets up a rule for himself. In some counties the practice prevails of classifying^ lands, e. g. as level farm land, rolling farm land, pasture land, and fixing a flat rate per acre for each class. One assessor estimates the true value of the land and "throws off" $5.00 per acre, others "throw off," 10, 15, or 20 per cent, each assessor being in this matter a law unto himself. We thus have differences arising from the delib - erate action of the assessing officers. Other disparities naturally arise from differences in judgment as to what the true value is, and still others are due to pressure exerted by taxpayers. The result of these forces is gross inequalities in assessing this most important item on the rolls. It is a matter of common observa - tion that properties in cities of moderate value are assessed at a higher percentage of their value than the more expensive ones, and that residence property is assessed at a higher percentage than business property. The most important immediate problem connected with real estate taxation, therefore, is the elaboration of means of securing a full and fair valuation. Improved Methods of Assessment. — The value of a thing is what it will sell for under normal conditions. The work of the assessor is to determine as accurately as possible what property would bring if offered freely for sale. Valuation by buyers is a matter of judgment on their part. It must always be a matter of judgment for the assessor. All the law can do is to aid him by </seg>
            <seg id="p071">The Sales Method 67 making available for his guidance such information as it is pos - sible to provide. The Sales Method. Many assessors make use of the sales of real estate which come to their notice as a guide in valuing not only the property sold, but also similar property not trans - ferred. The sale price is not an absolute measure of a proper assessment. The price may in any given sale, owing to peculiar conditions, be either higher or lower than the true market value of the property. Nevertheless in the price at which land actually changes hands the assessor has perhaps the best single guide to proper valuation. We are convinced that if assessors made systematic use of the information which could be gotten from the record of transfers and from other sources a vast gain in accuracy of assessment would be made. It should be the duty of the reg - ister of deeds to certify to the county assessor the description, date of sale and consideration in the deed of each parcel of land transferred. What use the assessor shall make of such informa - tion must be left to his discretion. True Consideration in Deeds. Unfortunately the in - formation given in the records is often misleading owing to the frequent practice of inserting nominal consideration in deeds. We have given some study to the question as to whether a closure of the true consideration should be required, if not in the deed, then in a separate sworn statement to be used by the assessor for official purposes only. Proposals of this kind have been recommended by several tax commissions and bills em - bodying the plan have been before several legislatures, including those in Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Illinois, Xew York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah and Wisconsin. As far as we have learned, no state has yet enacted such a law. The value of the information the records would soon contain would go far toward correcting the inequalities now complained of, and the supposed advantage of speculators in land should not be allowed to stand in the way of such a reform. As was well said by the Ohio Tax Commission in its report for 1911: "The assessment of property is a public function. The law provides the machinery for ascertaining values, and it would seem proper that the state should provide the best information upon which the assessor can base his action. It should put into his hands the most effective tools for this purpose. Men engaged </seg>

I The seriousness of the handicap upon assessors which the ?nt practice imposes is brought out by the Commissioners of * and Assessments of New York City in their report for E" During the last twenty-five yearst he practice of inserting ominal consideration in deeds has become so universal that / about one deed in twenty contains the actual consideration transfer. The custom conceals 95 per cent of the best evidence he value of real property; it operates to the detriment of the he business of real estate brokerage, by causing a well grounded ■ on the part of investors that they will be deceived as to the ae of real estate. Any practice which checks the diffusion of estate ownership is a detriment to the community. I The concealment of the actual prices paid for real estate s the department to waste much valuable time in a hunt for ; ought to be a matter of record. Sometimes deputies are ived and suppose that the consideration was greater or less it really was. If they had all the considerations for actual , those that were at peculiarly high or low prices would i out from the rest and would be discredited as evidences of It is rather an extraordinary fact that whereas the price of real estate is the most important price to know from the standpoint of taxation it is the most inaccessible price to obtain. Stocks and bonds are quoted daily on the Stock Exchange. On Produce Exchange we have daily quotations of all kinds of produce; the Metal Exchanges give us the prices of metals. Inquiry at any retail store gives actual prices of every conceivable kind of goods. Practically the only price that is today concealed is the price paid for real estate. I In 1911 and 1912 the New York State Conferences on Taxa - recommended a bill to require an affidavit setting forth the consideration for every transfer of real estate. In 1913 a having the same object was introduced in the legislature, :h attempted the same result by penalizing the record of a which does not contain a statement of the actual considera- The principle of these bills was endorsed by Judges Gilder - re, Brady and Ford.

Robinson. " We believe the time has come to adopt the principle in legisla - tion that the state has a right to this information. The Federal government has asserted it in connection with the administration of stamp duties on transfers, and it has become an important feature of the Alberta increment tax law described elsewhere in Classification of Real Estate. Better assessments could be made if lands were better classified. The legislature has already provided for classifying lands and lots as improved and unim - proved and classification should be carried farther. The law permits the assessor to list as one tract as much as a section of land when it belongs to one owner. There would be no objection, perhaps, to the assessment going on the roll in this way if the assessor has an accurate knowledge of the amount of the different grades of land in the tract, and has made a careful valuation of each grade in fixing his value of the whole. Equalizing boards are helpless without the knowledge supplied by classification. The higher or lower valuation per acre in different townships or counties means nothing unless the proportions of different grades of land are known. Every time an equalization is to be made by the state board representatives of the counties affected appear before the board and vie with one another in ascribing to their respective counties large tracts of rough, over-flow, and ■ lands. They furnish no accurate data because they have none; nor has the board ; it has nothing to act upon but general impres - sions. In the interest, therefore, of a better original assessment, and of a more careful equalization, classification of lands is re- tMr. E. W. Reed, formerly right-of-way statistician to the vay Commission, presented to this Commission a plan of ifying lands for purposes of valuation which we believe d be of considerable service. His plan is to establish classes nd as "level farm lands, rolling farm lands," etc., etc., and have the county assessor, with the aid of the leading real </seg>
            <seg id="p074">70 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission estate dealers, bankers and others having expert knowledge, fix a fair and reasonable valuation for each grade of land. The Kansas Tax Commission has had made a classification of the lands of that state under headings corresponding substantially to those proposed by Mr. L. L. Powers of the Census Bureau, as follows: Bottom land, upland; cultivated, arable; timber used for pasture, timber not so used; orchard; pasture, tillable and non-tillable; waste. The actual work of classifying the lands was left to the local assessors, and this was also a part of the plan of Mr. Reed. No doubt more accurate information can be collected in this way than has heretofore been available; but it would seem that under such a plan the same tendency must show itself to under-classification that there now is toward under - valuation. The opinion of men having the practical knowledge of the productive power of the soil is needed for making a classi - fication survey; but their opinion should be guided and checked by scientifically established facts where possible. A body of facts of this kind is being accumulated by the State Soil Survey, and by the United States Topographical Survey. The government has covered about 40 per cent of the area of the state including roughly the southern half of the state except the extreme southwestern corner. The Soil Survey is making a more detailed study of the character of the soil and the data supplied by it will be of great value to taxing officers when published. Thus far the maps for only Otoe county have been published. But surveys have been made for Thurston, Seward, Gage, Nemaha, Sarpy, Douglas, Cass, Saunders, Lancaster, and Scotts Bluff counties and parts of a few others. The topograph - ical work of the United States government naturally precedes the survey of the soils, and is a necessary preliminary, morever, not only to that work, but also to the work of the State Geological Survey. It is understood that the present policy of the govern - ment is to require co-operation on the part of the states in work - ing out the topography of the country on the theory that the states have a vital interest in such work and that they should contribute to the expense. The government offers, however, to duplicate any amount the state will provide for carrying for - ward the topographical survey. In view of the dependence of state activities upon the completion of this survey, it would seem wise to hasten the completion of this foundation work. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">71 The maps thus supplied, supplemented by the detailed work of the soil survey would be an invaluable aid in making a proper classification of lands. They can also be used as a base for the tax maps discussed below without any great additional expense. BWe recommend, therefore, that provision be made by law supplying county assessors, county boards and the state d of equalization with these maps as fast as completed. Tax Maps. Special maps made for the use of taxing officers have been found highly useful where employed. Their use has grown up especially in the larger cities of the country where the assessing authorities have most keenly felt the need of them. While more needed in the cities, they are equally applicable to rural lands. They must show accurately the boundaries of each parcel and should be on a large enough scale to permit the nota - tion of sale prices, asking price of property offered for sale, unit values and the assessed valuation. The value of such maps con - sists in the accuracy which can thus be secured as to the area of each parcel, in preventing omissions, and in bringing into a rela - tion where they can be easily seen the assessments of contiguous Aid of Experts. It is quite possible to over-estimate the importance of such devices as the sales method, classification and tax maps. In fact there is a tendency just now to make a fetish of them. No one, however, who has studied the problem of assessment can doubt their great importance; but after all is said and done, they are only aids, and the assessment must rest back finally upon the judgment of the assessor. In many cities the assessor follows the practice of calling real estate men and others having the first hand knowledge of values to help him in fixing his valuations. This is an important feature of the so - called Somers System now being employed in many places. The assessment board in New York City has long foHowed the plan. It is found that the publicity thus given to the work insures more accurate valuations and a higher degree of satisfaction on the part of taxpayers than when the valuations are made in the seclusion of the assessor's office, or with the questionable aid perhaps of the owner of the property. This method of appeal to community judgment is not one which can well be required by law. It is a matter of administration to be adopted on the initiative of the assessor or on that of the officer or officers charged with super- </seg>
            <seg id="p076">72 Ig his work. We believe that its general adoption for both and rural property would result in a great improvement in eal estate assessment. It is highly important that assessors Id be put in touch with the literature of this subject, in a form ble for their use. To sum up : The whole trend of tax-reform as far as method of assessment is concerned is in the direction of greater accuracy. Effort is directed toward the elimination of the personal equation of the assessor by giving to him the benefit of community judg - ment, expert council, working rules based on wide experience and wise guidance of supervising officers. The use of the devices suggested involves some additional expense but the expenditure is well worth making. Justice as between man and man in im - posing the burden of maintaining the government is the end sought and it must be as nearly attained as possible regardless of The Assessment of Buildings. —The law requires the separate assessment of "improvements," but there is no definition of the term and the state board has made no ruling on the subject. Doubtless the practice varies, but the most usual one is to include buildings only. In the interest of uniformity the assessors should be instructed what to include under the head of improvements. The assessment of buildings is itself a difficult task. Some counties make no return under this head, and too often the valuation is haphazard guess work. This is hardly the place to discuss the proper method of assessment. It would be part of the duty of a permanent commission to settle broad questions of policy such as what should be included under improvements, methods of computing cost of buildings of different construction, the rate of depreciation and the like. A great body of informa - tion on this and other phases of valuation is being published embodying the experience of those who have become skilled in certain branches of work of assessment. If our recommendation for assessing improvements at a lower percentage of their actual value than land be adopted by the legislature, the method of •Messing buildings will become one of great importance. Publicity of Assessments. — The result of the assessment should be given the widest publicity. This should be done in the case of personal as well as real estate assessments. At present no provision is made for notifying taxpayers of the amount of </seg>
            <seg id="p077">73 their assessment except upon request for a written statement. Such a request is rarely made, the taxpayer relying upon his recollection of the values tentatively agreed upon with the assessor, or set down by him if he makes out and mails his own schedule. The error is often made of thinking that the values so set down are the assessment. But it must be remembered that the listing of property and the assessment are two different things. It is the duty of the owner to take the first step and of the assessor to fix the value. Many assessors feel free to r» values given in by the owner "on fuller consideration" or "on later information"; and it is proper that they should. The law gives large discretion to taxing officers at every stage of the process to make changes that will bring about a full and fair assessment. But provision should be made for informing each person of the amount fixed by the assessor. The supreme court has held that while the county assessor may change the schedule of a taxpayer and add to it such property as has been omitted, "before making such change or addition to the schedule he must give notice to the taxpayer of his intention to do so, and thus afford him an opportunity for a hearing. It seems clear from the authorities that such change or addition made without notice and without an opportunity for a hearing somewhere along the line of procedure is void, for it amounts to "taxing the property of the citizen without due process of law." Bankers Life Insur - ance Co. v. County Board, 89 Neb., 469-472. The law should be so amended as to require the assessor at the time of viewing and listing to give to the owner a state - ment of the amount of his provisional assessment with the under - standing that it is subject to revision upon notification. I The taxpayer has a right to know not only what his own ssment is, but that of his neighbor as well. The law gives the right to appear before the county board of equalization to plain of the undervaluation of his neighbor's property, but s him no adequate means of ascertaining what that assessment If feasible it would be desirable to have assessments pub - »d before equalization, but such a plan presents certain diffi - ies. There is no reason, however, why the equalized assess - it should not be published for the information of taxpayers, j is done in many places. Sometimes only the personal list is published, sometimes only the real estate, but often together. </seg>
            <seg id="p078">74 Report of Nebraska Tax Commis- The city of Lowell, Massachusetts, for example, publishes a pamphlet giving for the whole city the following items: Per - sonal value, buildings value, law value, value per foot, total tax. In other places such information is provided for each ward sepa - rately. The publicity thus given to the equalized valuation, es - pecially of real estate would contribute much to securing a careful and fair valuation. Recommendations. — It is recommended therefore: Bl. That the law be so amended as to require tie assessor te time of viewing and listing property to give the owner a «n statement of the amount of his assessment and to notify of any change made in the schedule thereafter. BL That provision be made for giving publicity to the ized assessment of personal and real property. Quadrennial Assessments. — Prior to the revision of 1903 the assessment of real estate was made annually. The new law provided for the quadrennial assessment of this class of property. Authority is given the County Board of Equalization, at any of its annual meetings to change assessments on real estate "in cases of evident error or of apparent gross injustice" resulting from over-valuation or or under- valuation. As explained above, additions or deductions are made in case improvements are added or destroyed. An amendment made in 1911 seems to give the county board power in even numbered years "to equalize the valuation of real property" without any new assessment. Under this provision several counties in 1914 lowered their real estate valuations. It is understood that this amendment was expected to operate with other proposed changes which failed to become law. As the law now stands confusion is caused by the provision and if quadrennial assessments are continued we recommend the repeal of the amendment of 1911. I But should the quadrennial assessment be retained? It been argued before the Commission that it involves great itice. When poor assessments are made they in most cases lin unchanged for four years. Aggrieved parties may, it is i make complaint and secure relief, but as a matter of fact for riety of reasons comparatively few avail themselves of the ;. On the other hand, those who are assessed too low have an le advantage for four years. Again it is argued that even gh a good assessment is made, changes in values occur that </seg>
            <seg id="p079">75 ought not to be disregarded for three or four years. For example, the law seems to give no power to change the assessment if properly made in the first place, whatever the change in value may be. Again, the quadrennial assessment has been highly advan - tageous to owners of real estate during the period of rapid rise in land values since 1904. This is shown by the assessments of 1908 and 1912. In 1904 the assessment of real estate amounted to 182 millions. By 1907 this had been increased by the addition of improvements and extensions of the area assessed to 193 millions. The assessment for 1908 rose to 255 millions, and this probably fell short of the increase in value that had taken place during the quadrennium. Again, in 1912 there was a jump from 267 million to 319 million although most of the increase had taken place long before that year. The evil is increased by the fact that values do not change evenly in all parts of the state, or in all parts even of the same community. In urban communities especially values shift quickly and unevenly; and frequent assessments should be made in order to register the changes. I On the other hand, it is held that the present plan gives ter stability in the valuations in the assessment rolls than d be possible under a shorter term. This might prove a er of some importance to those institutions which depend i a permanent millage tax for support since it enables them stimate their future revenues with greater accuracy. Still advantage can be easily over-estimated. On the whole, these tutions under normal conditions have more to gain than to by more frequent assessments. But whether this is true or their interests should not be allowed to stand in the way of )ting a more just rule. Another argument against more frequent assessment is the increased cost it would entail. We have no data showing what the cost of such assessment is. If, however, the recommenda - tions of the Commission are accepted for making the county as - sessor the assessor in fact as well as in name, the increased cost would practically be covered by the cost of preparing the books. The valuation would be in progress during the whole year and the assessment the first of April would involve only the cost of tran- ■ It was argued at the time the present law was enacted that quadrennial assessment would be an advantage to those who </seg>

An increase in the valuation of a piece of land carrying with it an increase in the tax has the effect, other conditions remaining the same, of depressing the value of the real estate by an amount equal to the capitalized value of the increase of the tax at the current rate of interest. A dealer's calculations might thus be seriously affected by an increased assessment; but this seems no valid reason for retaining a plan which carries with it evident injustice to large numbers not in - terested in speculation. K Recommendations. — In the opinion of the Commission, weight of argument, therefore, is against the quadrennial sment. If that is abandoned what should be substituted As far as we have been able to learn, the practice in the various states is as follows: 28 states have annual assessments of real estate; 5 have biennial ; and 5 have quadrennial assessments. In our opinion all interests would be best conserved by a biennial assessment. We, therefore, recommend that the law be so amended as to require a new assessment of real property in 1916 and biennially thereafter. Forest Taxation. — The taxation of timber lands presents some special problems. A peculiar feature of this kind of property is the great length of time that must elapse between the planting of forest trees and their maturity. The imposition of the usual ad valorem tax upon it is for obvious reasons destructive of the industry. During recent years much attention has been given to this phase of real estate taxation. There are those who advocate the plan of total exemption of forest lands as an encouragement to timber culture. Another plan is to substitute for all annual taxes a tax upon the yield at time of cutting. Both these plans would involve the surrender of a source of public revenue, in the latter case for a term of years, in the former permanently. A third plan is to combine the annual land tax and a yield tax. This seems the fairest method for all interests concerned. Lands that have a use value aside from the timber would thus be required to contribute moderately to the public revenues without discourage - ment to tree planting; and when great values have thus been pro - duced they become a proper object of taxation. A fourth plan is to tax the land but exempt the value due to the presence of growing trees. This is the method provided by the present law </seg>
            <seg id="p081">Forest Taxation 77 in this state. The statute provides that "the increased value of lands by reason of live fences and forest trees grown and cultivated thereon shall not be taken into account in the assess - ment thereof." It is probable that assessors give little heed to this broad provision, but the right to exemption may be claimed at any time. This would seem to be all the encouragement that could reasonably be demanded for this branch of industry. The exemption now permitted is warranted only by the peculiar character of timber culture and its great social significance. There is danger, indeed, that if the law should prove successful in promoting the successful planting of considerable areas the liberal exemption now allowed might be withdrawn to the injury of those who had embarked in such enterprises. iWe do not recommend any change in the law at the present ; but it is a subject that may well be given study in the future. Opinions differ as to whether the development of mercial timber culture may reasonably be expected in this &gt;. The experiments now under way by the federal govern - t at Halsey ought ere long to throw light upon this subject furnish a guide to the legislature in dealing with the matter comprehensive way. Increment Taxation. The difference in economic char - acter between land and most other kinds of property has long been recognized, though rarely in the tax laws. Under the gen - eral property tax all kinds of property have been treated alike. A revenue system based on the inflexible rule of uniformity where such great variety exists is crude and must in time, as we have argued elsewhere, give way to a rational classification of property. We have recommended that intangibles be placed in a class by themselves and subjected to a lower rate, and that improvements be assessed at a lower percentage of their actual value than land. We wish now to call attention to another feature of land taxation which is commanding an increasing amount of attention and has already been embodied in practical legislation in some places. This new feature of taxation consists in appropriating for the public use some part or all of the future increase in the value of land. The means by which this end is accomplished varies in different places, but everywhere it is through a special tax upon increases in the value of land in addition to the usual tax on the land according to its present value. The first example' of </seg>
            <seg id="p082">78 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission this kind of tax was that laid by the Germans in their colony of Kiauchau in 1898. Large expenditures were to be made, a great port was to be developed and it was foreseen that speculators would rush in to buy up land they did not intend to develop in order to secure the rise in value certain to follow. It seems that the government at first proposed to retain control of the territory and profit by the rise, but for some reason this had to be given up and a scheme for taxing the increase in value was adopted. The plan was quickly seized upon by many cities in Germany as affording an appropriate revenue. Down to 1911 when an im - perial increment tax was adopted 4,500 municipalities had enacted some kind of an increment tax law. The nature and variety of these laws are indicated by the following summary by Professor E. R. A. Seligman: "The increased value on which the tax was applied was generally interpreted to mean the difference between the last pur - chase price and the present selling price. Allowance was almost universally made for expenditures incurred in the improvement of the land and for the cost of new buildings or rebuilding. Allow - ance was also usually made for a sum equivalent to the stamp tax, the transfer tax and other fees connected with the change of owner - ship. A further sum was usually allowed representing the interest (not compounded) from the time of the last sale to the present transfer. In some places these sums, especially the cost of im - provements, were subtracted from the selling price, while in others they were added to the purchase price. In some places again, where certain parcels of an entire tract owned by a single individual had been sold at a loss, allowance was made therefor, provided that the losing sales occurred at the same time as those that were profitable, or within a limited period previous thereto. In most cases, again, slight increases of value were exempted. The tax applied in general only to increments of value exceeding 10 per cent; sometimes, however, it began only at 20 per cent, and in Frankfort only at 30 per cent. The rates were almost always progressive, but the minima and maxima varied greatly. Thus in Hamburg the rates were graduated from 1 to 12£ per cent, while in Cologne they rose from 10 to 25 per cent. In Gelsen - kirchen the maximum was 30 per cent. The scale of progression, moreover, varied considerably, from 1 per cent for each 10 per - cent increase of value, as in Cologne, up to 10 per cent for each 5 per cent increase in value in some other cities. The maximum limits varied still more widely: In Paderborn, for instance, the highest rate (15 per cent) was imposed in case of an increase of value of over 75 per cent, while inXother townsjthe increase of </seg>
            <seg id="p083">79 value taken into account in determining the rate was consider - ably higher, rising in some cases to 200 per cent. The highest tax imposed anywhere was 30 per cent where the increase of value was over 155 per cent." I The same principle was adopted by the British Parliament a notable struggle over the budget of 1909. In October, , the Province of Alberta enacted a law providing for an ment tax. While designed for the benefit of the provincial iury, the tax is practically confined to urban lands. It does y to high priced farm lands i worth over $50 per acre) when in large tracts (over 640 acres). The law provides: I' That there shall be paid upon the registration under The Titles Act of any transfer of land a tax of 5 per cent on the ised value of the said land over and above the value thereof ding to the last preceding value for the purposes of this excluding in all cases the cost of improvements or develop - work actually made or done upon or in connection with the land." All these increment taxes seek to reach only that part of the increased value which is "unearned," that is, which is due to what Mill calls "the ordinary progress of a society which in - creases in wealth, and which is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords; to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community, in - dependently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themsel From the time of Adam Smith economists have recognized the peculiarity of ground-rents, and the value of land that they con - stantly tend to increase without any exertion or sacrifice on the part of the owners; that owners of land as Mill puts it "grow richer as it were in their sleep, without working, risking or econ - omizing"; and that the increasing value of land or the rent arising from it, therefore, is a proper subject for special taxation. The principle is recognized in the English income tax which im - poses a heavier tax on "unearned " incomes, such as those arising from rents and investments, than upon "earned " incomes derived from employment and the conduct of business. Most economists and the great majority of the people agree with Mill that while the taxing away of all the value which society has allowed to accrue to landowners would violate property rights which society is bound to respect, nevertheless there can be "no objection to </seg>

Prior to 1911 rrortgages were treated as personal property and assessed, when listed at all, at the domicile of the owner. In that year a new departure was inaugurated by the so-called Smith Mortgage Tax Law, providing by a round-about method for the practical exemption of rrortgages secured by real estate within the commonwealth. The m entitled "An Act to Provide for the Taxation of Mortgages of Real Property and to Prevent Double Taxation on Encun bered Property in the State." The act declares a mortgage on real estate in this state an interest in the real property for pur| of taxation. The amount and value of the mortgage is required to be assessed to the mortgagee or his assigns and the taxes levied thereon are made a lien on the mortgage interest; while the excess value of the real estate above the mortgage is assessable to the owner of the premises. But the mortgagor or the mort - gagee may either assume the payment of taxes on the inten the other. The two interests are to be assessed separately exctpt where the mortgagor agrees to pay the taxes on both intei In such cases the assessor "shall not enter said mortgage for separate assessment and taxation, but both interests shall be assessed and taxed to the mortgagor or owner of the property mortgaged." The act was not to apply to mortgages fik-d before July 1, 1911, nor "to corporations, the property of which is now exempt from taxation." (The Operation of the Law. — The arguments advanced in r of the law at the time of its passage and more recently for ontinuance were (1) that it would give relief from "double tion" to a certain class of property; (2) that it would make &gt;ssible for residents to invest savings in home mortgages; (3) that it would reduce the interest rate on real estate i.

We have no exact data bearing on the second argument for the law, but an investi - gation made by Representative I. H. Hatfield in 1913 showed that for Lancaster county the "home-ownership" of Nebraska mortgages had to all appearances very considerably increased. 1. Effect of Mortgage Exemption on the Interest Rate. This has been a matter of considerable dispute. We have secured from twelve of the counties, through the kindness of the registers of deeds, a record of all the real estate mortgages filed in those counties, except those of building and loan associations, during the year ending June 30, 1911, and the year next following. For this first year under the new law we asked to have the mort - gages listed separately according as they contained the "Tax- Clause" or did not. The returns cover almost four thousand mortgages. The results of the inquiry are presented in the table and the summary below. (The detailed tables by counties are </seg>

            <seg id="p088">84 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission The results will be more clearly seen in the following sum- I The tables show that in two counties the average rate on gages having the tax clause was the same during the first under the law as it was for the year ending June 30, 1911. hree counties it was higher; in the other seven the rate lower. For all counties the average rate was 6.22 per cent 111; on mortgages with the tax clause it was in 1912 5.96 per and on those without the tax clause 6.36 per cent. Com - lg all mortgages listed for the two years the average rate was he year ending June 30, 1911, 6.22 per cent, and for the first under the law 6.06 per cent. It is therefore not correct to say that the mortgage rate rose under this law, though in view of the general stiffening of the interest rate throughout the country in 1911 and 1912 a rise might well have occurred. Certainly there was no ground for expecting any considerable fall in the interest rate as a conse - quence of exempting mortgages. The rate on that class of paper had already been determined before the law went into force, on the assumption of practical exemption. The great mass of mortgage loans is owned by banks, trust and insurance com - panies, and are not directly taxable as such ; or they are made for export to jurisdictions where their ownership cannot be traced. Many cases could, of course, be found where individuals had been willing to lend at the going rate and yet pay the local taxes in order to have their security in sight; but the number of loans made under such circumstances must have been so few compared with those not intended for taxation as to have had little or no effect on the rate of interest. There should, therefore, have been no disappointment when it was found that as a rule the mortgagor assumed the tax and got but a slight reduction in the interest rate. The mortgagor has not been injured directly by the law Loans Interest Average Rate ear June 30, 1911 $4,117,942.71 $256,337.13 6.2. ear June 30, 1912: With tax clause 4,280,011.83 255,496.76 « Kithout tax clause 1,383,074.36 ital with and without 87,797.89 e.se tax clause 5,663,086.19 343,294.65 </seg>

Moreover, he does get his loan at a slightly lower rate, apparently on account of more local funds being available for real estate loans; and this in spite of a general advance in the interest rate. Still if the law was not passed for the purpose expressed in the title, or rather as a measure to relieve local owners from the necessity of concealing their property in order to escape double taxation, it would seem hardly to have been justified. 2. Effect on the Volume of Mortgages Listed. The effect of the law on the volume of mortgages returned for taxa - tion is seen in the following table: Assessed Value (One-fifth of Actual Value of Notes Secured by Mortgage on the Grand Assessment Roll Em shows a falling off of this item in the assessment of 60, or almost 60 per cent since 1911. The withdrawal amount from taxation involves of course an increase of )on those who hold other kinds of property. There is no knowing how much of this item is represented by mort - i land outside the state, owned by residents of the state. K Effect on the Banks. One result of the act seems to have quite unforeseen. We refer to the way the act has been ? to bear on the taxation of banks. I While the assessment for 1912 was in progress the question raised as to whether Nebraska mortgages held by banks ■ assessable to the banks. It was promptly ruled by the e Board of Equalization and Assessment that they were not; so far as they represented the investment of deposits they Id not be assessed to the banks since deposits were by L w ssed to the depositors; that so far as they represented in - ment of capital they should not be assessed, since their value already reflected in the value of the bank stock, the taxation hich was provided for by a section not repealed or in any way $4,501,21.", 1912 6,397,155 909 H.446,660 1913 4,769,780 910 7,249,134 1914 3,221,007 7,964,167 </seg>
            <seg id="p090">86 Some of the banks were not content with the view that they were not affected by the law. So far as known they did not return any mortgages without the tax-clause for separate assess - ment and taxation. But because of the generous provision of the section dealing with the assessment of banks, which allows them in determining the taxable value of their capital stock to deduct the value of their "real estate and other tangible property assessed separately," and the broad declaration in the act of 1911 that "a mortgage on real estate in this state is hereby declared to be an interest in real estate for purposes of assessment and taxation," the banks have established their right to deduct the value of their mortgages secured in this state from the value of their capital stock.

            <seg id="p092">Report of Nebraska Tax Commission 88 Conclusions and Recommendations. Three courses may be followed with respect to this law: 1. Repeal it Unconditionally. This was strongly urged in the 1913 session of the legislature. A bill for that purpose passed the House by a vote of 54 yeas to 37 nays, but failed in the Senate by a vote of 20 to 6. If this plan is followed it would make little if any difference in case the tax amendment is adopted and the legislature enacts an income tax law. All kinds of securi - ties would be exempt under such a plan. We can see no serious objection to repeal in case the legislature chooses the classified property tax as a means of dealing with intangibles. There is indeed good reason for treating domestic and foreign mortgages in the same way. But if the amendment fails we believe it would be a mistake, a backward step, to repeal the law. All the reasons for its enactment in 1911 still exist. Repeal would mean a check to the free investment of home capital in real estate mortgages and probably a slight advance in the interest rate. It would lead to the concealment of the ownership of about the only kind of intangibles a conscientious taxpayer can now afford to own. It would moreover give a sense of shiftiness in dealing with such matters that is wholly undesirable. While it would lead to an increase of "property" on the assessment rolls and thus reduce the rate on other classes, it would, as before the passage of the law, impose an unfair burden upon those owners of mortgages who will not or cannot take advantage of the numerous devices for escaping the tax. K2. Leave the Law as it Stands. This we do not approve ow interpreted it does not meet the reasonable expectation, ose responsible for its passage. This suggests as the proper se the third alternative. »3. Amend the Law so as to Conform to its Original Purpose. ng the measures introduced at the last session dealing this statute was a proposal to amend the law so as to for - the mortgagor to assume the tax on the mortgage inter - est. On the face of it this seems like a fair adjustment as be - tween the parties concerned. But it is a cumbersome method to follow. The mortgagee would have to swear off payments u they are made in order to reduce the base for his tax and </seg>
            <seg id="p093">89 corresponding additions would have to be made year by year to the mortgagor's interest. But of more consequence, such an amendment would not have the desired effect of making the owner of the mortgage pay the tax. The interest rate cannot be changed by an act of the legislature. There seems to be a feeling abroad that if the exemption of mortgages in 1911 did not greatly reduce the interest rate, the enforced requirement that the mortgagee shall pay the tax would not cause the rate to rise. The two conditions are quite different. We have considered the conditions which placed a limit upon the fall of interest rate in 1911. The effect of the proposed change can be foreseen. It is obvious that lenders who have a choice between placing their loans in a state where a tax must be paid and states where such tax is not required, will naturally choose the latter. The only condition on which foreign money would come in for in ment would be that of an interest rate enough higher than the normal return to pay the tax. A careful study of the operation of such a provision in California showed a few years ago that the lenders secured something above such a margin. Resident investors desiring to avoid taxation would buy foreign irrrt - gages, easily concealed, unless attracted to home mortgap a higher rate of interest. The few investors willing to loan only on security within sight would have but slight effect upon the rate. The conclusion seems inevitable that the tax would be shifted to the borrower and paid in a higher rate of interest. Our recommendation is simply for such amendrrents to the revenue law as will deprive the banks and other corporations taxed on the basis of their capital stock the privilege they now enjoy of deducting mortgages from the value of their shares. The provisions for deductions under Section 56 of the Revenue Act were already too generous before 1911. Banks are allowed to deduct the assessed value of all real estate or other tangible property owned by them and assessed separately. We believe this section should be amended so as to limit the deductions to the assessed value of the banking house, if owned, and the furni - ture and fixtures. This is the Wisconsin provision, except that there the banks are not allowed to deduct furniture and fixtures. In Xew York banks are taxed on the basis of capital, surplus and undivided profits, and no deduction is allowed for any real estate owned. The item of real estate other than banking house for the </seg>
            <seg id="p094">90 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission Nebraska state banks, October 21, 1913, was $352,434.21. The national banks of the state on the same date had "other real estate and mortgages owned" amounting to $795,464.48. How much of this was real estate we have no means of knowing. This amendment would effectually dispose of the claim of banks to deduct mortgages under the Smith Law on the ground that they are real estate within the meaning of that statute. </seg>
            <seg id="p095">The Railroads 91 CHAPTER VI THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS I. THE PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATIONS 1. The Railroads EThe railroad property of the state, next to real estate, con - tes the largest item in the grand assessment roll. The ive importance of this property since 1867 is shown in the i on p. . At present it represents 11.86 per cent of the total ation. The railroad property, except that situated outside the right - of-way, is assessed by the State Board of Equalization and Assess - ment and the valuation pro-rated to the counties and other civil divisions on the basis of "the number of miles of main track or line." The law has been construed to give the Board the right to classify the mileage of a system as " main line " and " brant and to ascribe different values per mile of road accordingly. Thus in 1912 the main line of the Burlington from Plattsmouth to the Colorado state line was valued at $80,000 per mile (assessed at $16,000 per mile); the main line from Rulo to Oxford was valued at $52,500 per mile; while the branch from South Sioux City to O'Neill at $25,000; the high line from Holdrege via Curtis to the state line at $35,000. The main line of the Union Pacific was valued at $107,500 per mile for the whole distance across the state and most of its branches at $46,000, and so on. It will be seen that this method of apportioning the value of the railroads is highly advantageous to those counties which have relatively little terminal property, such as station grounds and switch yards, and where land values are low, since the values cf terminal property and the right-of-way through high priced lands are spread out to the less favored parts of the state. t Terminal Assessments. — This situation was recognized in ,ct of 1907 providing for "Terminal Taxation" so-called, act provides for a separate assessment of the railway property in the corporate limits of cities and villages, upon which ase municipal taxes only. The local assessors are required </seg>

Compared with the railroad taxes paid in neighboring states those in Nebraska appear to be adequate. They exceed those of Iowa throughout the period. This does not imply that they are too high here, for there has been much complaint that in Iowa railroad property does not bear its just share of the tax burden. During the early part of the period covered by the table Nebraska roads were taxed considerably below those in Kansas but since 1909 the conditions have been reversed. The taxes for all the roads of the United States for the fiscal year 1911 were $442 per mile. In that year the roads of the state paid $360. Another way of comparing the yield of these taxes is to reduce them to a gross earnings basis. We give in the tables below, for the fiscal years 1912 and 1913, and for the calendar year 1913, the gross earnings in Nebraska, taxes paid, the percentage these taxes were of the gross earnings; and for comparative purposes what the taxes would be at 4 per cent and at 5 per cent for the seven largest railroads in the state: Table I Railroad Taxes in Nebraska for the Year Ending June 30, 1912 i iii Gross Taxes Taxes Taxes Earnings Paid Year Percent, on Gross Earnings e of Road in June 30, of Gross ' Nebraska 1912 Earnings At At In Pacific $17,554,540J $695,215 3.96 $702,182 %&gt; t. &amp; Q 20,892,008 962,920 4.61 «35,680 1,044,600 N.

            <seg id="p099">Railroad and Real Estate Taxes Compared 95 Nebraska are slightly above the average for the country as a whole when reduced to the basis of earnings. Does Railroad Property Bear a "Fair Share" of the Tax Burden? — The answer to this question will depend on one's view of what constitutes a " fair share." If by it is meant a share proportionate to the burden borne by other classes of property, we believe it does. Comparison can be best made for 1911, the latest year for which we have the valuation made by the engineer - ing department of the State Railway Commission. The engineers found the present value of the seven large roads of the state to be $273,683,779. The State Board found the actual value of these roads on May 3 of that year to be $272,522,072. But this in - cluded the "franchise" or intangible value as well as the value of the physical property. The Board in making the assessment for terminal taxation is required to find the value of "intangible property and rolling stock for each road. These two items for the seven roads amounted to $130,322,550. The rolling stock as valued by the engineering department for that year amounted to $26,599,487, leaving as the value of intangible property $103,723,063. The true value can thus be found by adding the value of the physical property as found by the engineers and the intangible property as found by the Board. This gives a true value of $377,406,842. The Board therefore assessed the rail - roads at 72 per cent of the true value thus computed. We have no means of comparing this with the assessment of all kin&lt; property; but accepting the estimates of the true value of lands made by Mr. Reed of the Railway Commission for 1913 it seems that this important class of property was assessed on the average at 73 per cent of its true value (p.64). It appears, therefore, that the railroads are being: assessed at a percentage of their true value very close to that of the lands of the state. I Another comparison can be made. It is sometimes pointed ;hat a large part of the property of railroads lies in the open try where the tax rates are low and Ihus they are taxed v the average rate. Without passing judgment on this ie of reasoning the following facts ma&gt; be adduced: The age rate of ad valorem taxes as found by the State Board in was 47.25 mills. If this rate had been api ied to the assessed ation of the seven large companies ($55,450,780) it would produced $2,620,049 in taxes. The taxes paid by these </seg>
            <seg id="p100">96 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission 11 companies, exclusive of occupation taxes, and taxes on lo - assessed property amounted to $2,530,011. It will thus be that the railroads pay very nearly the average rate of taxes valuation which is probably as near the true value as that of eneral property of t^e state. The Test of Profits. — Another method cf comparing the railroad taxes with those on other property is to reduce such taxes to an income basis. The data for such a comparison can be obtained for the railroads and other public service corporations, but for the most important industry in the state and the one with which comparison is most desirable— the agricultural in - dustry, only fragmentary information is available. It appears very probable, however, that if the facts could be learned they would show that a larger part of the net revenue from the agricul - tural industry is taken for taxes than is taken from the net earn - ings of the railroad industry as a whole. From the nature of the two industries this might normally be expected, for on the whole investments in real estate are looked upon as among the safest of investments, while railroad investments have long been regarded as more precarious especially for the small investor. Under such conditions a lower rate of return for land owners, and it may also be said for the operation of land, would normally be expected. No adequate means, however, are at present available for such a comparison. Distribution of the Railroad Taxes. — The most pressing problem in connection with the taxation of railroads relates to their distribution. The present plan is based on the generally accepted rule that tangible property both real and personal is taxable at its situs. The value of the railroads is localized in the taxing districts through which they run, just as the value of real estate, factories, or stocks of goods are localized. Now this method applied to railway property gives some peculiar results. In the first place the railroads are assessed on the "unit" plan, i. e. the value of the whole property is found, the share of this within the state for purposes of taxation determined, this share again pro-rated to the different taxing districts according to mileage of main track. Thus the Cheyenne county part of the main line of the Union Pacific is given the same value per mile as that lying in Douglas county. The Railway Commission's engineers found the "present value" of the Union Pacific Railway </seg>
            <seg id="p101">97 Ptructures thereon to be $657,128 per mile for the eastern n of the road extending from Omaha to Lane Junction; Grand Island to Columbus Junction, $121,864, and for the rn section from Julesburg to the Wyoming line $34,466 per If the only result of the present plan was to give a dispro - portionate value to the less developed counties of the state com - paratively little complaint would be heard. But all the railroad values are absorbed for purposes of taxation by the local govern - ments through which they run. The school districts are chiefly affected by this plan. The outlying districts receive no railroad taxes and the burden of maintaining the schools is a heavy one. This is especially true of districts in counties where the value of real estate is low. Often districts having no railroad mileage may have to levy 30 or 35 mills for schools while neighboring districts otherwise similar have to levy but 5 or 6 mills. How to deal with the situation which has thus grown up is a difficult problem. Two principal methods of dealing with it have been 1. Turn all the railroad taxes into the general fund of the state treasury thus relieving general property from state taxes in great part. 2. Let the state collect all the railroad taxes and apportion them to the school districts in proportion to school population. These methods are further discussed in the chapter on Separation of Sources of Revenue. 2. SLEEPING CAR COMPANIES History and Present Method of Taxation. — Until 1889 no provision was made for taxing these companies. An act of that year provided for the assessment of sleeping cars not owned by the railway companies by the State Board of Equalization. Information for making an assessment was furnished by the railway companies. They were required to report the number of cars used over their lines, the total number of miles run by such cars and the number of miles run within the state. The Board found the value of the average number of cars used, and took for the value in this state such a proportion thereof as the mileage run in the state bore to the total mileage run. 4 </seg>
            <seg id="p102">98 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission This rule remained in force till 1903 when the present law was enacted. The sleeping car companies now report directly to the ri. The rule for apportioning value to the state is changed a "miles run" basis to the "miles of main track" basis, present rule is as follows: "The State Board shall assess that portion of such total value which the number of miles of railroad main track over which such cars shall run were used within this state bears to the total number of miles of railroad main track over which such cars were used everywhere. Such assessment shall be included in the records and proceedings of the Board, and shall be pro-rated among the several counties traversed by railway having said cars and shall be apportioned by the county clerk" in the same way railroad taxes are appor - tioned. In addition to the property tax thus provided for sleep - ing car companies they are subject to the occupation tax on cor- porations. Operation of the Law. — The assessed (one-fifth of the actual) valuation of this class of property since 1900 is shown in the following table : The Pullman Company which controls the whole of this Kof business in the state paid property taxes for the year amounting to $5,260. These taxes were paid in sixty-five ties in amounts ranging from $12.57 in Washington county f 253.07 in Douglas. In forty-six counties the tax was less $100. In addition to the property taxes this company paid an "annual fee" of $250 under the corporation occupation tax law. We have no satisfactory way of determining whether these Eents constitute a fair tax or not. Wisconsin with about uarter more miles of railroad than Nebraska makes an ment of this company about double that of Nebraska and 900 $26,559 1907 ! 901 23,517 1908 902 Not separated from R. R.

            <seg id="p103">Criticism and Recommendations 99 collects nearly twice as large a tax. Minnesota with one-third more miles of railroad collects twice as large a tax. In both these states at least one important road operates its own sleeping and dining car service which is assessed with railroad property. Kansas with 50 per cent more railroad than Nebraska has col - lected an average of $20,000 for the past three years from the Pullman Company, that is a sum about four times as great as the property tax collected in this state. Criticism and Recommendations. While the com- parative figures given above are by no means conclusive in all respects they give strong indications that the present method of assessment does not secure to the state a proper share of the company's property for purposes of taxation. The method itself is faulty. In the first place because it attempts only to determine the state's share of the value of cars used in the state, thus ignor - ing entirely the intangible or franchise value attaching to the use of such property. Secondly, the method of determining the state's share of the value of the cars is arbitrary and has no direct relation to the amount of business done in the state or the earnings therefrom. If the company is to be taxed on the ad valorem basis the law should be so amended as to give the assessing board information as to capital, earnings, property and car operations such as will enable it to assess the intangible as well as the tang - ible property employed in the state. The Kansas law requires the return of a schedule containing twenty-five or more items. The rule for determining the state's share of the company's prop - erty should also be changed to a mileage basis. We believe the Kansas rule in this matter is more equitable than the present I The distribution of the tax should be changed. Every con - ration as to the nature of the property, character of the mess, and ease of administration, irarks this as a natural ■ce of state revenue. The tax is in no sense a local one. It ure fancy to localize Pullman cars in the counties through ch they run, sometimes without ever making a stop. We ■efore recommend that the proceeds of the tax be turned into general fund of the state treasury. This should be done even jgh the ad valorem method be retained; the reasons for cing it a state tax will be more imperative if the basis is changed n value to gross earnings. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">100 The Gross Earnings Tax. — In case the pending tax amendment is adopted we recommend the taxation of this kind of business on the basis of gross earnings. This form of taxation commends itself for all public service corporations and particu - larly for car companies the valuation of which presents some pecu - liar difficulties. The judgment of the assessor need not be relied upon under this plan for the gross earnings of such corporations are already a matter of public information. The tax adjusts itself to shifting conditions of business. When the volume of business is large the tax increases, and when business declines the tax is automatically reduced. It is simple, certain, fair to the public and to the companies, and easy to administer. About a score of states use this method of taxing car companies. Six of them impose a gross earnings tax in lieu of all other property taxes. The rates vary considerably, on different classes of companies. The California rate on intra-state and the state's share of inter - state earnings of sleeping car companies is per cent; the Connecticut Commission of 1913 recommended a 3f per cent rate for that state; the Rhode Island rate is 1 per cent; Min - nesota charges 5 per cent; the Arizona rate on intra-state earn - ings only, is 7 per cent. All circumstances considered we think a 5 per cent tax on the gross earnings of the Pullman Company would subject it to a tax burden equivalent to that borne by the general property of the state. This is a higher tax than the company now pays taking the country as a whole. In 1912 its gross earnings amounted to $40,103,216, its taxes to $962,371, making the equiv - alent gross earnings tax 2.4 per cent. Just what the effect of a 5 per cent tax would have on the revenues we have not computed because of lack of information. It is safe to assume, however, that it would add to the state's revenues. I Other Car Companies. — For the reasons set forth above ecommend placing other car companies on a gross earnings i in case the amendment carries. The legislature at its last on wisely turned the taxes from this source into the state iury. But these companies are still subject to ad valorem s; and all the difficulties encountered in determining the true e of the property of the sleeping car companies is encount - in the valuation of car companies engaged in carrying :handise. </seg>
            <seg id="p105">101 I Summary. The present method of assessing car companies mbersome and uncertain, and it fails to reach the intangible ss connected with such a business. If the constitution is ided so as to remove all doubt concerning the right to impose [ on gross earnings we recommend that method of taxing all companies. The tax should be based upon all intra-state ings and Nebraska's share of the inter-state earnings. For lese private car companies we recommend a rate of 5 per cent, sroceeds of the tax to be paid into the general fund of the ■ treasury. 3. The Express Companies I The Present Method. — The express, telegraph and tele - tie companies are taxed under the same sections of the revenue and by the same method. Each company is required to make a rn to the county assessor of its personal property "and of gross receipts of its business in said local assessing district the year ending April 1." •••••• "Such gross ipts to be taken and considered as an item of property and o listed and levied against the same as other property. Such s receipts shall represent the franchise valuation which shall be otherwise assessed." While the statute remains in its essential features as enacted in 1903, the court has modified it by interpretation in several important respects. It was early held that the receipts from inter-state business were not subject to taxation by the state. State r. Fleming, 70 Neb. 523. In Western Union Telegraph v. Omaha, 73 Neb. 527, 545, 1905, the court while upholding the right of the state to tax the "franchise" of corporations engaged in business within its borders, held that the tax must be by val - uation and that the amount of gross receipts of express, telephone and telegraph companies during the year prior to the time of assessment, taken alone, is not a reasonable and just method of ascertaining the value of the franchise possessed by such cor - porations; that it fixes an arbitrary rule, not founded upon justice nor upon any definite relation between receipts and value and is in violation of the rule laid down by the first subdivision of Section 1, Article IX of the constitution. The law as it stands, however, still requires a return of gross receipts to be treated as an "item of property." To what extent this is done the returns </seg>
            <seg id="p106">102 do not accurately show. The law, however, seems quite gen - erally to be complied with. As far as the facts are ascertainable they are as follows: In 1911, the Railway Commission found the "present value" of the property of express companies to be $150,007 and the "reproduction value" $206,806. The assessed valuation in 1913, the first year the express company valuation is given as a separate item, was $206,954, making an actual value of $1,034,770. This seems to indicate that the companies report earnings for local taxation amounting to more than $800,000, a sum not far short of their actual intra-state earnings. In 1913 the three large companies paid local property taxes amounting to $15,082.32. Local Occupation Taxes. — Under the law permitting munic- ipalities to impose taxes on the right to conduct various businesses, § cities impose occupation taxes on the express companies, times such taxes are laid in proportion to earnings, but often in the form of a flat rate ranging from $5 to $60. The local taxes paid by the three large companies in 1913 are shown in the following table: Taxes on Number of Property Including Local Townslmposing Name Earnings as Property OccupationTaxesOccupationTax $15,082.32 $2,652.50 I The Two Per Cent Tax of 1913.~The legislature of 1913 ided for an additional tax on each express company "for the lege of exercising its corporate franchise or carrying on its less in such corporate or organized capacity in this state." tax is payable on or before November 1 each year at the of 2 per cent upon its gross earnings from intra-state business, irently for the year ending June 30, preceding. It seems the "gross earnings" were not intended to cover receipts r than those from transportation and no provision is made for hing the state's share of inter-state earnings. I The question has been raised whether this tax was payable the year ending June 30, 1913. In fact the validity of the in its present form has been questioned.

The amount which would have been paid under the 2 per cent state occupation tax had it been collected $19,447.53 Total tax as now provided by law $37,182.35 Conclusions and Recommendations: 1. THE LOCAL Occupation Taxes. — While the right to grant power to the municipalities to impose occupation taxes on the express com - panies is firmly established and the practice quite general we believe the policy is a wrong one and should be abandoned. The express business is not one like the sale of liquor, plumbing and the like requiring regulation and therefore suitable for the imposi - tion of a license tax. If one is imposed it must be for other than regulatory reasons. The business is in no sense a local one. By its very nature it would seem unsuited for local taxation. Every transaction involves parties in more or less widely separated parts of the state. The service giving rise to its incorre is not localized, nor is the property by means of which the service is performed.

            <seg id="p108">104 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission The same economic grounds for denying the people of any state the right to regulate inter-state commerce exists for denying the right of any municipality to impose occupation taxes upon such a business as that of the express companies.

The Gross Earnings Return on the Schedule. — much the same reasons we recommend the amendment of ion 6368, R. S. 1913 so as to relieve the express companies i returning their earnings to be taxed at the local property rate, thus leaving only the tangible property to be entered he schedule. There is a further reason for this recommenda - , namely that the present requirement is not one that can be tively enforced. The confusion and uncertainty in which decisions of the supreme court have left this part of the law ires that it should be swept away by repealing the provision liring earnings to be treated as property. 3. The State Gross Earnings Tax. The act of 1913 im - posing a tax of 2 per cent on the gross earnings of these companies was a step in the right direction but it should be amended to meet certain deficiencies in it. The inadequacy of the value of property as a basis for taxing the express business has long been recognized, and there has been an agreement among students of taxation that gross earnings constitute the most practicable basis for taxing it. The second clause of Section 1, Article IX of the constitution specifically names this interest among others as one which may be taxed in any way the legislature may direct in addition to the tax by valuation provided for in the first clause of that section. There need, therefore, be no resort to the "occupation tax" idea for authority to tax express companies on the basis of their earnings. As pointed out above such a tax both because of its economic character and because of the greater ease and certainty of admin - istration under state authority, seems peculiarly fitted to be a source of state revenue. KThe present law makes no provision apparently for taxing pts from any other source than transportation. There is no reason why the receipts from the sale of money orders </seg>
            <seg id="p109">The Telegraph Companies 105 Kd not be included. This is done under the Minnesota law, ax being paid in this case on all receipts from such orders dless of the place of payment. I Another change should be made in the definition of gross ings. At present they include only those from business nating and terminating within the state. The state is en - i to a tax on all business originating, terminating or passing ugh the state in the proportion that the haul within the I is part of the whole distance traversed. This right is fully ilished by the courts and is made use of in several of the b. We have no accurate information as to what addition d be made to the base for the tax in this state if this item included, and can therefore make no accurate estimate of nue to be expected from this change. The present rate is not far from right assuming the local taxation of gross earnings as an item of property at the property tax rate. This rate would fall not far short of the equivalent of a 2 per cent tax. If the local gross earnings tax were repealed, as we recommend, the present state rate could be doubled without creating a greater burden than the law now imposes, and this we recommend. To summarize: We recommend the amendment of the state gross earnings law so as to place a tax of 4 per cent upon the gross receipts of express companies, such receipts to include a share of the earnings from interstate business pro-rated on the mileage basis, and also the receipts from money orders sold re - regardless of their place of payment, these taxes to be in lieu of all other taxes except those on the real and personal property of the companies to be paid at its situs. To carry out this plan we recommend further the repeal of all laws giving the right to municipalities to levy occupation taxes on express companies. The results of such legislation will be to rid the present statute of ambiguities and inconsistencies, to simplify the method of taxing these interests, to turn what is peculiarly a state source of revenue into its proper channels, and to increase the revenue from this source. 4. The Telegraph Companies These companies and the telephone companies are taxed under the same provisions of law as the express companies. The county assessors value the physical properties and presumably </seg>
            <seg id="p110">106 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission the "franchise," and the law still requires the companies to return their gross earnings to be treated as "an item of property." The municipalities may impose occupation taxes. The telegraph companies apparently do not make as full a return of their earn - ings to the assessors as the express' companies do. The assessed value, actual value for 1913 and the Railway Commission's re - production value and "present value" of the physical properties for 1912 are shown in the table which follows: RAILWAY COMMISSION'S Assessed "Actual Valuation ' Value" Reproduction Present 1913 1913 Value, 1912 Value, 1912 Express companies . . Telegraph companies Telephone companies Total The figures indicate that no very large return of earnings is made for taxation and in fact that the assessors do not find the full value of the physical property to say nothing of the "franchise" value. The Commission's reproduction value of the Western Union's property for 1912 was $1,337,604; the return of the company to the secretary of state for the assessment of the annual fee in 1914 was, "not to exceed $1,500,000" as the value of its physical property employed in this state. These values are carried on the books as representing earnings power and give an indication of what the assessors ought to place on the tax rolls. It would be strange if anything like an accurate assess - ment were made. The same reasons exist for assessing the tele - graph companies on the unit plan that make it necessary to assess railroads on that plan. The great majority of the states which levy ad valorem taxes on the telegraph companies provide for their valuation by some central authority. Moreover, the nature of the business is such as to mark the taxes arising from it as a proper source of state rather than local revenue.

            <seg id="p111">The Telegraph Companies 107 "Telegraph companies are taxed in very different ways by the various states, most of which combine one or more methods of taxation. The gross earnings tax, taxes upon the value of stocks and bonds, and ad valorem taxes are all in common use. The following is a brief summary of the principal methods used. A more detailed description of the method of each state will be found in Appendix II. Fourteen states impose taxes upon the gross earnings of telegraph companies. In only one of these, California, is it the sole tax; there it is at the rate of 3| per cent upon earnings within the state and a share of interstate earnings. (Four states have this as the principal tax, although used in ection with other methods of taxation. Maine taxes gross ings lj to 6 per cent according to the amount of earnings. Jersey also combines an ad valorem tax upon tangible erty with a gross earnings tax, the latter being at the rate of ' cent. In Rhode Island, telegraph companies pay 2 per cent i grcss earnings and are taxed upon real estate under the ral property tax. Texas has a gross earnings tax of 2\ per , license taxes, and local taxes upon property. New Jer&gt; is upon earnings within the state and a share of interstate ings. The other states tax state earnings only. Eight other states have the gross earnings tax together with valorem taxes upon all or part of the property of the companies. Vermont allows a 3 per cent tax upon gross earnings ( collect - i within the state) as an alternative to special license taxes pon wire mileage. k Besides the gross earnings tax, the principal methods of tax - elegraph companies is by means of ad valorem taxes on their erty. Sixteen states tax all the property of the companies impose no other taxes. Fourteen states use the ad valorem is the principal tax combined with other methods, and eleven r states make use of property taxes through using some r tax as the principal one. In eight states the principal tax on telegraph companies is based on the valuation of stock and bonds or stock only, though in all cases combined with some other form of taxation. Only two states base their system of taxing telegraph com - panies on an arbitrary basis as in the Connecticut system. Del - aware has a tax on wire mileage at rates of 60 cents, 30 cents, and 20 cents, upon the longest wire, the second longest wire, and other wires, respectively. Vermont allows the companies to choose between a gross earnings tax of 3 per cent (on earnings collected within the state) and a license tax of 60 cents per mile for the first wire and 40 cents for each additional wire. A number of other states use special, privilege, and license taxes as sup - plementary to other taxes which are the main bases of their </seg>
            <seg id="p112">108 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission Recommendations. — In case the legislature is given the power to do so by the adoption of the amendment, we recom - mend a tax of 4 per cent upon the gross earnings of the telegraph companies including the earnings from intra-state business and a proportion based upon mileage of the receipts from business passing through, into or out of the state, and that this tax shall be in lieu of all other taxes except those on real estate owned, the proceeds to be turned into the general fund of the state treasury. If the present constitutional provisions are retained, we recommend that the property of the telegraph companies be •Messed by the proposed tax commission, and in case no com - mission is created by the State Board of Equalization and Assess - ment, that the property be taxed at the average rate for the state, and that the taxes be paid into the state treasury. We believe by this method of assessment the "franchise value" of the companies can be reached. If, however, the ad valorem taxes be found inadequate for this interest, the way lies open through the second clause of Section 1, Article IX, to impose a business tax based on earnings. All local taxes based on earn - ings, and all municipal occupation taxes should be abolished. 5. The Telephone Companies There are reasons, because of the essentially local character of the telephone business, why this interest may properly be left subject to local taxation. But the method of assessment should be changed. We recommend that in case the ad valorem system is retained that the assessment of this class of property be made along with all other public service property by the proposed tax commission. If all the companies were purely commercial ones there would be good reason for placing them on a gross earnings basis along with the telegraph companies. An effective assessment that will reach the "franchise" or "corporate excess' seems a fairly satisfactory method, however, of dealing with both commercial and mutual companies and we recommend the retention of the ad valorem method. All special local taxes should be abolished in the case of these companies as in the case of express and telegraph companies.

            <seg id="p113">The Telephone Companies 109 "Some light on the problem of taxation of telephone com - panies may be obtained from the experience of other st The value of such comparison, however, is decidedly limited by the great diversity of methods employed and the almost complete lack of uniformity in the systems of the several states. In Ap - pendix II of this Report will be found an abstract of the methods employed in the taxation of telephone companies by each of the states in the United States. In the present chapter we shall attempt to give only a very brief summary of the principal methods employed by other states. I Apart from the old-fashioned tax on the property of the shone companies, which still prevails in many of the states, most common method of taxation is the gross earnings tax. iteen states make use of the tax on gross receipts to a greater ■ss extent. In four states it is the only tax imposed upon the ative property of telephone companies. These with rates imposed are as follows: I California, 31 ; Maine, 1] to 6' , , according to the amount of ■arnings (from business wholly within the state), Minnesota, Wisconsin, 21 to 5',, according to the amount of the earn- Except in Maine, the tax is upon earnings from state busi - and a proportionate share of interstate earnings. Four other states use the gross earnings tax (limited to bus - iness wholly within the state), as the principal tax, although accompanied by other forms of taxation. Rhode Island taxes gross earnings at the rate of 2% , in addition to local taxes on real estate. The District of Columbia imposes a gross earnings tax of 4 r , , together with a district ad valorem tax on realty. Mary - land imposes a 2 r &lt; gross earnings tax, a tax on capital stock and a tax on real estate. New Jersey taxes gross earnings, at but allows also local ad valorem taxes on tangible property. I Nine states accompany the gross earnings tax with an ad -em tax on all or part of the property of the companies, nont allows telephone companies to choose either a gross ings tax (on earnings collected within the state), at the rate per cent, or a tax of cents on each transmitter and 30 &gt; on each mile of wire. KOnly two other states use methods similar to that of Con - icut; i. e., select some arbitrary basis for the imposition of ax. Delaware uses a combination of the tax on transmitters the wire mileage tax. The second state is Vermont •ibed above. Besides these methods the three principal systems in force in other states ara: (1 ) taxes based on the value of the stocks and bonds, (2) ad valorem taxes on the property of the companies, and (3) license taxes, privilege taxes and various other special </seg>
            <seg id="p114">110 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission II. THE BANKS The banks are not taxed as such. The shares, however, are assessed to the owners, and the tax collected by the bank. This arrangement is made necessary by the restrictions placed by Congress on the taxation of national banks, which are regarded as creatures and agents of the federal government. A variety of methods may be followed in making the assessment and in the distribution of the tax. The Nebraska statute requires the county assessor to "determine and settle the true value" of the shares, and in doing so "shall take into consideration the market value of such stock, if any, and the surplus and undivided profits." The value of real estate and tangible personalty is deducted from the aggregate value of the shares, and the remainder divided by the number of shares to find the value of each. The law seems to require amendment in two important respects: First, in regard to administration ; and second, in regard to deductions of mortgages now permitted under the mortgage Bl. The most common method of assessing bank stock is st it at its "book value", i. e. the sum found by adding ther the capital, the surplus and the undivided profits. This sum represents the amount put into the enterprise by the shareholders but not necessarily the "true value." The value of a thing is what it will exchange for in the ordi - nary course of trade. But bank stock does not change hands frequently and its value must be determined by its earn - ing power. This cannot usually be done by the local assessor. He can of course determine the "book value"; but to find the true value which the constitution and the law requires to be assessed, he has neitller the skill nor the informa - tion. This information is properly enough given to the proper state authority but perhaps should not be placed in the hands of the local assessor. The proper course seems clear: To place the assessment of this class of property in the hands of a central officer. We, therefore, recommend that the assessment of bank shares be placed in the hands of the proposed state tax com - mission. In case no commission is provided for by the legisla - ture, we recommend that the assessment of these shares be made by the State Board of Equalization. The result of such an ar* </seg>
            <seg id="p115">Taxation of Insurant 111 rangement will be an increase in the taxes from this source and a more uniform apportionment of them as between banks. 12. Deduction of Mortgages. The mortgage tax law of was not intended to affect the method of taxing banks, supreme court has held, however, that after arriving at the i of the shares, the mortgages owned by the banks, secured on aska real estate, whether they contain the tax clause or not, be deducted in the same way that the value of real estate ducted. We have discussed the effect of this interpretation e law in the section dealing with the mortgage tax law. Our recommendation is, for the reasons set forth elsewhere (p. 89), that Section 6343 R. S. 1913 be so amended as to restrict the privilege of deductions, to real estate used for a banking-house and to furniture and fixtures. III. THE TAXATION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES The taxation of insurance companies, owing to the great variety in the character of organization, kind of policies written, nature of assets, and the widely scattered ownership of the same, offers some peculiar difficulties that have nowhere been com - pletely overcome and in Nebraska are very far from having been met. The most fundamental question in connection with these interests is whether they ought to be taxed at all. It is earnestly contended by many that on account of the beneficent social service they perform, insurance companies should be freed from taxes as churches and charitable institutions are, though for a somewhat different reason. Frugality and thrift, it is said, are the founda - tions of industrial development, and a tax upon the savings put into insurance is a tax upon those qualities and tends to check their exercise. This no doubt is true; but it is equally true of savings and accumulations in any form. It is not peculiarly virtuous, as is sometimes argued, for a man to make provision for the future in this particular way. Savings of all kinds that serve to provide against want and make an enlargement of industry possible are beneficent, and it does not appear that life insurance is so different in these respects as to warrant relieving such in - terests from taxation. As long as taxes are based upon posses - sions we see no good reason why investments in insurance shouk receive any special consideration. The argument, however, that the assets of insurance com- </seg>
            <seg id="p116">112 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission panies, consisting largely of securities, the mere evidences of wealth reached in a direct way by the taxing officer, is another matter, and is worthy of careful consideration. What has been said elsewhere (p. 46) concerning the double taxation involved in assessing wealth and also the obligations secured by it, or the evidences of ownership of it applies here. But if these forms of property are to be exempted it should be not because they are held by insurance companies, but because of their character. If such property is to be taxed at a lower rate than other kinds of property the low rate should of course apply to the securities of insurance companies as well as to those of individuals. While some European countries have pursued the policy of encourag - ing insurance by exempting such interest from taxation, the various states have all subjected them to some form of taxation. The method varies greatly in the different states, and even within the same state. The Present Method in Nebraska. —Article VI of the revenue law (Chapter 69 R. S. 1913) provides that all insurance companies doing business in the state, except certain specified classes, shall pay a premium tax in some form. No specific provision is made in this article or elsewhere in the law for ad valorem taxes on such companies. But under the constitutional requirement that all persons and corporations shall be taxed in proportion to the value of their property, the courts have held that insurance companies of whatever kind are subject to the general property tax. The premium tax, in spite of the curious wording of the law, is a business tax authorized by the constitu - tion (Art. IX, Sec. 1, Clause 2) in addition to the ad valorem tax imposed on all property except that specifically exempted. "Fraternal beneficiary associations and such mutual companies as operate on the assessment plan, have no capital stock and make no dividends, and whose scheme of insurance does not con - template the return of any percentage of earnings or profits to policy holders," do not come under the provisions of this article. All others must pay some form of premium tax. Foreign Life and Accident Companies KEach foreign life and accident company is required to pay the state treasury at the time of making its annual report le insurance board a tax at the rate of 2 per cent upon the </seg>
            <seg id="p117">Foreign Accident, Liability m 113 Imnt of gross premiums received by it during the j net-ding dar year for business done in this state, including all in - ice upon the lives of persons residing in the state, whether insurance was written during such preceding year &lt;;r j rior to." In addition to these taxes life companies are required b the following fees: For admission $50.00 For filing annual statement 20.00 For certificate of authority 2.00 For each agent's license 2.00 For copy of papers filed Indefinite For examinations when needed Indefinite These fees, however, and the gross \ remiums tax ir;. regarded merely as minimum charges; for under the so-called reciprocal or retaliation section of the insurance code both the tax and the fees may vary for any particular company ice ing to the charges which would be imposed upon Nebraska panies doing business in the state which chartered the company in question. Thus Ohio has a 2\ per cent tax on foreign cont - panies; and our rate for Ohio companies is therefore '1\ \ er cent. For the same reason an Indiana company would pay 3 per cent on its gross receipts in this state and if an Oklahoma company should apply for admission it would be required to pay a fee of $200 instead of the $50.00 provided in our law. All insurance companies paying the fees and making reports to the insurance department are exempt from the corporation occupation provided by Chapter 240 of the Laws of 1913. Foreign Accident, Liability and Surety Companies are taxed at the same rate on their premium receipts as the life panies pay. The taxes paid into the state treasury for the . 1909-1913 have been as follows: Accident, Liability Legal Reserve J Lit fe Surety, Etc. $7,659.30 10,891.32 1 OiHI $58,660.48 $61,001.18 61,481.22 65,772.20 10,240.38 76,012.58 70,918.40 10,839.77 15,285.50 81,758.17 79,139.65 </seg>
            <seg id="p118">114 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission Foreign Fire Companies. — These companies pay taxes on their tangible property at its situs. They are also taxed locally on their premium receipts though such receipts are treated as "an item of property." The law of 1903 required a return of premium receipts to the local assessor by each agent and made him personally liable for the tax. It was apparently the purpose of the law to base this tax on "gross premiums," permitting no deductions for reinsurance and premiums returned on canceled insurance. Since these deductions were authorized in the case of domestic companies, the supreme court has held they must also be allowed for foreign companies. The section, however, has remained on the statute book unchanged. Under the reciprocal provisions of the insurance law foreign fire companies may be required to pay additional taxes into the state treasury. In 1912, $12,460 were collected in this manner and in 1913 $10,448.27. On the other hand, as the law is now ad - ministered receipts for sums paid by these companies for local taxes are accepted as credits against taxes imposed by the In - surance Board under the reciprocal section. Domestic Insurance Companies I All Nebraska life, fire, accident and surety companies, pt fraternal and mutual assessment companies, are grouped Lher under the present law for purposes of taxation. They ill subject to a tax on any real estate or personal property, er Section 6357 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 (Sec. 69, Ch. they are also required to pay a tax into the local treasury d on premium receipts. Each company is taxed "in the county, town, city, village and school district where the agent conducts business upon the gross amount of premiums received by it for all Nebraska business done within the state during the preceding calendar year less amount of same ceded to other companies as reinsurance through regularly authorized agents in this state and less premiums returned on canceled policies. Such gross receipts less reinsurance and cancellations shall be taken as an item of property of that value and be assessed and taxed on the same percentage as other property. The agent shall render the list and be personally liable for the tax." It will be convenient to deal with each of these companies </seg>
            <seg id="p119">115 The Fire Companies. In addition to the tax provided for in Article 6, Chapter 69, as described above, every fire in - surance company doing business in the state except Farmers' Mutuals is required to pay into the state treasury annually a tax of three-eighths of one per cent on the gross premium fire receipts, after deducting cancellations and reinsurances on N'ebraska busi - ness for the maintenance of the department of State Fire &lt; missioner. (Sec. 2510 R. S. 1913). Duringthebienniumending Nov - ember 30, 1914, this tax yielded $25,295. A further tax, not toexceed $5.00 per year may be imposed in municipalities having less than 25,000 population, for the use of volunteer fire department ganized under the state law. These special taxes are for q i purposes in which the companies themselves have direct inl - and partake more of the character of an annual assessment than a tax. Since they operate uniformly upon all companies they require no particular comment from this Commission. The sections providing for the tax on premium receipts have some objectionable feature?. We recommend that the sections be amended so as to conform to the findings of the courts with respect to the equal treatment of home and foreign companies in the matter of deductions. As a matter of practice the return of premium receipts is not made by each agent but by the home company. Frequently no return is made at all, and when made it is often nominal. It would contribute to simplicity of admin - istration and ensure greater certainty and equality of treatment if these sections were administered through the Insurance Board and the proceeds turned into the state treasury as in the case of foreign life companies. In 1913 the net premiums of stock fire companies amounted to $4,409,963. A 2 per cent tax would yield $88,199.26. But we have no means of computing accurately the financial results of the change since we do not know the amount of taxes paid by these companies. Assuming a full return whether administered locally or centrally, a tax of 2 per cent would be the equivalent of a one hundred mill levy on a one-fifth valuation. The municipalities where the bulk of the premium income arises have levies that approximate and in some cases exceed 100 mills. It is probable that the average property tax rate is somewhat below 2 per cent on the true value and that assuming a full return there would be a slight loss of revenue. But it is quite certain that a fuller return would be secured through the Insurance Board than is now made, resulting in a </seg>
            <seg id="p120">Report of Nebraska Tax Commission 116 E;rable addition to the public revenue. This, however, not be the greatest gain arising from the change. Equality tment would be more nearly attained and this is of more ance than an increase of revenue. The Domestic Life Companies. There are ten of this class of companies. They are taxed upon a somewhat different basis from foreign companies doing business in the state. The latter pay a tax of 2 per cent on the premium receipts from policies held by residents of the state, "whether such insurance was written during such preceding year or prior thereto." The absence of the clause just quoted from the section dealing with domestic companies has given rise to a construction of the law by these companies that "gross amount of premiums received* * * for all Nebraska business done within the state during the preced - ing calendar year," means only the premiums received on new policies written during the year. This construction is highly favorable to the domestic companies. Again the domestic com - panies are permitted to make deductions for reinsurance and premiums returned on lapsed policies while foreign companies are not. Furthermore, the domestic companies usually do not return all the premiums collected even under the narrow con - struction they thus give to the law. It was without doubt an - ticipated that policy holders in each county would pay their premiums to a local agent who would turn them in as an item of property for assessment. But it is not the practice of the home companies to maintain agencies out in the state and collections are for the most part made through the local bank, or by check or money order payable at the home office. Under such circum - stances it has been quite natural for the companies to assume that it was the business of the assessor in each county to assess premium receipts arising there although it is well known there is no possibility of their doing so. On the other hand, if the assessor of the county where the home office is located should demand a return of premiums for the whole state the companies may fairly contend that authority had not been given him to correct the shortcomings of his fellow assessors. For the most part they return only the premiums on policies held within the one county where the company is domiciled. This is not always the case. In the same county it was found that in 1913 of two companies having approximately the same premiumj^income </seg>
            <seg id="p121">Accident and Surety Companies 117 from Nebraska business, one was assessed on a return of $10,841 and the other on a return of $131,105, the latter being the premium receipts for the whole state. Such a glaring inequality ought to be impossible under the revenue law. KThe present law does not meet the requirements of equality, domestic companies are unduly favored as Section 69 is now mistered. Instead of paying upon their gross premium pts as foreign companies do, they pay upon premiums from inew business, (2) within the county containing the home office, after making deductions not allowed the foreign companies, remedy is clear. If the premium receipts tax is to be retained recommend that it be administered by the Insurance Board that the rate be fixed at 2 per cent, the same as that paid by ign companies. Accident and Surety Companies. The same defects show themselves in the taxation of domestic accident and surety companies as are shown in taxing the life companies. For the reasons set forth above, we recommend that the assessment of these companies be placed in the hands of the Insurance Board and that they be taxed at the same rate as foreign companies of the same class. Effect of Central Administration. Our recommendation is that all insurance companies subject to a premium tax be required to pay this tax into the state treasury at the same rate that foreign companies pay. What the exact financial results of substituting centralized control for the present method would be cannot be determined from available data. But it is safe to say that the premium taxes on those companies now paying locally would be more than doubled by the change. The greatest gain from the change, however, from a haphazard system of self-assessment to one of certainty would consist in the more equitable treatment of competing companies. The Insurance Companies and the Property Tax. We have thus far discussed only the tax on premiums of insurance companies. But the supreme court has held that this is not in lieu of the property tax, and under the present constitution can - not be made so. The court in speaking of the 2 per cent tax on premiums has said: "This is a business tax imposed under the second clause of Sec. 1, Art, 9 of the Constitution, and such </seg>
            <seg id="p122">118 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission companies are also liable for taxation upon all their property within the state the same as other corporations or individuals." Speaking of the premium receipts tax on domestic companies the court says: "This tax also is a business tax and each of such domestic companies is also liable to be taxed upon its tangible property." Royal Highlanders v. State, Judge Letton concurrirg opinion, 77 Neb. 18, 29. And in a later case speaking particu - larly of the life companies the court says: " It is intolerable, how - ever, to contemplate a situation by which the large amount of capital profitably invested in the insurance business by domestic companies may wholly escape taxation and remain exempt from contributing its just share to the maintenance of the protection afforded by the state." Bankers Life etc. v. County Beard, 89 Neb. 469, 474, (1911). No adequate provision of law has been made for reaching this property. Here is confessedly one of the most intricate problems with which tax officers have to deal; and yet the law is silent when it should be most explicit, and has left the adminis - tration of the law in the weakest hands when it should be placed in ihe strongest. The legislature has in this matter, as in sorre others, abdicated to the county assessor. It is no wonder the supreme court in the case last cited, after calling attention to the constitutional mandate upon the legislature to provide "a just and equitable method of taxing our domestic insurance companies," concludes that "it would seem that it has failed to perform its full duty in that matter." I In 1909 the assessor of Lancaster county gave his own rpretation to the law. A capital stock life company, with ipital of $100,000, had returned its office furniture and fix - s and the premiums on new business in the county amounting &gt;3,175 as the basis for its tax. The assessor added to the riule the capital stock of the company its "surplus, conting - reserves and other forms of property," all of which he valued 611,000. The supreme court, after making use of the language ve quoted, reaches the following conclusion: S Therefore, in view of the requirement of the constitution, e inclined to the opinion that the other and more general lions of the revenue law are broad enough to require such uiies to pay a tax upon their capital sjtock; but the tax be based upon the actual value of such stock, which, in the </seg>
            <seg id="p123">Accident and Surety Companies 119 present condition of the revenue law, may be ascertained by Sections 10955, 10967, Ann. St. 1909, which define methods for ascertaining the value of the capital stock of certain corporations. * * • * * In express terms Section 10955, supra, (dealing with the assessment of banks) provided that after ascertaining the value of the capital stock of the corporation in the manner therein described, there shall be deducted therefrom the value of its real estate and tangible property otherwise assessed, and the remainder is to be taken and considered as the taxable value of its capital stock. It is a fundamental truth, which needs no demonstration, that when the value of the capital stock of a corporation has been correctly ascertained such value embraces not only its surplus, but all of its property and assets of every kind and nature. It therefore appears from the record that the action of the assessor and the order of the county board of equalization were unjust and inequitable, and were made and pronounced without legal authority, for such action clearly falls within the ban of double taxation, which the law does not tolerate or permit." Bankers Life Ins. Co. v. County Board, 89 Neb. 469,475. At the same time this case was decided opinions ware handed down in two fire insurance company cases involving the same question of law. From the cautious wording of the opinion and the syllabus, 1 it seems that the court is not fully committed to the taxation of these companies by a method analogous to that employed for taxing banks. But if this should become the accepted method, it leaves some important questions unsettled. It does not seem applicable, for example, to mutual companies which have no capital stock. The owners of the company are the policy-holders. If insurance companies are to be put on the same footing as banks, how are the reserves to be treated?

Under the present constitution it is assessable to Conclusions and Recommendations. — 1. As stated above the property invested in insurance is taxable under the general property tax, except as it may be in the form of Ne - braska mortgages and thus indirectly exempt under the mortgage tax law. It seems that until the constitution is changed the legislature is charged with the duty of providing a way of reach - ing this property. The most direct way to do so would be to impose the tax upon the companies with the knowledge of course, that it would be borne by policy holders. It is probable that under the United States Supreme Court decisions all the assets in the form of securities lodged within the State are taxable here, but it should be borne in mind that these securities are held in trust for the policy holders, many of whom reside outside the State; and it is doubtful whether the State should tax the reserves except in the proportion represented by resident poliyy holders. If the property-tax method is followed we see no reason why those fraternal organizations which accumulate considerable amounts of securities, whatever the name they are held under, should not be taxed exactly as other companies and indeed other owners of such are. But if an effective way of taxing insurance interests on the basis of their property be found the tax on pre - mium receipts should of course be repealed. 2. In case the wide-open tax amendment is adopted, the legislature is left free to take any one of the following courses: 1(1) It may continue the plan of taxing the property of •ance interests and repeal the premium receipts tax as out - l above.

E) Such a substitute might be found by basing the tax on &gt;ss income. This is the way Wisconsin taxes its domestic nies.

In ascertaining the income upon which such e fee shall be computed as aforesaid, no deduction shall be from premiums, whether paid in cash or premium notes, count of dividends allowed or paid to the insured." The personal property of Wisconsin insurance companies is exempt. This method of taxation has the merit of simplicity, certainty and ease of administration and is much to be preferred to any scheme of property tax. The taxes imposed under it in Wisconsin are complained of as unduly burdensome. If applied here it would certainly greatly increase the taxes of Nebraska companies. Thus one company which in 1913 paid less than $12,000 on premiums, only a small part of which was paid in Nebraska, would have paid under the Wisconsin law more than $30,000. We believe that such a tax would constitute an undue burden upon this interest. (3) A third plan which would be open to the legislature in case the amendment were adopted would be to impose a preirimu tax in lieu of all other taxes except those on real estate owned by the companies. In our opinion this, under all the circumstances in the case, furnishes the most satisfactory method of dealing with the domestic insurance companies. By placing the admini - stration of the law in the Insurance Board this plan would bring about substantial equality as between domestic and foreign companies; it would bring an increase of public revenue, and this revenue would properly be turned to state rather than local uses. Without taking into account the fraternal and other mutual assessment companies, the following table based on the business in Nebraska for 1913 shows what the state revenue from this source would be.

Domestic corporations, other than public utility companies, are supposed to fill out a similar schedule; while foreign corporations other than public utility companies are required to furnish in addition to the description of its real and personal property in the county and the "true value of its franchise," only the amount of its gross earnings from business in the state and the expense of transacting such business.

As a Ler of practice, therefore, in the assessment of mercantile, ufacturing and miscellaneous corporations, only the tangible ierty is reached, the "franchise," or "intangible," value ping altogether. Provisions as to Shares. — One other feature of corporation taxes in the state should be mentioned in this connection. Section 29 of the revenue laws which deals with the place of listing per - sonal property provides that: "The capital stock and franchise of corporations and persons, except as otherwise provided, shall be listed, * * * * * where the principal office or place of bus - iness of such corporation or person is located within this state." Section 28 provides that persons shall list among other things all their "shares of stock of joint stock companies when the capital stock of such company is not assessed in this state." In Bressler v. Wayne County, 84 Neb. 774 (1909) it was held that where the capital stock was not assessed to the corporation it was properly assessed to the shareholder. As far as can be determined, however, the stock of domestic companies is not assessed to the holder and it is rarely the case that it is "listed and taxed" at the principal place of business. It seems that where a return of capital stock is made to the ikdcmot </seg>
            <seg id="p128">124 the information is used only as a means of checking up the tangible property of the corporation. The State Occupation Fee. Besides the property taxes above described corporations have since 1909 been required to pay an annual "occupation fee," proportioned to their capital stock. This " fee " is paid by both foreign and domestic companies. The rates under the original act were moderate, ranging from $5.00 for corporations having a capital of $10,000 or less, to $200 for those having a capital in excess of $2,000,000. Under these rates the following sums have been collected and turned into the state treasury: I The legislature of 1913 increased the rates, now called the lual fee," so that the payment now ranges from $5.00 to X), the latter amount being payable by corporations employ - n the state a capital in excess of $25,000,000. Under these i there will be a substantial increase in the yield of the tax. collection in the first year amounted to about $90,000. The lere described is not to be confused with those fees required 1 corporations for filing or amending articles of incorporation. It will thus be seen that corporations are taxed in Nebraska mainly on the principle of the general property tax, i. e. according to the value of their property. The capital stock tax, under the name of an "occupation fee," is a departure from the ad valorem basis, and in taxing a few other interests to be noted later some other basis than the value of property is taken. But with these few exceptions the taxation of corporations is "by valuation." Unless the pending amendment to the constitution is adopted the chief problem in connection with the taxation of corporations must remain, as it now is, merely one of valuation, and more particularly of assessing in some adequate way the "intangible values" not represented by tangible property. This leads us to a brief consideration of methods employed in taxing the "franchise" so-called. tear Ending M lOV. i lov. c Occupation Fees $39,235.85 . 82,776.30 62,890.35 Penalties $2,010 6,480 3,250 909 St::::::::: 912 ... 58,140.95 1,950 60,090.95 . . 58,410.40 1,330 59,740.40 </seg>
            <seg id="p129">125 2. Methods of Taxing the "Franchise" Nature of the Problem; Its Difficulty. The meaning of the term "franchise" as an object of taxation is indefinite. When used of a public service corporation in its narrow sense it is understood to mean the value of the rights granted by the govern - ment -as e. g. the right to occupy the streets for traffic purposes, the right to plant poles and string wires, make conduits, or lay gas pipes. A right granted to an individual to do any of these things would of course be as much a franchise in his possession as though owned by a corporation. But the term has a wider application than this for purposes of taxation. It includes all those elements in the total value of a concern which repn the earning power of the business, not covered by the tangible property employed. In general usage, it means the difference between the total value of the concern and the value of its I ible assets.

A better example is found in the taxation of express, telegraph and telephone companies. The value of the tangible property in these, as in many other cases, is a poor index of tax-paying abil - ity. The legislature of 1903, apparently seeking to maintain the appearance of taxing these interests "by valuation," but not content with the tangible property as an adequate basis, pro - vided as shown elsewhere that to the value of real and personal property should be added the gross receipts for the past year, such gross receipts to be considered as an item of property, and to "represent the franchise valuation which shall not be other - wise assessed." This crude method of valuing the franchise has been declared void by the courts. In the taxation of other public service corporations the means are provided, through the returns </seg>

This seems to be quite effectively ie case of the railroads. The State Board of Equaliza- Assessment finds this element in the railroad values of to exceed $100,000,000. 2. Taxing the "Corporate Excess." — Systematic methods have been developed in some of the states for assessing franchise value, (a) In Illinois the duty of determining the intangible value of corporations rests with the State Board of Equalization. The intangible value, called the "corporate excess," is reported back to the local authorities where the tangible property is found and taxed at the same rate as other property for local purposes. The law seems never to have been very effectively administered probably in large part due to the constitution of the Board of Equalization. The method of taxing the Corporate Excess, followed in a general way in Illinois, was first adopted in Massachusetts and has there attained its fullest - 1 (b) Massachusetts has had a well denned method of reaching the intangible value of corporations since 1864. In recent years the method has undergone important changes but the essentials of the original plan are still retained. The tangible property is assessed at its situs by the local assessor for purposes of local taxa - tion. The valuation is also reported to the State Tax Commissioner. The corporation makes a report to the Commissioner, giving such information as to capital stock, earnings, expenses, dividends, etc. as will enable one skilled in corporation accounts to determine the market value of the capital stock. From this total value is deducted the sum of the local assessments, as also the value of tangible property located outside the state. The remainder constitutes the "corporate excess "which is taxed at the average tax-rate for the state. Property which the assessor is usually not able to value with substantial accuracy, like stocks of goods, is not assessed locally under the present law but its value appears in the "corporate excess" as found by the Commissioner. Shares in the hands of the owner are of course not taxable, but bonds of corporations are, when found, assessed to the owner. The distribution of the tax on the "corporate excess" has undergone some changes during the last few years. The tax is </seg>

It differs from the Mas - sachusetts law in several important respects. (1) It does not apply to public service corporations, these being taxed on the basis of their gross earnings. (2) Not only the capital stock ■ considered in arriving at the value of a corporation but to this is added the bonded indebtedness and all other indebtedness which represents investment or "is a cover for a division of profits." Neither the bonds nor the shares are taxable to the holder. (3) From the total value thus found are deducted the assessed value of real estate and tangible personal property, and the value of such property as is by law exempt from taxation. The remainder constitutes the "corporate excess," for the taxation of the corporation. (4) The rate on this intangible value is the same as that on intangible personalty — such as money and credits — in the hands of individuals, i. e. four mills on the dollar of valuation. In both Massachusetts and Rhode Island the law for taxing "corporate excess" has proven successful.

It is agreed on all hands that this method however well worked out on paper would fail as our own present method does, but for the highly efficient central administration of the tax. rore Effective Method of Reaching the Intangible Value of Corporations Needed in Nebraska. Why Intangible Values Should be Assessed. It should be noted that the plans followed by Massachusetts and Rhode Island do not involve any new principle in taxation. They are simply effective methods of taxing according to value. Their novelty is that they furnish a means of making a full and accurate assessment of the property of corporations and of taxing it once and only once. If such a plan were adopted in Nebraska it would be an effective method of doi.ig what the constitution and the law now require to be done, but for doing which no adequate rules or machinery are provided. It would, if efficiently administered, each a great mass of property not now taxed, and would bring about a fairer adjustment of the tax burden. As Mr. Justice Brewer has well said: " In the complex civilization of today a large portion of the wealth of a community consists in intangible property. ****** * * * To ignore this intangible property or to hold that it is not subject to taxation at its accepted value is to eliminate from the reach of the taxing power a large portion of the wealth of the country. To say that there is no such intangible property, that it is something of no value, is to insult the common intelligence of every man. It is a cardinal rule which should never be for - gotten that whatever property is worth for the purposes of income and sale it is also worth for purposes of taxation. Accumulated wealth will laugh at the crudity of taxing laws which reach only the one (tangible) and ignore the other (intangible) while they who own tangible property not organized into a single producing plant will feel the injustice of a system which so misplaces the burden of taxation." Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, 166 U. S. This argument was made in connection with a business in which the intangible value is unusually large but it applies to all businesses whether the intangible value is large or small. The reasoning has been accepted by the supreme court of this state in numerous cases; the law as interpreted is clear and the demands of justice no less so, that the non-physical as well as physical property must be included in the assessment. </seg>
            <seg id="p133">The Question of Discrimination 129 (The Question of Discrimination. It may be argued, ;ver, that corporate property should be taxed on the same as that of individuals and copartnerships, and that it would discrimination against the corporate form of business organ - )n to adopt a method of accurate assessment for corpora - that may not be applied to natural persons and firms. This rrent was put to a member of the Rhode Island Commission, speaking for himself and not the commission said: "Your apparent objection to the taxation of the intangible value of corporations by a positive method while the method of taxing is so ineffective that much of their intangible value escapes, does not seem to me to be very serious. If nothing is to be taxed until everything else is equitably assessed, I am afraid there will be a shortage of considerable proportions in both state and local revenues, and the principle of taxation at the source must be It is not the purpose of such a plan of assessment as that under consideration to discriminate between classes of property holders. If any discrimination should arise it would be incidental in the process of administration. As a matter of fact, the legisla - ture, clothed with power to determine the method of valuation, has already provided for different methods for different classes of property. The most striking example of departure from the usual method of assessment is found in the case of the railroads. They are assessed, as they should be, by a central authority supplied with ample data for effectively reaching the intangible value ; thus making possible equality of treatment for the various roads. No one thinks of lessening the efficiency of the machinery for assessing railroad property simply because all property can - not be assessed by the same method or with equal accuracy. Again the law requires bank stock to be assessed at its market value. Where this is done accurately it results in a higher pro - portionate valuation than is given to other property, for it reaches what may be called the intangible value of the business in excess of the funds put into the enterprise represented by the paid up capital, surplus, and undivided profits. Moreover the method of collecting at the source leaves no chance for the stockholder in this class of corporation to avoid the tax. The legislature has not, however, provided the machinery for effective administra- 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p134">130 tion ; for the local assessor, not able to determine the true value, generally accepts book value as the basis of assessment. These facts are adduced not to justify "discrimination" but to show that it exists under the present law as an incident to the different methods of valuation provided by the legislature. We may go farther and hold that as a matter of fact "discrimination" of flagrant form is inseparable from the ad valorem method of taxation unless it is administered in such a way as to reach in - tangible as well as tangible property. Suppose we take two factories with exactly the same equipment but one prosperous making the business pay say 20 per cent on the investment, the other barely maintaining itself on 3 or 4 per cent earnings. Only those blinded by the narrowest conception of the ad valorem system would argue that the two concerns should contribute the same for the support of government. To require it violates the most fundamental of the principles of taxation — that of equality. It has been argued before the commission that business ability, successful management, industry, integrity, good-will, ought not to be taxed. But if we were as familiar with the method of taxing according to income as we are with taxation by valuation, the flimsiness of such a contention would be apparent. If justice requires that income arising from skill or other personal qualities be taxed, it equally requires that the intangible value found in a going concern, whatever be its source, since it represents earn - ing power, should be included in the valuation of the concern. The argument that the assessment of intangible value to corporations would constitute a discrimination against the cor - porate form of organization, ignores, therefore, the important fact that the assessment of tangible property only involves in itself a flagrant discrimination in favor of the more prosperous corporations as against the less prosperous; it involves discrim - ination in fact against all forms of property, like that used for residence purposes, to which no intangible value attaches. The aim should of course be to reach the full value of the property of individuals and corporations alike. But because this cannot be done in all cases is no reason for doing it in no case. No state can afford deliberately to adopt the policy of making all parts of its taxing machinery as inefficient as it is at the weakest point. The contrary policy should be followed of making the assessment accurate wherever it can be made so. If an effective method </seg>

Does the fact that we now have in the Potts law a capital stock tax in form of an "occupation fee," stand in the way of adopting the Rhode Island method here? In our opinion it dees not. The only merit of that tax is that it is simple and easily administered. It rests on no sound principle of taxation. It is a convenient way of securing a slight increase of revenue, pin money we might say, but an attempt to raise any considerable sum by it would probably lead to its breakdown. The same tax is levied upon corporations having equal issues of stock regardless of its value, and regardless of the amount of bonds outstanding. While the tax is simple in itself, it introduces complexity into the scheme of taxing corporations. If desired it might be retained, as long as the rates are kept low though we see no reason for doing so. It is a business tax, not a property tax; and in no wise takes the place of the tax on any part of a corporation's property. Conclusions and Recommendations. Our conclusion is that a more effective method of assessing corporations should be provided for in Nebraska. We have made recommendations </seg>
            <seg id="p136">132 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission elsewhere that all public service corporations be assessed by a central board. We believe that mercantile manufacturing and miscellaneous corporations should be assessed by the same au - thority. Inasmuch as the values designed to be reached by this change are intangible in character there seems good reason for treating them, as is done in Rhode Island, in the same way that intangible property is treated. Thus if a flat rate is provided for intangible property, it should also be applied to the corporate excess. If the present constitutional provisions remain, the legislature will be required to provide a means of valuing the "franchise," and no other way is left open but to tax it at the general property tax rate. There is nothing in the economic character of the tax to mark it as a state tax though in some states it is turned to state purposes. Unless it is deemed desirable to adopt a plan of separation of sources, in which case the cor - porate excess tax will be needed to supply the state's needs, the values found should be certified back to the local governments as a basis for local taxes. </seg>
            <seg id="p137">133 CHAPTER VII THE SEPARATION OF SOURCES OF REVENUE In search for a way of escape from some of the evils the general property tax, a number of students of public finance have advocated the plan of separating the sources of revenue for state and for local purposes. The plan has been frequently commended to this Commission though not always upon full consideration of the problems involved. It has been urged that as between the state and federal governments this principle is observed and it ought to be carried further by giving the state its own special sources of income and reserving others to the counties and minor civil divisions. In some states this end has been attained without any conscious effort at segregation, but as an incident to providing more effective administration. In others it has been consciously aimed at as the most direct means of securing an equitable apportionment of the tax burden. Separation of sources is advocated for six chief reasons: 1 That there is a natural distribution of functions between the state and local governments and the tax system should be made to conform to this distribution; (2) that it is the only effective remedy for the evils of under-valuation; (3) that the imposition of state levies upon the same valuations as are used for the local levies creates too heavy a burden upon that base; (4) that property values may be localized in such a way as to give an undue advantage to those communities possessing them; (5) that it is a necessary step toward giving local autonomy in tax matters; and (6) that it will make it possible to place each tax in the hands of that branch of government which can best administer it. We shall consider each of these in turn. 1. Apportionment According to Function. The prin- ciple of apportioning revenues to the several governments in accordance with the functions they perform is best set forth in the report of the California Commission on Revenue and Taxa - tion for 1906. The argument may be summarized as follows: The activities of the local governments, such as the protection of life and property by the police, the fire departments, the local </seg>
            <seg id="p138">134 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission courts, the construction and maintenance of roads, streets, bridges and the like, the provision for schools, the care of poor and the like redound distinctly, directly and peculiarly to the benefit of local property owners and local industries and enhance and sustain the value of real estate and of other tangible property in the localities. This has always been the ground for making local government expenses a local charge. Separation makes no change in this respect, but it does propose to relieve local property from state taxes and from the expenses of general activities, the benefits of which are not directly traceable to the activities of the local government. It seems peculiarly fitting that local in - dustries like agriculture should bear the expense of their own protection, and support the local charges. There is probably no better way of apportioning the taxes among a group of farmers for the support of local government than by the taxation of real estate. The property tax originated as a neighborhood tax, and works best when used as such. In cities, generally, it is the growth of the community that gives value to real estate. It seems proper that such property should bear the greater part of the expenses of the city which creates its value. On the other hand the activities of the state are broad and general. Its duties are mainly legislative. It provides the laws under which business is conducted, corporations chartered, institutions in no wise local are maintained. In general it cares for all those interests too broad or too large for the local govern - ments to handle. These general activities suggest as the proper sources of revenue to support them, the public service corporations such as railroads, the telegraph, telephone and express companies, and the banks, whose business is in no sense confined to one locality. These industrial corporations are the creatures of the state, and it is by the state they are regulated and controlled. They serve the people of the state as a whole, and do not benefit, except as to their local franchises, in the same peculiar and direct manner as does private individual real estate, by the activities of the local government. I While the theory here presented has much to support it, in aeral way, it may well be doubted whether there is so distinct vision between the functions of state and local government &gt; make an exact basis for separating the revenues as is here med. The state of California was not able to apply it with exactness. Thus while it may be true that some banks ; wide districts, possibly the whole state, many others per - l a purely local service, yet the bank taxes are by the Cali - ia law turned into the state treasury. It would seem that street car companies ought according to the theory to be </seg>
            <seg id="p139">135 subject to local taxation, yet their taxes also were turned into the state treasury, because, as has been explained, it was only fair that the cities should give up this source of revenue as an offset to the surrender of the railroad taxes by the rural districts. 2. Separation to Avoid Undcr-valuation. — The argu - ment most frequently urged for segregation is the practical one that a fair assessment cannot be had under the present system of apportioning state taxes to the counties in proportion to valuation. Here is confessedly one of the most obvious, persis - tent, and universal defects in the tax system. All efforts to remedy the evils of under-valuation through equalizing boards have been unavailing; it is now proposed to remove the motive for under - valuation by giving the state an independent source of income and this as is supposed makes the assessment of property a matter of purely local concern. This plan has been advocated before the Commission by farmers on the ground that they are compelled under the present plan to pay an unfair share of the state tax because of the concealment of large masses of property in the cities, and segregation is expected to give them relief. I This argument assumes that if the assessment in each county d be fairly made the objections to the present plan of appor - ing the state tax would be removed. The state charges to county such a part of the total state tax to be raised as its ation is part of the total valuation. This in turn is collected 1 the taxpayers in each county in proportion to their in - dual assessments. The state tax in fact is so many mills on dollar of assessed value of each person's property and rests he same theoretical basis as the local taxes: Each person :pected to pay a state tax according to his ability, measured he value of his possessions, just as his local taxes are. (Several important questions are raised by this branch of the ment for segregation. Would the motives which lead to or assessment be swept away by separation? What effect d the plan have upon the character of local assessments? such assessments under any circumstances be regarded as itter of purely local concern? Have we exhausted the means curing a fair valuation as between counties? These ques - i were discussed by Mr. T. S. Adams now a member of the </seg>
            <seg id="p140">Report of Nebraska Tax Commission 136 Wisconsin State Tax Commission in an address before the N'a - tional Tax Association in 1907, as follows: "The influences or factors responsible for inefficient assess - ment work are so numerous, that the desire to evade state taxes is really a negligible consideration. Enumerate these factors: first, the inherent difficulties of the task; next, the political atmosphere in which the assessor too often works; then, the insufficient time, insufficient pay, desire to evade county taxation, desire to favor personal friends and political associates — enumer - ate these factors, and it is plain, without reference to experience, that the mere discontinuance of state taxation of general property can work no appreciable improvement. If reference to experience is needed, I can only say that the practical separation accomp - lished in Wisconsin has not, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, exerted any appreciable influence upon the character of the assessment work. There is the same old struggle over the county equalization, the same old strife between city and county, the same old scramble of the individual taxpayer to get from under the local assessment. How could it be otherwise? Of the general property taxes $706,660,244 in all collected in this country in 1902, only $83,320,134, or 11.6 per cent, went to the state governments, while $624,340,110, or 88.4 per cent, went to the counties, cities, and other local divisions. These figures furnish a good measure of the part which the desire to escape state taxes plays in de - moralizing local assessors. The counties alone collected nearly 75 per cent more under the general property tax than the states. If the state governments should abandon the $83,320,134 which they now are (or were in 1902) levying on general property, there would still remain $624,340,110 to be distributed and equalized among the taxpayers of the local divisions. For the state govern - ment to abandon this greater task of equalization is a cowardly evasion of its chief duty." State and Local Taxation, I, 522. I The relative importance of the state taxes in Nebraska is at ent somewhat greater than for the county as a whole in 1902. 913 of $22,487,791 levied on the value of property for all the ;rnments, $3,671,385 was for state purposes and $18,816,406 ocal purposes; that is 83.6 per cent of the ad valorem taxes * for local purposes. The state levy was in 1913 7.8 mills; average for various counties, including the state levy, ranged l 25.65 to 60.76 mills and the average for all counties was 15 mills. If the recommendations of the Commission for ling certain taxes over to the state are adopted, the local * will become relatively greater. We believe that any plan </seg>
            <seg id="p141">Separation to Avoid Under-valuatioti 137 of reform that leaves to the local assessors a practically free hand in determining how this great sum shall be apportioned among the taxpayers of the county, as is now the case, will fail of its purpose. It is Utopian to proceed on the theory that the difficul - ties of valuation will be lessened, or the motives for unfair assess - ments materially decreased, by separation. It is equally Utopian to argue that when made a local matter the people of each com - munity will look after their own interests and correct any evils that appear in the assessments. Experience shows that they will not, that state supervision is required whether there is sepa - ration or not. The Minnesota Tax Commission has found many cases where the inequalities between townships in the same county had been passed over by the county board and have themselves equalized or ordered reassessments. In some cases the county board has called the state to its aid. This practice prevails in Kansas. In New York where till recently there was complete separation of sources the local assessment has been thus described by Mr. C. J. Tobin, Assistant Secretary of the State Board of Tax Commissioners: k" It, should be remembered also that there has been no ralized control in taxation, so that each locality has been a unto itself with the result that there has been continuous :ion on the part of each to compete in the race for approval showing of efficiency. The goal has been ever for a lowering le tax rate as compared with some other county in the fear state tax and in any event as compared with some other 1 in the county on account of the county tax to which each 1 must contribute." The argument for separation on the ground that state equalization has failed is not, therefore, on closer examination, fully convincing. Administration is faulty in this state as it has been in others. But we have by no means exhausted the possi - bilities of improvement. The equalization of a faulty initial assessment is confessedly a more or less futile undertaking. But give to a permanent state board of tax commissioners a direct control over local assessments such as we recommend elsewhere, give to county and state equalizing boards adequate information as to the character of the property they are to equalize and the glaring inequalities will be greatly reduced if not eliminated. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">138 3. Separation as a Step Toward Local Option. S-ation is advocated on another and quite different ground, ly, that it would make possible the application of the prin - of "local option" in matters of taxation. "Local Option" or "Home Rule" in taxation has re - ceived considerable attention at the hands of students of the subject during the last few years. Advocates of the principle hold that the local governments should be clothed with power to determine, to a greater or less extent, the objects and the methods of taxation within their borders. It is argued that industrially and socially communities differ widely and that a tax system suited to one community may be wholly unsuited to another. These differences are most marked as between city and rural districts. Why should they be compelled to live under the same revenue system? Moreover, each community is held to be a better judge of the best means of raising revenue within its borders than the legislature can be, and that it should have a right to exercise its judgment. The assumption is, sometimes expressed more often implied, that the revenue system in one locality is a matter of no concern to other localities. In fact variety is desirable and the experiments thus permitted would lead to adoption finally of those methods and sources best adapted to the character of the community. These, we believe, are the chief arguments for local option in taxation. That there is much merit in them can hardly be denied. But as usual in such matters there are disadvantages as well as advantages connected with the scheme. No appeal can be made to recent experience as to the operation of the principle. The whole tendency in modern times has been away from local au - tonomy in matters of taxation and in the direction of centralized control. Some moves have been made toward decentralization, but they have as yet yielded no experience. In 1910 the people of Oregon amended their constitution in such a way as to empower the voters to "regulate taxation and exemptions within their several counties, subject to any general law which may here - after be enacted." But before this amendment was made effec - tive in any county it was repealed. As indicative of what it was believed could be done under the amendment, the following bill submitted to the voters of one of the counties is appended : </seg>
            <seg id="p143">139 I" Section 1. That all business, labor, trades, occupations, essions, and the right to conduct, work at or practice the ?; and all fonrs of personal property; and all improvements n and under all land shall be and hereby are exempted from tion for any purpose within Clackamas county, and no tax I be imposed upon any trade, labor, business, occupation or pssion under the pretext of a license or the exercise of the ;e power within said county; but in its application to licenses permits this is intended only to prevent the raising of revenue i such licenses and permits, and to prevent exacting of fees efor greater than the cost of issuing the permit or license, is not intended to impair the police power of the county, or state." "Section 2. All taxes within Clackamas county shall be levied on and collected from the assessed values of all lands, water powers, deposits, natural growths, and other natural resources, ard en and from the assessed values of public service corporation franchises and rights of way. This act does not affect corporation license fees and inheritance taxes collected directly by the state, nor such lands as are used only for muni - cipal, educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes, already exempt from taxation by law." As stated above the Oregon local option amendment has been repealed. There is now pending before the people of Cali - fornia an amendment which if adopted will give the people of "any county, city and county, city or town"the power to "exempt from taxation for local purposes in whole or in part, any one or more of the following classes of property: Improvements in, on or over land; shipping; household furniture; live stock; mer - chandise; machinery; tools; farming implements; vehicles; other personal property except franchise." In Colorado cities have the option of exempting improvements on real estate from taxation or practically so. Under this power the city of Pueblo provided by ordinance for exempting such improvements to the extent of 50 per cent of their value after January 1, 1914, and to the extent of 99 per cent of their value a year later. The legisla - ture of Nebraska in 1913 had under consideration a measure looking in the direction of limited local option. Senate File No. 161 provided for the submission of an amendment to Article IX, Section 6 of the constitution which if adopted would give the legislature power to vest all municipal corporations with authority to assess and collect taxes "upon such sources of revenue as they shall prescribe according to rules </seg>
            <seg id="p144">140 Bxation which shall be uniform, provided that reasonable ptions may be allowed." This bill passed the Senate by a of 23 to 6, but failed in the House. Without experience to guide in the matter of local option we are inclined to the belief that the advantages to be expected from this plan of reform have been over-estimated and that its limitations and the dangers likely to follow any large grant of authority to the local governments are seriously to be considered before any step is taken in that direction. What these limita - tions and dangers are is succinctly set forth in the address of Mr. Adams to whhh reference has already been made: " In the first place, separation and home rule cannot ma - terially increase tbe positive fiscal freedom of the local govern - ments. It is doubtful whether they can safely be permitted to exempt any class of property they desire to relieve from taxa - tion; but it is perfectly plain that they cannot be allowed to devise new taxes. Take the income tax, for example. Not only would it be impossible for a local government to administer the income tax without the right to call upon other officers of the state for information and assistance, but the difficult definitions and interpretations of income which the various local govern - ments might introduce, would bring about an intolerable amount of multiple taxation. Or take the much more feasible ] roject of license or business taxes upon commercial and manufacturing concerns in lieu of the present taxes upon plant and stock. The various local districts of a state could never be permitted to define and manipulate such taxes as they might see fit. Suppose a manufacturing concern had its factory and warehouse in village A and its principal office and salesroom in city B. The village might impose the present property tax on plant and stock while the city might, by adopting some plan of apportioning the total capital value of such concerns according to business done or gross income, tax practically all of this property again in another way. Furthermore, the local governments could not safely be permitted to tax individual categories of personal property as they saw fit. Take mortgage taxation. County A might institute a recording tax and County B the separate taxa - tion of mortgages as personal property. Yet an individual mortgagee residing in B might lend his money in county A, with the result that, whether mortgagee or mortgagor ultimately paid the tax, it would be double or multiple taxation of the most vicious kind. In general, it is a safe conclusion that the income tax, business taxes, and all manner of ad valorem assessmentjin the spirit of the so-called unit rule would have to be denif-d|the </seg>
            <seg id="p145">141 growing and commendable practice of distributing the intangible values of going concerns in accordance with their business or tangible property, it is doubtful whether even the method of assessing tangible property can be left to the discretion of the local governments. The opportunities for double taxation are too manifold. While the habitation or occupancy tax might safely, perhaps, be left to the local governments (although even this is problematical), most of the possible substitutes for the personal property tax can be introduced only as state taxes. As a matter of fact it is probable that the average legislature will never permit the local governments to bid against each other for the location of manufacturing concerns, although the pros and cons of this particular scheme seem to be evenly balanced. In other words, the tax laws for the local districts will always have to be made by the state legislature. Evidently then, the phrase 'home rule' does not mean exactly what the words imply. We want the local governments to have the liberty to exempt personal property, but we do not want them to have liberty to tax corporations as they please. We are advocating freedom when what we want, or at least the only thing we can have, is another kind of control. What we need is not less state regulation in the matters of local taxation, but more intelligent state regulation." 4. Piling up the Levies. Another argument for segre - gation is that it would avoid the evil of piling the levies of all the governments on one base, that of the value of property. Here is a serious fault in our system. No one can doubt that the larger the levies the greater the motive for under-valuation and other devices for escaping the tax. The real trouble here, how - ever, is with too large a dependence on the property tax. As long as ad valorem taxes furnish so large a part of the public revenues the evil will continue. Mere segregation will afford little relief. Suppose the railroad taxes were turned over to the state and satisfied the state's need. The 7.8 mills now levied on general property for the state would no longer be needed ; but the valua - tions of general property for local purposes would be reduced by the withdrawal of railroad property from local taxation and the local levies must be correspondingly increased. The best way to remedy this evil is to use a different base for part of the taxes. This is one of the merits of the income tax considered elsewhere. An increase of the inheritance tax would serve the same purpose pf relieving the strain of ad valorem taxation. </seg>
            <seg id="p146">142 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission Effect of Separation on Economy. -The arguments for a complete separation of sources based on the functions of the governments, the failure to equalize properly, and the evils of piling of levy upon levy, are therefore not fully convincing. On the other hand there is at least one good reason why the state should not have wholly independent sources of revenue. It may be but a crude method of passing on the economy of government to judge simply by the size of the levies, but, crude as it is, it is about the only method the electorate has of reaching conclusions under present conditions. If the state derived its revenues from corporation taxes, e. g. and made no levy on general property, the great body of taxpayers would have their interest diverted from the question of the appropriations which they now watch with some care. They would erroneously suppose that the weight of any excessive use of public funds would affect only the corporations. They would lose sight of the fact that cor - poration taxes are in the long run mainly indirect and will sooner or later be paid by those who employ their services. Thus the most effective check the voters now have upon extravagant ex - penditures would be swept away. In such a situation we might properly expect (1) a marked increase in the state's scale of ex - penditures and (2) an increase of corporation interest in state Partial Separation Desirable. — The state now has certain independent sources. The state treasury received in 1913 $741,623 from educational lands and investments, all for the use of the schools; from the federal government grants amounting to $120,232 also devoted to education; $569,552 from depart - mental fees and earnings, licenses, escheats, convict labor, fees from self-supporting offices and boards; while from the general tax on property payments into the treasury amounted to $2,249, - 337. Some progress has recently been made in supplying the state with new taxes. The corporation occupation tax first pro - vided in 1909 goes into the state treasury. As amended by the act of 1913 this tax yields about $90,000 a year. The last legisla - ture turned the troublesome but not prolific car-company tax into the state treasury and also the 2 per cent gross earnings tax on express companies, though in this case the old local taxes were left untouched. This process should be carried further, not for the purpose of abdicating to the local governments all power </seg>
            <seg id="p147">143 over assessments but for the purposes and reasons mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. 5. Separation Based on Efficiency of Administration. There are some taxes the local officials cannot successfully administer. We have called attention elsewhere to the failure of the local governments to deal with the taxes on insurance com - panies. They should be administered by the Insurance Com - missioner. For similar reasons the telegraph, express, and Pull - man company taxes, and those on inheritances should be admin - istered by state officers and the funds turned to state uses. 6. The Localization of Values. Complaint is made under present conditions that the tax burden is not equitably apportioned because of the way property values are localized. The well established rule is to tax property at its situs for the benefit of the government within whose boundaries it lies. A mill, a mine or factory beyond the limits of a taxing district cannot be touched by it for purposes of taxation. This no doubt is a sound general rule. Usually where there are large accumula - tions of wealth there is large need of public revenues, and the contrary. But often property values are located in such a way as to escape their just share of taxes. It was this fact that led the people of California to adopt a plan of complete separation. It was found that the property of water, light and power companies, and frequently their principal offices, were located in districts of scant population where the levies were low, though the services were rendered and paid for in distant and more populous places. The railroad values, owing to the necessity of entering the state through certain gateways, were also piled up in communities where there was little need of revenue, to the great advantage of the few people of the community and of the railroad companies. On the theory that these values had more than a local interest and that railroads owed something to all parts of the state, the railroad taxes were turned to the state's use. The principle was the easier seen when it was proposed to tax the roads on the gross earnings basis. Everybody who used the railroads contributed to these earnings; why should not all benefit by the taxes derived from them? Ee most conspicuous example of this kind in Nebraska is connection with the railroads. The roads themselves are r ell distributed, though four counties are not touched by </seg>
            <seg id="p148">144 them and a number of other counties have but a small mileage. The state board values the railroads and apportions to each county, city, township, road and school district, both tangible and intangible values according to the number of miles of road. Neighboring districts whose citizens make as much use of the railway and contribute as much to its earnings as the citizens of the district where the road is located, get no tax revenue from it for local purposes. The greatest disparity of tax burden is found in supporting schools especially in the western counties on account of this plan of distributing the railroad tax. It is urged on the one hand that all districts of the county should be allowed to levy on the railroad valuation; on the other hand, that there is no more reason for a district without mileage to benefit by the railroad values in another district than to benefit by the value of real estate or factories in a neighboring town. If the present method of apportioning these taxes is abandoned, what method should be substituted therefor? The question here raised is largely one as to the proper size of the taxing district but it also involves the question whether certain kinds of property should be dealt with in larger districts than the general mass of property. The specific problem is whether the railroad property is of such a peculiar character that the people of districts lying at a distance from the railway have a claim upon it for purposes of local taxation. Without entering upon the difficult task of determining the line of demarcation between property that should be treated as purely local and that clothed with a more general interest, we have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the present method of apportion - ing all railroad values to the districts containing railway track works an injustice to the non-railroad districts. Some study has been made of the relative tax burden for maintaining the schools in railroad and non-railroad districts, especially in those counties where land values are relatively low. County treasurers were asked to give the items indicated in the table which follows for six districts having a railroad and six districts without railroad mileage. In some cases village districts have been included. Thus the high average attendance in Cherry and Kimball counties indicates that such districts are included in the railroad group, but for the most part the comparison is </seg>
            <seg id="p149">145 between rural districts. The following table shows tru' results of the inquiry for six counties: railway industry, and of the way railroad values are localized we would have no hesitation in recommending a change in the present method of apportioning the railroad taxes if it wen- not for the disturbance it would involve in the financial interests that have grown up under it. If only rural districts were concerned the case would be fairly clear that justice requires a change in the law; for they are all attempting to maintain about the - kind of school. But the villages and cities which have by assurr - ing heavy burdens built up and are maintaining a high • are in a different position. Many of them would never have undertaken such a burden but for the railroad taxes and to withdraw these taxes, or to divide them for the support of nc n - railroad districts would bring a peculiar hardship to the high school districts. We are not contending that these districts have acquired an inviolable "vested right" to the railroad taxes; but we are pointing out that interests which have grown up in a perfectly natural way under a generally sound system ought to receive careful consideration before they are seriously (is- t Average Average Average Average School Amount Average Number UNTY Total Railroad Levy of Taxes Attend Valuation Valuation Mills &gt; Raised an. hool K Railroad . $559,806 $163,3.53 9.89 $5,540 27 -Railroad.. 247,116 K1 15 Railroad. 612,690 226,030 24.3 14,925 91 Non-Railroad 64,965 M 11,870 9 t Railroad. 191,971 99,470 7.99 1,535 •Railroad. 128,079 17.3 2.225 8 II Railroad. 848,795 591,075 9.94 , !4 M ■Railroad. 150,975 35.32 (32 15 »n Railroad 539,522 157,864 7.39 14 ■Railroad. 440,613 17 Railroad.. 516,400 211,695 4.96 K6 14 Non-Railroad. . \ 240,860 j , 11.9 8 In view of such a situation, the peculiar character of the </seg>

            <seg id="p156">152 We have not been able to give the problems involved enough study to warrant our making recommendations for legislation on this subject. We have, however, collected some data bearing on the operation of the two plans of dealing with the railroad taxes which have been most frequently discussed before the Com - mission, namely: (I) The plan of turning the railroad taxes into the general fund of the state treasury; and (II) the plan of col - lecting the railroad taxes at the state treasury and apportioning them to the counties on the basis of the school population. The results of this study are presented in the table which follows. The table contains also (III) a statement of the effect of substitut - ing the "local expenditures" (to be explained later) for "the value of property" as a basis for determining the amount of state taxes to be raised in each county. The table, therefore, is really a consolidation of three tables brought together for easier compari- ■ Explanation of the Tables. — It will be best to deal with of the plans covered by the tabl^ in turn : I. Divert the Railroad Taxes to the Use of the State. — This would be a step in the direction of separation. No plan of separation can leave the local governments this source of revenue. But as conditions now stand the railroad taxes added to the state's special sources of revenue would not supply its needs. In 1913, in addition to fees, licenses, earnings, grants and special taxes going into the state treasury, a levy of 7.8 mills for state purposes had to be made upon the general property of the state and there was charged to the counties the sum of $3,671,384 (column 3). The railroad taxes that year amounted approxi - mately to $2,530,011. This is the amount paid by the seven principal railway companies on the general railway valuation and the terminal valuation. Additional taxes were paid by most of these companies on property situated outside the right-of-way and assessed locally. These would under any circumstances remain subject to local taxation and are not here considered. The taxes of a few companies running into the state usually on leased tracks are not included. Their omission, however, does not materially affect the result even in Douglas county where they are chiefly paid. The railroad taxes, as will be seen, lack $1,141, - 373 of furnishing the state with its necessary funds. If the state </seg>
            <seg id="p157">Explanation af Tables 153 Ethis amount on what may be called "local property," i total valuation (column 1), minus the railroad valuation 1 2). It would have required a levy of 2.75 mills on "local y" to raise the $1,141,373 (column 8). How the several counties would be affected by the diversion of the railroad taxes to the state may be illustrated by examining typical cases. Adams county was charged in 1913 $59,726 on a valuation of $7,657,232. A part of this valuation represented railroad property, $980,802, on which the state levy of 7.8 mills yielded a tax of $7,650 (column 6). The state tax on "local property" was $59,726 less $7,650 or $52,076. But the local governments enjoyed a revenue of $32,903 from the railroad tax. If the railroad taxes had been enough to supply the state treasury this county by giving up its share of the railroad tax $32,903 would have been relieved of a state tax on local property of $52,076, and would have been the gainer by the difference, or $19,173 (column 7). But the state would have been corrpelled in 1913 to levy 2.75 mills on the "local property" of the courty which would have yielded a revenue to the state of $18,36&lt; that county would be the gainer by diverting the railroad taxes to the state by the difference, or $814 (column 9). Banner county has no railroad. It was charged $3,406 state taxes. By diverting the railroad tax, the state levy would l.e reduced to 2.75 mills and its state taxes would be only $1,201'. a gain by the change of $2,206. KBlaine county would have lost by the change $5,235, for it d have lost $4,136 by its surrender of the railroad tax and hare of the required levy would increase the loss by that int ($1,099 ). Columns 9 and 10 show the gain or loss which would have resulted in each county by turning the railroad tax to state pur - poses. The results would be modified but slightly if the Pullman taxes which we recommend for state revenue had been included in the calculation. We have no information as to the amount of express and insurance company taxes paid in each county. The changes which would result from withdrawing these taxes from local use would no doubt in some cases change a loss into a gain but the results would not greatly differ from those shown in the table. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">Report of Nebraska Tax Commission 154 II. Substitute "School Population" for "Railroad Valuation" as a Basis for Apportioning the Railroad Taxes. — This of course is not a plan for separation of sources. It retains the railroad taxes for local use but seeks to distribute their benefits more widely. Advocates of the plan are usually not very definite as to the method of division. The plan is often supported by the argument that the children of a non-railroad district are entitled to a share of the railroad tax in the county. In all fairness this argument must be extended in the interest of those children in counties which have no railroads and the table (II) is constructed on this theory. The four counties having no mileage would have a share of the taxes paid by railroads, presumably for the use of the schools. Column 11 shows the school population of each county, column 12 the percentage of such population, and 13 the share each county would get on this basis of the $2,530,011 railroad taxes paid in 1913. Adams county now receives for local use $32,903. Under the proposed plan it would receive $42,012; Banner county, which has no railroad, would receive $2,551; Hooker now has $1^.987 for local uses, under the proposed plan it would receive but $2,977, and so on. Such a plan would give to the several districts within the county its quota based on school population. We present no statistics to show how the districts within the counties would be affected. The combinations of circumstances are so numerous and varied that the change might easily bring as great hardships as it would remove. We are so uncertain of the outcome that we make no recommendation with respect to this plan of dealing with the III. Make the Apportionment of State Taxes to be zd by the Counties on the Basis of Local Expenditures :ad of the Basis of Valuation. — This plan has been pro - as a means primarily of avoiding the evils of under-valua - but it is also supported on the ground that the expenditures by the local governments are a better test of their ability pport the state than the value of property within their ts. The plan has been urged by separationists to meet the tion that any plan of separation is likely to produce too or too little for the state's needs. Very well, it is said, if comes to the state than it requires, turn it back to the local nments on the basis of the amount they raise for them- </seg>
            <seg id="p159">Explanation of Tables 155 selves; if too little, call on the local governments for contributions on the same basis. This, it is argued, would remove the ten tion to under-valuation and furnish a fairer basis than even the best of valuations would for apportioning expen- We have pointed out elsewhere that to adopt any arrange - ment that would make a good assessment of indifference to the state would be a step in the wrong direction, and we now have to say that we are not convinced that local expenditures constitute any fairer test of ability of a community than the value of prop - erty. If every government spent just what it was able to spend and no more, the argument would have more weight. But every one is acquainted with communities which voluntarily take upon themselves heavy burdens for local purposes, which, under the proposed plan, would subject them also to an unduly heavy tax for the support of the state as compared with their more parsimonious neighbors. Where attempts have been made to act on this principle, as in Oregon, it was found necessary to modify it by excluding one expenditure after another, and in that state the principle was finally abandoned. While not recommending this method of apportioning the tax burden upon the local governments, we present in part III of the table some data bearing upon its operation. We have no information as to the expenditures of the local government and were compelled to fall back upon the taxes charged for local purposes, for the counties and other local governments, as a basis of computation. These fairly, though not exactly, serve as a measure of expenditure. Our statistics of taxes charged do not show the amount raised for the various divisions of government, so that columns 14, 15 and 16 show respectively the total of local taxes charged for all governmental divisions in each county, the per cent of the total, and the amount of the state tax of 1913 if it had been apportioned on the basis of these taxes representing roughly the expenditures. Thus Adams county was charged $59,726; under the proposed plan it would have paid $61,509. Douglas was charged $354,794; under the proposed plan it would have paid $601,862. York was charged $70,803; under the pro - posed plan it would have paid only $49,158. A Feasible Plan of Separation. -If deemed desirable to adopt a plan of separation it could be accomplished by diverting to the state's use the following taxes: Those arising from the </seg>
            <seg id="p160">156 express, Pullman, telegraph, insurance and the railroad com - panies, and from the proposed flat rate on intangibles. We recommend for reasons set forth in discussing the taxation of the first four classes of corporations that the revenue derived from them in any case be turned into the state treasury. As pointed out above there are ample grounds in the nature of the railroad taxes for turning them into the state treasury and we are de - terred from recommending it only because of the disturbance it would create in th? financ3s of many local governments. There seems no especial reason for turning the proposed tax on intangi - bles to the use of the state except that more revenue is needed and that this tax would probably supply it. </seg>
            <seg id="p161">Problems of Administration 157 CHAPTER VIII PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATION Conditions Prior to 1903. The revision of the revenue law in 1903 was confined chiefly to improvements in admini tion. The most important change made at that time was the creation of the office of county assessor. Previously tents had been made by a precinct, township, city or village ass* as the case might be. These officers were elected annually and were empowered to appoint deputies to assist in the work. The experience under this plan was not different from that in other states having widely decentralized authority in assessment. Each assessor was in a very real way a law unto himself. He was formally responsible, it is true, to local boards of review, but practically he exercised authority with a free hand. The result was too often effective brow-beating by the strong tax-payer, a weak yielding on the part of the assessor to political and personal influences, under-valuation, evasion, and on the whole an intoler - able inequality in the assessments. Under such a system one in - competent or wilfully unfair assessor could debase not only his own assessment but that of the whole county. His action it is true was not final. In counties having township organization the town board and the assessor sitting as a board of review had power to raise and lower assessments, and thus served as a check upon carelessness and dishonesty, and the county board could hear appeals from the town board, and in counties under the supervisor system take up original complaints; but in sp'n these boards of review the assessor did his work with practically a free hand. The Reform of 1903; the County Assessor System. t legislature of 1903 seems to have been irriressed with the now generally recognized, that unless the origiral asac— is fairly made, inequality in bearing the tax Lurden ■ in. As one commission has said: "The germ of inequitable ion finds its origin in the local assessment. Every sub - snt step in its progress to a completed tax roll nourish* - ish growth until it develops into a widespread diseast </seg>
            <seg id="p162">158 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission ing the whole system of taxation." To depend upon equaliza - tion as a remedy for a poor assessment, except in a few cases, is to lean on a broken reed. The great reform of 1903 was in the direction of improving the original assessment. The county assessor was made the responsible supervisor of assessments for the whole county. The county board determined the number of assistants needed, and these with the consent of the county board were appointed by the county assessor as his "deputies" and held office at his pleasure. The work of the deputies was made subject to the supervision and direction of the assessor. It was his duty to require uniformity in valuations; to examine the schedules and the rolls to see that they were correct; to alter assessments made by deputies so that they should "conform to law." He was also required to examine the records in the various county offices for information that would lead to the proper listing of mortgages, liens, judgments, and other property of those under guardianship. The State Board of Equalization. — Important changes were made in the State Board of Equalization. It had been com - posed of the governor, auditor of public accounts, and treasurer. It was enlarged by adding to it the secretary of state and the commissioner of public lands and buildings and provision was for the first time made for a paid secretary. The new law changed the name of the board to its present form — the "State Board of Equalization of Assessment." Its work of equalization was made more effective. Prior to 1903 equalization could be effected only "by varying the rate of taxation on the different counties" in case valuations had not been made "with reasonable uni - formity." The new law required equalization by the more direct method of changing the valuations, but this could be done only by raising or lowering the whole valuation of the county. This crude arrangement was modified in 1905 by giving the power to raise or lower the values of particular kinds of property. The authority of the Board was somewhat increased in the matter of assessments. The method of valuing railroad and car companies was more fully specified and the information to be given by the companies was required in greater detail with the purpose apparently of reaching intangible values. Larger super - visory power was given over the revenue system. The Board is </seg>
            <seg id="p163">The State Board of Equalization 159 Eed to "provide a uniform method of keeping all books relat - taxation in the several counties of the state. It shall formu - nd send to the county clerk of each county all necessary to be used in the listing, assessment and return of property, i the levy and collection of taxes. It .shall have general ion and control of the county assessors in the performance ir duties, and shall direct the same." The county asawor cifically required to obey the instructions sent out by the board. Here was a sufficient grant of authority, it would seem, for an aggressive board to exercise a powerful control over the ma - chinery of assessment. But the board from its composition could hardly be expected to be aggressive, and where it has shown such a spirit the courts and the legislature have placed a check upon it. Thus in 1906 the board ordered a county assessor to place on the rolls certain property which had been omitted. The order was obeyed, but the county board of equalization, upon hearing, removed the property, whereupon the governor asked the supreme court to issue an order for its restoration to the assessment roll. The court held that the board was not an assessing body, that it had nothing to do with individual assess - ments directly and that it could not "direct the county assessor as to what valuation he shall put upon property and so accom - plish indirectly what the board cannot do directly." State r. The law requires the board to equalize the assessments as between counties so "as to make the same conform to law and for that purpose shall have the power to increase or decrease the assessed valuation of any county." The supreme court held in 1904 that while the board could raise the assessment of any county as an incident to equalization, it cculd not raise the valuations for the purpose of increasing the aggregate assessment. Hacker v. Hcwe, 73 Neb., 385. In 1S09, after a period of political agitation over the matter, the legislature unfortunately amended the law by forbidding the board, in a half-hearted way, to increase the aggregate assessment beyond the amount returned by the county assessors, unless it shall appear "that a just, equitable and legal assessment cannot otherwise be made." The purpose of the amendment was to place a check upon the Board, though </seg>
            <seg id="p164">160 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission the way still lies open for it to do within the law, practically all it could before the amendment was adopted. Effect of the Act of 1903.— Here for the first time in 1903 was provided a tolerably effective organization for making an assessment. How efficient it was is shown by the returns for 1904, the first year the new law was in operation. The old law had required assessments to be made at the full value of the property. In 1903, the last year under the old order the assessed valuation for the state was $188,458,379. While the new law provided that property should be assessed at 20 per cent of its "actual value," the grand assessment roll in 1904 amounted to $294, 779,245, showing an "actual value" of $1,273,896,225. The •Messed value of railroad property was raised in the first year from $27,284,946 on a supposed full valuation, to $46,082,853 on a one-fifth valuation. The grand assessment roll has continued to increase during the past decade, though probably not as fast as wealth has increased till it stood in 1913 at $470,690,414 represent - ing an "actual value" of $2,353,452,070. What has been accom - plished by way of equalizing the tax burden cannot of course be Devitalization of the Law; the County Assessor. Eg the decade the law has been in force the tendency in leg - n has been to weaken rather than strengthen the administra- The office of county assessor has been attacked in a variety 1. The legislature of 1909 took the backward step of making the local assessors elective once more. They are no longer "deputies" but "precinct assessors," elected for a term of two years, and ineligible to serve more than two terms in succession. Admitting for the moment that as good men are secured by elec - tion as by appointment, there is yet this to be said against elec - tive assessors: (1) They are subject to "local influence" to a greater extent than appointed officers, and (2) are less amenable to a central authority. The legislature of 1911 corrected the evil in some degree by providing that in counties having cities of more than 4,000 population the people of such cities shall elect on a general ticket the number of assessors decided upon by the county board and the county assessor to be necessary, and that they shall be assigned by the county assessor to their respective </seg>
            <seg id="p165">Effect of the Act of mn.i 161 districts. At the session of 1913 the original provision for the appointment of deputies by the county assessor was restored in cities of over 4,000 population. 2. The legislature of 1909 crippled the authority of the county assessor in another way. The deputies had, prior to 1909, been required to turn in their personal property schedules as fast as made out and these were entered upon the roll by the county assessor. This gave the assessor the means of real super - vision intended by the law; but an amendment in 1909 per - mitted the local assessor to make up the roll and keep it and all schedules in his possession till the assessments were all made. This left no possibility for supervision or even for a proper inspection of the books before they had to be turned over to the county board of equalization. This destructive provision was modified in 1911 and the law now requires the precinct assessor to turn in his schedules "from time to time" to the county assessor who is to make up the books in his office. The times for returning schedules, however, is still discretionary with the precinct assessor. 3. The legislature of 1911 made another breach in the county assessor system by giving the voters of any county the option at any general election of turning the duties of assessor over to the county clerk. Thus far twelve counties have dis - pensed with the office and it seems quite likely, unless checked, that other counties will do the same. As far as the movement to supplant the county assessor grows out of a demand for true economy it is worthy of commendation. Indeed, there is much to say in favor of combining all those functions of a financial character in one county finance officer. Such a consolidation of county officers would go far toward promoting order in the county finances. It would make possible the choice of a finance officer of large experience, ensure the better utilization of the clerical force in the county offices, and probably a more econom - ical administration. But we do not think the change authorized by the amend - ment of 1911 has been in the interest of economy. We have not been able to secure complete information as to the saving effected in the counties which have made the change and the fact that the change was in most cases made in 1911 or 1912, thus involving 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p166">162 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission the year when real estate was assessed, introduces a disturbing fac - tor. On their face, however, the figures for the counties for which we have full returns show a saving ranging from $91.00 to $896, and the average saving for these counties was $373.00 a year. The average number of precinct assessors in the counties report - ing was sixteen. It would be in the interest of true economy and efficiency to dispense with the precinct assessors and let the county assessor make the valuations. In a Missouri county of 35,000 population where 10,000 personal schedules are required and 17000 parcels of real estate are assessed, representing property worth $38,000,000, a county assessor made the assessment in 1914 with the aid of one field assistant and two clerks, the latter employed for two months only. Under a true county assessor system the wholly inadequate per diem now paid to precinct assessors could be turned toward the payment of an officer who would be at his task throughout the year. Thus far we have assumed that the county clerk could supervise assessments as well as an assessor. This will rarely be the case. The theory upon which the office of county assessor rests is that it will by its greater efficiency in getting property on the schedule and securing its proper valuation pay for its upkeep. In many cases this is done many times over. One office which took especial care to make a complete assessment in 1914 found enough property after the books had been sent to the county board to yield taxes more than sufficient to pay the total annual expense of the office. This kind of work is hardly to be expected of a county clerk, usually absorbed in the duties of his own office. It seems clear, therefore, that much of the hostility to the county assessor system has not had the desire for economy or efficiency for its motive. In many quarters it is opposed because it is too efficient, because of its power to hold precinct assessors to the performance of their duties. We cannot, therefore, but regard the law permitting the abolition of the office of county assessor as a backward step. True reform of administration lies in restoring the office and strengthening it. Recommendations. — The law of 1903 created the office of supervisor of assessments rather than that of county assessor. We recommend that he be made assessor in fact as well as in name of all the property subject to local taxation except such forms as are assessed by the state board or the proposed tax </seg>
            <seg id="p167">Recommendations 163 commission. We believe that it would be in the interest of good administration to have the office filled by appointment rather than by election, the assessor to serve without limit of term, but subject to removal for cause. The position is a purely administrative one, and ought to be removed as far as possible from political influence. There is no more reason that the people of the county should elect the county assessor than that the people of a city should elect the city engineer. We recognize, however, the deep-seated popular prejudice that exists against giving up the right of election, and recommend that the office be filled as now by election for a term of four years; that the assessor be authorized to appoint such deputies as may be required ; that such assessments as are made by the deputies shall be made in the name of the assessor and subject to change by him. The county assessor should be subject to removal for cause by the county board, and also by the state tax commission. If the county assesor makes his valua - tion of real property in accordance with modern practices and is diligent in collecting data which will assist him in making a proper personal assessment, there need be no objection to the office on the ground that it has no duties except during two months in the year when the schedules are being made up. There will be sufficient employment throughout the year Central Control of Local Assessments in Other States. This recommendation stops short of what is being done in states where a serious effort is being made to secure efficient machinery of assessment. Bills have been introduced in the legislatures of Kansas and Minnesota for making the county assessor appointive by a central authority. In Ohio this has been accomplished. By an act of 1913 each county was made an assessment district. In counties of less than 65,000 population one "deputy state tax commissioner" to be known as the district assessor is appointed by the governor, to serve without term, but subject to removal by the state tax commission, with the consent of the governor. In the larger counties two such district assessors are appointed. The district assessor has power to appoint such number of deputies and assistants as may be prescribed by the State Tax Commis - sion, and in his name all assessments are made. The old system of equalization by a county board elected for other purposes and </seg>
            <seg id="p168">164 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission Ijed with other duties is abolished and a "Board of Com - ts," composed of three members, is appointed annually by tate Tax Commission with the consent of the governor, to complaints and review assessments. This board has power crease or decrease valuations on complaint or on its own itive, but appeal may be taken from its decisions to the state Commission. The commission prescribes all forms used by listrict assessor and the Board of Complaints and their work bject to its supervision at every turn. In Wisconsin the old elective assessor system has been abolished and the duties formerly performed by them are now per - formed by the state Tax Commission or by the income-tax asses - sors appointed by it. In view of these developments the recom - mendations we make for strengthening the office of county assessor must be regarded as very moderate. A Permanent Tax Commission Since 1900 the number of states having a permanent tax commissioner or a board of commissioners charged with the duty of administering the tax laws and studying their operation has increased from half a dozen till now more than half the states have such a body. So remarkable a change in all sections of the country must be due to some common cause. We have no doubt that this cause is found in the increasing tax burden of which complaint is well nigh universal, and in the desire to find some way of adjusting that burden so as to distribute its weight more equitably. The old boards of equalization, which the new boards are superseding, had very limited powers and these were exercised by men brought together temporarily for that purpose, often withdrawn for the time being from other public duties to perform a service for which they had no special fitness. These old boards, of which our own is an example, no longer meet the demands of efficient administration. Moreover it has come to be recognized that the most vital part of the taxing machinery is that which has to do with the original assessments and that to secure equity in them effective centralized control is necessary. We have become thoroughly convinced that no important improvement in the tax system of this state can be made without </seg>
            <seg id="p169">165 providing for a permanent tax commission. There are three main functions for such a commission: I. To Assess Directly a Number of Classes of Prop - erty for Valuing which the Local Assessors Have Insifficient Information. For many years the need of a central body to value railroad property has been recognized in this state as elsewhere. But there is equal need for assessing telegraph, telephone and express companies also on the unit plan. In fact, all public service corporations should be valued by a state board even though the operations of such corporations all lie within one taxing juris - diction. The acurate valuation of such property requires skill and special knowledge which the county assessor's office does not possess. The same may be said of bank shares. The constitution requires them to be assessed according to their value and this value depends on a variety of conditions which can be best dealt with by a central body, not only because of wider knowledge and experience, but because the banks will the more willingly disclose the data necessary for making an accurate valuation to a state, than to a local officer. Again, if we are to reach the intangible values of corporations, it must be reached through a state board. Likewise if our recommendation for a central administration of the inheritance tax is acted upon favorably a state board will be the natural authority to administer it, and if we are to look forward to the enactment of an income tax law, a eommi must be provided for to administer it. III. In the Second Place a State Board is Needed to srvise the Assessment of all Property Assessed Local - ndto Equalize the Assessments as Between Countik annot be too strongly urged that the beginning of tax ■ms lie in improving the original assessment. We believe the changes proposed in the powers of the county assessor prove strongly conducive to that end. Relieve that officer i the necessity of attempting impossible tasks, such as finding igibles subject to confiscatory rates and assessing the value anchises; then make him the responsible assessing officer of county with power not only to supervise the work of his ities, but also to substitute his own valuations for theirs, a great stride in advance will have been made. The law now prizes the need of equalizing valuations among the ninety- </seg>
            <seg id="p170">166 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission three counties of the state, but it makes no provision for effective supervision of the assessments as they are being made. State super - vision over the counties is as essential as county supervision is over local assessors. There is no way of securing equality among different counties and as between different classes of property, except through central control. Take the assessment of real estate, by far the most important item in the grand assessment roll, as an example of the inequalities that exist after equalization by both the county and the state boards. The tables (p. 64) show great undervaluation and at very unequal rates in different counties. Suppose each county assessor to have adequate power to keep up the valuations in his county, he is not likely to do so unless he is certain the same will be done in other counties. At present he is left to guess on the rate at which other assessors will undervalue. Thus in 1914, officials from certain counties who appeared before the State Board of Equalization and Asses - ment, clearly showed that they had assumed the State Board's functions in equalizing. It should be one of the important functions of a permanent tax commission to collect accurate information on the subject of relative values to guide the assessors and aid it in its work as an equalizing board. Such information would be supplied by complete compilations of sales in all parts of the state, the records of the probate courts, the maps of the topographical and soil surveys, as fast as completed, and from such other sources as the board could utilize. The board's duty should not stop with supplying information. It should have the power to supervise the assessment. We have discussed elsewhere in this report the various devices coming into use for aiding in making an accurate assessment, such as land maps, tax maps, the use of transfer records, publicity of assessments, and the utilization of expert knowledge in the community in establishing unit values. These are aids which cannot safely be prescribed by law. They are of the nature of office methods, details of admin - istration and the only practicable way of securing their general use is through regulations established and enforced by some common authority. I The present Board of Equalization and Assessment was not ;ned for such work. It has not the accurate information ed for an aggressive policy in using the power it clearly has. limited in its authority to raise the total assessment beyond </seg>
            <seg id="p171">• of Tax Commission 167 the aggregate fixed by the county assessors. In equalizing, there - fore, it must frequently reduce the value of items in counties where they are admittedly listed at only a fraction of their true value. In this way the board is crippled in the assessment of property lying wholly within its jurisdiction. Year after year the repre - sentatives of the railways appear before the board and argue that the board should violate their oath of office by reducing the true value found for the railway property of the state to conform to the under- valuation of real property in counties through which the railways pass. In Wisconsin when the state tax commission undertook to value railway property, it met the same situation, and it was found necessary in order that equality might be pre - served between railway and other property, to secure the right to make its own valuations of property throughout the state. The need of a central supervision over the assessment of all property in this state is no less imperative. III. A Permanent Tax Commission is Needed to Study the Operation of the Revenue Laws and to Give Publicity to the Results of Tax Legislation.— There is at present no adequate provision for collecting infor - mation about the yield of the revenue system. For a classi - fication of the revenues of the state and local governments, the Commission has had to rely upon United States Census figures now a dozen years old. If one wants to know the yield of the railroad taxes, he must again rely upon statistics supplied by the federal government or upon the railways. No one knows what taxes are paid in the state by the express companies, or the in - surance companies, or the banks. The only way to find the yield of the inheritance tax is to write to each county treasurer for the information. Until recently it was no one's duty to ascertain the amount of ad valorem taxes levied in the state or to compute the average rate of taxation. These are items of information every citizen has a right to have made available for him. This is in line with a resolution adopted by the National Tax Associa - tion in "that provision should be made by every state for the col - lection and publication of statistics of assessment, taxes and other public revenue." ■ There is obvious need of a permanent board also to study operation of the revenue law and recommend such modifica - s as experience suggests. Experiments outside the state are </seg>
            <seg id="p172">168 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission Intly being made, worthy of careful investigation and an ise literature is springing up which requires consideration hose who direct the revenue policy of the state. The office tax commission should be a clearing-house for all sorts srmation not only about our own revenue system, but the systems of other states and countries. Recommendations. — Our conclusion, therefore, is that a permanent tax commission should be created with large powers. Such a commission should be created whether the tax amendment is adopted or not. Strong central supervision is needed, if for no other reason, to formulate and enforce rules and regulations for the assessment of the real estate of the commonwealth. This item alone now amounts to more than $2,000,000,000. It is assessed in the most erratic and unequal way. Personal property taxes may in time be swept away, but the land taxes will con - tinue and probably become of increasing importance. It is high time the valuation of this property should be made with as near an approach to scientific accuracy as possible. The most direct path to that end is through the creation of effective centralized administrative control. The Form of the Commission. Twenty-seven states now have permanent tax commissions. Of these, six, mostly in New England, have the single commissioner system, 1 three are com - posed of five members, part of whom are ex-officio members, and seventeen consist of three members, usually appointed by the governor for a term of six or eight years. The best commissions are placed in a position of independence and are freed as far as possible from political influence. Their work is in no sense political. It is purely administrative and judicial in character. Their function is to execute the laws made by the legislature. If the constitution permitted the creation of such a commis - sion, we should have no hesitation in recommending one com - posed of three members appointed by the governor for a term of I 1 The single commissioner system is found in Connecticut, Massachusetts, yland, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming; the five member com - ions are in Indiana, New Jersey and Oregon; those having three members in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, nesota, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, i, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. </seg>
            <seg id="p173">169 six years, and clothed with large powers. But the constitution, after establishing certain state officers, provides as follows: "No other executive state officer shall be continued or created, and the duties now devolving upon officers not provided for by this constitution shall be perforrred by the officers herein 6 Under these restrictions it is probable that the legislature ; be confined to a choice of plans all of which are more or less ;tionable. 1. It has been suggested that the powers of the State Board of Equalization be enlarged so as to give it the authority of the modern tax commission. We believe that such a plan would be fatal to any real progress in tax reform. The members of that board are political officers, chosen for short terms, and with little or no regard to their interest in matters of taxation. A board so constituted, however high the merits of the individuals com - posing it, cannot be expected to acquire that intimate knowledge of the problems of taxation demanded of a tax commission. The real work of such a body would of necessity have to be done by subordinates not directly accountable to the people. The board it - self under the conditions could not be held responsible for the acts of its subordinates; and even if it could that responsibility would be so divided as to be of little value as a means of control. 2. Under the circumstances we recommend the general form of commission provided for in House Roll No. 602 of the session of 1911. This bill provided for the creation of a tax com - mission to be composed of the governor with the title of Tax Commissioner, a deputy commissioner and two assistants. This plan should be modified by providing for three deputy coirrris - sioners of equal rank. They should be appointed for terms of six years and made removable only for cause, thus ensuring permanence in the membership. This would tend to center responsibility upon the governor and would work in admirably with the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Legislative Procedure for imposing upon the governor the duty of preparing and placing before the legislature the estimates of expenditures and income for the state government. The powers of such a commission should be as broad and plenary as those of the strong </seg>
            <seg id="p174">170 I The active members on such a commission should be selected heir special fitness for the particular duties which would de - b upon them. They should give their full time to the work e commission and should not be hampered with other official S3 or connected with other branches of the public service. 1 should be men of such standing that they may assume all •esponsibility which would naturally go with the position of nissioners forming an independent board. The Expense. — The maintenance of a commission will involve some additional expense; just how much will depend upon the nature of the work assigned to it. The appropriations for the Minnesota commission are from $30,000 to $35,000 a year. The expenses of the Ohio commission in 1912 amounted to $59,000 and on account of an increase of duties it asked for $71,000 for the next year. The Kansas commission requires $16,700 per year, and North Dakota $23,000. The Wisconsin commission cost $25,500 in 1903, double that amount by 1911 and since the passage of the income tax law, the cost has risen to more than $150,000 a year. It is probable that an initial appropriation of $20,000 would be required for a commission in Nebraska and as the duties of the board is increased this would have to be increased to perhaps $35,000 or $40,000 a year. A considerable part of this could be saved by abolishing the State Board of Equalization and turning the sums appropriated for its use to the use of the Commission, and by placing the administration of the corporation tax in the hands of the com - mission and dispensing with the clerical force in the office of the Secretary of State now employed in administering the corpora - tion occupation tax. But the expense of a commission that properly performs its functions will be paid many times over by securing the proper assessment of property which would other - wise escape taxation. This does not mean that the purpose of a tax commission is to increase taxes. The amount of taxes is determined by the legislative bodies authorizing expenditures. The assessing machinery, of which the Commission would be a part has only to do with enforcing the rules for apportioning the burden of taxes among those who have to pay them. We believe that no truer economy could be practiced by the state than in </seg>
            <seg id="p175">Income Taxation 171 CHAPTER IX INCOME TAXATION Growing Interest in Income Taxation. -The successful operation of the income tax in European countries for many years has long attracted the attention of students of taxation in the United States. England has had an income tax in continuous operation since 1842 which now yields one hundred eighty or one hundred ninety million dollars annually, or nearly one quarter of the imperial revenue, and more than a quarter of the tax reve - nue. Italy, Austria, and nearly all the German states make use of this method of taxation. The federal government resorted to it during the Civil War, was kept from employing it in 1894 only by a supreme court decision declaring the tax a direct one, and since the adoption of the sixteenth amendment, has once more made it a part of the federal revenue system. Moreover about twenty states at one time or another have levied taxes on incomes though generally with such poor success that till recently it has been generally discountenanced as a state tax. In the hearings before the Commission it has had numerous advocates as a part of the Nebraska revenue system. There seems to be a very general sentiment in favor of an income tax. Why an Income Tax is Desirable. — The merits of the income tax are unquestioned. Among peoples well advanced industrially it is an essential aid in bringing about an equitable apportionment of the tax burden. (1) As a test of ability it is a fairer basis than the value of property upon which the property tax rests for the reasons pointed out elsewhere that all kinds of property are not equally productive and not equally indicative of the ability of the citizen to pay taxes. (2) In the second place it is needed to reach that considerable class of persons in each community who enjoy an income out of all proportion to the property owned. And in the third place it is desirable as a sub - stitute for the troublesome personal property tax. That no greater progress has been made with this form of taxation in the American states is not due to any defect in the </seg>
            <seg id="p176">172 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission theory of the tax but to the practical difficulties inherent in its administration and to defects in administrative machinery that that can be removed. As before stated a score of states have had experience with this form of tax with such uniformly poor success that it had become axiomatic in discussions of fiscal policy that it was an impossible tax for the states to administer. Only the long arm of the federal government could be relied upon to reach reluctant taxpayers. In 1911 the state of Wisconsin after long consideration of the measure passed an income tax law that has to all appearances worked successfully. That experience en - courages the confident belief that other states may, by providing adequate administrative machinery and manning it with the right kind of officers, also adopt this highly desirable form of tax. We present herewith the main features of the Wisconsin law. The law applies to all residents of the state and to non - residents deriving an income from sources having a situs within the state. The general rule is followed in determining taxable income, that income from property which is taxable at its situs also follows the situs of the property, and income derived from property taxable at the domicile of the owner also follows the residence of the recipient of the income. Thus a resident is not taxable on income from rents or royalties arising in another state, but he is taxable on that derived from securities regardless of their origin; while rents and royalties arising in Wisconsin are taxable to non-residents. t Exemptions and Deductions. In the case of single per - an exemption of $800 is allowed ; in case of husband and wife K) is exempt ; and for each child under eighteen years of age other dependent persons, an additional exemption of $200 lowed. Individuals are allowed deductions from their gross nes, such as necessary expenses paid, losses and deprecia - interest on indebtedness, pensions received from the United », certain taxes, inheritances in case a tax thereon has been to the state, and life insurance up to $10,000. I Corporations are not allowed any exemption, but their net ne is determined in much the same way as that of individuals. [Ould be said by the way that the railroads and other public ce corporations and the insurance companies do not come r the income tax law. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">173 Rates. — The rates are progressive. For individuals they begin at 1 per cent on the first $1,000 of taxable income and gradually increase on each $1,000 up to and including the 13th which taxes a 6 per cent rate and the same rate applies to addi- IThe rate for the corporations starts at 2 per cent and rises nore abrupt grades to 6 per cent on the 7th thousand of ble income. The original law had a complicated system of » based on the dividends paid, a plan that no doubt has retical justification, but, because of practical difficulties, was i up in 1913 for the simple scale described above. Administration of the Law. Xo part of the law was worked out with more painstaking care than the administrative provisions. It was at this point that other states had failed in such legislation and it was fully realized that failure would come to the Wisconsin law unless it should provide carefully designed machinery for its enforcement. The state was fortunate in having an efficient commission with strong powers, some of the members of which had served continuously since its organization in 1901. To this commission, and not to local authorities, was entrusted the enforcement of the law. The sixty-nine counties of the state are divided into forty-one districts and an income tax assessor is appointed for each district by the tax commission for a term of three years. These assessors must be residents of the state but not necessarily of the district where they serve, and they may be transferred or removed by the commission. The income tax assessors assess individuals, the commission the corporations. An appeal lies from the assessors to a Board of Review composed of three members appointed by the tax commission in each county, and from that body to the tax commission. Adequate penalties are provided for neglect to make returns and for making false returns, both for individuals and corporations. The old office of county supervisor of assessment is abolished and the duties of that office devolve upon the appointive income tax assessors. Personal Property Practically Exempted. The law specifically exempts certain kinds of property formerly taxed. Intangibles are exempt, farm and garden tools and machinery, household goods including musical instruments, and personal ornaments. Live stock, merchants and manufacturers' goods and wares still remain subject to taxation ; but it is provided that any </seg>
            <seg id="p178">174 person who has paid a tax assessed on his personal property may offset such tax against his income tax if one is charged against him. Thus one pays a tax on his personal property only in case he is not an income taxpayer. Operation of the Law. The details of the operation of this law are not yet published except for the first year. The results for the first year were better than had been predicted. The yield was larger than had been expected. The total income tax charged was $3,500,000. But offsets allowed for personal property taxes paid and for other reasons were expected to amount to 35 or 40 per cent of this amount leaving about $2,200, - 000 as the revenue from the income tax. This is more than double the tax secured in 1911 from the personal property exempted under the new law. The tax charged in 1913 was $4,091,000 from which offsets will be allowed as indicated above. We have no data as to actual collections but it is understood that some large amounts have been withheld pending litigation. There can, however, be no doubt of the success of the law from the point of view of securing a revenue. The law has proven essentially an urban tax. In the first year over 40 per cent of the entire tax was charged in Milwaukee county and more than 80 per cent in the seventeen counties having the larger cities of the state, while 20 per cent was charged in the remaining 54 counties containing about 50 per cent of the population. The urban character of the tax is shown in another way by the returns from Dane county in which the capital is located. In the county there are six times as many farmers as there are public employees "yet only sixty-eight farmers in Dane county as contrasted with six hundred twenty-four public em - ployees and professors will pay an income tax; and the farmers will pay an income tax of $877.35, while the public officials, pro - fessors and teachers will pay $7,224.44, more than eight times as much." IThe tax seems to have reached the corporations effectively, relative assessment of corporations is shown in the following 1912 1913 B charged against corporation $2,392,454 $2,793,605 charged against individuals and firms . 1,108,707 1,297,484 $3,501,161 $4,091,089 </seg>
            <seg id="p179">175 I The average rate levied on corporations was 5.4 per cent ; the age for individuals and firms was slightly less than 2 per cent, notable that out of the 2,333,000 population of the state 46,582 were assessed and a considerable number of these doubt - offset the whole of their income tax with personal property tax ipts. In Milwaukee county forty persons in the one thousand 1 assessed; in Dane county thirty-six; while in more than a dozen less than five persons per thousand of population were ised. The average for the state in 1912 was 19.96 per thous - of the population ; that is, slightly less than 2 per cent of the ilation got upon the personal income tax list. K Distribution of the Tax. The state retains 10 per cent e proceeds of the tax, 20 per cent goes to the county, and 70 ent to the local district in which collected. Of the estimated 'ield of $2,200,000 for 1912: The share of the state would be $220,000 The share of the counties would be 440,000 The share of the towns, cities and villages . . . 1,540,000 $2,200,000 Is the Income Tax Inquisitorial? This question is frankly discussed by the Wisconsin Commission's Report for 1912. It says: "No tax measured by ability to pay can be administered without asking searching questions. The more thoroughly these questions are asked the more certain honest people can be that the tax dodgers are paying their fair share. If taxation is con - fined to visible things alone, the assessor can get along without asking questions; but such procedure would exempt from taxa - tion many of the wealthiest and ablest members of the com - munity. When an assessor is trying to ascertain a man's income or the value of his personal property, he must ask either the man himself or the man's neighbors. The second method is obnoxious. The open way is to put the taxpayer himself on record. This procedure is the honest man's only protection against the tax dodger. The old personal property tax would have been much more inquisitorial than the income tax if it had been enforced. It failed largely because questions were not asked; and its failure resulted in great financial burdens being shifted from the shoulders of certain classes of the community onto the shoulders of other classes far less able to bear them. The income tax will be a farce if </seg>
            <seg id="p180">176 Another objection to an income tax has always been that it requires taxpayers to reveal information hurtful to their business interests. This objection is held to be unfounded. Nothing is revealed by the records not already known to the credit agencies and to the business world. "A man's taxable income and the tax thereon are matters of public record, but that is all. Nothing is known of his exemptions, or his untaxable income, or of his income derived from business transacted without the state, or of his income derived from stocks and bonds taxed directly to the corporations from which received." Does the Federal Law Preclude a State Tax on Income? —It has been held by some citizens appearing before the Com - mission that since Congress has now entered the fidd of income raxarion, the states will be precluded from entering it. We do not think so. It has been a mooted question whether the states or the federal government have greater natural advantages in the administration of such a law. Under equally efficient admin - istration the advantages probably lie with the states, and there is no reason why the state should not have as good machinery and as efficient officers as the federal government if they want them. The high exemption now allowed under the federal law, $3,000 or $4,000 according to marital condition, leaves room in an agricul - tural state like Nebraska for the operation of an income tax. Information is not available as to the number of income tax - payers in the state under the federal law. But the Preliminary Report of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the fiscal year ending July 30, 1914, shows that for the ten months for which the federal tax was charged the corporations of Nebraska paid $168,084.27 and individuals paid $76,857.75, a total of $244,942.02. This is the equivalent of an annual tax of $293,930. - 40. Some indication of what could be expected from a state in - come tax can be gained by comparing the federal tax collected in Wisconsin and the state income tax. The receipts of the federal tax reduced to an annual basis were $862,114 as against $3,501,000 assessed in 1912 under the state law, and $2,200,000 estimated net yield, after deduction of personal property taxes, etc. If the same relations between the federal and state yield as here indicated should prevail in Nebraska a revenue of something </seg>
            <seg id="p181">177 ■lind, however, that the federal figures show actual receipts, the Wisconsin figures show only the tax assessed. Conclusions and Recommendations. While believing thoroughly in the principles of the income tax and that such a tax should in time be made a part of the revenue system of braska, this Commission recommends that no law for taxing in - comes be enacted by the legislature of 1915. While the law in Wisconsin has proven a notable success, many obstacles have had to be met and they are by no means all overcome. The first year's experience led to many important amendments in 1913 and others will doubtless be found necessary by the next legisla - ture. The success that has been attained in that state has due to the highly efficient administration of the law. This efficiency could not have been secured but for the centralized ad - ministration provided by law. A similar law could of cour - readily enacted in Nebraska and probably must be before a cess can be attained in taxing incomes; but the passing of a law is not enough. The chief factor in the success of Wisconsin has been the way in which the taxing machinery has been manned. The commission itself has been in existence for fourteen and has long had the confidence of the people of the state n that the large powers of appointment and supervision asked f&lt;,r in 1911 could be granted in the confident belief that they would be used only in the public interest. The commission which w be charged with the administration of the law gave several to the study of every detail of the statute which it was to ad - minister. In our opinion it would be unwise for Nebraska to undertake so delicate a task as that of administering an income tax law without going through some such period of preparation for it as Wisconsin has gone through. If it is not understood from t v e beginning that it will be fairly and fully administered by capable officials, an income tax would become as lamentable a failure as the taxation of intangible property it is intended to supersede. Until the state has built up an efficient central control through a permanent commission and that commission by its integrity and its efficiency has established itself in the confidence of the people, action looking to an income tax ought to be deferred. </seg>
            <seg id="p182">Report of Nebraska Tax Commission 178 CHAPTER X THE INHERITANCE TAX LAW In January, 1897, Governor Silas A. Holcomb recommended in his message to the legislature the passage of an inheritance tax law, but it was not until 1901 that the law was finally enacted. It has become an established feature of our revenue system. This law was adopted and worked over from the Illinois law, which at that time had the advantage of having been construed and upheld not only by the Supreme Court of Illinois, but also by the Supreme Court of the United States (170 U. S. 283). Our law has always been regarded as founded upon a solid constitutional basis for the reason that prior to its enactment the Supreme Court of the United States had upheld the Illinois law as con - stitutional legislation, had established the right of classification and gradation and had placed the matter beyond argument as to it being an invasion of property rights by holding that an in - heritance tax is a tax upon the right of succession and not upon property itself. It must be conceded that inheritance taxes have come to stay so far as the great majority of states of the Union are concerned. Ross on "Inheritance Taxation," 1912 edition, cites complete statutes in thirty-nine of the states providing for taxes upon inheritances and it is not known that any state has repealed an inheritance tax law, except the state of Kansas, where by an oversight the law was repealed. There is ample assurance, however, that it will be reenacted in that state by the next legislature. It must therefore be conceded that the prin - ciple of the inheritance tax is now recognized by nearly all states of the Union as a valid exercise of the taxing power upon transmis - sion of property under and by virtue of the law itself from the dead to the living; for the general rule is that inheritance tax is not levied upon the property, but upon the succession and that the value of the property is merely used to determine the amount of the levy and that those receiving the property under and by virtue of the laws of succession in any state, should and ought to pay a tax upon the right or privilege conferred by law.

No considerable o] is found at this date to the inheritance tax and the public fully acquiescing In the operation of this law wherever it Ifl adopted in terms that are fair and specific, and when it bei • better understood, all opposition will disappear. Of course there are details to be considered, such for instance, as the exemption of the widow's estate or dower, the exemption of gifta made fo* charitable purposes, an exemption of a certain amount to direct lineal descendants, the levying of higher rates on collateral rela - tives or strangers than those imposed upon lineal descendants. and the graduation of the tax according to the value of the « But all of these matters have been covered quite satisfactorily by our statute in the state of Nebraska, and but few amendments have been made to the law since its adoption in 1901. These amendments relate principally to refunding the tax where debts are proved against the estate after the inheritance tax has been collected and for refunding taxes erroneously paid. In 1907 an amendment was made concerning the manner of ap - praisement, and also to the application and use of the money derived from inheritance taxes. As our law now stands. Section 19 of the Act provides: That all money collected from this tax shall be expended for the permanent improvement of the county roads and these roads must begin at the limit of a city or village and extend therefrom in directions most traveled by the public. Such roads shall be built by contract, under competitive bidding and it will be observed that the fund can therefore not be used for any road building within the corporate limits of any city or village. It would seem that this of itself was a discrimination against cities, towns and villages. I This is founded on the fact that many estates required to the inheritance tax have large amounts of property in cities, is and villages and yet under the present system, the tax is ied wholly outside such sub-divisions. It also is plain from table hereto appended of the collection of inheritance taxes, the amount derived from the tax is uncertain and that it ;uates so much from year to year as to make it a source of nue not to be depended upon for any specific amount or &gt;ose. Added to the state revenue each year, it would con- </seg>
            <seg id="p184">180 stitute a fairly regular amount large enough to be worthy of attention. We would, therefore, recommend a change in the law so that inheritance taxes shall be paid into the state treasury to become a portion of the general revenues of the state. This of course may be considered a move toward segregation of state revenues on specific lines, but it is plain that corporation occupa - tion taxes do more good, paid directly to the state, than they would if scattered about the counties of the state, and we may well consider the advisability of putting such irregular amounts de - rived therefrom, into one great common fund in the state treasury. So too, occupation taxes on certain lines of business could well be added to the state revenues. I In view of the legislation adopted by many states in recent s, it would also be wise to reduce the amount of exemption ved under the present law and thus increase the revenues linable from this tax. We recommend that Section 1 of the Titance Tax Law be so amended as to allow an exemption of 00 only to the widow, surviving husband, child, brother, r, father, mother, widow of the son or husband of the daugh - and that the exemption in favor of relatives of more remote ■ee should be correspondingly reduced, as for instance: So not more than $1,000 exemption should be allowed to those ng under the second class of beneficiaries and no exemption at i the case of those coming under the third class. The courts hold that the legal estate created by statute in favor of the widow is not subject to the inheritance tax, therefore a reduction of the exemption to $5,000 to each person is a sufficient exemption for even the widow of a decedent and a clear exemp - tion of $5,000 to each person seems to be a sufficient protection against want or poverty, while the inheritance of that sum of money or property is likewise a sufficient guarantee of the ability of the donee or devisee to pay a reasonable tax thereon. It is not believed that in an agricultural state like Nebraska, on our present level of values and prices, that this reduction in exemp - tions would work anv particular hardship. </seg>

We would recommend that the administrative machinery of the Inheritance Tax Law be strengthened so as to secure more accurate appraisals and to the end that no estate subject to the inheritance tax law would escape payment thereof, which seems to be quite easily accomplished at the present time, particularly if the amount and value of the estate is close to the line of demarca- tion. Many states are strengthening the administrative sections of their laws and obtaining large revenues thereby. California seems to have made great strides in that direction by cent legislation and it is believed that much could be accomplished in this state along that line. It is respectfully urged that the present statute concerning inheritance taxes be retained as far as possible and that changes be made thereto by way of amendment rather than by an entire new statute, on account of the value of the numerous court decisions upholding, construing and defining the present law. It </seg>
            <seg id="p186">182 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission would be a distinct loss to the state if an entirely new act were to be drafted and enacted and a constitutional question should after - ward invalidate it. The present law has been held constitutional (74 Neb., 675) and has been pretty thoroughly construed and defined by several decisions subsequent to the case above cited. It also has the added fortification of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States upholding the Illinois law, from which our statute is taken. Therefore caution should be observed in making any changes that may be proposed to this statute. The Illinois law has since been amended in some particulars, but is still much like ours, except that it allows a much larger exemp - tion to the widow, children, etc., and also that the tax is paid to the state treasurer, the county merely retaining 2 per cent allowed to the treasurer for his services in collecting and remitting the same, in addition to his salary or fees allowed him by law. The financial results of the inheritance tax law since 1905 are shown in the table printed below. Prior to that year the tax was collected by the counties and covered into the state treasury. In the first year one county collected $64,74, in the biennium ending November 30, 1904, seventeen counties collected $5,608.86. In 1905 the act was amended by providing for the use of the tax for local purposes as described above. Down to this time $4,240.48 in addition to the sums noted above was collected, making a total of $9,914.08 from 1901 to 1905. This sum was returned to the counties for local use. The receipts by counties since 1905 as reported to the Legislative Reference Bureau have been as shown in the table at the end of this chapter. We also subjoin a table showing the chief provisions of the inheritance tax laws of the several states, taken from State and Local Taxation, Volume VI. Summary. — The Act of 1901 was based on sound prin - ciples, but in the light of fourteen years of experience it needs amendment in important respects. We recommend that the exemption be reduced as indicated above, that the rates as in - dicated in classes two and three be increased and made pro - gressive according to the scale given; and for administrative reason, sand because the tax from its nature belongs to the state rather than the local governments, that the proceeds thereof be paid into the general fund of the state treasury. </seg>

            <seg id="p192">188 CHAPTER XI r OCCUPATION TAX ON MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS IN LIQUORS AND TOBACCOS One of the possibilities under the existing conditions of our state revenues would be an occupation tax imposed upon such occupations and businesses as would distribute a light and in - direct tax upon the purchasers and consumers of non-necessaries, such as intoxicating liquors, tobaccos, cigars and all forms of such products. I This sort of occupation tax which is closely akin in its nature license, is usually paid promptly and cheerfully by the er, distiller and retail seller, and it falls in small amounts i those who consume something which they may readily dis - e with if they do not choose to consume the article specially A reasonable occupation tax upon distillers, brewers, rec - tifiers and retail dealers would bring in a considerable revenue to the state and it would appear just from any standpoint of economics to lay a heavier burden upon these lines of business since the direct result of such business and traffic creates a heavy inroad on state revenues. The Commission is informed that there are at this time ap - proximately 2,272 federal retail liquor dealers' permits held by Nebraska dealers. There are also licenses held by brewers, dis - tillers and rectifiers of liquors and a vast army of dealers in to - bacco and cigars, all of whom should be required to contribute in some special way to the state for engaging in this particular line of business. The consumption of alcoholic liquors, according to the Report of the Committee of Fifty, 1899, is the principal cause of 25 per cent of poverty, 37 per cent of pauperism, 45.8 per cent of child destitution and abandonment and 50 per cent of all crimes. All of these require expenditures by the state, as well as the county and municipality, for poverty, crime and child destitution and abandonment reach out and claim the interest of the state as well as that of the locality. The consumption of alcoholic liquors, </seg>
            <seg id="p193">189 according to the report of Dr. Rosanoff of Clark University, 1909, causes 25 per cent of all insanity and at that date there were, according to his figures, 43,605 insane persons in the United States whose insanity was directly chargeable to alcoholic liquors. By the United States Government report pertaining to divi 1908, it is shown that 19.5 per cent of divorces are caused by the use of alcoholic liquors, and this is exclusive of decrees that were granted to wives for cruelty and non-support. With the above staggering indictment against the liquor business, we should not hesitate to say that the expense imposed on the state by this traffic is so enormous that these businesses, from the brewery and distillery down to the saloon and pharmacy, are not paying a fair proportion of taxes when measured against the other lines of industry in manufacturing and other retail sales I While the way is clear to tax occupations under the present titution, still the adoption of the Norton Amendment will ifically provide for the taxing of privileges and occupations, so long as Nebraska is a local option state where one com - ity can vote in the saloon while another votes it out, we see no jn why a revenue should not be exacted for state pur] will in some measure assist the state in caring for the insane, criminal, the destitute and the delinquent, who are made by reason of the liquor traffic. We therefore recommend ccupation tax upon the following proposed schedule, on these of business: Brewers, distillers and rectifiers $1,000 each per annum Wholesale liquor dealers, $500 per annum. Retail liquor dealers, $100 per annum. Drug stores and pharmacies having permits to sell intoxicat - ing liquors $50.00 per annum. Manufacturers of cigars and tobaccos, $100 per annum. Wholesale dealers in cigars and tobaccos, $50.00 per annum. Retail dealers in cigars and tobaccos, $25.00 per annum. In connection with the above schedule, we would suggest that the law be so framed as to imply nothing suggestive of a license or permit to transact such business, from the state, but that it be framed upon the theory that anyone engaging in such business must, after securing the local or municipal license required, pay to the state an occupation tax for the privilege of conducting </seg>
            <seg id="p194">190 this business. This would not interfere with local option in the least. Every municipality, city and village would still determine its own policy as to whether or not it desired to be "wet or dry," but if a certain town having voted "wet," granted license to a liquor dealer, then it would be necessary for the dealer to pay the occupation tax or be subject to a heavy penalty to be stipu - lated in the law. Elt is the belief of the Commission that this tax would be i with almost no expense or effort on the part of the state, as dealers engaging in these lines of business would be likely to nit the justness of a revenue accuring to the state, as well as to village, town, city and school district. </seg>
            <seg id="p195">Taxation of Grain Dealers 191 CHAPTER XII. THE TAXATION OF GRAIN DEALERS I The Present Method. -Prior to 1904 grain dealers were i as other merchants were upon the basis of the value of jroperty in their possession on the first of April. Because of requency with which elevator companies, sometimes doing a I business, returned for assessment only the value of the itor and equipment led the legislature in 1903 to inaugurate /t method of assessing dealers in grain. The plan was adopted sessing them on the basis of the "average amount of capital sted in such business for the preceding year." No rule was down for finding the "average capital," nor was it clear just t was to be included in the term. In 1906 a case came up to the supreme court from Lan« County involving the meaning of the term. The county assessor had added $10,000 to the schedule of a company on account of grain found on hand on assessment day. The company had contended that the grain on hand should not be included in the assessment of its tangible property since it was included in the "average capital" separately returned. The supreme court in its first decision took this view of the matter, holding that the purpose of the legislature was to distinguish between the capital which could easily be viewed by the assessor and that not easy to determine; that the distinction was clear, therefore, between the capital invested in the plant on the one hand and the working capital used in buying and selling on the other; and that the average amount of this working capital was what the assessor was required to find. Central Granaries Co. v. Lancaster county, 77 Neb., 311. On rehearing, a second decision was filed vacating the first, and confirming the decision of the district court which had upheld the county assessor in treating grain on hand as "tangible property" within the meaning of the section which required that "real estate and other tangible property shall be assessed separately" from the "average capital invested in the business for the preceding year." That is, all tangible property is to be treated as such in the ordinary meaning of the term, </seg>
            <seg id="p196">192 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission and to this is to be added any excess of "average capital" found to have been employed. It seems that this rule would work out about as follows: If the assessor finds that an average capital of $5,000 has been employed in the business and that cash and grain worth just that much are on hand on April 1st, the capital is just accounted for; if he finds $3,000 worth of grain he adds $2,000 to make up the average; and if he finds $6,000 worth of grain he then ignores the average capital entering the $6,000 worth of grain as tangible property. This is the practical inter - pretation of the law as left by the decision of 1907, by some assessors at least. To make a difficult section worse the legislature in 1909 amended it by inserting the declaration that "tangible property" shall not apply to or incude grain on hand, so that we now have this remarkable provision for the assessment of grain dealers, that they shall determine the "average amount of capital invested in such business for the pre - ceding year, and taxes shall be charged upon such average cap - ital the same as on other property. Real estate and all other tangible property shall be assessed separately. 'Tangible prop - erty' shall not apply to or include grain on hand. 'Average capital' shall include all grain purchased during the year whether the same has been sold or is still on hand at the time of assessment." Komplicate matters still further the attorney general, with - iving a formal opinion, later publicly expressed the opinion the amendment of 1909 has no force, and that the rule laid in 1907 still holds. Operation of the Law. — This section has caused trouble out of all proportion to its fiscal importance. Under the item "capital invested by grain brokers" only from $275,000 to $300,000 are placed on the assessment rolls, yet there is hardly a section of the revenue law that causes more friction and dis - satisfaction than the one under review. The practice of the assessors varies in the matter of including grain on hand in the tangible property; and, what is of more significance, in the rrethod of determining "average capital" employed. The assessors have been left to struggle with the problem and they have settled it in different ways. Before the case cited above reached the supreme court a plan had been evolved and generally adopted, of dividing the volume of business done in the year </seg>
            <seg id="p197">193 I me number representing the supposed frequency of turn- Thus an elevator may have handled 20,000 bushels of i at an average price of 80 cents, requiring an aggregate f of $16,000. Assuming that in doing this business the were turned ten times, an "average capital" of $1,600 I be required for the transaction. The difficulty with this method lies in determining the proper "divisor". If for example in the above case it is assumed that the turn-over is twenty times a year the "average capital" required would be but $800. The problem is, not to find the average turn-over for all elevators but for a given elevator in a given year. Letters from a large number of assessors show that they exercise wide discretion in the use of a divisor. Some do not concern themselves with finding average capital at all. Those who do, report the use of 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 36 and 313 as a "divi - sor." The assessor using the last number got $170,000 worth of business done with a working capital of $543. An accurate assessment would of course require the use of different divisors according to the business methods of the elevator company. One which habitually makes frequent shipments will do a given volume of business with a smaller fund than one which follows a contrary practice. In only one or two instances do we find that the asseaaor varies the divisor for different companies within his jurisdiction. The practical bearing of this difference in methods was brought out in the case cited above. The plaintiff was a line company operating fifty or sixty elevators. Shipments were made from these to central stations for cleaning and mixing the grain. One of these was located in Lancaster county. It was contended by the company that the assessor had no right to assess the grain found in Lancaster County since it had been bought out in the state and assessed there as "average capital". This view of the law can be very plausibly defended. But even though it may be proven to be good law, it can hardly be shown to work equitably. A line company which keeps the bins of its country elevators clean by frequent shipments to its terminals will of course employ comparatively little working capital at the country elevator. The grain bought, is soon stored at the central station and the balance usually carried by such companies in the local bank is small. In fact it is not infrequently the practice for the bank to receive their checks and send them 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p198">194 Report of Nebraska Tax Commission forward to the central office for payment. With such a method of conducting business, the law may be fully complied with and yet a small cash item, or small "average capital" item, be truth - fully returned as far as the local business is concerned. But unless the law provides some means of reaching the capital employed in carrying the grain at the terminals, an injustice is done those competitors who pay a tax on their "average capital" on the basis of the full time it is tied up in grain. To illustrate: A company having terminal facilities may, in the natural course of business, have grain in its local elevator ten days and the same grain in its terminal elevator for twenty days. It is not equitable for it to use a large divisor — say 36 — on the ground of a frequent turn-over of capital and thus make out a low "average capital", while a competitor, carrying his grain also an average of thirty days is compelled to use a small divisor — say 12 — and thus make make an item of "average capital" three times that of the line company for the same amount of grain handled. Theoretically the line company ought to be assessed at the local elevator on the basis of holding its grain ten days and at the terminal on the basis of holding it twenty days in the case assumed. This would be equitable as between competitors, but to make such a compu - tation would render more complex and difficult a method already top-heavy with complexities and difficulties. Methods in Other States. — In most states grain dealers are taxed as they were in Nebraska prior to 1903. North Dakota, however, since 1907 has had a low bushel tax on "all grain grown within the state and therein in elevators and granaries" at the rate of one-eighth of a cent for oats, barley, corn, speltz and rye, three-eighths of a cent for wheat, and one-half cent for flax. These rates it should be noted apply to grain in the hands of producers and dealers alike on assessment day. Grain grown outside the state is taxed according to value. We do not know what consider - ations led to the enactment of this law, but its effect would be to discriminate against grain grown outside the state by whom-so- Minnesota in 1909 adopted a bushel tax of another kind. Graindealers there are taxed (1) on the value of the plant at the local rate; (2) on cash and credits held at the rate of 3 mills on the dollar, the same as other owners of such property; and (3) </seg>
            <seg id="p199">Conclusions and Recommendations 195 on the grain "received or handled" at an elevator or warehouse, regardless of place of growth, at the rate of one-fourth of a mill per bushel of flax and wheat, and one-eighth of a mill per bushel of all other kinds of grain. Grain on hand on assessment day is not assessed to the dealer. The merit of this tax is its simplicity and ease of administration. But a tax in such form is peculiarly liable to be shifted, a fact which probably led to the adoption of rates so low that they yield but slight revenue. The returns show 187,200,000 bushels of grain handled, in 1910 andtaxes amount - ing to $35,000. The Tax Commission recommends that the rates be quadrupled if this form of tax is retained. glowa has a law similar to that of Nebraska, which applies, &gt;ver, to dealers in ice and coal as well as to dealers in grain, secretary of the executive council informs us that the law is rally ignored and dealers in grain are assessed as a matter of tice on the basis of the property held on assessment day. Kansas assesses all merchants including grain dealers upon the "average value of such articles of personal property which he shall have had in his possession or under his control during the year." Whether such a plan is desirable or not may be questioned, but if applied to grain dealers it seems clear that it should also be applied to live stock, ice and coal dealers, and to all others whose stocks fluctuate greatly from time to time. The Kansas Tax Commission reports that the law gives general satisfaction. That Commission has worked out a form of statement for the aid of assessors in finding the average amount on hand, which if adopted in this state would enable the assessors to find the average capital employed with far greater accuracy than is now secured. A sample statement for a month's business shown in the table below. Conclusions and Recommendations. In view of the uncertain operation of the present law and the irritation caused by the attempt to determine the average capital employed, we recommend the repeal of Section 6333 R. S., providing for the assessment of grain dealers. This would place these dealers under the general rule of assessment on the basis of the property held on April 1. Doubtless the difficulties experienced prior to 1903 would reappear, but it may be questioned whether these difficul - ties would be any greater that those under the present law and the fiscal effect of the change would probably be slight. </seg>

This tax is at a rate equal to the average of the rates of the general property tax for the three preceding years. Such a proportion of the tax as corresponds to the proportion of its stock owned by residents of the State is distributed to the towns in which the owners reside, and the remainder is retained by the State for its own use. The right of way is exempt from local taxation. Street railway companies are subject to the corporate excess tax in the same way as railroad companies. In the case of street railways the tax is dis - tributed to the local units upon the basis of location of track.
