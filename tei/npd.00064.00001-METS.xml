In order" to proteet the interest of Nebraska ppers. this Commission desired, if possible, to prevent any increases the ratings on intrastate traffic.

The Nebraska Commission submitted certain exhibits tending to show that the intrastate scale of rates hi the western portion of the state ought not be inereeased, In connection with this docket, the Nebraska (Din - mission has been advised by the Interstate Commerce Commission that the matter will be handled under the cooperative plan and before a decision is readied a conference will be hald between the two com- missions. I On November 14, 1927, the Interstate Commerce Commission on own motion set down for investigation the general level of rates cement for distances of eighty miles, or less. This investigation cover the entire rate situation in the territory lying, generally nkini;, between the Mississippi river on the east and the Rocky mtains on the west, and will extend from the Canadian border to Mexican border.

C. Docket 17000, Part 7. will be decided at the same time the decision is rendered in the tire grain rate structure adjustment for the western territory. In the 1926 report, mention is made of the grain ease filed by the Southwestern Millers' League, I. &amp; S.

            <seg id="p141">141 OPINION AND FINDING BY THK COMMISSION: I On July 2, 1025, this Commission, upon Furinal Complaint No. olio' Nebraska Kami Bureau Federation, a full and complete public- hear - having been had. issued an experimental order directing: defendants ned in said complaint, to construct a sufficient number of partitions be used in adequately meeting tariff requirements for division of cies of live stock in mixed carload shipments intrastate within Ne - ska. such partitions to meet the following specifications (18 K.S. a) The gate or partition, shall be not less than •"&gt;() inches high l he top of the top cross-bar. b) Spaces between the floor and lowest cross-bar, and between three lowest cross-bars shall not exceed a inches each. f(c) Gates or partitions, shall be separable from the stock car, shall be so constructed that they can be held in place, when in use, wire or chains. »The order provided that liability of the carriers to supply j_ates partitions, for the purposes above set forth, did not exist unless ice was given by shipper to local agent not less than three days 'ore date of shipment, and that the gate or partition be delivered the car assigned to shipper who ordered it. I Order further authorized carriers to publish and collect a charge one dollar ($1.00) for each partition used by the shipper and re- Ecl the carriers to keep adequate records of (a) number of gates strutted; (b) number of shipments in which carriers' gates are 1: (c) cost of gates; (d) cost of repairs and replacement of gates; average percent condition of gates at end of experimental period", l t ) such other data as shall be of value in ascertaining the proper rge for the service. I It was directed that this order be in force until further hearing reon was had and a new order entered. The order having been force about eighteen months, the Commission on its own motion, ified interested parties and carriers to be present at a public hear - held by the Commission at its offices in Lincoln, on March 22, 1927, the purpose of receiving reports and data from the carriers, and h other information as would aid the Commission in determining ether or not there should be any change in the method of construc - i of the gates: whether each carrier should be permitted to use its [i type of gate, or whether some uniform type should be used; and determine further what charge, if any, should be made by the car - r to the shipper, for the use of the gates or partitions. As a result of such hearing the Commission finds : In compliance with the order, the carrier each have constructed </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 and placed a sufficient number of gates or partitions in .service, to ad - equately meet tariff reqairements. The gates constructed by the vari - ous carriers vary as to cost of construction, and are not uniform; each however was constructed under specifications set forth by the Com - mission, and properly serve the purpose lor which they were construc - ted. The uates not being; of a uniform construction, vary as to pei cent condition at end of experimental period. From exhibits of son,, - of the carriers it would appear that these grates are being furnished at a loss to the carriers, but the Commission is of the ..pinion, con - sidering; the per cent condition of L:ate&gt; at the end of the experimental period, the revenue derived therefrom and the cos( of a pate construc - ted as per Commission specifications, thai the carriers should Furnish these Liates or partitions, and be authorized to charge and collec dollar for each partition, or £ate, so furnished. t There have only been two or three complaints by shippers since I er became effective, to the effect that partitions wm- not furnis within the time required; these were mostly due to lack of infon hi on the part of the carriers' agent. These complaints were. h..&lt; r. not called to the attention of the Commision until the date of t hearing. In all other cases, it appaers that partitions kver be furnished within forty-eight hours after ordeied. The C is of tile opinion that the order should not be changed am shipper be required to give the usual three days' notice bet. Ipment. The carriers appear to be making every effort to ppers the best service possible in this connection, as most re and are furnished within twenty-four hours after ordere&lt; re no complaints as to the quality ,&gt;f the gate ami the Co of the opinion that the carriers lie permitted to construct gate, which to them seems adequate, following, however, th ■cifications herein set forth.

Hearing was had at Omaha, at which the county of pv, the department of public works of the state of Nebraska, and K railroad were represented. Prior to the hearing the parties met in Terence in an effort to reach an agreement as to the division of ex- nse, luit were unable to do I'he evidence as to flu- total cost varies but little from that sub- Ited a! the first hearing. Kngineers for defendant submitted an imate, including the proposed bridge and the grading, the total be- 13,500. A slight increase in the cost of the bridge is estimated on '■count of the assumption that it will be set diagonally over the high - ay, thus necessitating an increase in its length. The original figure Emitted was *7.II84. This has been changed to $7,500. The com - y's engineers estimate about 6,000 enbic yards of grading at $1.00 yard. The county surveyor's estimate of the amount of grading I greater, being 9,500 cubic yards. His cost of grading, however, is terially less, being '.W cents per yard, except for the excavation im - diately under the tracks, which he figures at $1.00 per yard. His al lor grading amounts to only $3,180. Mr. Cavenman, local engi - •r for the state highway department, confirms the county surveyor's imate. The total cost of bridge and grading on this estimate, there - of, would be $10,680. As the highway department is constantly en - led m grading work, it would appear that their figures are the more irly accurate. t Defendant points out that it is impossible to definitely estimate cost of the underground structure until the state and federal de - tments make specifications therefor. The structure included in the ve estimate, however, involves defendant's standard suecifieations, that, in all probability, the estimate is as high as will ultimately be ized. It is conceded by complaint that if the railroad Were not in ex - istence, a substantial cut would be necesary to secure a satisfactory (Trade.

There uld appear to be a joint interest in the construction of this under - load crossing. It is admitted that the present highway is almost iin - ssable and is very dangerous. The improvement of the road on her side of the track and its use as a eonneetmg link between t\vi' in thoroughfares will greatly increase traffic over it. The railroad. refore, has a direct interest in reducing to a minimum the possibi - r of accident. On the other hand, the county and state would have tain improvements to make, if the railroad were not in existence. Upon the record as thus made, we are of the opinion that fifty per cent of the total cost of the improvement including the structure and the grading on and off of the rigtt &lt; f way, should be assessed against the railroad company and the other fifty per cent to be assessed against the county of Sarpy and the state of Nebraska, to be divided by them as they may elect.

Holmes, attorney for the railroad, appeared in the interest of the complainant, defending the action of the company in establishing the signal in its present posi- tion. The testimony shows that some two years ami the Woman and the citizens of Jansen requested the Chicago. Rock Island .t 1' Kaihvay Company to erect an automatic flash light signal m the ■ of the main highway, about one mile east of the town of Jansei ferson County, where said railroad crosses t he highway, known as highway project Number .i, this crossing being considered by the Wo - raans Club and citizens of Jansen as a dangerous crossing, which re - quired adequate warning signal to the traveling public. They petition - ed flie Chicago, Kock Island .t Pacific Railway Company t&lt;&gt; erect an automatic flash light signal in the center of the highway so that the traveling public might have notice that they were about to cross dangerous railroad crossing while the track is visible for some distance on the north side of the highway, there is a deep cut on the south side. obscuring the view of an approaching train, which makes the crossing quite dangerous, unless there is an electric flash light warning sign of some construction that will give notice to travelers on the highway that a train is approaching. tT/he necessity for protection of the public at this crossing had been called to the attention of the Railway Commission by the citi - s. As has already been said the matter was taken up by the Wo - is Club directly with the railway which, acting on the suggestion of Womans Club, erected a flash light warning signal in the center of highway, without considering the liability they were assuming and jeeting Jefferson County to at the crossing on the federal road one : east of Jansen. The Womans Club and the citizens of Jansen are to be commended </seg>
            <seg id="p149">149 P action and interest taken in the welfare of the traveling pub - lsii are to be congratulated that they had persuasive power to railway company to comply with their request. Undoubtedly known that the universal and legal signals at dangerous eross - e those placed on opposite sides of t?he railway track and on sides of the roadway, they would have petitioned the railway &gt;mpany for signals of this character instead of the one now located the center of the roadway. The base of this signal is constructed as shown by Exhibit No. 1, introduced by the railroad company as being five by six feet, diamond shape and two feet high. The standard erected in the center of this concrete foundation is approximately twelve feet high, with a twelve inch gong on the top, which rings continuously when trains are within I-ertain distance of the crossing, and cross arms approximately five •t across, with a sign "Railroad Crossing" printed plainly thereon, il flash light signals arc placed three feet apart, seven feet above ■ ground, which flasli alternately upon the approach of trains from her direction, giving ;i warning red light signal. The signal is the inlaid signal used by the company where they are required to install c-tri(- flash light signals, the same that is being used where the road ~^c^ through cities, like Lincoln and other towns, and when properly (tailed are a very effective warning sign to the public of the ap - aching of trains. If observed and heeded the danger of an accident the crossing is averted. According to the published schednle of the Chicago, Kock Island E'acific Railway Company there are fifteen trains per day passing r this crossing, half of which pass during day-light hours and the pr half, either in the early evening, or night-time, at which time the its arc more plainly discernible than in the day-time. I.Mr. R. O. Green, district engineer of public 'works for the state of braska, testified that an inspection of road project No. 3 had been de by the chief engineer of (he United State bureau of public roads Washington, on May 23, 1025. The United States engineer instruc - the state highway department to take up the matter of the removal this warning signal with the railroad company, and prevent further nals being placed in the center of federal highway by this or any or railroad company in Nebraska. I It seems from the testimony that the federal government had for ne time been withholding .$lo,000 of federal aid money that has been igned to this project No. 3, by reason of the fact that this signal s in fhe center of the highway, contrary to the rules and regulations the government. Recently $13,000 of this money had been paid into fund, so that at the time of fhe hearing there was $2,000 being held by the government, subject to the removal of this signal from the iter of the highway.

            <seg id="p180">180 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT Testimony of the plaintiff shows that the land on the ea&gt;t side &lt;&gt; the railroad right-of-way has until recently been uesd as pasturage am ulialta hay land, but at the present time the pasture has been brokei up and is in corn, with the exception of a small portion at the smith end adjoining the main highway, which is in alfalfa. Testimony ol the com plainant also shows that when this land mi the cast si&lt;lc of the railroa&lt; was being used by him for pasture that he bad a water pipe under tin railroad right-of-way to conduct water tor the use of the stock tba was being pastured on that side of the railroad right-of-way. In the fall of 192li, the railroad company did some ditching along the right -oi way and broke off the pipe, which neither the railroad company nor tin plaintiff had since repaired as there was no stuck being kept on tha side of the track. The railroad company constructed a grade crossing about six hundred feet north of the present location of the drainage pipe, when the road was built, adjacent to the complainants buildings leading across the track so that complainant has a practicalh leve grade crossing connecting the land on both sides of the railroad track This crossing is provided with stee! gates, such as th impany usuall; provides at grade crossings. Plaintiff has been using this crossing eve Ice he has been the owner of the land and has been driving his ato&lt; and from the land on the east side of the road when it was used i sttire land. There was no testimony introduced to show that ai ck had been killed or injured, while being driven across the track ler direction. I The complainant testified that it was absolutely necessary for Inn have this tirade crossing, for the purpose of tilling the land, also tor uling the products of the land to his buildings and to market, but that driving stock back ami forth across the track, the lions would run up d down the track and caused him considerable inconvenience. The defendant company produced very elaborate pictures I location of the plaintiff's buildings and the defendant's railway, tin in highway and the close proximity to the town of Abie. The Com - ma was unable to get a comprehensive idea of the conditions e.\ - ng from the testimony and the facts in the case, the commissionei ng from the testimony of either the plaintiff or the defendant com - ly's exhibits, and in order to be able to have ;i better understanding the testimony and the /acts in the case, the commissioner ami ineer for the Railway Commission suggested a personal sorvej the grounds and condition, which 'was agreed to by both the plaiti - and the defendant company. The commissioner and engineer ac - dingly went to Abie where the plaintiff's farm is located and made ersonal survey of the grounds and conditions. They found that the place where the opening under the railroad bad formerly been and where the iron drainage pipe is now located had filled up between the plaintiff's land and the railroad grade, sa that the bank at that point would not be of sufficient height for the installation </seg>

They further found that the place where this culvert, or bridge was located was in close proximity to the main highway running east ami west in front of plaintiff's buildings and that this opening was right at, or very near, the main fence paralleling the highway. That the land on the east side of the railroad which had been used by plaintiff as pasture land was under cultivation and in corn, except a small field at the south end of alfalfa. The grade crossing which was about six hundred feet north of the highway was a level and adequate grade crossing for the purposes for which it was being used. The gates open directly into plaintiffs yards so that it would be convenient for him to drive his stock from his yards, adjacent to his barns and out buildings, across the track to the land on the east side of the track, but if the underground pass prayed for was installed, plaintiff would in- compelled to drive his stock around in front of, or on the east side ■ ■I his house out next to the main highway in order to get them through miier the track. I The Commission does not favor a combination of drainage pipe and ek pass as there is liable to be continual trouble from mud and &gt;ris washed into the pass, and in thawing and freezing weather the ter forms ice on the floor of the pass and stock slip on the ice and ■ liable to fall and break their legs, or otherwise become injured, lere the pass is placed at a point where it is only used as a cattle ■s. this trouble does not occur. The law provides plainly that the ner of land that is divided by a railroad is entitled to one adequate ssinu. Section 5527 Complied Statutes of Nebraska, as amended 192.!. reads as follows: "Whenever any person owns land on both sides of the right - of-way of any railroad, such railroad shall provide and keep in repair at least one adequate means for such land owner to cross the right-of-way. Any interested land owner with land on both sides of the right-of-way of any railroad may file written com - plaint with the state railway commission against any such rail - road that the crossing is not adequate or is unsafe and dangerous to the life and property of those who use the same, and the com - mission thereupon shall make such investigation and hold such hearing as may be necessary, and shall issue such orders as it shall deem necessary, proper and adequate.

About six or en years ago, while the competitive struggle was at its height, the coin company constructed a farm line out of the village of Inavale, ich is about seven miles west of Red Cloud. This farm line ran th for a distance of lO 1^ miles to the Kansas line. It was con - ted with the Red Cloud exchange by a trunk line from Inavale to 1 Cloud. When first constructed, some subscribers in Invade •e served by this line. Later the Inavale subscribers, were taken &gt; Red Cloud on a separate line. Eight farmers were persuaded by Lincoln company to take this farm line service. Pour of them e since discontinued the service. </seg>

Thai pas ;iness on this line had fallen off to such an extent thai the train s being operated at a considerable loss to the company and that volume of business was so limited that it could be handled ade - itely by a gas motor car and effect ;, substantial saving in over d expense. Exhibits were presented showing: th; volume of business bandied on trains No. 4 and No. 11 from August 7 to September 7. 1926, in - clusive. The greatest number of passengers handled on train No. 4 for any one day during that time was twenty-three. Only ten of these originated at Red Cloud and on train Xo. 11, running in reverse direc - tion the greatest number was twenty-nine on at Hastings, with sixteen off at Red Cloud. The track between Hastings and Red Cloud is of heavy sti-el and well ballasted so that a motor car would run reasonably smooth over the track and passengers would not be subjected to any unreasonable inconvenience. The car that the company proposes to use on this run would be an Edwards double unit gasoline motor car, with seating rapacity for thirty-five passengers, with separate toilet facilities, smoking compartment, baggage and pouch mail compartment. </seg>

Hearing was held in the matter at Palisade on July 1, 192/, where ubseribera were heard in the mat- telephone companies and interested Hamlei is a small village situated midway between Palisade and Wauneta and at present is served by Palisade Telephone Company who maintains at the exchange an operator and switchboard. At present the manager, of the Palisade Telephone Company testified there were only thirteen subscribers within the village and thirteen subscribers on a farm line served from the Hamlet switchboard. The independent farm lines situated between Palisade and Wauneta and near Hamlet arc at present enjoying service to all three exchangee and also to Hays Center. The Palisade subscribers do not receive service to Wauneta lint do receive service to Hays Center and Hamlet. Palisade Telephone Company owns the telephone plant in Hamlet only, the farm lines be - ing owned by farmers' companies. Independent farm lines connect Palisade and Hamlet and Wauneta and Hamlet. The Wauneta Telephone Company is interested in the application because of the service which is rendered by the company without com - pensation. The Wauneta Telephone Company has an authorized switching rate which has been impractical to use in the case of some subscribers which it served, since the farm line which pays them Stching service for thirteen subscribers between Hamlet and Wauneta nects with Hamlet and thereby opens t?rritory in all directions i-h comes through the Hamlet exchange to W&amp;aneta. I To eliminate the Hamlet exchange would necessitate the connee - of farm lines directly with the Wauneta switchboard and there - permit the company to collect all switching charges due it. This •n &gt; also as to the Palisade Telephone Company. t Testimony was presented to show that the operation of the Ham - exchange was unprofitable. The operator at the Hamlet exchange eives a salary of approximately twenty-five dollars per month ih- the gross toll and rental business will not exceed an average of ■ty dollars per month. Without an elaborate study of the remain - expenditures necessary to operate the Hamlet exchange it is ob - vions that the exchange is not being operated on the present basis at a profi*. Furthermore, the financial statements of the Palisade Tele - phone Company indicate that the company as a whole is at present nut operating at an excessive profit. I The evidence is quite conclusive that the present subscribers of e Pa'isade Telephone Company who receive service from the Hamlet change, for the most part, transact thair business at Hamlet or in </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 Palisade. Some of the subscribers oil farm lines served through the Hamlet exchange transact their business in Waimeta. some of which might be better served by arranging for Wauneta service. I The financial effect upon the companies involved it the Hamlet hange were discontinued would lie the elimination of an operator the Palisade Telephone Company and also the elimination of main ance of the switchboard at Hamlet. The Wauneta Telephone Com - iv would benefit by further switching revenue from some Bubserib - who are at the present time receiving Wauneta service without rge. The manager of the Wauneta Telephone Company estimated t the additional gross revenue which might accrue to them if the hange were eliminated would approximate eleven dollars per month. The officers of independent farm lines and other subscribers in - terested in the proposed change of service were mostly in favor of discontinuing the Hamlet exchange rather than to revise rates and establish toll charges, provided any change of service was granted. tThe village of Hamlet by mutual agreement of both of applicant panics 'would be served in the future by both Wauneta and Palisad panies provided the Commission orders the discontinuance of the ilet exchange. Such an arrangement would permit residents ol tilet to become subscribers "I either exchange and pay toll r. The Commission is of the opinion that the Hamlet exchang operated at a loss and further, that the operation of the Hamlet change on its present basis requires the Wauneta Tel&lt; Compai to furnish service without compensation. It is apparent thai it y should be given to discontinue the operation of the Han t Kates for service will necessarily require adjustment bo far ;i~ nlet subscribers are concerned.

This change will not impair in any way, nor disrupt, alter or change the frsqoeney of Ber - vice on Tenth Street and will in no way disarrange the schedule now be - ing: extended on the Tenth Street line. I The petitioner alleges that if it is caused to retain and maintain double track lines on South Tenth Street between "B" and GarfieU. it the necessity of paving between said double tracks would cost e Lincoln Traction Company a cash outlay of over $5,000 without y corresponding benefit either to the traction company or the public. this is purely a matter as to the maintaining of service adequate the handling of the business on this line, the Commission did not em it necessary to hold a hearing, but did take the matter up and was submitted to City Attorney Peterson and Deputy City Attorn &gt;y like, who after a consultation with the City Council, reported to the mmission by letter, that the City Council had no objections to the plication of the Lincoln Traction Company to abandon thf&gt; double tck between "B" and Garfield Streets, provided the single track </seg>

The new a""lic - u provides for four-party line residence service, which service is, now provided by the company.

I Hearing on this application was held at Gothenburg on June 3, 7. Notice of the hearing was sent to practically every subscriber eivimr service, the subscribers' directory being used for this pur - e. Notwithstanding the wide notice thus given, there were no tests tiled either before or at the time of the hearinir. and no evi - ee of any nature was submitted in objection to the proposed rates. &gt; petition referred to recites that the signers are subscribers for ■phone service at Gothenburg, and that they request applicant to es - lish common battery telephone service in that city, and that they lerstand it will be necessary, after that is done, that the rates ask - for be charged for the improved s?rvice.

            <seg id="p312">312 ri at Gothenburg is desirous of securing common battery serv though the rates must be increased. I As indicated, the company has already made »ubstantial improve - iits in t lie telephone plant at Gothenburg. Daring the year 1926, it &gt;ended over $18,1100 for this purpose, increasing the property invest - it from $45,386 to $63,585. Some improvements have been made je the first of the year. The company supports its application elaborat" showing as to revenues and expenses, relying in the main an estimate covering the revenues and expenses that will be shown er the common battery service is in effect. This estimate is based the actual experience at Gothenburg, with such modifications a~ ■ necessary to meet the changed conditions. The figures relate onlj exchange operation, toll being excluded. At the request of the Com ision. the company submitted a statement for the year 1926 &lt;-,, m I: the combined operation ot exchange and toll. The figures thus (resented were used to check the estimate referred to. It is unneces ry to state in detail the &lt; xpense statement. The estimated gross thange revenue pec year, bused upon the proposed rates. i&gt; $22,570. The total expenses, exclusive of return mi the investment aggre te $18,768.60. This would leave a net income ot $3,802.60 applicabli return '&gt;n the investment. The property account as shown by the books of the company, ad - justed to include the prospective expenditures for the common batterx installation, totals $62,861.32. Applicant made a physical valuation of the plant ;is of tlie date immediately following common- battery installation, and this figure, including five per cut for value, totals $89,804.15. Elxeluding going value, the depreciated cost of the property on a reproduction basis is very close to the investment as shown by the books. Perhaps this is due to the fact that a very con - siderable proportion of the property has been placed during the past two years. With the physical valuation corresponding so closely to the investment, elose scrutiny is unnecessary and the figure can be accept - ed as fairly representing the value of the property. In this case, the net income that will be produced by the new rates is not sufficient to pay a reasonable return on a value considerably less than that claimed, being only slightly ovpr six per cent on the book cost. If a seven per cent return were to be allowed on the value as claimed b\ the company for rate purposes, at least $1,090 more in net revenue ivou'd be required. Applicant does not anticipate any material growth in business at Gothenburg, the town being very well developed from a telephone standpoint at the present time. Tt is probable, therefore. that unless costs are reduced, the net income will be short of a fair return for sometime to come. I We have carefully checked the operating expenses, and while re may be variation in some of the items under actual operating ditions, there appears to be no reason for criticism. In a previous </seg>

The criticisms of the Commission, however, were not sustained »the federal court to which the ease referred to was appealed.

            <seg id="p315">315 I I r i i 1 i r tlectric service on a portion of the so-called loop in I'niversity i-, is involved. The two applications arc given joint consideration \\fvc beard jointly. Tor the reason that they involved service by two companies to substantially the same territory, being that in heast Lincoln and University Place. !n September, 1926, the Omaha, Lincoln * Beatrice Railway Com - iany, in addition to the electric street railway service which it furnish - ed between Lincoln and University Place, and Lincoln and Bethany, established a motor bus service between University Place and the lowntown district of the city of Lincoln. A tew weeks thereafter, Lincoln Traction Company made certain changes in its electric ailway schedules and established in connection therewith, motor oach service from the downtown district of the city of Lincoln, to Diversity Place, following a route past tin* Agricultural College ami 1 Warren Avenue in I'niversity Place. In this application, it asks I the motor bus service from .'J8th and Holdrege Streets, which point directly in front of the Agricultural College, to University Ec, be discontinued. In the original petition it also asked that a ion of the street car service about the so-called loop in I niversity • :■. he abandoned. At the time of the hearing, however, the ap - ation with respect to the loop service was recalled, so that the re- rst relates only to discontinuance of the motor hus servic • between points named. The general manager of the 0. L. .v: B. states that the operation the motor hiisses since theii installation, lias been carried on at i.-s. Aii exhibit covering the revenues and expenses of the motor &gt;c&gt; from October 1!'. l!&gt;'-&lt;&gt;. to April :J0. L927, shows that a total ■senger revenue of $14,590.3] was received from the operation of ses. Againsl this a iiross expense of $16,065.15 is charged, in - atinp a deficit of almost $1500.00 for the period, or a loss per bus c of .0185 cents. The revenue from operation of the electric cars not included in this statement. It is the testimony of the general uiager, however, that prai tically all of the passengers riding the sses came from the electric cars and that the traffic on the latter was correspondingly decreased. The addition of the bus service re - sulted in a slight increase in total traffic amounting, it is estimated, to perhaps $10.00 a day. In other words, the motor busses were direct oinpetitors of the street cars. The anticipated increase in riders iiil not develop. The Omaha. Lincoln .v Beatrice Railway Company, in connection with the retain to electric service, proposes to establish a new ter - minal in the city of Lincoln. Its electric cars now, and for many years past, have stopped at 14th and O Streets. The new plan is to operate the cars around a loop described as follows: Beginning at 14th and K Streets; west on R Street to 11th Street; south on 11th Street to 1' Street; east on F Street to 14th Street, and north on </seg>
            <seg id="p316">316 14th Street as no* operated. This will have the advantage of ex - tending service to interurban passengers to such points as the Cham - ber of Commerce, the state university, the post office and two or three of the hotels, as well as delivering them closer to the shopping dis - trict. As a part of this plan, it is proposed to utilize some of the tracks owned by The Lincoln Traction Company. I In support of its application for authority to discontinue motor &gt;ses from 38th and Holdrege to University Place, The Lincoln Trac - 1 Company asserts that the traffic beyond 38th and Holdrege is light as to render the operation of busses unnecessary and waste If the busses are removed, the same service as existed prior to ir installation, will be restored, that is, a 30-minute electric service 1 be maintained to University Place and around the loop in that l, and a 30-minute service to Havelock, thus affording a 15-minute (|uency. The 0. L. a.- B. will also have a 30-minute service dur - the middle of the day, and a 1-Vminute service daring the peak irs, to University Place. The record shows that traffic on the busses beyond 38th and Hold - rage is very light. A number of citizens living east and north of 38tb and Holdrege, objected at the time of the hearing to the discontinuance of the busses, on the ground that the 0. L. ,t B. serves only ;i small section in the business district of Lincoln, and that two tares are ne - cessary where transfers to The Lincoln Traction Company are in - volved. It was urged as an alternative, that instead of stopping th • busses at 38th and Holdrege. that the run be extended to 48th and Holdrege. At th&lt;? time of the hearing The Lincoln Traction Company was instructed to make a count of passengers using the busses be - tween 38th and Holdrege and 48th and Holdrege. Such a study covers a period of four days. May 21, 22, 23 and '24. These st dies show the total passengers on and off between these points, to have been 49 for May 21; .V2 for May 22; 73 for May 23 and 62 for May 24. On many of the trips during the day, no passengers were handled be - tween these points. Objectors stressed the fact tliiit people Living in the territory could not go to church in south Lincoln without trans - ferring to The Lincoln Traction Company cars. The record shows, however, that for Sunday, May 22, only 52 passengers on and oft 'were carried, and the record indicates that tew. it' any of these, used the &gt;-n\-&gt; during church hours. To maintain the service as far as 4Sth Street. it is alleged by the company, would require the operation of an addi - tional bus over that nee &gt;ssarv to furnish the service to 'fSth .Mid Ilo'd - resje. The service from 38th and Ho'drejre to the downtown district is not complained of and is presumed to-be adequate. It has been suggested that the c.irs might be stopped at 45th and Holdreiie instead of 48th. This wou'd require six blocks less travel, and might be accomplished without the operation of an additional bus. We are disposed, therefore, to reqnire a trial of such ssrvice If, dm- </seg>
            <seg id="p317">317 niu a period of two weeks, it is found that The Traction Company basses eafenot make the trip from downtown terminus to 45th and tioldrege without impairing the service between town and the Agricul - tural College, the additional service beyond 38th Street can be dis - continued. It is manifest, of course, that the company should not be required to serve this additional territory if another bus needs to be operated. The company should keep a record of the time consumed on Bach trip, so as to make a report to the Commission at the end 01 I Much of the objection at University Place to the proposed ap - eation, was caused by the proposal to abandon a portion of the loop. ten the company changed its petition in this respect, the objectors vresaed themselves as content with the service planned. It would pear, therefore, that the service as proposed by the two companies, at the present time more than is justified by the traffic served, and appears that the plan to abandon bus service by the 0. L. &amp; B. and ablish a new loop in the downtoAvn district, will adequately serve ■ people contiguous to its lines. It is also manifest that The Lin - ii Traction Company should be permitted to make the changes pro - sed and to abandon its motor bus service as indicated above. As we have said in previous opinions, the problem confronting the people of Lincoln is to maintain any street transportation facili - ties. Traffic continues to dpcline. The installat'on of motor busses by The Lincoln Traction Company in some sections of the city, has checked this decline, and it is still hoped that the new method of transportation will prove so satisfactory that it will be able to unrcni fully compete with the private automobile. The trial is still under way, however, and in the meantime, every effort to make it a success should be 'ncouraged. The operation of such unnecessary service as we have described in this proceeding, should be discontinued. The co - ordination of the service of the two companies wil! materially im - prove conditions over what they were when the two were being oj&gt; - prated in sharp competition. To a desrree each 'will now supplement the other, affording as near a maximum of service at a minimum of i-ost as is possible with the lines under separate ownership.

The Commission found that the application both companies as prayed for should be granted with the exception t there was some opposition to the Lincoln Traction Company dis - tinuing bus service between 38th and 45th on Hokfarege Street. ■ Traction Company contended that in ease they were required to end the service from AHt\\ to 4.~&gt;th it would require an additional in order I aintain th. schedule to the Agricultural College, at li Street, it they were required to run to 4oth Street. The Commission granted the application of the Omaha, Lincoln Beatrice Railway Company to discontinue the running of busses to University Place, but required the Lincoln Traction Company to run busses to 45th Street, that being the end of the zone, for a period of two weeks and during that time an accurate checking should be made as to the number of passengers carried between 4oth and H8th Streets on HoMrege. It was contended by parties living between 45th and :&gt;Hth Streets, that owing to the fact that the interurban could ii"t furnish transfers for passengers south of 14th and () Streets, thai it greatly inconvenienced them in not beinjr able to make the trans - fers and get th- benefit of that service. tit is only two blocks from any of the residences between 38th 1 4~&gt;th Streets to the Omaha, Lincoln a.- Beatrice Interurban lin». re arc no residences on the north side of lloldrejie Street between h and 4"&gt;th Streets and between 4l!rd and 45th only two or thre'! idences. Passengers desiring transfer privileges could walk to h ami take the Lincoln Traction Company bus. The cheeking shows that very few of the passengers who have i-M patronizing the bus from 4."&gt;th Street to Ii8th Street have been taking advantage of the transfer privilege. There has be?n an average toul.v five transfers per day during the two weeks checking:. An - .■r strong contention made was that patrons desiring to attend irch in the south part of the city of Lincoln would make extensive use of transfers. The two Sundays over the period which this check - ing has taken place show that on Sunday, Jun;' 5th, there were four transfers and Sunday, June 12, three transfers, bo that the use of Hie transfers on Sunday is considerable below the use of the transfers • in week clays.

The city was represented by y Attorney Peterson. Notice of the application had been served in the public, and no one appeared opposing the application, The testimony shows that the Traction Company have been and are operating both the lines in question, at quite a substantial loss. !t has been costing the company $1.83 per hour to operate the North 10th Stre.'t car line, and the revenue received by the company is only ss cents per hour, so that the out-of-pocket expense would aggregate about $2,000 per year. The evidence also shows that the out-of-pocket less on the Capital Beach line amounts to $1,980 per year. The testimony shows that busses could be operated over the same lines, giving the same number of car mile service, at approximately five 'cuts per car mile less with busses than with street cars. It Was also shown by undisputed testimony, that if the Traction Com - l any were required to continue street car service to Capital Beach, they would be required to expend from $2,500 to $3,000 to repair the line and the bridge over Salt Creek, but if they were permitted to sub - stitute busses, this expenditure would not be required. The Lincoln Traction Company agreed to furnish a sufficient number of busses to take care of the business to Capital Beach during the open season, and with the class of service that they propose to furnish, there would be a saving of approximately $4,000 per year in operating ex - : enses. and give adequate service to the public, both on the Capital Beach and North 10th Street line, and the substitution from street </seg>

The Lincoln Traction Company did not ask to abandon or remove any of its tracks, either on the streets or on the O Street or 10th Street viaduct. The Lincoln Traction Company is under contract with the city and the Burlington Rail - road Company, to maintain its share of the surface of the O Street and North 10th Street viaduct. The Lincoln Traction Com - pany propose to run busses to the Burlington round house for the ac - commodation of the laborers who work at th&lt;&gt; Burlington round house, from September 1"&gt; to May 15, but during the time Capital Beach is open, this service cannot be furnished except the company would be required to furnish extra busses which at the present time they do not feel justified in doing. The North 10th Street line over the 10th Street viaduct is the Traction Company'.-, line leading to the State Fair Grounds, and while this line is not used extensively during tlie year, except for a week or 10 (lavs each year during state fair time. jre&lt; it is important that this line be kept in good repair, and ready tor use in case any demand should be made for street car service to the State Fair Grounds, on account of any activities that may take place at the fair grounds.

OPINION AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein is a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of Nebraska. It has an authorized capital stock of $150,000. divided into 1,500 shares of the par value of $100 each. It has applieed to this Commission for a permit to issue and sell its first mortgage six per cent, ten year bonds in the amount of $75, - 000 for cash at par, and to validate the sale of 600 shares of its com - mon stock which was paid for in cash at par, also by amendment to issue a stock dividend on 900 shares to be issued pro rata on the stock validated. t Petitioner is engaged in the business of carrying and distributing iter for sale to the public, for irrigation purposes. It owns and op - ites a canal about thirty miles in length with headgates in the itte River, near Cozad, and extending in an easterly direction. It the successor of the Farmers and Merchants Irrigation Company Lexington, which had an appropriation of 1142.86 cubic feet per </seg>
            <seg id="p325">325 End of time. Approximately 80,000 acres of land are under the .1 and subject to the beneficial application of the water. Perman - water rights have been sold for 5.500 acres of the land benefited the remainder of the appropriation is sold annually as seasonal itions may require. The canal is located in the semi-arid district and bears a close relation to the prosperity of the community, which is engaged in agricul - tural parasite, as the territory is subject to great variation in rain - fall tlurinu: the growing sgason. The former owner had allowed the canal and structures to suffer froni deferred maintenance and de - preciation, until it had passed the point of service to the community. Applicant has undertaken to restore the canal to good operating con - dition, enlarge and extend it, to water new lands at the lower end. I Petitioner acquired the property at a low figure through sale der foreclosure. The permanent water rights issued by the old npany were reinstated and applicant immediately expended $30,000 new capital on the canal in attempting to reclaim the enterprise. ceipta for 300 shares of common stock were issued for this amount, ter $30,001) additional cash was expended Qn the property to rehabil - te it, receipts were likewise issued in the same amount. The canal s also been enlarged and the company has outstanding obligations the sum of $48,000 which represents the cost of excavation and 'tain additions and betterments. Petitioner will also require ap - jximately $60,000 additional to pay for the extension of the canal the east and structures to provide the service necessary for the blic. The record includes an inventory and appraisal of the physical property which shows a reproduction cost new as of March, 1927, in the sum of $273,778.55 and less depreciation in the amount of $267, - 738.73. This does not include the enlargement and extension of the canal to the east and certain canal structures which will be required for dependable operation.. The inventory shows right-of-way in the amount of 725.9 acres, at $100 per acre. This value per acre is an average figure which reflects the benefit of irrigation on the lower side of the canal. From the view point of reproduction cost new, which the applicant has used, the assumption is that no canal was in exis - tence prim- to the time of the appraisal, therefore, the right-of-way will take the value of the semi-arid side of the canal which the testi - mony shows is worth approximately $50 per acre. Moreover, the land on which the canal has been constructed is not irrigated and not subject to the benefits which flows from it. The testimony also shows that the appraisal engineer used fifteen cents per cubic yard as the coat for common excavation. Applicant has paid as much or more than this for similar work, but the price may have resulted from the fact thiit the work performed was the enlargement of an old canal and </seg>
            <seg id="p326">326 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT excavation was recently let in that locality for 9.8 cents per cubic yard, to be performed with a drajr line, which is the customary method used for excavation of this class and under these conditions. The Commission will not fix a price for common excavation under these conditions, but for estimate purposes will use twelve cents per cubic yard as an average figure for this class of work, under similar con - ditions. When these changes have been made, the engineer's appraisal figured less depreciation, becomes +210.81"). When the extensions and structures are completed this figure will become approximately $320,000. tThe average annual gross revenue for the hist five years has been iroximately $24,000. This will be increased to about $30,000 when new extension lias been completed and the water applied. The in - est on the bonds will be $4,500. Normal operating expenses added this figure should leave a reasonable margin available for the eom - u stock after bond interest is paid; however, none will be paid for several years as the principal stockholders are also land owners under the canal, and it is probable that net earnings before dividends will be required for additions and betterments to plant, which will be to the interest of all concerned. tThe sum of the common stock paid for and the bonds to be ws a total capital liability of $135,000, which will be comparable with iets in physical property of at least $320,000. A stock dividend 600 shares. $60,000 pur value, is not unreasonable under these eon - ions since it will leave a surplus of $125,000 represented by physical &gt;perty and satisfy the requirements of the t'orporation. The Commission believes and so finds that the stock subscribed for and fully paid may be issued in the amount of 600 shares or $60,000 par value. The Commission also finds that the Financial ■•.,!! - dition of the company fully warrants the issue ol six hundred shares "i the common capital stock as a stock dividend to be spread over the stock paid for in the ratio of one share of stock lor each share full} paid. The Commission also finds that the issue and sab- of $75,000 of first mortsrajre, 6%, ten year bonds for cash at par. is reasonably required for the purpose of the corporation.

            <seg id="p329">329 OPINION AND ORDER HANDALL, Commissioner tThe applicant iu this case is the Chicago. Burlington .* (juincy Iroad Company asking to discontinue agency and telegraph service 'heney, Lancaster County, and substitute therefor custodian service. iring was held at the depot in Cheney at 2:00 p.m. on Thursday, e 2, 1!'_'7. that being the time and place specified for such hearing in notice to the citizens of Cheney. Cheney is an unincorporated village of approximately sixty iu - lialiitiints, located eleven miles southeast of Lincoln, six miles south - ■ i College View, and seven miles north west of Kennet, on a federal highway. The business houses of the town consist of a bank, j.o&gt;i oft ice. one general store, one hardware, implement and auto - mobile store, a filling station and elevator. A federal highway passes through the town and the highway is at present gravelled within cio.se proximity to the town and during the season of 1M27 will be improved and undoubtedly gravelled all the way into Lincoln. I "wing to the prevelent use of the automobile and truck, both pass - :er and less than carload business has fallen off materially. The in of Walton on the Missouri Pacific is located about five miles ■theast of Cheney, and the towns of Koca on the Burlington and nlon on the Union Pacific are about six miles southwest of Cheney, i competition in the grain business between these towns, is quite ong and as the elevator at Cheney is owned by a line elevator com - iy, the company is not meeting the price offered for grain at com - itive points, so that a large amount of the grain that is being hauled these towns has reduced the carload shipments at Cheney, so that only the less than carload business, lj tit the carload business has len off materially. Testimony also shows that the loeal merchants at the town have Er own trucks and commodities purchased at Lincoln, are trucked to ney. and that produce and other commodities that in the past were ipcd either by express, or freight, are now parried by truck to teoln &gt;o this class of business has been reduced in a great degree. Exhibit No. 1 of the railroad company shows that revenue from I Of these receipts the railroad company only receives $76.65 from ress, -IS. 7."&gt; from t^letrraph business, which would make the revenue •arliiiid shipments forwarded in 192(&gt; was $6,561.82 Less than carload shipments, forwarded 40.09 Carload shipments, received 3,939.99 Less than carload shipments, received 387.42 ;■•■■ I Express revenue 153.30 Telegraph revenue 37.50 Making a total of $11,120.12 </seg>
            <seg id="p330">330 received by the company $95.40 less than the receipts at the station show, which would make the actual receipts at the station $11,025.12. The agent would receive ten percent of the telegraph and express com - mission in addition to his salary, which would make the net receipts at the station for the railroad company $11,006.04. tThe question of the falling off of business at the station was sed by the protestants and the Commission was asked to look up the ount of business for the years 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926, and ke a five year average which the Commission agreed to do. The ires taken from the Commission's ledger shows that the business e at the station for 1922 was $15,316.32 making a total of $6 ],35tt.26,or an average for the five years of $12,271.25. These figures do not contain express or telegraph business, while the figures produced by the railway company in K.\ - hibit No. 1 do include the telegraph and express, business. During the period which these figures represent, roads have been improved and gravelled and this has brought about a material tailing off in the less than carlod shipments, both forwarded ami received, and undoubtedly crop conditions have had something to d" with the falling off in car - load shipments, as well as possibly market conditions that have been previously mentioned in the order. The salary of the agent at the station amounts to $1,470.24. Fuel and other supplies and expenses at the station amount to #."&gt;!). 4(&gt;, mak - ing a total expense to the company in conducting the business at the station of $1,529.70. The company introduced evidence to show that in case they are permitted to substitute custodian service for agency service that the business of the station can be conducted for at least $1,200 per year less than is now being paid, without any material inconvenience to the citizens of the town and vicinity, or the traveling public. Conditions at the town of Cheney are not materially different than other small towns that are located in close proximity to large cities. People who formerly did business at these small towns are now driving to the city over gravelled roads, where there is a larger variety of merchandise to choose from, and in disposing of their produce and other commodities they can be handled either by automobile or truck and they are market - ing them in the city, which not only takes business away from the pro - duce man and merchants of the town, but also reduces the amount of business to the railroad company. This is a natural consequence and instead of improving will gradually grow in volume to the detriment of the railroad company. 1923 12,131.15 1924 13,804.83 192.") 10,053.07 1926 10,050.29 </seg>
            <seg id="p331">331 The telegraph business at the town is of very small volume, owing to the fact that the Lincoln Telephone * Telegraph Company have lines running into the town and people in the town and vicinity can call the Western. Inion Telegraph Company at Lincoln and send and receive telegrams over the telephone. If the telegram has to be prepaid they have the advantage of having that charged to their telephone account ami billed to them by the telephone company, so there is no necessity for a telegraph operator at Cheney to serve the people in that line. Tlie company proposes to permit shippers of grain and live stocn and other carload shipments to have their billing done either at the town of Bennet or at Lincoln, whichever place is the most advantag - oas to the shipper, and the billing of all carload and less than carload freight can be made out either by the agent at Bennet or Lincoln, with - out anv expense to the railroad company and the patrons of the road will in reality have agency service, except the purchasing of tickets and the payment of freight. tThe Commission is of the opinion, after duly considering all of tnw ts in the case, that the application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; ncy Railroad Company to substitute a custodian for the agent at iiey is an economical and efficient 'way of handling the business at ney, and that the application should be granted subject to the term* conditions of the folowing order.

If the party to whom the telegram is sent does not live in Cheney, but has a telephone, the custodian shall notify the per - son to whom the telegram is addressed, by telephone, that there is a telegram there for him and inquire if he desires the telegram to be telephoned. If he does the custodian shall telephone it to him, if he does not desire to have it telephoned, the custodian shall enclose the telegram in an envelope and deposit it in the United States post office, or retain the same until the party to whom it is sent calls for it. 5. The railroad company must provide telephone service that is connected with the Lincoln Telephone exchange at Cheney, so that patrons of the road can communicate with the custodian in regard to shipments, or other business that they have with the railroad company. Also the custodian may telephone telegraph messages to the agent at Lincoln or Bennet, and receive telegraph messages from the agent at Lincoln or Bennet that are not sent to parties living at Cheney and vicinity. 16.

FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman I The Blair Telephone Company operates a telephone system in shington County with three exchanges and tributary farm lines, its dqnarters being at Blair. It recently purchased the competing pro - ty of the Northwestern Bell Telpehone Company at Blair and has •e effected a consolidation, the purchase and consolidation having n approved by the Commission in Application No. 6381. It has sady made substantial improvements in the consolidated property 1 has others in prospect. In tile purchase of the Bell property ami additions and betterments noted, it has made a substantial ex diture of funds, a considerable portion of which is now represented notes payable and bills payable. The present application requests authority to issue #60, 000 of the company's negotiable bonds to be dated June 1, 1927, and to mature June 1, 1942, bearing interest at six per cent per annum, payable semi - annually. Such bonds are to be secured by a trust deed and mortgage running to the United States Trust Company as trustees, the same to be a first lien on all property of the company, real, personal or mixed, now owned or hereafter acquired. The company has outstanding $48, - 200 of common stock. Manifestly, the issuance of $60,000 would violate the provisions of Section 462, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. The mortgage has been executed, however, the bonds printed, and all the proceedings for the issuance completed. The company, therefore, asks that the full amount of the $69,096 be authorized, but only $32,000 be issued at this time, the remainder to be issued at a subsequent time, subject to the approval of the Commission, it being understood, of course, that the relationship between bonds and stm-k will be made to meet the statutory requirements. I Applicant paid $12,000 tor the property acquired from the Nbrth - stern Bell Telephone Company. It owes $9,1)0(1 of this amount. addition, it has bills payable of approximately $15,000 for addition, 1 betterments already placed. It has approximately $10,000 worth material on the ground ready for placement and estimates that by ! time the work of rehabilitating the property is completed, at least 0,000 in additions and betterments will have been extended. Ap - cant keeps its accounts in accordance with the uniform system escribed by this Commission. It follows, therefore, that it makes &gt;per charges against the depreciation reserve for property displaced, the opinion of the Commission, the proceeds of the bonds as applied ■ are reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation and )uld be approved, subject to conditions. </seg>

Mr. McGregor also owns and o era) miers Home Telephone Company with exchanges at GibLon aiul •lton. Since purchasing th" Arcadia property, he lias been making iro\c3ients thereon, ami contemplates further overhauling and re - istruetion of the plant, which was in a badly rundown condition ■a acquired. He alleges that present rates produce insufficient emie to operate the plant properly and give the kind of service which the community is entitled. For that reason, he lias tiled this •lieation asking tor an increase in rates. I A hearing was held on the application at Arcadia on the evening Friday, June 17. 1!I27. An evening session was requested by ap - [•ant in order to afford a better opportunity for farmers and other Irons to attend. It should be said in this connection that the own - of the property went to unusual lengths in acquainting his patrons th the present physical and financial condition of the property and to &gt;ri\ e them the reasons for the re dition to publishing in the local new: ■sing practically a full page lor this to each subscriber going into minute the business.

In addition to replacing poles, stringing new wire and adding new poles and iruys. it is proposed to divide a Dumber of the lines so as to re - duce the number on each line and thus afford more prompt and satis factory service. The territory covered by a number of the tarn line - is very rough and it is necessary to follow circuitous routes in reach - ing subscribers. An unusually lariie territory for a given number ■&gt;: subscribers is, therefore, covered, the average per farm subscriber be ing: 1.2 miles of pole line. It is estimated that the total cost of re - building the farm property will amount to $6,634.43 of this amount $2. (ISO. 84 will be for replacements and will be charged to the depreci - ation reserve. This leaves $4,567.49 as a net addition to 'he proper!;. account. kAs soon as it can be reached, it is the plan to rebuild the town t, although this will probably not be completed within a period of years.

The present expenses exclusive of interest or return on investment are $7,615.08. tit is anticipated that with the improvement in plant involving the litional investment, maintenance costs will increase. Applicant also of the opinion that the wages now paid to operators are insufficient il that a scale for the three operators of $55, $50 and $40 per nth should be provided with $10 per month for Sunday and vacation ief. These salaries are not excessive and are probably necessary efficient help is maintained. Some items of commercial expense I be redneed as the owner expects to handle the bookkeeping at the </seg>

The total estimated expenses, exclusive of return on the investment, are estimated at $8,447.37. Deducting the estimated expenses from the proposed revenue, a net income of $1,375.13 would be realized. Applicant makes claim to a fair value of $25,Mt. He arrives at this figure by taking; the total book cost of the property and adding to it the cost of replacements proposed in the farm territory, plus materials on hand, and deducting: therefrom the amount of the depreciation reserve, which at the present time is $ 10,1) 12.8,"). This leaves a depreciated property account of approximately $25,000. Ap - plicant is paying interest time on $12,500. It to this #e were to add the 94,567 which it is proposed to expend in immediate improvements, we would have an investment of at least $17,000. The net income on this amount would be approximately 8 percent. If figured on the $25,000 claimed by applicant as the fair value of its property, the income would be only 5% per cent. I Applicant owns a half interest in three toll lines naming to neigh - ring towns of Comstock, Loup City and Ansley, and a toll connee - n at Ord. These are all metallic lines 'with the exception of the line Ansley. The gross revenue from these toll lines in 1916 was $1,558.- This is about $1100 more than would be received by applicant the toll lines are not owned and it received nothing but a eoiBBtts - n for handling the terminal business. The rather large toll revenue • a property of this size tends to distort the revenue showing and obably explains why the exchange rates have been on a eompara - ely low basis in recent years. The toll lines along with the farm jperty are now in urgent need of rebuilding and this overhauling is The rate of $1.1)5 net per month for farm line service is slightly higher than in other independent exchanges of similar size. This appears to be justified, however, by the fact that the farm lines are considerably longer in this exchange, and the topography of the country calls for greater maintenance expense. I Applicant has submitted detailed figures covering the cost of 'nishing switching service to sixty-four farmers "who own their es. The result is to show a cost per subscriber of $7.02 per year, rate of sixty cents per month is, therefore, asked. It is further iposed to make a gross switching rate of $8.40 per ye;ir. with a luction of ten cents per month if payment is made during the first j months of the semi-annual period. The prevailing switching rate Nebraska among independent companies is fifty cents per month. $6.00 per year. While the figures submitted by applicant apparent - have been quite carefulK prepared, they result necessarily from :her arbitrary divisions of property and expense. A careful valna - n of the property involved might or might no' sustain the conclu- </seg>
            <seg id="p339">339 sions. The added length of farm lines and their increased mainten - anee do nut, of course, affect this rate, since the farmers themselves maintain this portion of the property. We ;ire of the opinion, there - fore, thai a gross rate of $7.20 per year with a 10-cent per month discount, under the terms proposed, which would leave a net rate of $6.00 per year, would be more reasonable. This will result in a slight reduction in gross revenue. I With respect to the proposed rates as a whole, with the exception ed, the Commission is of the opinion that they are reasonable and essary, and should be approved. They compare favorably with es for similar service in neighboring towns. Since it is the plan proceed with the reconstruction of the farm lines at once, and since i service during: this period of reconstruction will not be of the best, ■ new rates will not be made effective until September 1, 1927. ring the intervening sxity-day period a substantial improvement in property should be accomplished.

It has an authorized capital stock of $1,000,000 divided into 6,000 shares of preferred stock and 4,000 shares of common stock, of the par value of $100 each.

            <seg id="p342">342 and have been approved by the Commission in a piece-meal manner as the development of the property has required. Petitioner now desires to eall the eight per cent preferred stock and the seven per cent bonds at a premium of three per cent and to capitalize additions and betterments in the sum of ■■£125,300 which has been added to the property from March 31, 1925, to April 30, 1927. The amount of the securities retired also includes the discount on the new issues to be sold. The above requirement results in a total sum of $553,450. The requirements for refunding and additions and betterments nre summarized below: I The new issue exceeds the immediate requirements of the company the sum of $41,550: Applicant now has seven per cent preferred &gt;ck in its treasury which has been approved by this Commission the par amount of $6,100, this will be deducted from the securities plied for, otherwise there would be duplication of approval by, the remission to this extent. A detailed statement of the additions and betterments which mts attached to the application shows pole line construction, substations and equipment required for efficient operation and extension of the service. The above includes a transmission line to connect with the Harvard Light and Power plant which applicant has recently pur - chased. The purchase price of the Harvard plant is listed with the addi - tions at $58,160.31. This is a direct current plant which must be changed to operate with alternating current. This means that changes will he required in the distribution system and alternating generators will be used in connection "with the power plant which will serve as stand-by equipment as the town will be supplied by transmission lines. The situation requires; a careful study to distinguish between charges Redemption of bonds $300,000 Bond premium, 3% 9,000 Call 8% preferred stock 80,000 Premium on preferred stock, 3% 2,400 Additions and betterments 125,300 •Discount : 36,750 Total ; $/)o3.4^i) The securities applied for are listed as follows: ~ Common Stock 18.90&lt;\ 7% Preferred stock 76,100 'irst Mtjr. 5V2 '&lt;c ■ol )otl M .. .. .. 500,000 Total $595,000 </seg>

The Com - mission will reserve jurisdiction over the amount which is charged to fixed capital by return of the purchase of this property and the cost of the changes which are required. Petitioner described the new construction and equipment that will be required within the coming year, these will cost approximately $50,000. Applicant will have securities in its treasury after the pro - posed financing has been completed to pay for these additions as they are required. tThe testimony shows that there was a credit to surplus for that r ending December 31, 1926, of approximately $9,000 after oper - g expenses, interests, taxes, depreciation, dividends on the pre - -ed stock and eight per cent had been paid on the common stock standing. The earning power of the company should increase under new situation which includes an interchange of power between the licant and the neighboring utility, also a reduction of the interest rges on the bonds and preferred stock. This is largely a refunding proposition for the purpose of secur - ing lower interest rates on the long term debt and a reduction of the dividend rate on part of the preferred stock.

It also includes ."&gt;00 miles telephone circuits devoted to toll purposes. I The consolidated balanr-e sheet of the Platte Valley Telephone opany and the Wehn Telephone Company as of April 30, 1927. allows iss assets in the amount of $827,0.55.44. Deferred deliit items are luded in the sum of .$8,022.13. The plant investment account in - ding construction in progress is $761,121.64. The liabilities include )ital stock with par value of $324,700; a funded debt of $165,000 1 bills and accounts payable in the sum of $116,569.06. These lia - ties will be retired and cancelled from the proceeds of the sale of the urities applied for. I A substantial portion of the properties were constructed under price sis which prevailed before and during the early part of the European r. The prices of telephone materials and equipment are 50% higher n the prewar level. Therefore, the appreciation in the dollar in - ted over that shown by the books, is fairly consistent with the pur - se price. Hagenah * Eriekson, a telephone engineering company nl Chicago, Illinois, inventoried and appraised the properties of the eompanj June 1, 1927, with a finding of an aggregate value-reproduction &lt;■!&gt;&gt;■ new less depreciation for the two properties of $1,083,092.00 and ex - clusive of going concern value. $934,092.00. The total of the securities when sold will net the applicant $935,000.00. The new owners will also be required to advance approximatey $50,000.00 for additions and betterments which will be required in the immediate future. I Net earnings after operating expenses, taxes, interest ami depreci - on for the year 1926 were $60,550.75. There will be a reduction of (rating expens:' by reason of the saving in salaries in the amount of 666.61 which will increase the net available for bond interest and idends on preferred stock to $68,217.36. There will also lie a saving interest charges and the general managers salary which will further rease this amount to $72,000 or $73,000.

Applicant's o ( ik&gt; were adjusted at that time to conform to the valuation figures. 'estimony presented by applicant indicates that considerable money las been expended in improving the plant since the Commission's aluation. Therefore, undoubtedly the present value of the plant is excess of that shown for 192."&gt;. The liabilities side of applicant's balance sheet, after the pro - .1 financing, would appear approximately as follows: In lace of the State Constitution. Article X, Section V, which pro - des thnt, No dividend shall be declared or distributed except ! net earnings after paying all operating expenses, including a depreciation reserve sufficient to keep the investment intact". [s necessary to determine whether or not surplus now shown on ap - :ant's books is earned, at least to the extent of the proposed stock idend. The balance sheet appearing herein has been based upon sicaJ valuation made by the Commission in 1925, and purports to w subsequent changes in plant accounts. The valuation was com - ■d by applying estimated original cost units. It is obvious tluit the present depreciation reserve adequately pro- Its the property and in fact may be more than adequate since the •mil discloses that considerable improvements and replacements have •n made to the plant since the Commission's valuation at which time ■ reserve amounted to $8,301.91.

Such practice would reduce profits and permit of accumulations in the de - preciation reserve since an allowance has been made for both main - tenance and replacements and is included as an item of expense whether expended or not. These accounting irregularities will be cor - rected by the Commission's accounting department. (By tracing the capitalization of the company from 1912 to the sent time, we find that applicant has given notes from time to time required and has nut issued capita] stock. The largest amount &lt;&gt;t es outstanding during the company's history are those at present standing; in amount $7,055.40. The growth in plant since the or - ization, less depreciation accrued, is clearly in excess of the notes 1 stock issued, as has been disclosed by the physical valuation ed on original cost, and the financial history of the company. •refore, it is reasonable t&lt;. assume that the excess plant, at Least the extent of the proposed dividend, has been built from revenues profits.

The question of what mighl reasonable rate for common battery service at Sidney can be jached later. Petitions reading as follows: "We, the lOllov )scribers to the Sidney telephone exchange, respectfully reqi that you do not increase our present rates, for m presented at the time of the hearing signed by more than 20&lt; company's subscribers. In presentiiur the petitions, w Gra Iitified that the signers represented all classes oi subscribi ited it as his personal opinion that in this manner they de ice their opposition to higher rates. The committee repr itestants also stressed particularly in the memorandum bri them, the inequity which they fee! follows forcing at a burl higher type of service on subscribers in a (riven commnnit the subscribers themselves desire. On the other hand, representative business men of Sidney the witness stand and indicated their desire for the higher type ser vice at rates which the Commission might find fair and reasonable. They were unanimous in agreeing that Sidney was enjoying a splendid growth, had taken its place as one of the outstanding cities of west - am Nebraska, that its trade territory was highly prosperous, and thej insisted that the telephone industry in Sidney should keep apace of the times. It was their notion that the attitude of Sidney folks was that the best of telephone service was none too good, and that they were willing to pay a fair and reasonable charge to secure it. </seg>
            <seg id="p361">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 361 With such absolutely contradictory testimony concerning the de - sires of subscribers themselves for common battery service, it is but natural that the Commission finds itself in a quandary in attempting to reach conclusions as to just 'what type of service Sidney patrons do desire. The Commission is reluctant to force a higher type service upon subscribers of a community who are entirely satisfied with lower grade service. On the other hand, it feels that under ordinary cir - cumstances the telephone industry should keep step with the growth and development of communities, in the class of service furnished. I In the instant case, there is another factor which must be con - •red, i.e., the practical problem of furnishing magneto service at exchange the size of Sidney. Magneto service is 'well adapted to smaller exchange. However, with the growth of the exchange, re comes a time when magneto service becomes impractical. It nits in slowing down the service and making it otherwise unsatis - tory. It is also true that it finally reaches the point where it ap - aches, and might even exceed, the cost of common battery service, ause of its inherent impracticableness for larger exchanges. I Applicant alleges that this is the situation that no* confronts it Sidney. Witness Livermore so testified, stating that if magneto lice were continued, a certain reconstruction program in the im - diate future was faced, and that the company would find it nec - ary to ask for additional rates. Witness Johnson corroborated &gt;, stating that if magneto service were to be continued, the company nld find it necessary to enlarge its central office equipment and rv on a reconstruction program of the outside plant, with an at - dnnt necessity for increased rates. This witness also testified that ney was the only exchange of its size in Nebraska owned by them, ich had magneto service, all others having been previously cut over common battery. I Therefore, having in mind the recognized impracticableness of jneto service for the larger exchange, and the present inade - &lt;•&gt;■ of both central office equipment and outside construction at ney, and the necessity for a reconstruction program, whether the nt be made common battery, or continued magneto, it is the Com - sion's conclusion that the interests of the subscriber will be best served by authorizing a schedule of exchange rates at this time eh will permit the company to conduct its reconstruction program the future upon a common battery basis. The company proposes following schedule of rates for common battery service: [THIN THE BASE RATE AREA Individual line, business Individual line, residence Two-party line, business $4.75 (a) 2.75 (a) 4.00 (a) </seg>
            <seg id="p362">362 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT Two-party line, residence Four-party line, residence 2.25 (a) 2.00 (a) OUTSIDE THE BASE RATE AREA, but within the exchange area: Rural line residence, metallic 2.25 (a) Service station (annual rate) 7.6(1 (b) OTHER RATES AND REGULATIONS : rA discount of 25 cents is allowed from this rate each month in which the subscriber's entire account, including; any balance due, is paid on or before the loth day of that month. r Payable annually in advance. A discount of $1.00 is allowed from this annual charge if paid within the first two months of the twelve months for which the bill is rendered. t Witness Johnson stated that this is the schedule which applicant s in effect at its smaller common battery exchanges, and is the rest schedule which it has published for common battery service Nebraska. In substance, it is the schedule recently authorized ap - ;ant for similar service at Gothenburg, following petition presented citizens of this community praying for common battery service. The proposed schedule would increase business individual rates $1.00 per month; business two-party 75 cents per month: residence one-party 50 cents per month: residence two-party 25 cents per month: residence four party 25 cents per month. No change is involved in the rates for rural metallic service. A reduction of •"&gt; cents per month is provided for service station subscribers. The rates for business and residence extension stations remain the same. It is observed that the individual residence subscriber under the proposed schedule, could se - cure service at the rate now paid, by subscribing to two-party residence service; the two-party residence subscriber could secure service at the rate which is now paid, by subscribing to the residence four-party ser - vice. The individual business subscriber, by subscribing for two-parti business would pay but 25 cents additional per month. It is thus noted that by taking a slightly inferior service, subscribers can secure ser - vice under the proposed rates at a similar monthly charge. Applicant has in mind major construction program for Sicinev. It contemplates the purchase of a lot in the downtown business dis - trict, and the erection thereon of a new building, the installation of new central office equipment of common battery type, and the replace - ment of all magneto subscribers' sets in the exchange limits, with com - mon battery sets. In addition, certain aerial wire is to be replaced with cable and the pole lead down the main street of the town is to be removed therefrom, and located otherwise. The company is paying $4,000 for the lot, which it regards as ideally located. It proposes to expend an additional $10,600 in the construction of a one story brick building, a garage to harmonize with the central office building, to- </seg>

Applicant has presented a number of comprehensive exhibits in connection with the application. Applicant witnesses were cross-ex - amined at some length by protestants, and by accountant Devoe of the Commission. It was stated that the accounts of the company are kept in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the United States, and also prescribed for Class A telephone companies by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, applicant being a Class A company. The figures which were presented in the various exhibits were figures taken from the company's accounting books and records, except in so far as they involved estimates, in which case they were based on the past exper - iences of the company under similar conditions. In all of the exhibits, whether relating to operating income and expenses, or to valuation matters, the set-up has been made on the basis of exchange service only, all matters with respect to toll having been eliminated in so far as possible. Where impossible to entirely eliminate toll, proper credits and debits have been made as between toll and exchange service.

            <seg id="p365">365 The items involved in the make-up of "Total Telephone Operat - ing Revenue (Except Licensee Revenue Dr.)" are self-explanatory. As previously stated, revenue from toll has been excluded as have all ex - penses involved in the furnishing of toll service. Accordingly, the task involved in reaching the final figures of "Total Telephone Oper - ating Revenue" is largely a mathematical one, involving the applying of the rate schedule used, to the number of subscribers in the different classes. The Commission desires to discuss certain items involved in "Total Telephone Operating Expenses and Deductions", particularly those to which protestants directed their cross-examination, and concerning which thev referred in their memorandum brief. TRAFFIC EXPENSE I The item of traffic expense in amount of $5,219 is an estimate, :essarily so because it is applicable to a common battery board, ereas actual traffic experience at Sidney is on the basis of oper- Dn of a magneto board. This figure has to do with exchange servite" ely. and is composed in the main, of operators' wages. According testimony, at the time of the hearing, applicant had in its employe operators. The applicant made very careful studies of toll and ex - inge volume, and allocated traffic expense as between these two a basis of relationship of volume of work. It might be added that figure of .$5,219 charged to exchange service, is less than 45 per t of total traffic expense, including additional traffic expense be - se of to'l, and amounting to $11,299 The Commission feels that this x-ation does no injustice to the exchange user. No criticism was ?cted at salaries paid by applicant for operators at the Sidney ex- DEPRECIATION The item of depreciation in amount of $3,199 is one toward which Etestants directed much cross-examination. It is now generally re - nized by Commissions and courts as a proper charge against earn - s. The Supreme Court of the United States said in Ivnoxville v. sxville Water Co. 212 U. S. 1 : "Before coming to the question of profit at all, the com - pany is entitled to earn a sufficient sura annually to provide not only for current repairs, but for making good the depreciation and replacing the parts of the property when they come to the end of their life. The company is not bound to see its property gradually waste without making provision out of earnings for its replacement. It is entitled to see that from earnings the value of the property invested is kept unimpaired, so that, at the end of any given term of years, the original investment remains as it was at the beginning." </seg>
            <seg id="p366">366 The annual depreciation charge proposed is approximately 4.4 per cent of the cost of depreciable property. It is approximately thirteen per cent of total revenue. This seems to be not unreason - able, 'when allowances made by state commissions for depreciation of telephone properties range generally between tour and eight per cent of the investment in^the property. Similarly the provisions for de - preciation has usually required in the neighborhood of from twelv to twenty per cent of total revenues. THE FOUR PER CENT CONTRACT (Another item of operating expenses is entitled "Licensee Revenue, This is an amount paid, under what is called the license con - it, to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. It has been need within the last year and a half from 4' 2 per cent to four cent of the gross exchange revenue, excluding revenue from ser - b station subscribers and certain miscellaneous revenue. This nraission, in a previous case, criticized this expense item. 15 N. S. ('. 213-282 (245). The federal court, however, refused to sustain B criticism of the Commission, when the case referred to was ap - led. 18 X. S. R. C. 490-497. The courts, in fact, have quite gen - 11 v upheld the validity of this contract. S. W. Telephone Co. v. Pub- Service Commission. 282 V. S. 276: Houston v. S. W. Telephone , 259 D. S. 318. kWe have carefully checked other operating expenses. While it i&gt; ably true that there will be some variation from the estimate un - actual operating conditions, there seems to be no occasion for cism. FAIR VALUE AND RATE OF RETURN There remains the question of fair value, and the return thereon which the company shall be allowed. Witness Livermore testified that, after common battery installation, applicant will have at its Sidney exchange, a book cost figure of 197.84:?. Kliminating there - from property costs which should be classified as toll, we find a total estimated book cost figure of exchange plant, including general equip - ment of $1,239, amounting to $74,126. Witness Sxrancutt in Applicant's Exhibit L sets forth cost of reproduction new, of plant which will re - main in service amounting to $22,767. and of plant to be placed, amounting to $51,672, or a total cost of reproduction new. undepre - ciated, of $74,439. Current prices in effect May 1, 1927, were used. From this is deducted depreciation on a basis of 93.94 per cent com - posite condition, leaving a figure of $69,928. Working capital in amount of $2,083, and going value on a basis of ten per cent of eost of rewoduction new in amount of $7,443 is added, giving a final figure </seg>
            <seg id="p367">367 These figures have been carefully checked by the Commission's engineering department and no objection to them is offered by it. t Excluding going value and working capital, it is noted that the ik cost figure, and the cost of reproduction new, depreciated, are far apart. This is due to the fact that a large portion of the nt will be new construction, original cost and reproduction new, refore, being one and the same figure; furthermore, a considerable turn of the plant which will remain in service was placed in 1921, probably substantially higher unit costs than exist now. t Protestants called the Commission's attention to the fact that property of applicant in Sidney was turned in to county officials taxation purposes, at a much lesser figure than they claimed for e-making purposes. The Commission is aware of the fact that such crepancies exist in public utility properties, similarly as they do properties not devoted to the public use. Neither commissionsi nor rts have attached importance to this figure in reaching conclusions to fair value. Protestants also objected vigorously to the inclusion of the item covering going valne. The courts have recognized this as a proper element of value. In a recent decision, the Supreme Court of the Inked States said: "The decisions of this court declare: 'That there is an element of value in an assembled and established plant, doing business and earning money, over one not thus advanced, is self evident. This element of value is a property right and should be considered in determining the value of the property upon "which the owner has a right to make a fair return when the same is privately owned, although dedicated to public use.' " MeArdle v. Indianapolis Water Co., 47 Sup. Cfc 144. I In this same ease, the court held that the evidence fully sustained per cent for going value. In other cases, the courts have upheld per cent, and even more, of the cost of reproduction. I However, the Commission is making no definite finding in this se as to whether going value should be included as an element in the ;e base for earning purposes. With it excluded, the variation in the :e of return is only slight. Since it plays no important part, rela - ely speaking, the conclusion of the Commission as to the properiety including it, is withheld. tThe Commission, under holdings of the courts, must recognize element of value and will not object to the figure which the com - y presents. Any percentage reduction which the Commission might ct would result in no appreciable change in the rate structure. </seg>
            <seg id="p368">368 In conclusion, applying net telephone earnings available for in - terest, under the proposed schedule of rates, we find the following : If the estimated book cost figure of exchange plant in amount of $75, - 126 plus working capital in amount of $2,083 be used as the rate base, with no allowance for going value, the company would have a rate o v return in amount of 7.8 per cent. Again, if the figure representing cost of reproduction new, depreciated, plus "working capital plus goins; value be used, the rate of return amounts to 7.54 per cent. It is prob - able that the figure of fair value as a basis for earnings falls some - where between the above mentioned valuation figures. t Protestants objected to a rate of return in this amount. How - the Commission believes that it is not unreasonable, having in holding of the courts. In McArdle v. Indianapolis Water Com - , supra, the court said : "The evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the rate of seven per cent found by the Commission. And recent de - cisions support a higher rate of return." And in a Nebraska case, the court said "We cannot approve the finding that no rate yielding as much as six per cent upon the invested capital could be re - garded as confiscatory, in view of the undisputed evidence, ac - cepted by the master, that eight per cent was the lowest rate sought and generally obtained as a return upon capital invested in banking, merchandising, and other businesses in the communi - ty; seven per cent being the legal rate of interest in Nebraska." Lincoln Gas Co. v. City of Lincoln, 250 r. s. 256. It is the opinion of the Commission, therefore, that the rates for exchange service which applicant proposes at Sidney, are reason - able. They 'will be approved, to become effective at such time as ap - plicant is in a position to furnish common battery service. It is un - derstood that it proposes to undertake its reconstruction program immediately. The application, in so far as it proposes increases for certain supplemental service, is denied. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, be, and the same is, hereby authorized to publish and collect at its Sidney, Nebraska, exchange, the following schedule of rates for common bat - tery service, the same to become effective on and after the installa - tion of equipment necessary to render such common battery service: </seg>

            <seg id="p370">370 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Chairman: I The application of the Chicago, Burlington at Qaincy Kailroad npany to discontinue agency service at Ayr, Nebraska, and substi - e therefor custodian service, recites that Ayr is a village eleven es southwest of Hastings, in Adams County, with a population of t inhabitants or less; that there are only four industries at Ayr, ) grocery stores, an elevator and a lumber yard; that the people Ayr do most of their traveling by automobiles; that the force em - yed at the station consists of an agent and the expense thereof is 13.15 per month; that the applicant can employ a custodian who 1 keep the station open and handle car orders by telephone, the oe as other stations where similar service is provided, and that s substitution will save the railroad company about $1,000 per r. Hearing was held on this application in the depot at Ayr, on Thursday, July 14, 1927, after due notice had been given to all in - terested parties. The railroad company produced exhibits showing the amount of business transacted at the station for the years li»"J. r &gt; and 1926, which is as follows: In 1926. the Burlington received a revenue on car load shipments from Ayr Ice Track of $1,650.50 and from Ayr Junction *1. 668.78. These shipments were billed by the agent at Ayr, but the business transacted at Ayr Junction and Ayr Ice Track was not contained in the figures in the exhibit above introduced. After this Exhibit No. 1 had been presented by the applicant company. Exhibit No. 2, being a letter from H. C. Holzbach, auditor of Freight Accounts, was intro - duced to show that the figures presented in Exhibit No. 1 would not correspond with the figures filed with the Railway Commission, as the railway company had made an estimate of the percentage on for - eign shipments in order to obtain the actual C.

            <seg id="p371">371 l&gt;\ Mr. I'owell. rate expert of the Commission, and it has been found by him as follows : "Pursuant to your request, I have checked Exhibit No. 1 in Application No. 8779 against the monthly station reports on file with the Commission for the stations of Ayr, Ayr Ice Track, Ayr Junction. I find the total freight and passenger traffic for the year 1925 and 1926 for the three stations as shown by the monthly report to be as follows: 1925 1926 $16,105.89 16,966.05 The same figures as per Exhibit No. 1 are: 1925 $18,262.50 1926 17,627.35 "As regards Exhibit No. 2 introduced in this record, it is true that the Burlington figures its foreign interline traffic on a 50-50 basis on the monthly station reports while in its state - ment of revenue to the Interstate Commerce Commission it takes the actual amount that accrues under the legal division between the Burlington and the foreign road handling the shipment. However, this class of traffic at Ayr must be exceedingly small and could not possibly account for the difference in the above figures. "The reports as made by the Burlington to the Commission are based on the total revenue accruing to the Burlington for the haul on its line, according to a check made by Miss Fern Parker in Chicago on April SO, from which I quote the following: 'All local revenue is reported on an interstate shipment re - ceived or forwarded. That is, on a car moving from Ayr to Chicago over the Burlington, total charges $80.00 to Chicago, Ayr is credited with $80.00 forwarded and vice versa.' " I Disregarding the estimate as stated by H. C. Holzbach in Exhibit . 2 and •taking the records in the Commissions office, furnished them the railroad company in their monthly reports, the total revenue tne company at the station of Ayr, Ayr Ice Track and Ayr Junction 1925 is $16,165.89 and in 1926, $16,966.05. There was consider - e testimony introduced by protestants against the application being mted owing to the fact that all of the ice shipments, except those pped to the railroad company and the dealer himself are shipped h hill of lading and sight draft attached, also the lumber and coal t i&gt;- shipped to Ayr, is in a great many instances purchased through kers and diverted from the original place of shipment to Ayr, which uld complicate the prepayment of freight. Another contention that is made by witnesses for the protestants was that in the yeaT 1925 </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT Ii 19:20 there were very short crops raised tributary to Ayr, which de the volume of business subnormal and that with the present &gt;d small grain crop, prospects for a good corn crop, the volume of siness would be very much larger .during 1927 than during 1925, or !6, and the protestants felt that this was a very inopportune time the railroad company to ask for so radical a change in the class oi' vice to be furnished at the station if the application was granted, was admitted by testimony of the protestants that owing to the ivelled roads, a great deai of the less than carload ami passenger siness had been lost to the company by the use of the automobile 1 truck, but that owing to the inconvenience in the billing of grain I live stock and other freight out and the shipment of lumber, eoal 1 other commodities on which freight would have to be prepaid, it the station should be in charge of an agent with authority to sign s of lading, collect freight and sell^ tickets. The telegraph business furnished at the station for lSt2."&gt; amounted to $117.97 and in 192b, $151.64. The revenue from this source t&lt;&gt; the railroad company would not amount to more than .+60 alter the agents commission was deducted. The expense of a telegraph agent over a non-telegraph agent is twelve ceits per hour, which at eight hours per day for the 313 working days a year, would amount to $300.48, so that during the year 1925 the railroad company was required to absorb a loss on telegraph business of $229.73, and in 192(i they were required to absorb a loss of $209. 50. As the inhabitants of Ayr and vicinity have direct telephone connection with Hastings and Blue Hill, this telegraph service could be handled by the operators at Hastings or Blue Hill without any expense to the railroad company and with little or no inconvenience to the citizens: desiring to use t*he telegraph service. There was no objection raised by any of the witnesses for the protestants, against the eliminating of the telegraph service, as it did not seem to be of much concern to the patrons, o^wing to the fact that they would have this telephone connection with Hastings and Blue Hill, where tele - graph service could be obtained during all hours of the day and night. As telegraph service at Ayr is not necessary for the operating of trains, the Commission is of the opinion that where economies can be practiced, without inconvenience to the public, the railroad company should be permitted to eliminate the unnecessary expense. The Commission does not believe that a telegraph operator is necessary for the convenience or the transaction of the business at Ayr. either for the railroad com - pany or the public, but with the volume of business being furnished the company by the patrons of the road at Ayr, Ayr Joe Track and Ayr Junction which are all being billed from the station at Ayr, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the application of the Chicago, Burlington &lt;fe Quincy Railroad Company to discontinue agency service at Ayr and furnish custodian service should be denied, but that if the company so desire they may discontinue telegraph agency service and substitute therefor non-telegraph agency service. </seg>

A hearing &lt;&gt;n the application was held at Franklin on August 18, 19"27. I The manager for applicant company prepared and submitted as an ibit at the hearing a rather complete study of alleged costs of ren - ing switching service. The general plan of finding the cost was ;d upon the use of applicant's equipment and service by the rural companies. All plant equipment so used was inventoried and costs thereof applied from the books of the company. Central ice equipment was divided upon a basis of the number of calls inating from the switched subscribers as compared with applicant's scribers. The number of calls was found from an actual count ot inating calls.

Maintenance and depreciation on the portion of plant estimated be used by the switched companies was computed at nine per cent, d a rate of return at seven per cent. Taxes and insurance were ap - ed at actual cost of plant used by the rural line companies.

Office rent and operators' salaries were pro-rated on the basis of the peg count theretofore mentioned. tThe amounts charged to officers' salaries for the year were divided in the basis of peg count, the annual salary being $1200, one-ninth which was taken as a proper amount for allocation, since in the nion of the manager one-ninth of the time was devoted to operation tThe Commission is unable to follow the reasoning of applicant h respect to this particular item. It is doubtful if the number of Is through the switchboard indicate the amount of the manager's ary applicable to the switching company. Furthermore, since part of the officer's salary item is chargeable to maintenance lense, it is doubted if any part of it should be eliminated from the t study before pro-rated. A revision of this item, if it should be iject to revision at all, would result in an increase in the cost ;of ving the switched subscribers. The same reasoning also applied the division of the item of "Office Supplies and Expenses", which 5 pro-rated on the peg count basis. Compensation insurance applicant also allocated on the basis of the peg count or 23%, which again is perhaps subject to some criticism. The item might better be measured on the basis of the amount of labor devoted to the switching service, which would include lineman's salaries as well as operators' wages. If the suggested revision was made, ap - plicant testified that the amount chargeable to the switched companies would be reduced $7.00 per year for 149 subscribers, t Applicant has included as a part of the cost of rendering switching lice an item of $35.88 to cover nine per cent depreciation and niain - ance expense and seven per cent return on free service trunk lines other exchanges. The proportion of the investment used in the ve calculation was found by applying twenty-three per cent resulting m the peg count to the total book cost of the lines. We find no d reason for the inclusion of this item and believe that the free net lines should be considered as a part of the whole plant and not regated for the purpose of this computation. The elimination of &gt; item would result in a reduction of total costs per switching sub - iber of approximately twenty-four cents per year. tA recapitulation of the costs .chargeable to the rural lines above erred to, before any revision suggested, discloses a total cost per itched subscriber of $6.31 per annum. After applying the suggested </seg>
            <seg id="p376">376 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT corrections the total cost would still remain in excess of $6.00 per annum. tA study of applicant's financial statements as shown in annual orts to the Commission for the past four years discloses an average lual income available for interest and dividends of $782.83. Ap - :ant's statement shows a book cost of property undepreciated of ,466.01 at December 31, 192b. Increased revenue which would re - t on account of the proposed increase in switching rates on the is of the number of subscribers served on March 31, 1927, would $298.00 per year. It is obvious that the proposed increase in rates ild not yield an excessive return. ■ The Commission is of the opinion that the application with respect the switching rates is reasonable and should be approved. i Applicant asks the Commission's approval to the method of col - ting toll charges from the agent or officer of the rural line or eom - ly rather than from the individual. It is unnecessary for the Coot - ision to enter an order in this particular matter since the Commis - d has always held and the practice has been uniform to collect from officer or agent of a rural switched line rather than the individual ce the contract is with the company or line as a whole and not the ividual. The Commission will not rule on this part of the applica - a, but offers the above suggestion for the benefit of the raanage - nt. The agreement should be worked out between the parties in - ved. Applicant also asks the Commission to approve of a rate of ten cents per annum for attachments in cases where applicant's pole lines are used to carry w^res other than its own. This matter iirvolves a contractual relation between the companies involved over which the Commission has never asserted jurisdiction.

The above securities were issued and sold with the approval of this Commission and the Commission has also approved stock in the amount of .$"29,700 par value, which may be sold to the public and is held in the treasury of th' company. tThis application requests authority to issue and sell bonds in the amount of $27,000 to pay for additions and betterments and re - ee working capital invested in fixed property. I The record shows that applicant has placed additions and better - nts and extensions of plant which cost $64,527.29. This includes 11,951.76 which is the remainder to be paid under the terms of a se contract tor the purchase of a Ueisel engine, which is now in - lled and under operation. The above expenditures were made be - ■en August 31, 1926, and May 31, 1027. Applicant also shows that impended $3,312 between April 1 and August 31, 1926, which was not lulled in the above figure. Under Application Xo. 6484 petitioner was permitted to sell its own &gt;tock and credit operating expenses with the actual cost. Two thou - sand dollars 'will be added to the above to reimburse the company for this expense. The discount on the bonds applied for will amount to *1.350. The total brought down to this point amounts to $71,189.29 described as available for capitalization. The stock held .in the trea - asury in the par amount of $29,700, plus the bonds applied for amount to $56,700. </seg>

The difference bet ween this figure and the total invested in additions and betterments may be accounted tor by the investment of surplus and reserves in plant. Dividends have been earned, hut not paid on the common stock. Earnings available for surplus and the common stock for the year ending May 31, 1927, were $5,802. New service connections will be made during the remainder of the year 1927, which should increase this figure substantially.

Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6796 I the Matter of the Application of the Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha for a Permit to Issue 37,500 Shares of its Common Cap - ital Stock. Appearances For the applicant — Senator Norria Brown, attorney For the Commission — B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. BY THE COMMISSION Applicant herein ,is a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of Nebraska. It is engaged in owning, oper - ating and controlling yards, pens and railroad facilities for the pur - pose of handling live stock in transit and for sale. It has an authorized common capital stock of $12,000,000 par value divided into 120,000 shares of the par value of $ 100 each of "which $7,496,300 par value is outstanding. Petitioner has applied to this Commission to issue 37,500 additional shares to the stockholders pro rata to the shares as they are now held. The basis for the above increase in applicant's fixed capital liabili - ties is the net earnings of the company since the year 1903 available for dividends and reinvested in the property of the company as re - flected in surplus as shown by the balance sheet at the time of the application. I The record shows that the company was organized and began ness in 1883 and during the first few years of operation it made ations of stock and real estate in various amounts to different </seg>
            <seg id="p381">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 381 meat packing concerns such as Swift, Armour, Cudahy and others to build plants near the yards and use the facilities of the company.This practice might have had an influence on the plant investment account and the capital liabilities as a measure of the investment depending upon how the transactions were recorded. No donations of this char - acter have been made since 1903. The advisability of the above prac - tice is reflected in the net earnings after all charges of the applicant which have been reinvested in the property. In 1903 applicant declared a stock dividend which absorbed a large part, if not all of the surplus at that time. This was done without an inventory and appraisal of the tangible assets for purposes of com - parison with the book values. It is possible, therefore, that the par value of the stock dividend may have been greater or less than the earned surplus. However, the net balance credited to surplus from November 30, 1903, to December 31. 1926, after all charges including dividends was $5,812,191. I It is also true that there was a period in the early years of oper - )ii when the company charged all expenses of every description in - ding replacements and some additions and betterments to expenses, the year 1909, it set up a reserve for accrued depreciation on its &gt;ks and credited this amount with $100,000. This was purely an es - ated figure without any definite relation to the cost of the depre - ble property. This annual credit was continued with one or two eptions until 1916 'when it was increased to $150,000 and raised lin in the year 1920 to $190,000 and for the last five years has not ■ii less than $242,000. In 1922 and 1923 it ,was $281,238 and 12,438 respectively. Since 1909 the reserve account has been credit - with .+3,108,422 and charged with only $880,055 representing the t of the property retired from service. I After the reserve was set up and prior to the year 1914, the cost changes in plant which involved additions and betterments was ided between the plant investment account and depreciation reserve the ratio of sixty per cent of the cost to plant and forty per cent to reserve. In 1914, the company began using the classification of ounts prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission for the lroad portion of the property and applied it to all of its property. is provided a more careful distinction between capital and expenses, wever, the government agents for the Income Tax Bureau have re - itly found that the annual credit to the reserve for the years 1921, 12, and 1923 should not exceed $190,000 and ordered a charge to reserve ami a credit to surplus to be made accordingly. The account showing the investment and operating results of the stock yards department ami the railroad property have been kept separate although very closeh related. The company's financial state- </seg>
            <seg id="p382">382 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT ments and reports showing the results of operation have included both departments. The Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction over the rates and capitalization of the railroad property and the United States Department of Agriculture has the power to regulate service charjres of the stock yards.

To clarify the situation the ownership of the railroad property, exclusive of real estate, was placed in n separate corporation the stock of \vhi&lt;-li is owned by the Union Stock Yards Company Which leases the real estate used tor tracks and switches to the railroad company for an annual rental of $50,000. tWhen the above separation was Blade, the Interstate Commerce mission permitted the capitalisation of the railroad property in sum of $1,650,608 par value.

I he rale is clear that new stork and bonds must represent the equivalent of labor done, or property actually received. This means that money paid for additions and betterments and plant extensions may be capitalized but it does not iro further and say that the only property that can be capitalized must be financed by the sale of new Ik and bonds or money borrowed. It was not disputed that ap - ant has invested its net earnings in property applied to the purpose which the corporation was created, at least within the scope of showing since 1903. The money might have been distributed to stockholders and the necessary funds for plant development sup - il from the sale of new securities, or money borrowed as the ad - ons were required. In that event the interest charges would have itly increased the cost of plant. The fact that the stockholders elected to reinvest their surplus lilies without interest should not be construed to the disadvantage he owners of the property.

However, at the hear - ing it developed that applicant feels that the financial obligation in - volred in changing from magneto to common battery, is too great a one to be assumed in the immediate future. It stated that it did not desire a rate schedule authorized which might be predicated on its ab - ility to furnish common battery service. Its contention is that the present rate schedule is inadequate under existing conditions, and it proposes a schedule of rates which it feels will be sufficient for com - mon battery service, such improved service to be furnished at some future date when the necessary financing is possible. The Commission could not authorize rates for common battery service, effective im - mediately, to cover such service to be furnished at some indefinite future date. Accordingly, such rate schedule as may be authorized herein will be on the basis of the company's present needs, with magne - to service for basis for the Commission's conclusions. At such time as the company finds it possible and desirable to change from magneto service to common batter; service, further application can be made for such schedule of rates as the company deems necessary.

It is probably true that the depreciation reserve has also been drawn upon to some extent, to supply capital necessary lor additions and betterments.

            <seg id="p390">390 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT This witness, on cross-examination, conceded obsolescence in the properties, particularly the switchboard and telephone instruments, such obsolescence being the greater because of the probability of change in the near future from magneto to common battery. The Commission feels that such obsolescence, under the existing circum - stances, is a matter of importance and should be given outstanding con - sideration. For this reason, it finds that the figures submitted by this witness must be reduced. Having in mind the fact that the change from magneto to common battery service will make radical changes in important units of the present plant, with consequent changes in its fair value, the Commission's further consideration of fair value will be necessary when such change is made. Accordingly, for the purposes of this case, while no final finding of fair value will be made, a rate is being authorized which the Commission believes will permit of a fair return being paid upon a value of not less than $28,000. Since the securities outstanding are in amount considerably less than this, this will allow a very generous dividend on stock &lt;&gt;iitstan&lt;l ; n'_ r after all interest charges have been paid. Increased salary expenditures ami the increased value for earn - ing purposes, necessitate of themselves increases in rates. Tiie Com - mission is not disposed to penalize economy of operation where coap.'ed with efficiency of operation. The subscribers of this company have for a number of years, benefited by the high efficiency of local manage - ment. Such efficiency may well be recognised in l: i \ i n v: consideration to proper annual dividends. tThe company's public relations are of the West. No objectors &gt;eared at the hearing. In fact, a resolution was presented by Dave Stevens, editor of the only newspaper in Coz&amp;d, on behalf of the nbers of the Commercial Club of Cozad, indicating their interest adequate rates for applicant, and concluding as follows: "Therefore, be it resolved by the Commercial Club of Cozad, Nebraska, that this Chamber of Commerce does hereby endorse the application of said telephone company for authority to in - crease rates, and does hereby petition the Nebraska State Kail - way Commission to grant to said telephone companv a sufficient increase in rates to enable said company to pay its onerating expenses, create a reserve to cover depreciation, and pay to the stockholders a fair return on their invesfnen'." The resolution was unanimously adopted. The Commission seldom witnesses such splendid community co-operative spirit. The sched - ule of rates authorized herein, will produce additional revenue per month, exclusive of revenue from additional charges for desk sets, in amount of $142.50. Applicant reports 155 desk telephones, making a further additional revenue of $38.76 from this so -rce. or a total ad- </seg>

With the books kept in con- tinuity with this uniform system in the future, the company and the Commission will have definite information as to the effect of the IB- eased rate schedule. §1 udoubtedly in the near future, applicant company 'which serves prosperous growing community, will desire to make further ap - ation for a schedule &gt;&gt;t rates which will be adequate and sufficient common battery service.

The wages that are paid to the agent at sixty cents an hour amount to $1,468, on &lt;i l&gt;.i - eight hours per day at sixty cents per hour, and if the company were permitted to discontinue the telegraph operator service, there would be a saving to the company of $300 per year, without any considerable inconvenience to the public. It was shown by the testimony of the witness that the citizens of Wann and vicinity had telephone eonneet - tion with Ashland, where all telegrams could be phoned to and for - warded from, and in ease telegrams were sent to parties at Wann. the agent at Ashland could communicate them by phone so that there would be no delay in the sending or delivering of telegrams., L There was no serious ob,ject : on by any of the parties who were ent who live at Wann, M.

            <seg id="p394">394 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Chairman I On July 8, 1927, the Missouri Pacific Kailroad Corporation in braska, filed an application with the Railway Commission to continue the running of trains Nos. 107 and 108 between Omaha and Dsas City. In that application they stated that it has been found t the business did not justify the operation of four trains daily ween Omaha and Kansas City and intermediate points. That all business offered could be adequately taken care of by three trains h way daily. That three trains on the schedule proposed would iquately and conveniently take care of the business and sufficiently ve the needs of the public. I The Commission notified all towns between Omaha and Palls « it v •ough which these trains traverse of the application and advised it if their community had any objections to the granting .of the av - iation without a hearing to inform the Commission not later than Ly 15 as to the result of the investigation made by the parties noti - d. Objection was filed by the Chamber of Commerce of Omaha and o by an interested party at Falls City, but before the Commission ed a date of hearing on the application to eliminate trains Nos'. LOT i 108, the Missouri Pacific Kailroad Corporation in Xc - iska, filed an amended application to substitute the elimination "1 tins 103 and 104, between Omaha and Kansas City in place of trains and 108. All interested towns between Omaha and Falls City were ved with a notice of the amended application and the case was set vu for hearing at the Court House in Omaha on Tuesday, August at 10:00 o'clock a. m. at which time interested parties appeared 1 testified. The Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska by their general superintendent of western lines, testified that owing to the falling off of local passenger business along the entire length of the line between Omaha and Kansas City and especially from Falls City to Omaha, that the local passenger business had fallen off t&lt; - such an extent that the company is running these trains 103 and 104 at a great loss to the railroad company. That trains Nos. 10o, 106, 107, 108, 109 and 110 were ample to take care of the business between Omaha and Kansas City and especially between Falls City and Omaha. That the reason for the company making an amended application to eliminate trains Nos. 103 and 104 in place of 107 and 108 as was contained in the first application was because after a careful canvass had been made it "was found by the railroad company that more people were using 107 and 108 between Omaha, Plattsmouth, Union, Nebraska City, Auburn, Falls City and Kansas City than they were 103 and 104, as the arrival and departure of the trains from Omaha, Kansas City </seg>
            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 395 and intermediate points seemed to be more convenient than those of 103 and 1U4. I The testimony of the superintendent showed that the local pass - ?r business on their lines in Nebraska had decreased approximately y per cent during the past three years. This decrease in passen - aervice having been brought about by the paralleling of their line n Falls City to Omaha by gravelled roads, bus lines and the use of privately owned automobile, which not only will continue, but will oubtedly increase in volume. Also, the express business has been siderably affected by the use of the truck carrying express to the lous towns between Omaha and Falls City. There is at the present i' bus service between Falls City and Omaha as shown by Exhibit 1. which is the official Nebraska Bus Guide for July 1927, a bus leaving Omaha at 9 :30 A. M. arriving at Falls City at 1 :45 P. M. leaving Omaha at 4 :15 P. M. arriving at Falls City at 8 :30 P. M, giving service to all towns between Omaha and Falls City. Also a bus leaving from Falls City at 8 :00 A. M. arriving at Omaha at 12 :15 P. M. leaving Falls City at 3 :30 P. M. arriving Omaha at / :45 P. M. These busses carry passengers between Falls City and Omaha and intermediate points.

There was very little ■ ■ tion raised by the parties who appeared to protest against the elimin - ating of the trains after it was found by them that the trains 107 and 108 "would only be thirty-five minutes later in arriving at Omaha and twenty-five minutes later in arriving at Kansas City, so that the traffic that was handled by L83 and 104 ,-ould be handled by 107 and L08, 189 and 110, without any considerable inconvenience to the passenger it ex - press and cream patrons.

The creamery com - ly representatives that appeared at the hearing stated that they did : appear in opposition to the taking off oi any train that the Com - ssion deemed was proper, providing adequate substitute service was en by the railroad company. I After considering all of the facts in connection with the application I evidence presented by the railroad company and also taking into sideration the question of adequate service to the public between aha, Falls City and Kansas City, the Commission is of the opinion t if trains 103 and 104 are eliminated that the service offered by the Iroad company will be adequate to take care of passengers, express [ mail business and that with the falling off of revenue, caused by bus, privately owned automobile and the truck, that the railroad ipany should be permitted to practice reasonable economics in the ducting of their train service. That to require them to run trains t are not well patronized and are in fact not necessary to give ade - ,te service to the public would be an uneconomical waste. Commission believes and so finds that the application of the iouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska to eliminate passen - trains Nos. 103 and 104 should be granted. </seg>

The affairs of this company were thoroughly investigated by the Commission in connection with the company's application for an in - crease in exchange rates in the year L921. The Commission had before it an inventory and appraisal of all the physical property devoted to the ■se of the public. Operating revenues ami expenses Were analyzed and the company was permitted to increase exchange rates which were ample to rehabilitate the property ami pay a reasonable return on the fair value of the property, as found by the Commission. The company was also authorized to issue a stock dividend as a measure of earnings reinvested in the property. This was a separate investigation and disclosed the early history of the company and all the facts necessary to determine the equity of the stockholders. tThe testimony in the instant case related largely to poor service cli applicant alleged results from the free service between exchanges. l company also contended that the expense of maintaining the pro ty used for this purpose requires additional revenue.

A record of five days' experience is not 'ficient to supply the information necessary for complete analysis. ta of this character should include a series of test periods selected different seasons of the year, if possible, in order to reflect the ! of the service between exchanges by the different classes of sul&gt; - •ibers, in its relation to the total of all calls. The chief night operator testified that connections were made in the central office promptly, although it might be possible to speed up the service to some extent if the free service calls were reduced. She stated that free trunks are frequently called when they are busy, but this might happen if a separate charge were made.

August 9, 1927, after notice had been sriven to the public, through the press and to the city commission and chamber of commerce. tit was shown by the testimony of E. K.

            <seg id="p407">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 407 over that particular line all of that energy was wasted; also that owl car service had fallen off considerably, undoubtedly due to the private - ly owned automobile being used by those who had to go to and from their Work in the midnight, or early morning hours. It was shown that there were quite a number of people who go to their work after midnight or discontinue their work between the hours of 12 :00 o'clock after the street cars have discountinued running and before the re - gular runs in the morning and that unless these people had some mode of transportation it would necessitate their buying an automobile or using a taxi and that expense would be prohibitive, or they would be required to Avalk long distances in all kinds of weather and it would greatly discommode that class of residents in case the owl car was eliminated. It was also shown that the largest part of the patronage received l&gt;y the owl car was from train men either working at the Burlington timd house, or running out of the Burlington freight yards and from &gt;&lt;-k men coming in and going out on stock trains. The owl car did t run within nearly one-half mile of the round house and yards, so at these railroad men and stock shippers who had been patronizing the car had to walk from the P Street Burlington crossing to the round tuse and yards. For that reason a great many of these railroad men d purchased and were using their own automobiles, but those who re less fortunate had been using the owl car and had been walking s distance from the P Street Burlington Crossing to the round house ami yards. It' the bus runs up to the round house undoubtedly a number of the men who have been running their automobiles to the round house will discontinue to do so and patronize the bus. I The Commission has recently issued an order which has been roved by the city commission, permitting the Lincoln Traction lpany to remove the tracks of the Lincoln, Capital Beach and Mil- ord Railway Company. -\s soon as these tracks are removed it is livious that there could be no owl cars running to the P Street Bur- lington crossing, so that .these men who work at the Burlington round house, freight yards and man the trains from that point would be ■without any transportation whatever unless they furnished their own automobiles and that* would be very unsatisfactory where train men leave to be gone a considerable length of time on their runs, their oars would be, standing out subject to the elements or possible damage, or theft, and when they returned from their run they would be compelled to either walk or hire a taxi, which would cut into their salaries to such an extent that it would be prohibitive. There are also a number of these railroad men who receive calls during the night to report to the round house or yards for service that are without cars, that would be compelled to walk that long distance and in order to have pavement to walk on would have to go clear around on the P Street paving and then back to the round house, which would be a great waste of time in re- </seg>
            <seg id="p408">408 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT porting to the round house for duty and then when they have finished their days' work or completed their run, would have to walk around again over the cinder road and to the P Street paving then back to O Street over the viaduct "where they could take a street car to s?o to their rooming house, or home. The running of the owl car to furnish this service to these men is of more consequence than all the owl service rendered in other parts of the city. The Commission is not in favor of depriving either these men of service to the round house, nor the public in the city over the routes that the owl car has been traversing. I The traction company produced an exhibit showing that to oper - s a bus over the same lines and on the same schedule that the owl r had operated on would cost them $9.61 per night, this is $12.34 less in it is costing to run the owl car. If the revenue was no more than has averaged on the owl car there would be a loss to the company $7.39 per day, as against a loss of $17 per day in running the owl r. It was admitted by Mr. Heiny that if the company was required run an owl bus in place of the owl car, that with that class of ser - :e they undoubtedly would have an increase in revenue, which would luce the loss and perhaps entirely eliminate it. tThe Burlington Railroad Company has recently moved the stock Is 'within a short distance of the round house and shippers of stock d walk down from the stock yards to the round house and take the from there to town, which would be a big convenience to them. I After considering all the testimony the Commission is of the opi - n and so finds, that the application of the Lincoln Traction Company discontinue owl car service in the city of Lincoln should be granted, ; in lieu thereof the Lincoln Traction Company be required to fur - h owl bus service to run on the same schedule and give the same ss of service over the streets of the city of Lincoln and to the P eet Burlington crossing, but in addition they should be required to &gt; the bus up to the Burlington round house. ORDER E1T IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway nmisaion that the Lincoln Traction Company's application to dis - tinue owl car service be granted. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Lincoln Traction Company furnish owl bus service to run on the same schedule and over the same routes and in addition thereto, to run from the Burlington P Street crossing to the Burlington round house to give service to the railroad men and others desiring' .to patronize the bus to and from that point. </seg>

OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Chairman tThis hearing occured upon the application of the Lineo'n, Capitol cli and Milford Railway Company for authority to abandon street way service and remove tracks from 10th and "O" Streets in the of Lincoln to Capitol Beach. In an order written on an application made by the Capitol Beach and Milford Railway Company and the Lincoln Traction Company on the 16 of July, 1927, wherein the Capitol Beach and Milford Railway Company and the Lincoln Traction Company made application to alian - don street car service between Bessey, Fourteenth Street and Capitol Beach and substitute busses from that point to Capitol Beach and re - turn over. the "O" Street viaduct, it was provided that this substitution could be made by the Capitol Beach and Milford Railway Company and the Lincoln Traction Company, subject to the approval of the City Commission of the city of Lincoln. The order also provided that the company was not to remove any of the rails or trolleys, but at all times keep the track in jrood condition to be able to restore street car service over the tracks of the company without unnecessary delay. </seg>
            <seg id="p410">410 Alter this order was written the Lincoln Traction Company made application to the eity council of Lincoln for a permit to run b over the streets of the city of Lincoln and to Capitol Beach ;is provided lor in the order of July 16, lint failed to obtain the permission from the city commission, owing to the fact that the viaduct over the Burlington and Union Pacific Railroad tracks on "• &gt;'" Street between the r.iils of the Capitol Beach and MUford Railway Company had not been kept in reasonable and sale condition by the street car company and that unless the street cur company wore permitted to remove the rails from the door of the viaduct and make the necessary repairs the temporary permit that had been extended to the street car Company to furnish bus service over the "&lt;&gt;" Street \ iaduct would be rescinded. This require the street car company to put not only the viaduct in sale and adequate condition, but would also require the street car company to iniprovdtheir entire street car system from Ninth and "O" Sin. Capitol Beach, which would entail a prohibitive amount for the com - pany to expend in view of the fact that the volume of business on the line from Ninth and "O" Street to Capitol Beach and Lakeview was not of sufficient volume to warrant the expenditure of the amount that it would take to not only repair the viaduct, but the Capitol Beach line. I It was found upon investigation by the city comm 1 Traction company that it would require the sum of $3 paving on the "O" Street viaduct over the tracks of rlington &amp; Quiney Railroad Company and the Cnion l'a npany. In the previous ease that w&amp;a held upon the i 1 Traction company to discontinue street car servii tch, the lowest estimate in repairing the track. tmlli s $2,500 and with these two amounts added, as has ted. would make an amount equal to, if not in excess Mines from revenue on this line for an entire year. t t After an agreement had been reached between the city comm and the Traction company for the removal of the rails over the Street viaduct and fixing an amount that the company would be re - •ed to pay for putting the "O" Street viaduct in pood repair, the ap - ation on which this action was based, was filed with the Commis - and after due notice had been given to all parties concerned, hear - was held in the hearing room of the Railway Commission at I0KM) &gt;ck a. in. on the 5 day of August, 1 !I27. KThe Traction company was represented at the hearing by their gen- I superintendent, K. K. Heiny; the eity of Lincoln was represented the city attorney, C. R. WUke; Capitol Beach by its proprietor, R. Ferguson, and Mrs. Stella M. Stephens represented the citizens ,,f ceviev . </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 411 There was no evidence introduced showing that the city commis - sion was in any way adverse to the substitution of busses over the pro - posed routes, for street car service. The only real contention being made was that with the rails in place as now exists on the "O" Street viaduct, that it precluded the use of the viaduct for traffic and that with those rails in place and with the floor of the viaduct in its present condition and with the addition of bus service over the viaduct added to the natural traffic, brought on a congested condition that made it necessary that the rails be removed and the paving on the floor of the \ iaduct be placed in a condition that would not only make it safe for vehicles to run over, but would increase the eapaeity of the viaduct for traffic by at least one-third. , I The citizens of Lakeview were very much interested in the question the service being; furnished either by street car. or busses as citizens that community had either erected, or purchased their ho.nes there, lecting to have transportation to and from the city of Lincoln and ile they were not contending for either class of service they were [tending for dependable service either of one class or the other. Mr. L. Ferguson, representing Capitol Beach, probably the most impor - t business that would be affected by lack of transportation ser\ice ■r the "&lt;•" Street viaduct to Capitol Beach, testified that he was •i'eetly satisfied, with the bus service in lieu of the street car rferviee. at the service that had been furnished by the Traction company h basses since permission had been given them to abandon street • service to the Beach and substitute b.is service, had tioen very satis - •tory and with its continuance the proprietors of Capitol Beach had objections to its beinu substituted for street car service. I There is also on the west side of the viaduct what is known as idis Baseball field, where league games are played and with the bus vice eliminated there would be no way for parties desiring to attend se games to attend them, except with their own private cars or by Iking there, and it is quite a distance from the business part of Lin - n to this ball park. There are also some industries located between viaduct and Capitol Beach. The Chicago, Burlington A Quincy iid house and Chase Plow Company, where a great many men are .loved who live in the city of Linco'n, would have no means of trans - ■tation except if they furnished it themselves to get to and from ■ir work. The Traction company is very anxious to furnish adequate bus service and so testified. They have provided themselves with the latest up to date busses and have a sufficient number to take care of the volume of business that would be furirshed them, even at peak periods. They also furnished a schedule showing that the service to and from Lakeview would be of tha same frequency as had been furnished for vears by street cars. </seg>

It appears that the former owner had allowed the lines to run down, and the subscribers had had no service at all. Applicant has at thi.s time installed a new switchboard and has considerable of the outside plant repaired, and will soon have the plant rebuilt. Upon in - \ estimation by the engineering department of the Commission, we find applicant has made a true statement in regard to the rebuilding pro - gram. Applicant alleged the fair value of properties to be approxi - mately $19,000. Engineering studies made by the Commission's engin - eering department indicated this was too high a Figure. For the pur- this case, the Commission finds the fair value to be in the neighborhood of $17,500. The books of the company are kept accord- ing to the Commission's accounting system, and a check of the records shows that they accurately reflect present operating conditions. The published hours of service heretofore were from (i a. m. to 10:30 p. m. hut the records disclose that hereafter there will be twenty-four hour rvice, which will necessitate more operators.

This is a duplication to the extent oi; his time spent in maintaining the property. For the purpose of this calculation, the Commission will deduct one-half of the manager's 6alary as it is provided for in the charge for maintenance anil de - preciation. This is also true of the upkeep and depreciation. on the car in the sum of *;io. It is the Commission's opinion that eleven per cent of what represents approximately the reproduction nCW value of the properties, is more than is necessary for maintenance and depre - ciation. The total requirement is reduced accordingly to the sum of *.~&gt;77.!t(i or $6,935.52 per year. tThe proposed rates will produce $519.85 per month or an apparent 5 of $58.11, or an annual loss of $697.32.

OPINION AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: §This is an application of the Omaha &lt;fc Council Bluffs Street Kail - &gt;\: Bridge Company, tor authority tc issue its refunding bonds in amount of #2,000,000. The application states that the company was originally incorporated under the laws &lt;&gt;f Iowa, October 20, and on the 9 of April. 1887, the same ineorporators organised a cor - poration under the laws of Nebraska, under the same name. There - after, and prior to the construction of the bridge, hereinafter mention - ed, the two corporations were merged so that at the present time it is Eh an Iowa and a Nebraska corporation. The company constructed 1 still owns the street car system in the city of Council Bluffs, Iowa, h extensions to nearby suburbs of that city. It also built and owns ridge across the Missouri river, joining Omaha and Council Bluffs, iili earries the street car lines of the Council Bluffs system over i this state. The bridge is also used by vehicles and pedestrians as ill bridge. The entire property of the applicant company is leased tin Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, a Nebraska poratiun, owning and operating a street railway system in the city tOn January 1, 1903, the applicant company issued its negotiable ■ Is bearing interest at five per cent in the sum of $2,000,000 due in nty-five years, or January 1, 1928. Such bonds are a first lien on the property of the applicant company. The purpose of the present lieation is to refund these bonds. I The prayer of the application is for permission to issue two million liars of negotiable bonds bearing interest at the rate of six per cent ted October 1, 1927, maturing October 1, 1947, secured by a trust ed upon all of the property of the applicant company, both in Iowa d in Nebraska, and including the bridge above mentioned and all of i rolling stock and miscellaneous property of the applicant. An reement has been made whereby the bonds, if issued, will be sold to t the company !);&gt;••&gt;. The discount will be assumed and paid by the naha .v- Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, the lessee. Objei tion was made to the allowance of the application by R. B. Howell, who appeared for himself and others similarly interested, all being citizens of Omaha. Nebraska. The objection seemed to go to the value of the bridge property as claimed bv the applicant and to the allowance of the application because it might interfere with the efforts </seg>
            <seg id="p440">440 1 ■ of some of the citizens of Omaha to secure the 1&gt; i-i«lir* ! f &lt;»r municipal purposes. Under the provisions of the statutes governing the ("minis sion in this class of cases, the Commission cannot give consideration to the latter ground of objection. We have nothing to do with the purposed purchase of the bridge by the city of Omaha. The matter before the Commission is an application for permission to issue securities tor tht purpose of refunding outstanding obligations. It' the property is ol sufficient value, and the application correctly states the needs of the company it is entitled to issue the securities. tThe first matter lor our consideration is to ascertain whether or the security offered for the bonds is adequate. It appears from testimony of the applicant that the value of its street railway pro - ty taken by itself, thai is, tin- bridge not being included, has recently b a subject of litigation in the United States District eourt for the them district of Iowa. The master appointed in that ease has filed (report in which he found the present fair value of the street property to lie $2,809,419.83; that the present fair value o ge property is, without anything tor going concern value, ■•*- Tliis makes the present fair value of the entire property, bu iiderini: the going concern value of the bridge property. $4,809 The report is dated October 11, 1027 and has not yet come li court for consideration. The evidence offered before the Coi sion shows a large intangible value in the hnd I While the findings of tin master are not y are evidence of a high order that tin that the party must be, -including the goinf ncern valu&lt; nearly $5,000,000. The applicant a'so presented a valuation made by Ralph M a tell known civil engineer, who found a presen the bridge property. The actual valuation Ansrier as of September 9, 1927, under the supervi Me I seems to have been made for the us,, of the purchaser oi tl i «ed bonds. While neither Mr. Modjeski nor Mr. Angier was preset I 'ore the Commission, Mr. Leussler, general manager of the Omaha « uneil Bluffs Street Railway Company, the lessee of the property, s present and testified generally as to the value of the property. He ike with intimate knowledge of much of the property and his testi - ny fully sustains the figures sriven by the special master and the tires given by Mr. Modjeski. We therefore find that the present fail tie of the property is ample to justify the proposed bond issue which 1 be a first lien on all of the property of the applicant. I In addition, the Omaha a- Council Bluffs Street Railway Company er the provisions of the lease, will iruarantee the payment of the rest on the new bonds. </seg>

            <seg id="p446">446 AVERAGE MONTHLY OPERATING COST It' the application of the company is granted, the company would schedule daily-exeept-Sunday Train No. 128 out of Falls City a1 3:05 a.m. instead of at 5:5(1. arriving at Nebraska City at 5:25 and pick up the Kansas City sleeper tor Lincoln. This would reduce the overhead expense practically $1,184.45 per month. If the same amount of busi - ness was transacted on this train as is now beinj: transacted by both trains that the company is operating, instead of there being a deficit "t *(I74.O6, the revenue received Would be sufficient to pay the operating expenses and leave a balance of $210.39, over and above the overhead expense of conducting the trains. I There was a Iarjre amount of testimony presented by protestants, with one or two exceptions, it had more to do with the mail service n the passenger service. After the matter bad been thoroughly gone ), a large part of that objection was overcome as it was shown to protestants that arrangements would be made by the railroad npany to have mail handled so that there would be no particular def - ence from the service that is now being rendered by both trains. ;re was. however, one or two towns that, it was shown by th' ny of the witnesses, would be considerably discommoded if trains s. 121 and 22(1 were discontinued and the proposed trains N. and 128 substituted for the present trains. But the revenue from these fwo towns iwas of so small a volume that the Commission do not be - lieve that the company should be required to absorb such a targe deficit in order to accommodate passengers from these two points. as the patronage that they are furnishing to the company i&gt; of very small volume. There is, at the present time, bus service being offered to most of the towns affected, that is quite dependable and runs upon schedules that give those who desire t" •_:■&gt; from Falls City to Nebraska City and Lincoln, adequate service in addition to the service that would be ottered by the railroad company on the proposed trains.

Nebi and Oberlin, Kansas. The distance between these points is 7&gt; miles. Only ten miles of this line of road is in Nebraska, the train being an interstate train. The railroad company shows that tor many years past tln - has been operated over this line of road daily, except Sunday, in each direction, leaving Republican at 10:00 a. m. and arriving al Oberlin at 1:15 p. ru. Departing from Oberlin at 4:(IU p. m. anil ar - riving at Republican at -7:10 p. m. The out-of-pocket cost to the railroad company for the open of passenger trains 141 and 142 has averaged $2,157 per month. The passenger revenue from the train has fallen off materially. In 1916 the average passengers per train mile carried by the company per month was 24 on No. 141; in 1926 it was (i. On train 142 it wa in 1916 and five in 192(i. The cause for the decrease in pass* traffic on these trains has been due to the development of the highways and the use of the automobile and busses. There is no prospect of the patronage being irestored, but it is liable to even fall off to a greater extent. The railroad company proposes to install a gasoline electric motor car 75 feet in length, divided into three compartments, the pass compartment "will comfortably seat 25 passengers. The baggage and express compartment being 28 feet long and 1"&gt; feet of the ear to lie devoted to a railway post office. The car will be of sufficient si/v and capacity to take care of all the business that «ill be offered to the company. tThe installing of this gas electric motor car in place of the steiun senger train will effect a saving of $759 per month, or a total to company of .$9,108 per year.

            <seg id="p460">460 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT plication had been held the Commission permitted the Omaha £ Lin - coln Railway and Light Company to promulgate schedules for motor busses and discontinue operating street cars between Papillion ajid Omaha, requiring the company to run on the same schedules with busses, as had been furnished by street cars. After this order was issued the Omaha and Lincoln Railway was purchased by Louis F. Mentz and is now conducted as the Mentz Bus Ijine. tOn July 15, 1927, the Mentz Bus Line, Papillion to Omaha, sue - sors to the Omaha .t Lincoln Railway ami Light Company, made )lication to the Nebraska State Railway Commission to change its edule of service between Papillion. Ralston, South Omaha and aha. Hearing was held in the Court House at Papillion on the ap - ation on December 1, 1927, at 1 ::td p. m. that being the time and 3e where all interested parties had been notified hearing &lt;&gt;n the ap - ation would be held. I There was considerable testimony ottered by the company show - r . that certain operations required of the bus company under the ledule provided for in the order issued on the d day of June. l!'2t&gt;. s unnecessary and uneompensatory. The street ear eompany pre - ue to the changing from street cars to l&gt;us&gt;e~. under the franchise ieh they were operating, were required to carry passengers to 15th 1 Capitol Avenue in the city of Omaha. This made a duplication service from '24th and N Streets, a distance of three miles, or a total tance of six miles tor the round trip. This operation was exclusive - for passengers from Papillion and Ralston. 1 Testimony showed that the company was receiving on an average $3.99 for this service and that the expense was $8.96, making a loss $5.87 per clay that the company was required to absorb by reaaoi the duplicate service between 24th and N Streets and Capitol Avenu' i 15th Street and that the fare charged by the company, from 24tl 1 X Streets to Capitol Avenue was the same a&gt; charged bj the laha a.- Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, so it the applican ipph.-iii were permitted to make 24th and N Streets, the northern terminus there would not be any extra expense to passengers. They "would be required to change from the bus to the street cars. Street cars to South Omaha all pass 24th and N Street at a frequency of about three minutes, so there would be no loss of time in making the trip. In the company's application they asked to discontinue this dupli - cate service. The company had also asked to discontinue certain scheduled busses between Papillion and Omaha, owing to the fact that at the scheduled time some of these busses were running, they were not being patronized for the reason that the schedules were arranged for the time of day when there was very little demand for service on the company's busses. </seg>

Bodeker, Murray; Georg Nickles, Murray OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Commissioner: t Applicant herein, Lincoln Telephone A Telegraph Company les telephone service at Murray. Nebraska, ami territory adjacent reto. It serves litii subscribers, 147 of Whom are rural, the re - nder being town, business and residence. Present service is of the nieto grounded type. Applicant proposes t" reconstruct it^ Murray perties so that it can furnish subscribers of this exdhange with metallic- service. This application requests authority to revise it~ edule of rates for service at this exchange, the changed schedule be effective at such time as applicant is able to render mi vice. Hearing upon the application was held at Murray, on Friday. rember 18th. I Applicant states that it is confronted with a present reconstruction irram at its Murray exchange, whether it remain grounded, or be le metallic. In recent years electric transmission lines of high ajre have been constructed in the territory paralleling telephone s. Such construction has resulted in inductive interference with grounded lines of applicant, making the service highly nnsatisfac - ,• to Murray subscribers. A petition circulated by applicant re stinir it to make the chansre to metallic service and approving the e schedule herein proposed, was quite generally sismed by subscribers ected. The Commission is familiar with the highly unsatisfactory phone service which follows the paralleling of a grounded telephone by a transmission line of high voltage. The proposal of applicant </seg>
            <seg id="p465">465 to make its grounded lines metallic, appears to be the practical way of restoring the service to a proper standard. I Applicant presented Exhibit A containing among other things, a tement of actual earnings and expenses of this exchange since 1922, 1 estimated annual earnings and expenses under the proposed rate edule, with the exchange metallic. This statement shows that in the rs of 1922 and 192b\ applicant had available for return on its in - tment, a very meagre amount. In all of the other years, the ex - nge failed to produce sufficient revenue to pay actual operating enses. The estimate showed total annual exchange revenue under rate schedule proposed, of -1&lt;4,83:kO7 ; total expenditures exclusive of fair return of $4,029.97, leaving $803.10 available for return upon the investment. This estimate of receipts and expenditures under the proposed schedule, the exchange being metallic, is undoubtedly approx - imately correct, being based upon six years of actual experience of the exchange. The investment or book cost of the properties as reflected by the iany's books of account, is $15,489.98. In changing from grounded ommon batterv service, it is estimated that the net investment in I exchange will be increased about .f:W()0, making a total investment original cost, after the exchange is metallic, of slightly less than .lino. On a basis of estimated revenue available for return, applicant ild earn slightly in excess of 4 per cent on its alleged book cost. t Subscribers offered no objection to the proposed change from unded to metallic service. In fact, they indicated their approval hange. Neither did they protest against the rate schedule They did, however, insist that if the rates be increased, tsideration lie iriven to the salary paid the loea] operator, the thought ig that her present wage is insufficient. At the present time the .tainr's salary is W&gt; per month. She resides in a building owned by the applicant, jointly used as telephone office and her residence. She furnishes heat and light for the premises, is responsible for twnty - foirr hour service at the switchboard, keeps the company's local records, and makes collections. The service which is being given by her was highly praised. It was contended that after necessary expenses were deducted from her salary, including the salary which she must of necessity pay a relief operator, the waic which she received was en - tirely inadequate for the splendid service which she was rendering the .nublic. This beins a matter of common knowledge, the telephone usinir public were extremely reluctant to use the telephone during the hours of the night because of disturbing the operator in what they knew to be a much needed rest. If a more generous wage were paid, additional help could be secured by the operator: she would have more opportunity to rest during the day. and the subscriber, as a result, would have less reluctance in the use of telephone service during the </seg>
            <seg id="p466">466 rt hours. So it was contended by the subscribers who appeared at hearing;. I Such a tribute to a faithful public utility employee is unusual. ?&lt;.'ially at a time of application for increased rates, when the in - ation is perhaps mure likely to be one of general fault-finding. tTlus Commission lias no jurisdiction over wages paid by public litics to employees, except as such wages minM be unreasonably li and unduly burdensome upon the rate-paying public. Neverthe - s in the case at hand, it urges the serious consideration of applicant tlie contention of these subscribers, and expresses the hope thai ar - igements may be made which will be agreeable and satisfactory to parties of interest. 1 Applicant has shown the necessity for changing from ground tallic service. The rates which it proposed are not unreasonal ORDER IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Ra omission that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company be same is hereby authorised, effective the first day of sueh n it is able to furnish metallic service, to publish and collect tin lowing schedule of net rates at its Murray exchang Business, one-party Business, extension-; Residence, one-party Residence, two-party Rural, ten-party IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the c any- sta and net rate rule shall be applicable.

Rogers is a town located about midway between the towns of North Bend and Sehuyler. Schuylar is the founty seat of Colfax County and is abont eight miles west of Rogers. Rogers lias a population of about 120. There are two elevators, two stores, two garages, one hank, one ware store, one lumber yard, a barber shop and a blacksmith PP in the town. Owing to the close proximity to the towns of uyler and North Bend, both being towns of very much greater size also the construction of the Lincoln Highway practically through town, the growth of the town has practically ceased and there tip possibility of its ever gaining much larger proportions, either in illation or the number of business houses.

The subscribers would all receive Schuyler service, which would added service, and Sehuyter being the county seat town would be aluable service that they would receive and at a Less figure than they &gt;w paying tor the service from the Rogers station. I There is another very important matter that enters into the re - val of this exchange from Rogers to Schuyler and that is a twenty - ir hour service that is furnished by the Schuyler exchange that at present time is not being furnished by the Rogers exchange to such extent. The question of toll service from Rogers was raised by witnesses at Rogers and the company agreed to establish a toll tion for the use of the public so that there would practically be 1 change in l&lt;&gt;ni: distance toll service, over the present arrangement, the company would provide a toll booth in some convenient location the use of the patrons and the public. I The question of the collecting of the accounts from the patrons at gers was also considered, as at the present time the subscribers can k' their bills at the Rogers exchange. If the exchange was abandoned li the service furnished from the Schuyler exchange, it would be ■essary for the subscribers to make settlement at the Schuyler ex - ange. The Commission is of the opinion that the telephone company raid make arrangements with some business house at Rogers where »se bills eould be sent and the subscribers could make payment up the time of the allowing of the discount. If bills were not paid by it time, then they could be sent to the office at Schuyler and parties old be required to either remit by check or go to Schuyler and ke settlement. I About the only objections by the citizens of Rogers in the removal the exchange to Schuyler, was town pride and a foreboding that service would be impaired. Therp is no question but that the </seg>
            <seg id="p470">470 service will be improved, and, while it is true, the exchange will be taken away from Rogers the question of town pride should not influence the ronmiission in bringing about economies for the public and the telephone company. The Commission is of tin- opinion ami so finds that the main - taining of the exchange by the company at Rogers under the present conditions is an economic waste and that the application of the company to furnish the patrons ,of Wooers with service from t he Schuvler exchange should be granted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of tlie Northwestern Bell Telephone Company for authority to discontinue its central office at Koirci - serve the patrons of the office through their exchange at Schuvler he granted.

OPINION AND FINDING I KT1SS. Commissioner: The applicant, Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, requests authority of the Commission to make certain reductions in its intrastate 1 rates for distances exceeding 390 miles. The American Telephone Telegraph Company has announced that, effective December 1, , its rates for messages traveling over 390 miles, will be reduced, icant alleges that this will result in inconsistencies between its thaul rates, and the interstate rates of the American Telephone Telegraph Company for similar distances, which will undoubtedly Elt in some misunderstandings on the part of applicant's patrons, &gt;s corrected. This is due to the fact that many of the interstate sages originating and terminating in its exchanges are carried over lines of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Applicant, therefore, proposes to modify its toll tariffs both inter - and intrastate, so that they will be in line with those of the American Telephone ami Telegraph Company. A complete toll tariff letting forth the applicant's rates for intrastate toll service in Nebraska, ■they will exist it the proposed changes from the present tariffs made, is attached to the application and marked Exhibit A. I We have checked the proposed tariffs with those now in effect, eh have been previously tiled with and approved by us. and it is nd that the changes in toll rates which "will result, if the proposals authorized, are all for distances of over 390 miles, and all reduc - is. N&lt;&gt; changes are proposed for distances under 390 miles. Since re are few toll routes in Nebraska exceeding that length, the effect the change upon applicant's toll revenue will be negligible. The horization intrastate becomes necessary in order to eliminate in - sistencies between the schedules of the two companies, which inter - nge a large amount of toll business. Uniformity seems desirable. since the changes proposed are reductions, the application will authorized without the Formality of a hearing. ORDER §IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway mission that the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company be. and ereby authorized, effective December 1, 1927, to publish and col - toll rates on intrastate messages within Nebraska, in accordance </seg>

            <seg id="p486">486 OPINION AND FINDING MILLER, Commissioner: tThis matter involves several complaints filed by certain telephone scribers at Cambridge, Hartley and Indianola. which complaints ifed that the service conditions complained of were brought about mgh practice of the various companies in the vicinity of exchang - service between exchanges without eharjre and expressing them - es in favor of a reasonable ami proper toll charge as a remedy. above matters were heard by the Commission under Resolution Also involved in this proceeding is an informal complaint desig - nated as Informal Complaint No. 7.T_M filed by the Commercial Club of Farnam. Nebraska, alleging a discrimination against the business interests of Farnam on account of the free service existing in the territory t Hearing was held in these matters ;it Cambridge on Maj re appearances were made and testimony taken from the panies and some of the interested subscribers. The manager of the Hartley Telephone Company testified that few complaints are received by the company on account of the En vice conditions and that the few complaints were from business who were re r.iired to wait at times for the free service lines.

It was her belief that the practice of ren - called free service did not impair the service conditions elephone company at Ilolbrook is only slightly affected by lervice practice since the amount of free service at the ex- ited. The telephone company at Arapahoe has no reement with other companies except that it trans- ser ills through its exchange to other companies. It is the practice independent companies to retain the fees if any from all out- Eng messages, hence Arapahoe Telephone Company charges for all ginating calls and is not affected by the free service except as the Milling free calls may at times require his operator's time. No com - int is offered by the Arapahoe Telephone Company on account the free service. With the exception of the telephone companies at Indianola and istis, the remainder of the companies, appearing through their rep - sentatives, were unanimously in favor of the continuance of free nice as were also the subscribers that were represented through ommercial Clubs. </seg>
            <seg id="p488">488 The testimony from the manager and operators of the Havana Telephone Company at Indianola indicated that the practice of giving the free service heretofore discussed interfered with the rendering of efficient service and they wore in favor of the same being discon - tinued. The manager proposed the charging of a small loll rati service between exchanges which in his opinion would eliminate much of the unnecessary conversation and would tend to reserve the lii ■ business purposes. The manager also testified that his subscribers with whom he had conferred, favored a toll charge in lieu of free service and that there was. so far as he knew, no objection to dis - continuing the so-called free sen ice. The chief operator of the Havana Telephone Company was &lt;|iies tioned closely by the Commission with respect to the free service practices. Indianola patrons have advantage of free service with Hartley, Cambridge, Stoekville and Curtis. The operator was positive in her statement that the Tree service lines were used mostly tor visit ing purposes and that frequently the tree trunk lines wei five to twenty minutes. It was also her testimony thai t western Bell toll circuits were used almost excl purposes.

The Jtor at Eustis testified that service conditions were hindered on </seg>
            <seg id="p489">489 runt of the free trunk line service between exchanges and that trunk lines were used mostly for visiting, the business men using Northwestern Bell toll circuits exclusively. The secretary of the Nebraska Telephone Association on behalf of some of the companies involved in the hearing and who were members of the association made certain investigations relating to the complaints filed and his testimony in regard to 'such investiga - tion was heard. His testimony was that upon personal investigation • und the Cambridge switchboard considerably congested and stated that the operator advised him the congested condition was brought about by the so-called free service. tTlic secretary of the association made studies of telephone made through the switchboards at Indianola and Eustis for the ose of determining to what extent the so-called service was used what percentage of the subscribers availed themselves of such service. The studies indicate that the service was used by only a few subscribers, but was paid for by all of the subscribers. This condition in the opinion of the witness resulted in a discrimination against the subscribers who did not use the service. It was his contention that by establishing a toll charge the service would be improved generally, and also that the toll charge would require the subscribers who used the service to pay for it. An attempt was also tie to secure such studies from other companies involved who used to make the compilations. No explanation was made as to f the companies did not desire to disclose these facts. I The Commission is of the opinion that the free service trunk bs between exchanges increases the cost of local service to sub - ■ibers who may not use the free service. The Commission also serves that the objections raised to the present plan of free ser - e were by those companies who are operating telephone com - lies for a profit and as a business enterprise. The Commission ognizes the rights of the telephone investor in the matter of a r return on his investment, but feels that in the case of Eustis 1 Indianola where the officers of the company testified that they sired to be relieved of the free service conditions that sufficient ormation has not been presented to warrant discontinuance of the ■vice at this time. All other telephone companies and patrons in - ved in the hearing appear to favor the continuance of free service ier the present plan. The purpose of the companies, operated prin - ally for the benefit of the community, as was expressed by an o£ - er of one of the companies, is to give as much service as possible the amount paid, without regard to the return to stockholders. LThe Commission is of the opinion that the complaint of the Far- Commnnity Club could be satisfied only by the elimination of </seg>
            <seg id="p490">TWENTIKTH ANNUAL REPORT 490 free service or by requiring the Northwestern Bell Telephone Com - pany to give free connections at Farnam to the farmers living south of Farnam. It is obvious that neither of the plans are practical since to discontinue free service at one point and allow it at an - other would be discriminatory. To require the Bell Company to fur - nish free service to the farm subscribers south of Farnam and near Orafino would eliminate present toll revenue and require additional operating expense. tThe Commission 'will dismiss all of the complaints involved in proceeding without prejudice to the rights of any of the com - ies who desire to make further showing to the Commission in matter. ORDER tIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway imission that all of the complaints involved in this proceeding and the same are hereby dismissed of record without prejudice. ■ Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twenty-second day June, 1927.

OPINION AND FINDINGS BY TIIK COMMISSION I In compliance »ith the provisions "f House Hull No. '■&gt;■&gt;, an A. the Forty-Fourth Session of the Nebraska Legislature, 1927, nrhic ame a law April 25, IU'27. entitled "An Act relating to motor vehi and the regulation of .service except the making of rates for providing for the taxing there es ami motor Ira md general control t tlie lares and transpoi providing tor a viding penalties for the violation of the several of this act; ami to declare an emergency;" and in the exercise of the general powers therein rred rue of jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway re - ferred by section 20 of article 4 of the constitution of th Nebraska, which provides as follows: "The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers, as the Legislature may provide by law.

KA full and complete hearing having been hail by the Commission the time set forth in said resolution, motor transportation companies </seg>
            <seg id="p495">495 itiul other interested parties bemji represented as shown m the appear-" hereof. At such hearing the Commission presented a set of ten - tative* rules and regulations covering the operation of motor trans - portation companies. All interested parties 'were given an opportunity I comment on such rules and regulations and make su&lt;-h suggestion* they deemed proper. The representative of the Nebraska Bus Opef - rs' Association objected to certain of the rules and asked leave to le a memorandum brief in connection therewith, which brief has beeu •il bv tiie Commission. At the hearing above referred to. a committee was appointed by the Commission from representatives of insurance companies who are now writing liability insurance tor motor transportation companies op - erating in the state of Nebraska, and from representatives of the bus operators, to confer with Assistant Attorney General Hugh LaMaster and Leonard 1). Densmore. secretary of the Commission, to consider the advisability of amending the endorsement to be placed on liability insurance policies, as provided for in order entered under Commission's Resolution No. S(&gt;. A number of conterenees were held and an endorse - ment submitted, which was agreed to in every particular between the I - operators and the representatives of the insurance companies, with the exception of the question of direct liability of the companies writing such liability insurance policies. The endorsement hereinafter set forth is somewhat broader and affords the public more adequate protection than heretofore, in that the policy written by the insurance companies, covering the operation of a motor transportation company, covers all of the cars which are operated by such company, whether said cars are described in the policy or not. This provision was con - ceded by the insurance companies, and adds materially to the protection afforded the public. In the onler issued under Resolution 8(i, the Commission set forth the amount of liability insurance necessary to be carried by motor transportation companies, which amounts are someAvhat higher than required by the majority of the states, but which, in the opinion of the Commission, alter thorough investigation, having in mind the number of persons involved, is inadequate to properly protect the public. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the limits of liability should be increased as follows: On motor vehicles carrying twelve passengers and less. $5,000 to $20.0(10. i.e. $5,000 to any one person injured or killed, and $211,000 for more than one persDn injured by reason of one accident: thirteen to twenty passengers $f&gt;.000 to $40,000; twenty-one to thirty passengers. $5,000 to $60,000, over thirty pass - engers. $80,000. This increase will cause a slight increase in the pre - miums to b«&gt; paid by the bus operators. However there was no objec - tion to the increase by the operators repersented at the hearing. On the contrarv, the record shows that some of the operators are carrving </seg>
            <seg id="p496">496 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT double the amount of liability which is required by the Commission at Ihis time. Under section -4 of House Roll o. 93, Law s of Nebn r the Commission was directed to pro ide lor liability insurance or bund tbc carried by motor transportation companies, which would ade - itely protect the property affected. Heretofore, the Commission i not required motor transportation companies to curry liability iirance' covering property. However, each company so operating in state is now carrying sueh insurance. The Commission is of the nion and so finds that each motor transportation company in this tc should carry liability insurance covering property in the amount The question lias been,' presented to the Commission as to the ad - visability of the issuance &lt;&gt;i an order which shali define the minimum essentials for insurance companies, touching -their stability and finan - cial responsibility.

            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 513 any and all actions taken by it in initiating said hearing and hereby requests the Nebraska State Railway Commission t.. proceed no further in said matter. "Be It Further Resolved that it is the sense and opinion of tliis Body that if the Commission should decide and de - termine that a common battery system of telephones should only be installed in the city of Scottsbluff upon fixing rates as requested by the telephone corporation or substantially in that amount, then it is (or the best interest of the com - munity that no change be made in the present telephone system or rates, and that the economic welfare of the community would be furthered by making no change in the existing conditions." However, having in mind all of the facts and circumstances, it is the Commission's opinion that it should proceed with an order authorising the change from magneto to common battery, and pre - scribing what it finds to be a fair and reasonable rate for such service. I Scottsbluff is one of the outstanding cities of western Nebraska. is located in a fertile valley with a prosperous trade territory. Its »wth lias been phenomenal. Its present population is about 8500. citizenry are aggressive, energetic and highly optimistic of the future. Without doubt, it will continue to enjoy a further development and growth. These facts of themselves "would stfem to justify a change from magneto to common battery, which is necessary in larger exchanges, to facilitate service. Magneto service in a city this size l- "t necessity slow and unsatisfactory. In our modern cities the those subscriber is demanding promptness* and speed in his ser- This is not possible with the magneto type service. This is Jonly city of its size in the state which now receives magneto vice. It i- it 11 properly be said that magneto service at Scnttsbluff obsolete, and not in keeping with the development of the city uei'wise. Furthermore, respondent telephone company is confronted with an immediate reconstruction program, whether the plant remain mag - neto or be changed to common battery. Testimony of Superintendent of Plant Fuerst was to the effect that the present switchboard is crowded to capacity. In fact, it was stated that the company, be - of this congested condition, was unable, at the present time, to furnish other than party line service. It is only a matter of time until all party lines 'will be filled and the company unable to supply further request for service, except as an occasional subscriber dis - continues service. It is unable to add further sections to its switch - board because of lack of space to place them in the building now </seg>
            <seg id="p514">514 occupied. Furthermore, the switchboard now in use is obsolete and worn out, and would require replacement if magneto service Lie con - tinued. The building now occupied is crowded to capacity in every respect, and in nowise lends itself to further occupancy for pur - poses of respondent. Such conditions are intolerable and cannot be countenanced in a growing city like Scottsbluff. t Since the company must go forward with an immediate recon - ction program, it is certainly the part of wisdom to proceed on basis of common battery service rather than magneto service. I For the reasons above set forth, the Commission regards it its obligation, both to the subscribers affected, and respondent upany. to direct the installation of common battery equipment and authorize what it finds to be fair and reasonable rates for com - n battery service. Respondent set&gt; Forth its reconstruction program il commo battery service be ordered. It now owns a lot valued at $15,001 well located tor a telephone building. It proposes to build a two story, brick and reinforced concrete building, fully fireproof t iir out, with full basement. The building will ser\ for the company and will house the Scottsbluff central off ment. The cost of the building, exclusive of the value of th is estimated at $42,500. This building should b&lt; i.i to the retail section of the city of Scottsbluff. On a floor space used, there has been allocated to the Seoti .*l&gt;7,!l!rj of this item. It was stated that additional propel able to the Scottsbluff exchange in amount oi w if the change to eomnfon battery service be made. r l adds value of plant remaining in service and find on a basis of reproduction new, depreciated, of $310,111.55.

The Commission will discuss briefly certain expense items above set forth. Respondent sets up nine per cent of the estimated re production new for maintenance and depreciation. Where maintenance and particularly depreciation, tire set uu on a percentage basis, it is the customary accounting practice to figure same on the iuvestmen as of the time of construction of the property, or eost basis. It is the Commission's observation, following closely the experience o telephone companies of this state, that an allowance of from eight to ten per cent of original cost is sufficient for maintenance and de - preciation. Accordingly, it is concluded that to the extent that !» per cent of reproduction new exceeds !&gt; per cent of the original respondent has charged more to maintenance and depreciation than will be found necessary. Respondent alleges its properties to be in 92.03 per rent condition. The reproduction new value, depreciated, of $310,111.55 is the figure arrived at after applying this depreciation figure. Respondent sets up an expense item of 8 per cent upon this figure as a fair return. While the Commission recognizes reproduction new. depreciated, as a dominant factor in reaching conclusions as to fair va never regarded this us the sole factor in finding a fair va While it is true that in changing from magneto to common battery, further units of property must be placed new, reproduetioi original cost thereby becoming one and the same figure true that there are portions of the property placed in rat years, in which the original cost thereof is less than r duction new. Having in mind these facts, the Commission the condition per cent of properties of 92.03, which i While it is based on a common battery system, with the necessary units in place, the Commission is of the opinion that e too high a percentage figure to be applied in finding Though the properties have been well maintained, as above suggested many units have been in place for years. This composite condition was found by engineering studies made by Bagenah &amp; Erickson fol - lowing personal inspection of the properties, and presumably repre - sents actual depreciation apparent through observation. Considera - tion has not been given to latent depreciation, or accrued depreciation not apparent through field inspection. Such depreciation does exist and must be considered in finding fair value. For these reasons it is concluded that the fair value of the properties for earning pur- poses should be reduced. The Commission does not believe it necessary to make a definite finding of the fair value of respondent's properties at this time. Re- </seg>
            <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 517 Iident presents this engineering data showing the alleged repro - :ion new, depreciated. Quantities of alleged units have been •ked by the Commission's engineering department and found to approximately correct. The alleged composite condition has been tioned. Otherwise no data is available upon ■which to predicate niti 1 conclusions as to fair value. Further information should be table before ;i definite fair value figure is named. From such Filiation as is at hand, accordingly, it is the Commission's con - ion that the lair value of the properties for earning purposes would it least somewhat less than the figure claimed by the company. The committee representing the chamber of commerce called particular . attention to the fact that the rate schedule proposed by respondent is considerably higher than schedules for other Nebraska cities the size of Scottsbluff, and in some instances cities even larger than Scottsbluff. The Commission cannot attach undue importance to rate comparisons. There are many factors entering into the question of what is a fair and reasonable rate. Accordingly, a rate at one exchange is not highly pertinent evidence of what might be a reasonable rate at another exchange offering the same class of service. In the instant case it must be borne in mind that consider - able portions of the property have been placed since 1919, under a high level &lt;&gt;t unit costs. Other properties are still to be placed before respondent is able to furnish common battery service. Again sub - scribers at the Scottsbluff exchange have free interchange of service with their neighboring city, Oaring, which is also the county seat. At none of the exchanges whose rates Were quoted by the committee above referred to, does such valuable free interchange of service exist. There arc undoubtedly many calls every day passing from Scottsbluff to Gering. If toll were collected on these calls, it no doubt would amount to a considerable item and would, to that extent, make Ksible resultant reductions in exchange rates. Free service to a nty seat town is highly valuable. The Commission feels certain that ttslilutf subscribers desire this free service arrangement. How- tr. they should realize that this is a thing of definite value, not imon to the furnishing of telephone service. Nevertheless the spread between rates herein proposed for Scottsbluff, and other cities of its size in this state, is so great as to challenge the Commission's attention. Some consideration must be ■riven to this fact. The rates herein authorized, while less than re - quested, are slightly more than are collected in some cities similar in size to Scottsbluff. The necessity for this is explained in part, at liv the facts above referred to, viz: the construction of large portions of the property dur'ng a period of high unit- costs* and the free interchange of service with Gering. LThe Commission has in mind the fact above referred to, that ttsbluff is a rapidly growing city. This is a matter of interest </seg>
            <seg id="p518">518 TWENTIETH ANNUAL REPORT to the telephone industry. It will undoubtedly enjoy a growth Ln line with the growth of the city. With the enlarged plant following the change from magneto to common battery, respondent will pass through a cycle in its existence in which operating expenses do not increase proportionately 'with the increase in number of subscribers. Saving in mind all of these facts, the Commission is authorizing a schedule of rates sufficient, it is believed, to pay all operating expenses and some return upon the fair value of the properties. It is quite possible that the return in the immediate future may be slightly less that what might be called a fair return. However, it is felt that the probable rapid growth in number uf subscribers in the immediate future will provide the additional revenue necessary for a Fair return upon the fair value of the property. The rates authorized herein for supplemental service are in tl main the standard rates authorized by the Commission for th ditiona] service.

Holmberg, hereinafter referred tu as plaintiff, owns and resides upon a quarter-section farm situated near Wausa, Nebraska. This farm is bisected by the right of way of the Chicago, St. Paul. Min - neapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company, hereinafter referred to as def - endant. Situated north of defendant's right of way is a depression or low. wet valley which in a general way parallels the right of way and is useful for pasturage only. It contains some eighteen acres ol land and extends across the farm. A branch of this valley extends to the southward intersecting the defendant's line of railway ;il&gt;imt the center of the farm. At this point of intersection the grade &lt;&gt;i defend - ant's roadbed, as shown by the evidence, is approximately nine feet in height. In the present proceeding the plaintiff seeks, under the pro - visions of section 5527, Comp. St. 1 !•■-''-!. as amended by chapter 1 • &gt; T. Laws 1923, to compel the construction of an underground cattle pass of sufficient size for the passage of horses, cattle and hogs under the track of the defendant connecting the two halves of his farm. Here - tofore there has been an ordinary surface or grade farm crossing maintained by the defendant on the northern part of the farm, but the findings of the Commission, which are supported b) the evidence, dis - closes that in its present location this crossing does not answer to the requirements of the farm, and is inadequate for the purpose for which it is constructed and has not been used ordinarily by the plaintiff be - cause in its location it was impracticable. The record also discloses that in 1922 the plaintiff filed a petition before the State Railway Commission for an order requiring the defendant to construct an un - derground crossing through the right of way on this farm at the point above described, which was by the Commission denied, and that no appeal was prosecuted from such denial.

IThe first assignment of error at the threshold of this case is that Railway Commission erred in refusing to take notice of, or receive in evidence, the record of the former hearing of 1922. This record, duly authenticated, was offered in evidence by the defendant at the present hearing. The Commision refused to admit it in evidence, but the offer of proof embraces the complete record of proceeding referred t". and the transcript of same forms a part of the bill of exceptions, I the present case. It was conceded on argument of the present case the representatives of the Commission who appeared in its behalf it the record offered should have been received in evidence. With - : further consideration, for the purpose of this case only, we ac - ■t this view of the law. The record of the case, determined in 1922, 1 therefore be considered as before the court, and entitled to the ue consideration as though formally received and considered by the mmission at the time the order appealed from Avas made. It there - •e follows that, assuming error to have been committed by the ruling complained of, it cannot be considered as prejudicial in this case. In considering the previous determination of the Nebraska State Railway Commission of the matter now before us, when first presented I that Commission by the same parties, it is to be remembered that - Commission finds the source of its po"wer in the Constitution. The itations of its powers, and the proper manner of their exercise, must be determined by the terms of that instrument, and also, as ex - pressed therein, "as the legislature may provide by law." In the ex - ercise of its prerogatives the Nebraska State Railway Commission is ii"t subject to direction or criticism by the courts, except as 'what transpires may be a proper subject of judicial review, as bearing upon orders &lt;&gt;r "judgments".

Lindemann v. St. Joseph * G. I. Ry. KSJpra. would appear opposed to defendant's contention and eon ling mi this branch of the ease. However, the question under consideration naturally leads to and further contention made by the defendant that section --'■ ir, Comp.

The application of the principles of constitutional law upon which defendant liases its contention to the facts in this case discloses t the fundamental question involved here is the right of the state, the exercise of its police power, to eliminate the perils of srrade f -sinus. Tlie principles themselves are well established. As applied he precedents found in the court of controlling jurisdiction, it would seem thai the validity of the statutes attacked must be sustained. Mr. Justice Hughes, in delivering the opinion of the supreme court i the United states in Chicago, M. .v St. P. R. Co. v. City of Minne - apolis. 2:!2 I". S. 430, said: "It is Well settled that railroad corpora - tions may lie required, at their own expense, not onlv to abolish ex - iMinu grade crossings, but also to build and maintain suitable bridges Kiiaducts tn carry highways, newly laid out. over their tracks, or to ry their tracks over such highways." Other specific illustrations the application of this established rule to the elimination of grade ssings are Davis v. County Commissioners. 153 Mass. 218; New York 14. E. R. Co. v. Bristol, r&gt;i r. s. 556; Selectmen of Norwood v. New rk a N. E. R. Co., 161 Mass, 250; Illinois C. R. Co. v. Copiah County, \li&gt;s. us:.; City of Harriman v. Southern R.

            <seg id="p532">532 In a later case, Justice Holmes, in delivering the opinion of the supreme court of the United States in Erie R. Co. V. Board Of Public Utility Commissioners, 254 U. B. 394, made use of the following langu - age: "Grade crossings call for a necessary adjustment of two eon - fliciting interests, that of the public using the -streets and that of the railroads and the public using them. Generally the streets represent the more important interest of the two. There can be doubt that they did when these railroads were laid out, or that the advent of automo - biles has given them an additional claim to consideration. They always are the necessity of the whole public, which the railroads, vital as they are, hardly can be called to the same extent. Being places to which the public is invited and that it necessarily frequents, the in the caiv of which this interest is and from which, ultimately, the railroads derive their right to occupy the law, has a constitutional right to in - sist that they shall not be made dangerous to the public, whatever may be the cost of the parties introducing the danger. That is one of the most obvious cases of the police power, or to put the same proposition in another form, the authority of the railroads to project their moving masses across thoroughfares must be taken to 1m- subject to the im - plied limitation that it may be cut down whenever and so far ;i&gt; the safety of the public requires. It is said that if the same requirement were made for the other grade crossings of the road it would soon be bankrupt. That the states might lie so foolish as to kill a goose that lays golden eu^s for them has no bearings on their constitutional rights. If it reasonably can be said that safety requires the change, it is for them to say Whether they will insist upon it, and neither pro - spective bankruptcy nor engagement in interstate commerce can take away this fundamental right of the sovereign of the soil. Denver &amp; R. G. R. Co. v. City and County of Denver, 250 r. s. _&gt;4i. To engage in in - terstate commerce the railroad must get onto the land, and to get onto it must comply with the conditions imposed by the state for the safety of its citizens. Contracts made by the road are made subject to the possible exercise of the sovereign right. Denver A R. G. R. Co. V. City and County of Denver, 250 U S. 241 Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Co., 248 i . s. 372; Louisville a M. R. Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, Northern P. R. C. v. State, 208 U. S. 583 ; Manigauet v, Springs, 199 I*. S. 473. If the burdens imposed are so great that the road cannot be run at a profit it can stop, whatever the misfortunes the stopping may produce. Brooks Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission Of Louisiana, 251 D. S. 396. Intelligent self-interest should lead to a careful consideration of what the road is able to do without ruin, but this is not a constitutional duty. In the opinion of the courts below, the evidence justified the conclusion of the board that the expense would not be ruinous. Many details as to the particular situation of this road are disposed of without the need of further mention by 'what we have said thus far. The plaintiff in error discusses with consider - able detail the effect of the changes upon private sidings. But its </seg>
            <seg id="p533">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 533 tits in respect of these are at least no greater than those in respect the main line and are covered by the preceding discussion." A consideration of cases above cited discloses that the source of the state's authority to adopt regulations for public safety at grade crossings is the police power of the state, and that the elimination of grade crossings is within the scope of that power. The fundamental fact upon which its existence is justified is that its exercise promotes the safety of either or both of -two distinct classes, (1) the pas - nengen transported by the railways, and (2) travelers proceeding over the "intersected way"'. These considerations apply to "farm i:rade crossings". It must be conceded that each of these, in greater or less degree, is a place of potential danger. Indeed, some farm crossings, because of peculiar situation, may impose greater perils upon the public there in course of transportation, as well as upon per - sons ami property on the premises where situated, than such as are incidental to usual grade crossings upon public highways. The re - gulation and elimination of farm grade crossings must therefore be deemed properly within the scope of the police power. The doctrine cannot be gainsaid that the police power of a state under federal and state constitution, when exercised in the interest of public safety, is unlimited except by the requirement that the exercise be not cap - ricious or wanton or unreasonable. The extent and conditions upon which this power will be exercised obviously is a matter of legislative discretion on part of the state. It follows that authorities set forth herein are applicable to the present case and controlling, and that section ."&gt;."&gt; 27, Camp. Stat. 1922, as amended, is valid and enforceable. Tne last proposition for consideration is embraced in the question, "I- the order of the Railway Commission reasonable in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case?" The authorities upon the ques - tion here involved are not numerous. Elliott on Railroads makes use of the following language as applicable thereto : ''Communication from one part of a landowner's property to another part, 'which has been cut off by a railroad right of way, is often provided for by pas - sageways and subways constructed under the tracks. As a rule, such passways and subways are more convenient for the landowner, and are at the same time much safer for the railway company, for col - lisions and injuries at such crossings are practically reduced to a minimum. There are but few adjudicated cases as to whether or not a company can be compelled to furnish a crossing by means of a pass - way or subway under the track . * * * It has, however, been held, and correctly, we think, that Where a railroad company was required to construct farm crossings, and it appeared that the track was on a high embankment, and there was a natural depression through which a subway could be more conveniently constructed than a grade crossing, such subway would be ordered constructed." 3 Elliott, Railroads (3d ed.) 476 .Beardsley v.

E. P. Boyer Lumber &amp; Coal Company and wholesale business concerns and corporations doing business in naha, severally joined the plaintiff railroad company in a petition intervention. From an adverse ruling by the Commission the rail - ad corporation has appealed. 115 Neb. Re,.. 727 </seg>
            <seg id="p535">535 ■ Iii this action, the corporation states the issues in its brief, from viewpoint, in this language : t"The question involved in this appeal is whether or not the order the Nebraska State Railway Commission requiring the Missouri :ific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska to open, its team tracks on it is known as the 'Belt Line' in the city of Omaha to the public uld be upheld, or, in other words, whether the order of the Nebraska te Railway Commission should be sustained whereby the Missouri ■itic Railroad Corporation in Nebraska is required to switch ears Phave arrived in Omaha in the course of intrastate railroad trans - ition upon a railroad other than the Missouri Pacific- to a team k owned by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska, a Switching charge." The argument on which the corporation relies for a reversal of the order is that the Railway Commission should have sustained a ■ertain order of May 2. 1!)2H, wherein the Commission held that team 3 of the corporation are for its sole use and that switching ser - rom and to such tracks should not be performed for connecting lers. And this, it is argued, is on the ground that the team tracks he corporation arc its private property, and, besides, it is ar.irued hat it is the uniform custom of carriers to use team tracks for hand - ing the business of their own lines exclusively. It is further argued K. to compel the railroad company to place upon its team tracks arriving in Omaha on foreign lines, and upon which cars the Mis- i Pacific has not had the line haul, is a discrimination in favor ither common carriers. And it is also contended that to compel railroad company to allow foreign line cars to be placed on its n tracks would result in congestion upon its licit line and impair ability to properly handle its own business on the belt line. And, tides, the argument continues, there is no provision in the charter the belt lint mpany which requires the opening of the team tracks ttiie public- or to switch cars from other roads to its team tracks for switching charge. It is also urged that public interest is not con - ned in the application for the revocation of the order of the Rail - y Commission of May 2, 1023, nor is there any demand by the )lic for such revocation. tOn the part of the Railway Commission, and Trenmor Cone, in - vener and amicus curiae, the argument in substance is that on May 1023, the Railway Commission approved an application filed by the ■poration to publish the following item in its freight tariff, namely: t'^eam tracks of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in raska are for its sole use, and switching service from or to such ks will not be performed for connecting railroads." </seg>
            <seg id="p536">536 The order also contained the following condition I "It should be understood that this conclusion is without prejudice any cause of action which may hereafter arise concerning the rea - lableness of this or any similar tariff ruling." I But, on September 27, 1923, the Railway Commission entered following: order: "Whereas, on the second day of May, 1923, this Commission issued an order, effective upon thirty days' notice, authorizing the Missouri Pacific Kailroad Corporation in Nebraska to publish a new and additional item in its freight tariff, Nebraska No. 7. said item reading as follows: k" 'Team tracks of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in raska are for its sole use, and switching service from or to such ks will not be performed for connecting railroads," and "Whereas, order of approval was issued upon ex parte showing oi said Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska and upon condition that it was without prejudice to any cause of action which might arise concerning the unreasonableness of this or any similar tariff ruling; and Whereas, complaint has been lodged with this 1 § unreasonableness of sai.l rule, and it appearing to the • t good and sufficient cause exists for further investij properiety and reasonableness &lt;&gt;I said rule: "Therefore, be it resolved, that the said Missouri Pa&lt; r&gt; Erporation in Nebraska be, and it hereby is. ordered to appear in the ice- of the Commission at Lincoln, Nebraska, at 10 o'clock a. in., on twenty-third day of October, 1923, to show cause why such order nli-r shoud not be revoked or modified, and that due notice of be given to all interested parties.' tThe corporation argues that the belt line congestion is so in-eat t its facilities are not sufficient to properly perform the required vices. From this it appears that it was its duty to enlarge the ilities. Complaint is made that the switching rates are not eom - isatnry, but the Commission points out that no application was made an order to fix compensatory rates. And the Commission directs • attention to the fact that the corporation's predecessor operated belt line for about 40 years without a complaint. This, of course, not of itself conclusive. But the Commission explicitly held that re is not sufficient around to support the plea of inadequancy of opensation. The argument is that the legislature is the body to </seg>
            <seg id="p537">537 whom application should be made for such relief, if any, as the cor - poration may be entitled to in the premises. I We think the question before us turns the question of the power of Railway Commission, and it appears to us that the Railway Com - ion acted within its powers and that the remedy of the railway oration lies with the legislature. tit may be observed that a dealer had 50 cars of sand and gravel delivery at one of the corporation's team tracks in Omaha, and testified that he was informed that the corporation had some w rules'' in effect that very day and that there would be no more n tnu-k deliveries unless the dealen would pay the new switching rge of $6.30 a car. This, he testified, was a prohibitive rate on class of shipment. The result was that he lost about 30 customers retained only 4. The "new rules" put this shipper hit of busi - ~ without fault on his part. The same situation prevails in respect hay, jrrain, and other shipments. There is evidence tending to prove that out of 39,781 cars that re "switched" in 1922, only 1,375 of these were from other roads and Kv wen- set out at team tracks at the rate of only four cars a The Commission granted a rehearing upon application of the f poration and at this hearing it was shown that during the periods the heaviest freight movement the largest number of cars handled 1 August, June, July and September, each day was, in the average of respective mouths. !-'•_&gt; phis, 5 plus. 7 plus and 9 plus, and this ulatioo was based on J(i working days to the month. in Grand Trunk R.

To lat mixed trains are not passenger trains is not to say that they •eight trains.

The secretary advised me that there were no era! regulations prohibiting the use of wooden cars commingled h steel oars other than a regulation of the post office department h reaped to postal cars. The secretary also advised that several s had been introduced from time to time upon the subject but none i been passed.
