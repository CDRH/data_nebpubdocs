GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE 

Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Bepresentatives : 

Legislative authority has been conferred upon you at an auspicious 
period in the history of the State. Since the last regular 
session of the Legislature there has been a marked degree of prosperity 
in every department of industry, and our growth in population 
and wealth has been a marvelous event, even to those who 
had indulged the most sanguine anticipations in contemplating 
the possibilities of the future. A brief review of our State history 
may be profitably considered in this connectior. At the 
date of admission into the Union, in 1867, thepopulation of Nebraska 
was estimated at 70,000, and the aggregate valuation of 
the taxable property of the State was $20,115,252. The population 
at the present time, as estimated on the basis of a moderate increase 
over the census of 1880, is not less than 600,000. The 
total assessed value of property as shown by the grand assessment 
roll of 1882, on file in the office of the State Auditor, is 
$98,537,475.11. 

The sparse settlements of 1867 were #emote from centres of 

ie and -railroad connections, and were deprived of most of 
comforts of life. The people of Nebraska are now brought 
close relations with the commercial and social world, and it is a 
ifying fact that every organized county in the State, except 
it, has railroad facilities. Two principal agencies have accomlud 
this transformation. The homesteaders, under the liberal 
cy of the general government, accepting a heritage which in 
if was a valuable legacy, have toiled from year to year with 
6 J &gt; J J </seg>

            <seg id="p004">
Iaring energy and splendid success in improving the lands thus 
ared. The capitalists of this and other countries having a 
jee of faith in our future which has been more than justified 
results, pushed the work of railroad extension in Nebraska 
h unexampled zeal and thus opened the way for the large 
nigration which followed from the Eastern States and the old 
rid. 

The policy of the General Government, in granting aid to railroads, 
as in giving homesteads to settlers, was designed to promote 
the common welfare, and it speedily gave us a railroad system 
which has been a potent agency in developing our natural resources. 
The practical co-operation of the above mentioned 
agencies has brought us to a period of prosperity which is contemplated 
with feelings of pride by every citizen of Nebraska. 

FINANCIAL. 

|*he condition of the State finances has materially improved 
;e the date of my last biennial message, although the treasury 
not yet fully recovered from the embarrassing results of the 
; of 1879, limiting the rate of taxation for general purposes to 
i mills on the dollar. The increased levy of 1881 has afforded 
tial relief, and underthe energetic management of the Treasurer 
liabilities of the State have been promptly met. It is believed 
t no serious complications can occur before the general fund 
I be sufficient to cover all expenditures. 

Â» 

On the 19th of October, 1882, the Board of Investment, created 
by Art. 13, Chap. 83 of the Compiled Statutes, decided that the 
U. 8. 4 per cent, bonds, amounting to $50,000, heretofore purchased 
by direction of the Board, should be sold on the best 
terms to be obtained for the purpose of sustaining the public 
credit and meeting current demands upon the treasury. The 
sale was effected and upon the 23d of October the returns were</seg>

placed to the credit of the State. The transaction is accurately 

set forth in the following statement: Original cost of bonds at 

$1.03 1-16 (less charges) $51,718.75. Amount realized on sale at 

$1.1% $59,750. Profit on investment, $8,031.25. Interest re- 

ceived on bonds to date of sale by the State, $5,500. Total profit, 

$13,531.25. 

The receipts and disbursements of the treasury for the two 

years ending November 30th, 1882, as shown by the treasurers 

report were as follows : 

f 

Balance in Treasury November 30th, 1880". $ 343,018.61 

Receipts from all sources during the two years ending 
Nov. 30th, 1882, including transfers 1,943,307.64 

Total amount 2,286,326.25 

Disbursed during same period, including transfers 1,814,211.75 

Balance on hand Nov. 30th, 1882 472,114.50 

The bonded indebtedness of the State remains as reported in 

my last biennial message, viz : 

Relief bonds due in 1885 50,000.00 

Funding bonds due in 1897 449,267.85 

Total 499,267.85 

Under the Relief Bond Act of 1875, provision was made for 

paying the interest and principal of the Bonds by levying an an 

nual tax of one-tenth of one mill. Subsequently this part of the 

act was repealed and it was provided that the interest and prin- 

cipal of the bonds shall be paid out of the Sinking Fund. This 

left a balance of $10,643.38 credited to the Relief Bond fund, and 

as the bonds will become due in 1885, 1 concur in the opinion of 

the Treasurer that the above amount should be transferred to the 

sinking fund. </seg>

            <seg id="p006">
auditor's department 

The aggregate valuation of property assessed for taxation in 

131, as shown by the Auditor's report, was $93,142,456.99, and 
1882, $98,537,475.11. The rates of levy and amounts that will 

accrue to the State on ihe assessment of 1882, are as follows :

General fund, 4| mills $ 437,874.44 

Sinking fund, J " 23,726.15 

School fund, 1 " 98,537.47 

University fund, | " 36,951.56 

Total $ 597,089.62 

A special effort has been made to collect delinquent taxes by 
county treasurers, and they have been uniformly successful. 

Etie Auditor calls attention to the fact that $6,396.51 of the 
000 appropriated in 1881 for the purpose of furnishing revebooks 
and blanks to the several counties was necessarily 
used to pay for books and blanks previously furnished, leaving 
ft the small amount of $3,603.49 to be used for that purpose 
ng the past two years, and the result is a deficiency of 7,-54. 
An appropriation of $18,000 to cover the deficiency 
provide supplies for tbe next two years is recommended by 
Auditor. 

The fees collected in the insurance department of the Auditor's 
office during the two years ending Nov. 30th, 1882, amounted 
to $14,178.62, being more than the amount appropriated for the 
expenses of that department during the same period of time. 

Under Sec. 19, Art. 3, of the Constitution you are required to 
provide for the payment of the expenses of the State government 
from March 31st, 1883 to March 31st, 1885. The estimates 
made, as the law provides, by the several State officers and </seg>

            <seg id="p007">
heads of departments, showing the amounts that will be needed 
for that purpose, appear in the appendix herewith submitted. 

LAND COMMISSIONER'S DEPARTMENT. 

A very satisfactory exhibit is made in the report of the land 
commissioner showing the transactions of that office during the 
two years ending Nov. 30th, 1882. The business of the department 
has been thoroughly systematized and commendable progress 
has been made in ascertaining the status of school lands 
sold and leased in former years and upon which purchasers 
and lessees are in default for non-payment of interest or rentals. 
A considerable amount of these lands have reverted to the State 
and have been promptly leased by other parties. 

The amount of interest and rentals due the State and now delinquent, 
on school land sales and leases is $92,984, an increase 
of $13,950 over the amount due in 1880. This result is doubtless 
due to the fact that many irresponsible persons have purchased 
or leased school lands solely for speculative purposes, and 
to the further fact that the power of the State to enforce or annul 
these contracts is not sufficiently well defined. I therefore 
recommend that the Board of Educational Lands and Funds be 
authorized to cancel all school land contracts upon which the 
purchaser or lessee is in default for non-payment of interest or 
rentals for a longer period than two years. 

In my last biennial message I called attention to the provision 
of the act of 1879, allowing parties holding educational lands 
under lease to purchase them, and asked that it be modified so 
as to authorize the Board of Educational Lands and Funds to 
withhold contracts when the appraisement is manifestly too low. 
No action was taken by the Legislature and this obnoxious feature 
of the law continues in force. Parties may conspire to de- </seg>

            <seg id="p008">
fraud the state by a dishonest appraisement and the Board has do 
power to defeat the conspiracy, as a contract must issue when the 
law has been complied with. I urgently renew the recommendation 
I made at that time, believing that you will realize the 
importance of amending the act in the manner suggested. 

In July, 1880, the General Land Commissioner addressed a 
letter to the Land Commissioner of this state informing him that 
in order to reach a satisfactory settlement of claims for indemnity 
due the State outside of Indian reservations, a carefully pretid 
list of the deficiencies occurring in each of said sections, 
and 36), "giving credit against each section for the indemwhich 
may have been selected therefor and approved," 
ild be forwarded to the General Land Office for comparison 
i its" records. 

Of the class of lands above referred to, over 8,000 acres are 
II due the state. The records of the Land Commissioner's office 
not furnish the necessary data for the report required by the 
neral Land Commissioner. In order to prepare such a report 
isit to each of the IT. S. land offices in the State for the purie 
of examining plats and records would be necessary. The 
ie employed in the Land Commissioner's office will not admit of 
etail sufficient for that purpose. I concur in the recomuienda- 

Kof the Commissioner that an appropriation be made to onthe 
Board of Educational Lands and Funds to procure the 

rary data and prepare the lists called for by the General 
Commissioner. 

In conformity with a decision made in 1880 by the Commissioner 
of the General Land Office, the substance of which was 
embodied in my last biennial message, under which the State 
was allowed indemnity for school lands in lieu of sections 16 and 
86 within the Otoe and Pawnee Indian Reservations, the Land </seg>

            <seg id="p009">
Commissioner and Attorney General acting under the direction 
of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, made a selection 
of lands on the 14th of October, 1881, in lieu of a portion of the 
double minimum lands within said reservations â€” aggregating 
11,944.06 acres. A list of the lands selected was filed in the 
land offi ce at North Platte, and the attention of the General 
Land Commissioner has been repeatedly called to the subject, 
but these hinds have not yet been confirmed to the State. In view 
of this extraordinary delay, the Land Commissioner suggests 
that an agent of the State should personally represent its interests 
in this matter at Washington. 

The large and increasing volume of business and numerous 
complications that have arisen in consequence of the imperfect 
manner in which the management and disposition of educational 
lands was conducted prior to the organization of the Land Department, 
has prompted the Commissioner to draft a bill embodying 
proposed legislation which is considered essential to the 
proper management of that department. The various suggestions 
therein contained will be considered by the Board of Edu 
cational Lands and Funds, with a view to reporting the bill to 
the Legislature in a satisfactory form. I trust that it will have 
your careful consideration, and that a liberal policy will be pursued 
in affording facilities which will enable the Land Department 
to properly control, preserve and utilize our large endowment 
of Educational Lands and Funds. 

The number of acres of these lands held by the State,, November 
30th, 1882, was 2,582,366.65. Of this amount 217,030 acres 
have been sold but not deeded. 489,440 have been leased, leaving 
1,872,846.65 acres subject to sale or lease. During the two years 
preceding the above date 274,699.70 acres were leased at an eeti- </seg>

            <seg id="p010">
mated aggregate valuation of $824,099.10. During the same 

period 88,627 acres were sold for the sum of $657,971.42, being 

an average of $7.42 per acre. 

EDUCATIONAL. 

The report of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction 

embodies a fund of valuable information concerning the com- 

mon school system of the State, the various institutions of learn- 

ing, and other educational interests. The school attendance in 

1882 was 115,546, an increase of 14,770 over the number in at- 

tendance the previous year. The total value of school property 

is estimated at $2,054,049.18. The report contains a carefully 

prepared statement of the Permanent School Fund, showing the 

manner in which it is invested, anil the aggrjjgate amount, as 

follows 

Cash in Treasury Nov. 30th, 1882 $ 135,208.37 

U. S. 4 per cent. Bonds 15,000.00 

County Bonds 303,600.00 

Mortgages ' 4000.00 

State Funding Bonds 326,267.35 

Claims in hands of Atty. General for collection 7,692.23 

Notes from sales of School Lands 1,470,919.49 

,11V/, 

Grand T &gt;tal $2,262,687.44 

The fund derived from this endowment has increased from year 

to year in about the same proportion, as the increase of popula- 

tion consequently the distribution per capita, has not materially 

V 

changed. 

The graded schools of the State are justifying the anticipa- 

tions of those who have given attention to this feature of our 

educational system, and it is evident that they have established </seg>

            <seg id="p011">
a higher professional standard among teachers, from which pupils 
have derived corresponding benefits. 

The Superintendent of Public Instruction recommends that 
the law in regard to holding institutes be changed so as to make 
the attendance of teachers compulsory. If held while schools 
are in progress, it is recommended by him that they be temporarily 
suspended, and that the several school boards be required 
to pay half wages for the time that teachers are thus necessarily 
absent. 

A small appropriation is asked for by the State Superintendent 
to be used in publishing and distributing plans for the construction 
of school houses. In view of the fact that the moat 
obvious and important sanitary considerations are frequently ignored 
in the construction of such buildings, any suggestions that 
may lead to improvements in this particular, should have proper 
consideration. 

STATE UNIVERSITY. 

The unfortunate controversy which was for some time a disturbing 
element in connection with the affairs of the State 
University has been brought to a close, and the Faculty is in process 
of reorganization upon a basis which enables the institution 
tenter upon a period of enlarged usefulness and prosperity, 
e position of Chancellor will undoubtedly be filled by the 
Board of Regents at an early period. 

A fund has been accumulating in the State Treasury known as 
the Regent's fund, derived from the leasing of University lands 
and from other sources. It is suggested by the Board of Regents 
that the amount now on hand, viz: $8,115.91 be appropriated for 
the use of the University to make necessary repairs and cover </seg>

            <seg id="p012">
Ker incidental expenses. It is recommended also by the Board 
t the levy off of a mill be continued for the present. 

STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 

A pefiod of uninterrupted prosperity is reported by the Principal 
of the State Normal School â€” the last year being the most 
prosperous in its history. The catalogue shows an attendance 
of 318 students. It is believed that, in point of efficiency, the 
school will compare favorably with similar institutions in other 
owl ILS. 

This in8titu-ion is exclusively devoted to the work of preparing 
students for the profession of teaching, and while all who graduate 
may not follow this vocation, it will undoubtedly add large numbers 
to the roll of thoroughly competent teachers in our common 
schools. The wants of the school and appropriations required 
for the ensuing two years are fully set forth in the report ot 
the Principal, to which 3'ou are referred for additional information. 

SECRETARY OF STATE. 

The report of the Secretary of State embodies important details 
concerning the business of that department and contains recommendations 
which are the results of long experience in connection 
with State affairs. An elaborate plan for letting State printing 
contracts, covering all kinds of work of this character, is submitted 
by the Secretary and is worthy of consideration. 

It is recommended by the Secretary that the present limitation 
t&gt;n the number of notaries] public for each county be removed, 
view of the fact that the quota is ample for some counties 
I not sufficient for others, the law should be amended so as to 
&gt;w a larger number to bo appointed in each county, or the limrlon 
should be wholly removed. The basis upon which the quota </seg>

            <seg id="p013">
is fixed under the existing law is variable and unsatisfactory. The 
vote in some of the counties was lighter at the late election than 
at the election of 1880, and the quota of notaries is decreased, 
although the population is undoubtedly greater than it was at 
that time. 

The Secretary recommends the repeal of the Act of 1869, providing 
for an annual State Census, as the law is inoperative in 
some counties, the returns therefore being of little value. Instead 
of an annual census it is recommended that a Suite census be 
taken in the year 1885, and every ten years thereafter, thus alternating 
with the U. S. census. 

STATE LIBRARY. 

The report of the State Librarian shows 21,487 volumes now 
on the shelves of the library. It has been recently arranged in 
more commodious quarters on the ground floor of the oast wing, 
and comprises a large number of very valuable and important 
works. I heartily endorse the recommendations of the Librarian 
relative to the building up of its Xcbraska Department of History, 
and trust that the citizens of the State will add thereto by voluntary 
contributions of reliable data covering important events in 
the history of the State. 

STATE INSTITUTIONS. 

The management of the charitable, reformatory and penal 
institutions of the State during the past two years, has been 
without exception eminently satisfactory. 

HOSPITAL FOR THE INSANE. 

The biennial report of the Superintendent of the Hospital for 
the Insane will inform you in regard to the management and </seg>

            <seg id="p014">
wants of that institution. On the 30th of Nov. 1880, there were 193 
patients. During the two years following, 288 were received, 
165 discharged, 1 escaped and 42 died, leaving |273 in the Hospital, 
Nov. 30, 1882. The Superintendent has been able to receive 
all insane persons whom he has been asked to admit. The Hospital 
farm has been very productive during the past year and the 
crops produced have materially decreased the average cost tff 
maintaining the inmates. 

I invite special attention to the recommendations of the Superintendent 
in relation to building an engine house and providing an 
ample 6upply of water. These recommendations are considered 
vtry important, as a disastrous conflagration is liable to originate 
in the boiler room, which is^now in the centre of the basement 
of the main building. 

The new wings of the hospital providedfor by the Legislature 
Bits last regular session are rapidly approaching completion, 
will be j'our duty to make suitable provision for furnishing 
and preparing them for occupation. 

The Superintendent's report shows that there has been consid 
erable difficulty and much irregularity in making collections from 
the several counties of amounts due the State for the support of 
their insane. Some of the most populous and wealthy counties, 
having the largest number of inmates, pay the smallest amounts 
for that purpose. This evil should be promptly corrected. 

The generous policy heretofore pursued by the State for the 
tose of ameliorating the condition of the insane has been 
ly creditable, and I trust that the same fostering care will 
continue to be exercised in providing for the wants of thisinsti- 
Eon. Much important information concerning the business 
lagement of the Hospital, including a detailed statement show- </seg>

he crop yield of the farm connected therewith, will be fouud 
in the Steward's report. 

The average cost /Â¦ -i/&gt;if,i jut wâ€”k of maintaining the in 

mates of the asylum, including salaries and expenses of every 

kind during the past two yours has been $3. 24.1 

INSTITUTE FOR THE DEAF AND DUMI 

At the regular Kwon of 1881, the Legislature provided for the 
construction of an additional building in connection with the 
Institute for the Deaf and DutuK The building has been erected 

and completed by contract under the general supervision of the 
Board of Public Lands and Buildings and is now partly occupied. 
It is a brick structure forty-two feet (42) by sixty-six (66), 
with basement and three rtorini. An appropriation for the purpose 
of famishing the new building is needed. Other valuable 
improvements have been male, and the institute is generally in 
a very salisfa -lory condition. It is recommended by the principal 
that an additional amount of land contiguous to the Institute 
be purchased for its benefit. A number of interesting features 
have been added to the methods of instruction. The use of the 

vocal organs has been taught with the aid of the audiphone, and 
the experiment has been remarkably successful. 

A printing office is successfully operated by the pupils and 
they are issuing a semi-monthly journal which is very creditably 
conducted, and all expenses connected with ita publication , are 
met by subscriptions and advertising patronage. The total number 
of pupils in attendance is 120, an increase of 24 over the 
number reported two years ago. The average cost per capita 
per week of maintenance of inmates has been $3.29. 

Applications have-been made to secure the admission of feebleminded 
children, and I earnestly endorse the opinion expressed </seg>

            <seg id="p016">
governor's message. 

by the principal that the time has arrived when an institution 
for this class of unfortunates should be organized either on an 
independent basis or in connection with some other State charitable 
institution. 

INSTITUTE FOR THE BLIND. 

The educational and industrial departments of the Institute 
for the Blind have been conducted with gratifying success. Iu 
addition to obtaining a thorough education the pupils are becoming 
proficient in various branches of industry, and a majority of 
them will become self-supporting. The iiuraBfer enrolled at 
the present time is twenty-five. The principal asks that an appropriation 
of |3,000 be made for the purpose of providing the 
building with steam heating apparatus. The average cost per 
capita per week of maintaining the inmates during the past two 
years has been $5.33. 

STATE REFORM SCHOOL. 

In accordance with the act of the Legislature of 1881, providing 
for the organization of a State Reform School at Kearney, 
the Board of Public Lands and Buildings on the 29th of April 
of that year, appointed Hon. Geo. W. Collins Superintendent, 
and also appointed the subordinate officers authorized by said 
act. The school was formally opened in June, 1881, and has been 
successfully operated since that time. There are now thirtyseven 
inmates, and the capacity of the building is only sufficient 
to comfortably accommodate thirty. The construction of a building 
or buildings sufficient for one hundred and fifty inmates is 
recommended by the Board of Public Lands and Buildings and 
also by the Superintendent. The tendency of the Reform School 
to repress and prevent the commission of crime is indisputable,</seg> 

            <seg id="p017">
governor's message. 

17 

and if supported on a liberal scale it will prevent large expenditures 
for the punishment of hardened criminals. It viewed only 
from a humane stand-point the school should have every enc-ouragement, 
as it enables. the !&gt;tate to rescue a large number of 
children from vicious surroundings and give them the advan- 

tages of a good education together with well established habits 

of industry 

Your attention is directed to the fact that while the law provides 
that the State shall pay all necessary expenses connected 
with the transportation of juvenile offenders sent to the Reform 
School, no appropriation has been made for that purpose. 

PENITENTIARY. 

Under the effective management of the Warden of the Penitentiary 
the affairs of that institution have been conducted iu a 

very satisfactory manner during the past two years. 

Your attention is especially called to the recommendation of 
the Warden that an appropriation be made for the purpose of providing 
an abundant supply of water. Whether this can be best 
accomplished by means of an artesian well, or otherwise, is a question 
which you will be able to determine after obtaining accurate 
knowledge of the situation. It is unquestionably the duty of 
the State to furnish the supply of water required, and this duty 

should no longer be neglected. In connection with this im- 

provement a thorough system of sewerage should be provided. 
Other important recommendations are made in the Warden's re- 

port, to which I also refer you for statements in detail concern 

ing the wants of the prison. 
Tlie act approved Feb. 26th, 1^70, extending the contract for 

lease of penitentiary and of the labor &lt;&gt;t' the convicts, provides 

that after January 1st, 1884, Is'cbiaska prisoners only shall be </seg>

kept in said penitentiary. At that date the prison will contain 

Â¦f 

Rimbet of United States, New Mexico and Wyoming prison - 
sentence&lt;l tor a period extending beyond that time, while the 
act of our own Legislature makes it the duty of the Warden to 
exclude them from the prison. The complications that may 
arise in consequence of this siate of atfairs should he avoided by 
proper legislation. 

The state of discipline in the prison has Wen all that could be 
desired and the health of the conrictl under the excellent medi- 

cal supervision of the prison physician has been exceptionally 
good, only one death having occurred in the last two years. The 
number of prisoners reported by the warden on the 30th of November, 
1882 was 261. Of these, three are United States prisoners, 
seven are from New Mexico and thirty-nine from Wyomin 
â€” leaving two hundred and twelve that are State convicts â€” 
an increase of only-six over the number reported two years ago. 

MILITARY AFFAIRS. 

An elaborate report of the military attairs of the State is made by 
the Adjutant General covering the period that has elapsed since 
the organization of the National. Guard in 1881. You will find 
therein a carefully prepared history of the organization of the 1st 
regiment X. X. G. and of the Blue Springs Light Artillery ; also 
a multitude of details concerning their equipment. 

The operation- of the military in connection with the suppres- 
sion of the riots at Omaha having been fully set forth in my mes- 
sage to the Legislature at the special session in May, 1882, it "is 
not necessary to enlarge upon the subject at this time, but I.take 
fasure in again testifying to the efficiency of the State troops 
that occasion, and repeat the statement then made that the </seg>

results justified the wisdom of the legislature in providing for a 

more thorough military organisatioo 

The recommendation of the Adjutant General that an appropriation 
be made sufficient to enable tin- National Guard to hold 
an encampment annually BM my mnttH approval, as it is impossible 
to maintain an effective military organization of this character 
without affording proper facilities for instruction and drill. 

The very thorough and critical report of the Inspector Genial 
will enable you to arrive at proper conclusions concerning the 
atate ot discipline that prevails and the legislation that is necessary 
to give greater efficiency to the service. The principal 
causes of dissatisfaction mentioned by the Inspector General have 
recently been removed. Until the beginning of November, 1882, 
the companies had provided their own uniforms, as it was not 
considered advisable to use any portion of the military appropriation 
for that purpose. Within the last sixty days seven companies 
of the Guard have been provided with U. 8. regulation fatigue 
uniforms, and are now in all respects well equipped. The payment 
of armory rent for the regiment and the expeuse of providing 
uniforms as above stated wholly exhausted the military appropriation. 
The remaining companies should lie uniformed in like 
manner as soon as practicable. I concur in the recommendation 
made by the Adjutant General that an appropriation of $5,000 
per annum be made for the purpose of defraying the necessary 
expenses of the military organization of the State during the next 

two years 

I refer you to the carefully prepared report of the Quartermaster 
General for details* concerning the military property of the State, 
distribution of ordinance Store*, receipts and disbursements of 
money, ami other matters connected with his department. 

In taking leave of this subject mv connection with the military </seg>

            <seg id="p020">
affairs of the State ia brought to a close, and I avail myself of the 
opportunity to express my gratitude to the officers of rny personal 
Btati'as well as to the officers and enlisted men of the Guard for 
their fidelity to duty and earnest co-operation in every effort to 
increase the efficiency of our military service. 

RAILROAD LEGISLATION. 

Important questions of State policy involving, the regulation 
of rates of transportation over railroads, require your careful 
consideration. The problem is comparatively a new one in State 
and National affairs, and its solution is attended with difficulties 
of a complicated character. To determine what legislation is 
necessary for the purpose of subjecting railroad corporations to 
proper legal control without injustice to the people or the railroads 
requires a very thorough knowledge of railroad construction 
and management, and also a clear understanding of the abuses 
complained of by the public. Judicious legislation, to accomplish 
this object, is demanded by the substantial business men and farmers 
of the State. The clamor of those who are conducting an 
indiscriminate war upon railroads for the obvious purpose of advancing 
their own personal or political interests should be studiously 
ignored. It is as much your duty to prevent mischievous 
legislation upon this subject, as it is to provide that which is 
based upon exact principles of justice. 

In the 6tate of Illinois every phase of the question has been 
under consideration during the past twelve years, and by means 
of a Board of Railroad Commissioners, equitable rates of transportation 
have been established and many of the abuses complained 
of corrected. An examination of the laws of that State 
will ftbow that the Commissioners have power to tix maximum 
rates of transportation which shall be prima /(KM evidence of </seg>

            <seg id="p021">
reasonableness, and as the burden of proof is on the railroad 
corporations whenever an attempt is made by them to establish 
the reasonableness of higher rates, the result is that the 
schedules prepared by the Commissioners are usually accepted 
by the railroad companies as conclusive. The law, however, does 
not prevent them from establishing higher rates by going into 
the Courts and demonstrating their reasonableness before a jury 
of the people. In the report of the Commissioners for 1881, 
page 20, the statement is made that " the right to fix reasonable 
maximum rates for the transportation of freights and passengers 
by railroads,' either by direct statute or by officers created by 
law, is no longer seriously questioned." The enforcement of the 
Illinois act of 1873, to prevent extortion and unjust discrimination 
in the matter of giving special rates and rebates has been 
Ended with greater difficulties, but the Commissioners have 
le very satisfactory progress in that direction. 

I also invite your attention to the laws of Iowa providing for 
the organization of a Board of Railwaj' Commissioners, and to 
their subsequent reports and proceedings. The general results 
in that State have justified the act of the legislature creating 
the Board. The reperts of the Commissioners, both of Illinois 
and Iowa, contain a mass of valuable information bearing upon 
everv feature of the question, and may be studied with profit 
by all who are interested in securing impartial legislation upon 
this subject in our own State. 

While I do not assume that the Commission system is the only 
practicable method of dealing with the problem, I regard it as 
the best that has yet been devised. My opinion is strengthened 
by the fact that during the past fifteen years it has been steadily 
gaining in popular favor and has been adopted by about twenty </seg>

            <seg id="p022">
Believing that you will be guided by wise counsels iu whatever 
action you may take upon this important subject, I pass to 
the consideration of other topics. 

TATE BOARD'x&gt;F EQUALIZATION 

A common misapprehension exists concerning the duties and 
powers of the State Board of Equalization in connection with 
the assessment of railroad property, and I therefore invite your 
attention to the act of 1881 on this subject, wherein it is provided 
that the president, secretary, superintendent or other principal 
officers within this State, of every railroad and telegraph 
company shall list and return to the Auditor of Public Accounts 
for assessment aud taxation, "the number of miles of such railroad 
and telegraph line in each organized county in the State, 
and the total number of miles in 4;he State, including the roadbed, 
right of way, and superstructures thereon v _main and side 

b 

tracks, depot buildings and depot grounds, section ana tool housesrolling 
stock and personal property necessary for the construe, 
tion. repairs, or successful operation of such railroad aud telegraph 
lines.'" 

The tangible property above described is the only railroad 
property that is subject to assessment by the Board. 

Section I Article IX of the Constitution makes it the duty of 
the Legislature to provide for the assessment of the property and 
franchises of individuals and corporations, but there has been 
no legislation to give effect to that part of the Constitution relating 
to franchises, and the Board has no authority to assess 
this species of property. 

]No official duty which the several State officers comprising the 
Board are called upon to perform, is so liable to misconstruction 
and censure, as that of assessing railroad property. The problem ia </seg>

            <seg id="p023">
UO\ERNOR&lt; MESSACF. 

23 

complex in itself and is made more difficult by the loose manner 
in which all property is assessed tor taxation. It would doubtless 
be agreeable to the Board to be relieved of this duty if it 
could be done in a manner not prejudicial to the best interest.* 

of the State. 

Railroad property has been listed tor taxation by the various 
companies under oath as provided by law, and every means within 
the power of the Board has been employed to obtain Â¦ fair and 
just valuation of the property so listed. In the judgment of the 
Board such property has been assessed at a valuation corresponding 
with that of other property throughout the State. In fact, if a 
comparison with assessments of railroad property, and of other 
property, made in other states may be taken a* a guide, it will be 
found that under the present law the taxation of railroad property 
has been higher comparatively, in this State, than in most 
others. 

The- section of the constitution cited above declare? that the 

Legislature " Shall provide such revenue as may be needful, by 
levying a tax by valuation, so that every person and corporation 
shall pay a tax in proportion to the value of his, her or its property 
and franchises," and the present revenue law provides for 
the valuation ot personal property "at its fair cash value." and 
realty "at its fair value estimated at the price it would bring at a 
voluntary sale thereof," but through the influence of public opinion 
and an established custom more potent than law, these provisions 
have been universally ignored, ami all property has been 
valued for taxation at less than half its real value. The embarrassing 
position in which the State Board of Equalization as well aa 
all County Boards and Precinct Assessors are placed by this demoralizing 
custom is obvious to all. </seg>

            <seg id="p024">
E trust that this subject, in all of its bearings, may receive the 
sidoration that its importance demands, and that you will dei 
a method by which the difficulties encountered in endeavoring 
to fix a correct and uniform valuation upon all property listed 
for taxation may be entirely removed. 

STATE LITIGATION. 

The several cases in which the State is interested now pending 
or recently decided, are reported by the Attorney General and 
published in the appendix hereto attached. The large amount 
of legal business of this character transacted during the past two 
years, has imposed no charges upon the State for counsel fees, 
and I call attention to this fact as a tribute to the fidelity and 
efficiency of the Attorney General, to whom I am also under 
many obligations for the valuable aid that he has rendered me in 
the discharge of my official duties. 

FISH COMMISSION. 

The work of the Board of Fish Commissioners was seriously 
retarded in the early part of 1881, by the death of Hon. II. S. 
Kalcy, who was I member of the Board. In September of that 
year, lion. B. E. B. Kennedy was appointed to fill the vacancy 
and negotiations were soon after commenced for the purchase 
I he Hatchery of Messrs. Romaine &amp; Decker in Sarpy county, 
in March, 1882, the purchase was consummated. This propembraces 
fifty-two acres of land upon which is situated a 
sr supply which is considered the finest in the State for a 
chery. In October, 1881, the Commissioners received from 
U.S. Commissioner of Fisheries, 500,000 Salmon eggs which 
e immediately hatched, and the young fish distributed in the 
amB of the State. In November of that year the Commission </seg>

            <seg id="p025">
governor's message. 

25 

obtained a supply of German Carp, a very valuable fish which 
may be readily propagated for food by every farmer who will 
provide himself with the proper facilities. The Commissioners 
have also obtained and distributed a considerable number of 
brook and California trout. 

Substantial improvements were made in connection with the 
Hatchery during the fall and summer of 1882. The zeal and 
energy of the Board in prosecuting its work is worthy of special 
commendation. I again call attention to the fact that the Legislature 
has provided no compensation for services performed bj 
the Commissioners, nor for the "payment of actual expenses incurred 
by them while employed in their official capacity. I refer 
you to their report for further details in regard to the work accomplished, 
and the appropriation that will be necessary to continue 
their operations during the ensuing two yerrs. 

NEW COUNTIES. 

It will be your duty to fix the boundaries of one or more new 
counties, to include portions of unorganized territory in the western 
part of the State. The rapid extension of railroads in that 
direction and corresponding increase of population, has created 
a necessity for immediate legislation upon this subject. I recommend 
that the act be tramed so that it will clearly designate the 
Judicial district to which such new County or Counties will 
become attached when fully organized. 

JUDICIAL DISTRICTS 

The administration of justice has been seriously retarded in a 
number of the Judicial Districts of the State by the large increase 
of business in the district courts. Legislation for the purpose of 
increasing the number of judges and judicial districts is in mj 
judgment imperatively demanded. </seg>

PARDONS. 

xecutive clemency has been exercised in one case during the 
two years, the reasons for which will be found in theappenpublished 
herewith. 

CLAIMS AGAINST THE STATE. 

Ehe Legislature of 1873, by joint resolution, authorized the 
ernor "to appoint an Agent or Agents to prosecute to a final 
decision before ( 'ongress or in the courts the â€¢ â€¢laim of this State for 
the live per OMt due from the United States upon the lands of 
this State disposed of by Indian Reservations, and by the location 
of military land warrants and laud Mfip issued tor military service 
in the wars of the United States and tor Agricultural College 
Ep and railroad lands." The compensation to be such as may be 
ed upon by the Governor and Agent or Agents so appointed, 
ible after the collection of said elajma in whole or in part. 
In pursuance of the authority so conferred. Uov. Furnas entered 
into a contract with Thomas P. Kennard, under which said 

Kennard agreed to prosecute said claims, and receive as coinpeu 
sation for his services fifty percent, of the amount collected. 

In the month of .January, 1882. I was notified by the Treasury 
Department at Washington that an account had been adjusted 
between the United States and the State of Nebraska for the five 
per cent upon net proceeds of the m\tm of lands embraced within 
Sie Pawnee Indian Reservation amounting to Â£6, 275. 89 I waa 
bo informed that the amount had been carried to the credit of 

t State on account of the direct tax provided by Sec. 8, Act of 
gust 5th, 1861, U. S. Statutes, 12. P. 292. I at once notified 
the Treasury Department that the amount found due belonged to 
the Permanent School fund of the State, and asked that it be </seg>

            <seg id="p027">

27 

remitted at once. Ln the month of September following, a draft 
was received by me and made payable to my order as Governor, 
covering the amount of the above mentioned claim. Mr. Kennard 
then filed a statement wherein he claimed that under the 

contract above specified, he was entitled to fifty per cent of the 
amount collected. A careful examination of the terms of the con- 

tract was made at my request by the Attorney General, and his 
conclusions sustained my own opinion, that it was my duty to 
pay the money into the State Treasury which til accordingly 
done. 

It is claimed by Mr. Kennanl that through the aid of an attorney 
at Washington, and by his own personal attendance 
there at considerable expense, a prompt adjustment of the claim 
was originally reached, and that the action of the Treasury Department, 
by which the amount was finally paid over to the 
State, was due to his efforts. 

With these explanations the subject is submitted for your consideration, 
in the belief that vou mil take such action thereon 

as the case demands. 

In the month of September. 1882, I received a United States 
Treasury draft for $4,193.78, covering the amount appropriated 
by Congress in the deficiency bill approved August 5th, 1882, to 
reimburse the State for expenses incurred in suppressing Indian 
hostilities. A claim for 25 per cent, of said amount, was presented 
by Patrick O. Ilawes as the sum due him for his agency 
in obtaining said appropriation, and it was claimed by him that 
he proceeded under a contract made in 1872 with Acting Governor 
W, H. James. I declined to pay him the per cent, demanded 
believing, as in the case above stated, that it was my duty to pay 
the whole amount into the State Treasury, which was done. </seg>

            <seg id="p028">
CAPITOL BUILDINO 

The west wing of the new eapitol building which was commenced 
in 1879 was completed and occupied by the close of 
1881. The contract for the construction of the cast wing was 
let in July, 1881 to W. H. 13. Stout, in accordance with plans 
and specifications prepared by W. II. "Wilcox, the architect of 
the west wing. The eastern extension was substantially completed 
by the 1st of November, 1882, and was formally accepted 
by the Board of Public Lands and Buildings on the first day of 
December 1882. The total cost of the two wings was a little less 
than $175,000, and when completed according to the original design, 
the capitol building, in its architectural features, commodious 
halls and superior office accommodations, will compare favorably 
with far more expensive structures. Â¦ 

HOME FOR THE FRIENDLESS. 

The Legislature of 1881 provided for the erection of a Home 
for the Friendless, and made an appropriation for that purpose, 
subject to the conditions .-pecified in the act, in compliance with 
which the institution has been located in Lincoln. The Board 
of Public Lands and Buildings purchased two and 83-100 acrea 
of land in the southern part of the city, as a location for tho 
Home, for the sum of $2,100. A contract, for the erection of 
the building was let on the 24th of August, 1882, for the sum of 
$3,599.77. The amount in excess of the appropriation, expended 
in purchasing the land and erecting' the building, baa 
been assumed by the Society of the Home for the Friendless, 
and the Institution has been formally turned over to that organization. 


IMMIGRATION. 

The State officers are continually receiving letters of inquiry 
from the Eastern States and from Europe, asKTTjg for information </seg>

            <seg id="p029">
governor's hessagb. 

in regard to the advantages and resources of Nebraska. Many of 
these letters are from representative men whose influence would 

direct large numbers of immigrant! to this State. Capitalist! 

are also making inquiries with a view to engaging in stock raiting 
or in some manufacturing industry. Large Dumber* desire cor- 

rect knowledge concerning the facilities afforded for obtaining 
home steads and cheap lands. It is impossible to answer these 
numerous letters fully and satisfactorily in detail, and I therefore 
recommend that a small appropriation be made lor the purpose of 
preparing add publishing immigration documents under the immediate 
supervision of the State officers, giving full and reliable 
information concerning our varied resources. A small outlay in 
this manner would, in my opinion, be a very profitable investment. 


INSURANCE. 

The sum of $8,000 was appropriated by the Legislature of 1881, 
for insurance of public buildings. A statement showing the 
manner in whieh the appropriation has been expended, excepting 
the small balance which remains in the treasury, is submitted 
in the appendix published herewith. The State has no insurance 
on the Capitol building. To cover the amount required 
for this purpose and for necessary additional insurance on other 
buildings, together with renewals, I recommend that an appropriation 
of Â§10,000 be made for the next two years. 

EWARD FOR MURDERER 

The terrible tragedy enacted at Minden in Kearney County on 
the 16th of last October, and the previous cold blooded murder of 
a prominent official in the city of Omaha, have forcibly impressed 
upon my mind the conviction that the Governor should be clothed 
with additional power for the purpose of securing the apprehen- </seg>

            <seg id="p030">
s'lon of desperate criminals. The present insignificant reward 
authorized by law, should be increased to a proper amount, ami 
the Governor should have discretionary power to offer an additional 
reward whenever, in his judgment, the ends of justice 
require him to do so. 

C0NTA&lt;;i0l"S DISEASES AMONG CATTLE. 

I have been formally requested by the State Board of Agriculture, 
to call your attention to the dangers that are to be 
apprehended from the spread of pleuro-pneumonia and other 
contagious diseases among cattle. The subject should be thoroughly 
investigated and proper regulations instituted to guard 
against the introduction of these diseases into Nebraska. 

MKTE0R0L0GICAL. 

My attention hae been officially directed by the U. S. Signal 
Service to the fact that our State had n&lt;?\ organized system of 

obtaining meteorological reports. Observations have been made 
and embodied in monthly reports Vjy Prof. Thompson of the 
State Cniv&lt;rsit\ . A very thorough system may be organized at 
a small expense, for the purpose of obtaining weather reports, 

and as these observations would be valuable to the people of our 

own Stat.. I trust that this subject will have your favorable consideration. 


It has also been suggested that arrangements should be made 
for obtaining reliable crop statistics at the proper seasons of the 
year. A plan could be easily devised for accomplishing both of 
these objects through a single organization, and I am informed 

that competent penoni are willing to make the necessary obser- 
vations aii'l "*;it!i''P st&amp;tisti' &amp; without exi Â¦ the State. </seg>
