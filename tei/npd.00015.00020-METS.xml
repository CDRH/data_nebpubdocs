            <seg id="p003">MACARONI WHEATS. BY T. L. LYON What part the so-called macaroni wheats are to take in the farm economy of this region is yet to be determined. It will depend largely upon their productiveness as compared with other crops, and upon their market or feeding val Judged by the first of these considerations, as exhibited in the experiments here recorded, macaroni wheat would seem to be entitled to a place among the crops of at least a por - tion of Nebraska. The rather extensive distribution of this wheat made by the Bureau of Plant Industry of the 1 Department of Agriculture through this Station in 1902 was planned by the writer to give information on the following points: (1) The productiveness of macaroni wheat as com - pared with other spring varieties or with winter wheat; (2) the portions of the state to which it is best adapted; (3) the varieties best suited to growth in this region. While it is not possible to draw final conclusions from a test during one season, it is considered that results of sufficient value have been obtained to warrant publication. Especially is this the case in view of the large number of inquiries from persons wishing to know whether it will be a profitable crop for them to raise, and who can best judge of this by knowing what success has already been attained by others in the same portions of the state. For this reason individual tests, ac - companied by the conditions under which they were made, are reported. While this bulletin is published for the purpose of making known the results of experiments carried on with macaroni wheats in this state, it will be of interest to persons who may be considering the advisability of undertaking their culture to include a short description of the wheats, and of </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 the industry to which they give rise, as well as some evi - dence looking towards the possible market for the crop. APPEARANCE AND HABITS OP GROWTH OF MACARONI WHEATS. The macaroni wheats are so called because they are largely used in the manufacture of macaroni and other edible pastes. These products are much used for food in Europe, and are constantly becoming more widely used in this country. The wheats belong to the group Triticum durum, while the com - mon wheats, from which bread is made, belong to Triticum vulgare. The macaroni wheats are tall, with broad, smooth leaves. The heads are heavily bearded, being much more so than any of the ordinary wheats, and the plant when headed has much the appearance of barley. The heads are large and vary in color from light yellow to almost black, depending upon the variety. The kernels are large, very hard, having less starch than common wheat. They vary from light yellow to reddish yellow in color. The habits of growth of durum wheats adapt them to regions of light rainfall. They have great ability to with - stand drouth and heat, but require a rich soil, although they are notably tolerant of alkali. In some mild climates durum wheats are sown in the fall, but generally they are grown as spring wheats, and they must occupy that place in Nebraska at present. The principal durum wheat growing countries are Russia, Turkestan, North Africa, the drier portions of Argentina, Chile, India, and Asia Minor, and to some extent Spain, Italy, Greece, Roumania, Mexico, and the Central American states. FOREIGN MARKET FOR MACARONI WHEAT. One of the most important considerations in the attempt to introduce durum wheat culture into this country is that of a market for the crop. What the foreign demand for edible pastes has become in the last few years may be appre - ciated by reading the following facts taken from a report by Mr. Robert P. Skinner, Consul General at Marseilles: 1 1 U 8. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Plant Industry, Bulletin No. 20 </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 "The European demand for macaroni wheat has increased with remarkable rapidity within recent years. The present consumption of macaroni wheat by the factories in Mar - seilles alone is 24,000 bushels daily. The output of macaroni and edible pastes in that city is limited only by the supply of wheat suitable for their manufacture. Throughout the entire Mediterranean country there has been a correspond - ing increase in the manufacture of these products. Semo - lina mills have been erected, or are in course of construction, in all the important wheat markets, and in the Levant, haps the largest semolina mill in the world is one recently built at Salonica, which has a daily capacity of over 7 bushels of wheat. "The supply of wheat for this large industry is not drawn from western or northern Europe, as the climate there is such that the proper quality of wheat can not be raised. Large quantities of durum wheats are now imported into France and Italy, from Russia and Algeria. These wheats make the best quality of macaroni, but owing to their scar - city they are frequently Mixed with the softer wheats from western Europe. Durum wheat from Russian seed is being grown in France in considerable quantity, but the product even from the first year's crop is not equal to the Russian - grown wheat. "There would seem to be no reason why there should not be a strong and increasing demand for American durum wheat to make good the deficiency in the European mark HOME MARKET FOR MACARONI WHEAT. Concerning the home market for durum wheats, Mr. M Carleton, Cerealist of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, writes as follows: 1 While the prospects are very good for a foreign market for these wheats sufficient to utilize probably all that we can produce for several years, an excellent market is also likely to be developed sooner or later in our own macaroni factories. At present all these factories, with rare exceptions, use the flour of common bread wheats in their operations. Of course this is chiefly due to the fact that heretofore it has been impos - sible to obtain true macaroni wheats in this country, and it is considered 'U. S. Dept. of Agr., Bureau of Plant Industry, Bull. No. 3. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 impracticable to Import them. Most of the factories realize the import - ance of using the semolina of such wheats as soon as they can obtain it In sufficient amount and of good quality. It will certainly be of the greatest advantage to the factories as well as to the growers to establish trade between them in the use of these wheats. The factories will thus be able to obtain either the wheats or semolina made from them at much less cost than the imported material, and the farmers will have the benefit of a quick home market Another strong advantage in using these wheats in our own factories, and which especially affects the consumer, lies in the fact that the homemade product, other conditions being equal, is always much better from the standpoint of simple freshness. We all know how much better fresh bread is than old, and what a nutty flavor newly-made flour gives to the bread. These facts apply with even greater force in macaroni making. All imported macaronis must of necessity have lost a large per cent of their flavor, and as the homemade product is made almost entirely from common wheats, it follows that the majority of American people really have never tasted the very best macaroni. More than all else the use of macaroni as a food is far from general in this country, and should become more popular. It is a comparatively rare food with us. A: already quoted in another place, in France alone the annual output of edible pastes is estimated at from 120,000,000 to 170,000,000 pounds. A considerable amount of this is of course exported, but there remains an enormous amount which is consumed In France. These pastes are among the most common and popular foods in that country. The same may be said of Italy. Let a sufficient amount of good wheat be grown and our factories begin producing from these wheats its best article possible, in a variety of forms, and there is no good reason apparent why such foods should not soon rank in popularity with our breakfast foods. HUNDRED AND ONE TESTS THROUGHOUT NEBRASKA. The durum wheats distributed in the spring of 1902 con - sisted of a number of varieties, most of which were imported directly from Algeria and the remainder from Russia, except a small amount grown in this country. It is perhaps un - fortunate that more of the seed was not of Russian origin, for the results indicate very plainly that it is more produc - tive than that from Algeria. Previous experience has also shown that seed grown at least one year in this region gives larger yields than imported seed. This, together with the fact that the season was not such as has been considered favorable for the growth of this crop, has made the test a severe one. Most of the experimenters received one bushel of seed which it was expected would be sown on one acre of land. No attempt was made to prescribe in what manner the land was to be prepared for the seed, or how the seed was to be </seg>
            <seg id="p007">7 sown. These and other unknown conditions that always enter into a test of this kind make it impossible to draw more than general conclusions, and make it desirable to report individual tests so far as space will permit. The following is the tabulated experience of each experimenter, omitting from necessity much interesting information that accompa- nied the report blanks from which this is compiled : ADAMS COUNTY Experimenter J.

The reports on the productiveness of durum wheats as compared with other spring and with winter varieties are quite conflicting. In order to afford a clearer basis for com- parison, they have been tabulated by counties as follows: As good as or better than spring wheat. As good as or better than winter wheat. Poorer than Poorer than spring wheat, winter wheat 1 1 Adams 1 Blaine 1 1 1 Box Butte Boyd Brown 1 Buffalo 1 ! Butler 2 1 Cherry Clay 1 1 1 1 1 Custer 4 Dawes 1 Franklin Furnaa 3 1 </seg>

The average yield for all durum wheats tested in 1902 was 18.3 bushels per acre. The durum wheats were grown principally in western counties, while the others were distributed over the state. From the data at hand it is safe to say that durum wheats yield better than other spring varieties, but how they com - pare in this respect with winter wheat in western Nebraska can not be definitely stated at this time. There were a number of reports of the durum wheats hay - ing rusted and lodged. Those raised at the Station were very badly rusted, and also lodged in places. They appeared to be fully as susceptible to rust as other varieties of spring wheats i Gage.. Gosper . .

            <seg id="p023">23 The average time of ripening was July 16, both for the tests made throughout the state, and for those made at the Station. The average time of ripening for sowings made before April 1 was the same as for those made after April 1. E'he average yield of all sowings made before April 1 was &gt; bushels per acre; of all sowings made after April 1, 17..") hels per acre. This indicates that, for at least the year orted, early planting was desirable. As macaroni wheats not easily injured by frost, this rule will doubtless hold a* for all ordinary years. The average yield per acre and number of tests of each variety were as follows : Oriein Yield P" r Number Â°f 6 " acre. trials. Variety. Emitting varieties of which there were less than five tests, average yield per acre for the Russian varieties was 21.2 lels, and for the Algerian varieties 17.6 bushels. Ii test of a number of varieties of durum wheats was made the Experiment Station. The unusually wet weather and rd windstorms interfered much with the growth of the eats, and doubtless decreased the yields. The test is there - e of less value than it would have been in a normal season. : varieties were planted March 20 to 27 and were put in ;h a press drill.
