TO CANDIDATES F«&gt;K EXAMINATION Recent legislation has made a Nebraska State Certificate more desirable than ever before and for this reason the number of appli - cants for the honor is constantly increasing. At a recent meeting, the members of the Examining Committee discussed the reading and grading of papers and agreed that a few suggestions to candidates might be helpful in preparing for examina- •The county superintendent may, at his discretion, grant a first grade certificate, without examination, to a graduate of a college, university, or state normal school, subject to such rules and regula - tions as may be prescribed by the state superintendent of public in - struction. — Sec. 11, Subd.

Sometimes poor spelling, a disregard for all rules of nctuation, capitalization, paragraphing, or grammar, indicates a knowledge of English inadequate enough to bar the candidate from the ranks of professional teachers. Once in a while a single statement t stifles the rejection of the entire paper. For example, not long ago . applicant dwelt at length upon the "cocoon state" of the frog, and referred to plants as the "lower forms of animal life." Another said, "Transcendentalists are those who when they die pass into the souls of other lower animals." Quite often, when asked for some recognized authority on a subject, an applicant will name his last teacher in Normal School, Junior Normal, or College. Such mistakes are not accidental nor are they the result of ner - vousness; they are direct proof of narrow, superficial preparation. On the other hand, many papers are the best kind of recommenda - tion for the writer's scholarship and grasp of the subject. It may be of advantage to know that, — Bl ) The questions will be general in nature, but searching lorough. (2) The aim is to test the applicant's power and his general knowledge of the subject. Therefore, it is a mistake to "cram" for the examination. (3) The tone of the whole paper will be considered as well as the separate parts of it. ■4) Laboratory work in chemistry and zoology is an es - ation for examination in those subj. munition is intended to test the candidate's ability to choose and present clearly and concisely the principal points of the topic or discussion assigned. Therefore, a liberal discount will be made for padded paragraphs. The neatness of the manuscript and knowledge of English shown by papers in all subjects will be considered in grading papers. The best teachers of the state will not be satisfied with examina - tions requiring only superficial preparation. The Professional State Certificate should be conclusive evidence of broad scholarship and suc - cessful experience in teaching. RHETORIC Sentence structure, punctuation, paragraphing, figures of speech, scansion, etc., will constitute the basis of the examination. Ba foundation the student should have a thorough knowledge elements of English grammar. Next, he should familiarize with the principles and rules of rhetoric as laid down in 3d text. The ability to apply these rules Is of the utmost im - e. All manuscripts handed in by the candidate will be consider - naking up the credits on this subject. </seg>

PSYCHOLOGY The work in this subject will be based principally on the Reading ok of tl, tor 1906-1907 Putnam's Text-book of chology.
