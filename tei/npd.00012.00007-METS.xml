REPORT. 

Bon. John H. Mickey, Governor: 

Sir â€” The seventeenth biennial report of the Nebraska Hospital 
for the Insane, at Lincoln, for the period beginning December 
1, 1902, and ending November 30, 1904, as provided 
for by law, is herein submitted. 

MANAGEMENT. 

The official staff has continued in service since the last report, 
without change. 

NUMBER OF PATIENTS TREATED. 

At the beginning of the biennial period there were present 
516 patients (194 males and 322 females). There have been 
admitted and returned from parole during the period 1,087 
patients (649 males and 438 females), making a total of 1,603 
patients under treatment for the two years. At the close of 
business, November 30, 1904, there were present 588 (214 
males and 374 females). The greatest number present on 
any particular day was 629, on June 17, 1903. 

During the entire biennial period just closed this hospital 
has received and cared for all patients offered from the entire 
state, and there has not been delay in a single case when the 
law has been complied with. This course of procedure has 
crowded the house far beyond its capacity, and rendered the 
burden of all concerned much greater than it would have been 
had a normal number been under treatment. This crowded 
condition was directly responsible for an accident, in which 
one patient, a male, lost his life. 

GENERAL HEALTH. 

There has been no epidemic disease present here during the 
past two years. An occasional case of erysipelas has oc- </seg>

curred, generally during the winter months. There were 
seven cases of enteric fever this fall, all of them occurring in 
patients who had more or less freedom of the grounds, and, 
consequently, opportunity to partake of food and drink without 
suitable observation and supervision. In the main the 
ailment was mild, and all save one patient recovered. One 
of the oldest employees in point of time of service became infected 
and lost his life, after an illness of three weeks. 

With the foregoing exceptions, the health of all detained 
here has been better than could reasonably have been expected, 
considering the crowded condition. 

REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS. 

The plan formulated at the beginning of the previous biennium, 
when the present management took charge here, viz., 
to put the entire plant in first-class order, has been followed 
most assiduously, and results are now apparent. 

The surgical operating room mentioned in the last report 
as being under way has been finished, furnished and equipped 
with every material thing required for modern surgery in all 
its branches. Visiting physicians and surgeons have commended 
and pronounced it the best in the state. Operations 
of all grades of importance have been performed, some of 
tkem to relieve conditions of pain and suffering that had existed 
for years. 

The pathologic laboratory has been furnished and equipped 
with all of the instruments of precision needed in modern 
medicine. This addition to the hospital's armamentarium 
does more than all else toward modernizing its methods. 

E? last legislature increased the appropriation for wages, 
the distinct understanding that night nurses would be 
ded in all departments of the hospital. This has been 
done, and has contributed more than all else to the comfort 
of the patients. It enables us to care for them in unlocked 
rooms, and is another advancement in modern care of the </seg>

lature for new plumbing. The amount has been expei 
under the direction of the Board of Public Lands and Build 
ings, and the entire hospital plant now has new plumbing of 
a modern type. 

Two vertical water tube boilers, of 100 horse-power capacity 
each, have been purchased and installed. All the work 
of removing the old boilers and erecting the new ones was 
performed by the hospital's regularly employed force, under 
the direction of the chief engineer, Mr. George Blakely. 

The funds for rebuilding the barn, which was destroyed by 
fire more than two years ago, have been expended, and the 
barn has just been finished. It is a very satisfactory structure 
and will meet the requirements for many years. 

The greenhouse has been repaired and enlarged in such a 
way as to render it better suited to the needs of the institu- 

tion. 

The work of general repairs has been carried on constantly. 
A painter, with two or three patients, has worked constantly 
for two years. The institution's carpenter, with patients for 
helpers, has been steadily employed. An item of repair that 
deserves special mention is steel ceiling. These have been 
placed in all the bathrooms of the main building and upon 
two of the wards. They are both ornamental and durable, 
and will stop a constant expense of repairing plaster. 

The grounds about the hospital, in both front and rear, 
have had constant attention. New curbing along drives has 
been provided in many places, making an ornamental and 
permanent improvement. 

Several hundred fruit and shade trees have been planted, 
given good care, and are doing well. 

THE FABM, GARDEN AND STOCK. 

The yield from the farm and garden has been quite satisfactory 
for both years covered by this report, and has contributed 
more than at any like period in the past toward the 
maintaining of the patients. The policy of keeping all of the </seg>

place. This year the farm has furnished beef for the entire 
institution for about thirty weeks, and we have left 242 cattle 
of all ages on the place, with an abundant supply of feed to 
carry them through the winter. 

The hogs have been carefully managed, and the breeding 
brought to a higher standard. The farm now produces both 
Poland China and large English Berkshires of pure blood, 
and these herds are drawn upon by many farmers in this and 
adjoining counties for the purpose of improving their herds. 
There has been no sickness among our swine during the past 
two years. It is thought that this result has been obtained 
by careful sanitation. There is now being slaughtered from 
day to day hogs eleven months old, weighing 320 pounds each. 
This meat will be cured upon the place and will aid materially 
in reducing the expense during the coming year. 

FINANCIAL STATEMENT. 

The legislature of 1903 appropriated |172,600 to pay salaries 
and maintain and improve this hospital for the period 
beginning April 1, 1903, and ending March 31, 1905. The 
amounts thus appropriated for this period were estimated 
upon the number of patients likely to be present. At the time 
the matter had final consideration it was thought by the committees 
in charge of the appropriations that the Norfolk Hospital 
would be open and care for patients from that district 
for at least ten months of the period. As it has terminated, 
that institution will not be occupied before May 1, 1905. This 
hospital has continued to receive all of the patients offered 
from the entire state, with the result that expenditures from 
several of our funds, that depend entirely upon the number 
of patients present, have been unusually large, and deficiencies 
in board and clothing, drugs and postage have occurred. 

The following table shows the condition of the various 
funds at the close of business, November 30, 1904. The balance 
in these funds is supposed to pay expenses to April 1, 
1905. That it is inadequate is obvious. I suggest that you </seg>

request that they do as they did two years ago, viz., by special 

act, passed early in the session, transfer from the funds ap- 

propriated for Norfolk two years ago, or appropriate outright 

by special act at least $18,000 for a general deficiency fund, 

to carry these current expenses to April 1, 1905.

PEB CAPITA COST. 

The per capita cost of this biennial period has been as fol- 

lows: 

First semi-annual period, December 1, 1902, to May 
31, 1903 $ 76 76 

Second semi-annual period, June 1, 1903, to November 
30, 1903 90 06 

Third semi annual period, December 1, 1903, to May </seg>

            <seg id="p008">

The above statement represents the cost from funds appro- 

priated by the legislature, and does not include the value of 
farm products consumed or expenditures from our cash fund, 
which fund comes largely from the sale of the products of the 
farm. It does, however, include the expenditure of $17,000 
for permanent improvements, such as barn, boilers and en- 

gine, greenhouse, etc. 

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED. 

Fire Protection. 

The reservoir, on top of the hill south of the hospital, is of 

Ky solid masonry, but inadequate in capacity. It can have 
addition of eight feet built on its present wall with safety, 
1 thus increase not only its capacity, but the pressure in 

the mains. 

Neic Boiler 8 and Dynamos. 

Two additional boilers will be required. When these are 

installed, in addition to the two provided for by the last legislature, 
this item of repairs will be finished, and nothing in 

the same line will be required for at least fifteen years. 
The dynamos having been in use for sixteen years, the 

greater part of which time they have carried an overload beyond 
their rated capacity, as a consequence are worn out and 

must be replaced. 

Neic Building. 

Your attention is called to the fact that the arrangement 

of this hospital provides for more women than men. There 
are present to-day 374 women and 214 men. This hospital 
owns the largest and best tract of farm land belonging to any 
state institution ; yet, owing to the small number of male patients 
kept here, it is always difficult to find enough help to 
carry on the work of the farm. An appropriation of f 50,000 
would provide room for 175 more male patients, and provid-

ing for that number here, would lessen the annual per capita 
tost of maintenance at the hospital, besides, before this building 
could possibly be erected, there will be a pressing need 
for room. 

Conclusion. 

A report from the pathologist and a series of tables of interest 
to those who wish to compare this with former periods 
follows. The steward's report contains a statement in detail 
of all the funds received and expended during the period covered 
by this report. Vouchers, properly executed and approved, 
for each item of expenditure, are on file at the hospital. 


The lasting gratitude of all the officers of this hospital is 
due your Excellency and the Board of Public Lands and 
Buildings for valuable advice and aid at all times, and for 
the constant evidence of confidence yon have shown the management 
; also for the privilege of having administered its affairs 
untrammeled by the spoils system of politics.

REPORT OF PATHOLOGIST. 

To the Superintendent : 

The laboratory, as at present equipped, has been in existence 
since November, 1903, and has proved its purpose of 
practical utility. While there are yet improvements to be 
made, and while the work is still rather unsystematic, it 
is to be hoped that, with the coming biennium, the pathological 
department will be fully organized and its work will be 
carried on in close co-operation with that of the clinical side 
of the hospital. 

At the disposal of the worker here can be found the necea- </seg>

urine, and gastric analysis, bacteriology, and for the demonstration 
of pathological anatomy and histology. 

This apparatus has been constantly employed by the pathologist, 
blood examinations and gastric analyses being made 
when called for; urinalysis, as a routine measure with every 
patient admitted; bacteriological examinations of the blood, 
urine, and feces in cases of typhoid fever, acute delirium, and 
such other cases as present the clinical picture of an acute 
infection; microscopical examination of the sputum when 
pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected, and of the membrane 
in cases of suspected diphtheretic sore throat Airtight, 
sealed tubes of the different culture media are kept on hand 
to be used for emergencies. Whenever autopsies have been 
allowed, the same have been performed by the pathologist, 
and the findings recorded. The different viscera and cranial 
contents, when affording specimens of interest, have been preserved 
to form the nucleus of a hospital museum. In every 
autopsy sections of the central nervous system have been 
made for microscopical examination, and further examinations 
have been made more or less exhaustively, according to 
the findings as shown by the result of the routine procedure. 

A useful measure of importance in a hospital for the insane 
is lumbar puncture and a careful examination of the cerebrospinal 
fluid, according to a prescribed technic. It affords a 
means of differential diagnosis between functional and organic 
nervous disease, and at times is of a distinct therapeutic 
efficiency. It is of especial utility in distinguishing between 
the early stages of paresis and the acute so-called functional 
psychoses. Lumbar puncture has been introduced here with 
satisfactory results, and will doubtless remain as a recognized 
aid in the hospital work. There have come to autopsy during 
the past eighteen months ten cases, of which two were 
complete, including the thoracic and abdominal viscera, as 
well as the central nervous system. The rest were partial, 
the cranial contents only being examined. When possible, 
it is to be desired that the autopsies be complete, more comprehensive 
and reliable statistics thereby being obtained. </seg>

STATE HOSPITAL FOR INSANE. 

77 

In this series there were several instructive cases, one of 
which deserves mention. The patient was a man of 68, a case 
of mild alcoholic delirium, who rapidly became convalescent 
and, to all appearances, healthy. A month after his admission 
he developed stupor and a left hemiplegia, and, passing 
into, coma, died, seven days after failure in health was first 
noted. The clinical diagnosis was cerebral thrombosis. The 
anatomical and microscopical diagnosis was a gelatinoform, 
small-celled sarcoma, infiltrating in character, involving the 
right frontal lobe, and extending from the pre-frontal pole to 
the anterior extremity of the central ganglia, and laterally 
to the cortex of the Rolandic area. The absence of clinical 
symptoms, indicating destruction of brain tissue, in the presence 
of so large a growth, is certainly indicative of the latent 
character of the frontal lobe. 

Needed improvements in the pathological department include 
a special record book for inscribing the results of all 
examinations and analyses made in the laboratory, together 
with the name and case number of the patient examined. 
This will provide data for future statistics, and a means of 
comparison with clinical records of the physicians' office. 

A new morgue is urgently needed along with the necessary 
post-mortem table and other facilities appertaining thereto. 
An ice cabinet, for preserving the cadaver, is of the utmost 
importance to preserve the integrity of the finer structures 
of the nerve cells from post-mortem change. The importance 
of an active co-operation between the clinical and laboratory 
departments of the hospital can not be too strongly emphasized. 


The pathologist wishes to express his sincere thanks to the 
superintendent for the encouragement he has given the work 
in this department, and for the material way in which he has 
added to the equipment of the laboratory. 

Respectfully submitted, 

G. A. Young, </seg>
