            <seg id="p002">Honorable Chester H. Aldrich, Governor, and the Board of Public Lands and Buildings: ■ Gentlemen: I herein submit my report as Commandant the Home for the biennium ending November 30, 1912. I also enclose an estimate for the needs of the home for the next biennium. I have asked for an appropriation of $10,000 for a new laundry. This improvement is needed very badly as our laundry work is more now than ever before and we are now so crowded that it is absolutely dangerous to life and limb to do the work that is being done. My estimate for general repairs is based on what I consider necessary to keep the present buildings and improvements in as good condition as possible. My judgment is that a competent architect or builder should make a thorough and complete exami - nation of the condition of the east part of the main building before expending much money in repairing same. We need an elevator and must have it soon or abandon the use of the rooms on the upper floors. The home has increased in membership nearly 100 in the last two years. We now admit many more women than men for the reason that women are admitted at fifty years of E, if otherwise eligible, and the probability is that the home be needed for twenty-five to thirty years or more. We now e more members than at any time in the previous history of the home and about twenty applicants are waiting to be ad - mitted. I At the present time we have room for about twenty more the upper floors but all of the other room is in use. I leave the problem of furnishing more room for the home to the Board and Legislature, with this, as my opinion, that we will need during the present biennium another one story brick build - ing large enough to accommodate seventy-five to 100 people. I appreciate very much.the lively interest you and the Board of Public Lands and Buildings have taken in the welfare of the home and the assistance given me in the management of the same. Respectfully, D. W. Hoyt, Commander. </seg>

            <seg id="p053">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT Col. D. W. Hoyt, Commandant of the Soldiers and Sailors Home: Dear Sir: During the last biennium there have been eighty deaths, five less than in the preceding one, fifty-three men and twenty-seven women. Of this number, ten men and five women died while on furlough. This is a decrease of nine deaths of men and an increase of four deaths of women. The increase in the number of deaths of women is due to the fact that there are fifty percent more women in the home now than there were two years ago, while the number of men has increased by eleven During the first half of this biennium there were forty-one deaths, twenty-six men and fifteen women. During the last half there were thirty-nine deaths, twenty-seven men and twelve women, of whom five men and three women died while out on furlough. There were then sixty-five deaths in the home during this biennium, thirty-four the first year, and thirty-one the second In the first half of this biennium there were sixty-nine ad - mitted to the hospital, in the last twelve months, fifty-two men and thirty-three women have been admitted to the hospital, a few of them new members, but most of them brought from the other buildings. Forty-two have been discharged from the hospital and returned to the convalescant hospitals, or the main building the last year. There are now thirty-six men and forty - six women in the main hospital, and seventy-one men and sixty - two women in the three convalescent hospitals. During the twelve months ending December 1, 1912 I have attended to ten thousand nine hundred fifty office calls at the Dispensary, have dispensed $1,500.00 worth of medicine; and have made three thousand seven hundred fifty visits to patients outside the main Every bed in the hospital is occupied, and there are a few men in the other buildings who will be taken to the hospitals and placed under the care of nurses as soon as there is room for them. Respectfully, 0. S. Townsend, Surgeon. </seg>
