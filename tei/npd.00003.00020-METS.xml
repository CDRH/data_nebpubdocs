REPORT OF THE ADVISORY BOARD. 

His Excellency, Governor W. A. Poynter. and to the Honora- 

ble Board of Public Lands and Building 

The advisory board beg to submit the following 

Meetings have been held as the statutes of Nebraska direct, 
irmony has prevailed at all times, and we unanimously com•nd 
the wise and helpful management of the Superintendent, 

Edwards. We have found her at all times seeking to up- 

r those placed in her charge. She has been kind and sym 
thetic. without being lax in discipline. 

The industrial features have been peculiarly gratifying. The 
aining received here has turned many a young woman into 

;eful path 

We especially commend the judicious use of the small amount 
funds placed at Mrs. Edwards" disposal. The land has been 
ltivated aud been made to yield bountifully. The table has 

n uniformlv good, and much has been supplied from thf 

irdei 

\ competent corps of officers and employees have helped to 

indard of the Home. 

untain 

As a board, we unanimously recommend the appropriation of 
inds sufficient to make much needed repairs. The buildings 

isr rapidly deteoriate unless Such funds are forthcoming. 
We beg to call your attention to the fact that no deficiency 

as been brought under the present management

GENERAL INFORMATION. 

The magnitude of the work of this institution is not generally 
understood. Penitent dependent girls, from any part of the 
gtate, who have no one to care for them, are brought under 
home influences and home training. The educational advantages 
and practical instruction render it possible for all who will 
to fit themselves for positions of self-support, and usefulness. 
Most of them prove their gratitude for the mental, moral, and 
physical training they have received, by going out into good 
homes as faithful, respected helpers. By placing the babes in 
good homes useful citizens are produced. Could a grander work 
be done than to help those .who have no one to care for them, 
to arouse them to their best efforts, and to save the innocent 
ones from the dangers of pauperism and crime? 

DISCIPLINE 

As loyal obedience is always based upon self-respect, the kind, 
loving, strict discipline of the Home must call for that obedience 
which engenders self-respect, and causes each one to guard well 
their thoughts and acts. 

A very wayward inmate remarked thai she did not realize 
how bad she was until she came into the Home atmosphere and 
saw her life in the light of truth. We demerit all contention, 
gossip, slang, and everything that would mar the happiness of 
the Home. Each inmate is made to feel that she is a part of 

the Home, and that as the happiness of a household may be 
marred by one disobedient member, so our home may suffer 
from any careless, selfish act on her part. The thoughtful 
loving obedience manifested is wonderful when we remember 
that many of our grls have never known discipline until they 
came here. 

INnVBTRIAL DEPAKTMEN 

Domestic. 

Household economics are practically and systematically 
taught every day. There is a great demand for good, welltrained 
domestics. Every inmate is required to take six weeks </seg>

'raining in each of the following departments: Laundry, wash»g 
and ironing; cooking, plain, cooking pastry; dining-room; 
lormitory and general management. Each one taking full 

charge as head girl for one week in the various departments, 
passing from one department to another as in school work. 
Many of our girls are getting extra wages on account of their 

iency as housekeepers. 

&lt; hir home should be placed among the educational institutions 

if the slate. We emphasize the value of practical education, 
•oinbined with Christian principles. All who are able are ex&gt;ected 
to attend school in the afternoon of every week day. and 

ndav school on the Sabbath. We have had some inmates who 

onld neither read nor write in English, some who have finished 
lie eighth grade, and a few graduates of high schools, proving 
hat where the intellect had been cultivated by our free school 
ysfeni. the everyday moral discipline had been lacking. Our 
¦very evening chapel exercises of prayer and song and Bible 

study ait- enjoyed by all. and seem conducive of much good. 
Much valuable information is obtained during the year by read- 

ng aloud to the inmates at each meal time, one of the officers or 
inployees conducting the reading. 

Keiring and Dresxinahiny. 

lie aim in this very important department is not only to teach 
n sewing, making over, mending and the care of their cloth- 

ing, but also to cut and make their own dresses. Some have 
learned to cut by chart expecting to make a livelihood by sew-

REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS. 

In order to keep up the repairs of our large buildings and 
many outbuildings it is necessary to drive a nail here and drive 
a nail there almost daily. We have expended the money given 
us where most needed. We have moved the partitions in the 
barn, with no expense, except material for brace, and now have

We greatly appreciate the interest the Governor lias ta 
in the welfare of this institution: the watchful care of accoti 
taken by the Board of Public Lands and Buildings: the ki 
helpful spirit of the advisory board, and the kindness of 
who have sought to be kind. Letters of cheer, and visits fi 
kind friends, who are interested in the work of the Home, h 
been the cause of much gratitude. We are grateful to the |
