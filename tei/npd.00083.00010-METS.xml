            <seg id="p007">3 Honorable R. L. Cochran, Governor of Nebraska. .- ■ . ■ Dear Governor Cochran : In submitting herewith the biennial report of the Board of Con - trol of Nebraska for the period ending June 30, 1937, we have a cer - tain degree of satisfaction in the manner in which each institution has been conducted, and call to your attention the fact that the fol - lowing pages would indicate advancement in the manner of caring for various patients, inmates, members, and students in the institu - tions. We direct special attention to the fact that modern methods have been adopted in the care and treatment of mental patients. The prison industries have provided additional work for many of the in - mates of the penal institutions. Special advancement has been made in the method of insti - uction both the Schools for the Deaf and the School for the Blind, as well as other institutions where school work is carried on. We are pleased to report to Your Excellency that the biennium has been completed without a deficit in any department or fund. During the last six weeks of this biennium the Assistance De - partment, consisting of the Child Welfare Bureau, the Old Age and Blind Assistance Division, the Statistical Division and Commodity Distribution Division, has been placed under the direction of the Board of Control with Neil C. Vandemoer, director of Assistance and Child Welfare, and Harry Becker as the head of the Child Wel - fare Division. The Board of Control has given of its time and efforts in as - suming the new duties in connection with the administration of the affairs of the different penal and charitable institutions, and trust that the subsequent pages will prove interesting and satisfactory. Very truly yours, BOARD OF CONTROL By WALTER E. HAGER Chairman. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">4 REPORT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE BOARD OF CON - TROL FOR THE PERIOD BEGINNING JULY 1, 1935 AND ENDING JUNE 30, 1937 The Nebraska State Board of Control is the second largest spending agency in Nebraska — it being surpassed only by the State Highway Department. Under |the Board of Control all of the 18 state institutions in Nebraska are administered. The Board is composed of' three members; one member is ap - pointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Legislature each two years. The law requires that no two members may be appointed from the same congressional district and that no more than two members can be appointed from one major political party. The Board appoints the superintendent and certain officers pre - scribed by statute in each of the institutions and the law requires that the superintendents name the other employees in the institutions. The schedule of salaries is made up by the Board and all expendi - tures, including salaries, are approved by the Board of Control. During this biennium, the Board handled a number of activities which were either new or had just been instigated prior to the present biennium. Following is a list and explanation of such ac - tivities. Prison Industries. Prior to the passage of the Hawes-Cooper Bill by the United States Congress, private companies maintained factories in the Penitentiary and the Reformatory for Men. They paid the prisons a certain amount for this labor and reaped a profit at the expense of free labor. The above named federal statute pro - hibited this practice and left Nebraska without a means of employing prisoners other than in the operation of the institutions. The prev - ious board submitted a recommendation to the legislature and was able to secure the passage of a state Prison Industry law which en - abled the Board of Control to establish industries in the penal in - stitutions. This law prohibits the sale of any of the products from </seg>

By this method we have a minimum amount of competition with free labor. In August 1935 the first industry, the garment factory, was established.

These figures are based upon total cost, exclusive of the added cost in the Board's office, under whose supervision all materials and sup - plies were purchased. It has been the policy of the Board during the last biennium to use inmates who can be trusted from the Penitentiary and Reforma - tory to work in other state institutions. This materially decreases the cost in other institutions and helps to solve the problem of work - ing prisoners. At the present time we have approximately 25 trusties Working in other institutions exclusive of the 25 men who are working at the Genoa State Farm. This number varies with the amount of work to be done and the season. During the harvest season the number is somewhat more than that stated above. Just after the beginning of the 1935-1937 biennium the Board started taking an equipment inventory of all equipment in the insti - tutions. A complete perpetual inventory was set up and is now in operation. A card index was made of all the larger equipment and each piece was marked with a code number. A list of extra equip - ment not in use was prepared and a considerable savings was effected by the transfer of equipment not needed in one institution to places where it was required. Some of the clerical work required in pre - paring this inventory was done by WPA help. </seg>

            <seg id="p012">8 The previous Board had employed an engineer and his helpers on a salary basis to handle the engineering on a water works system for the Lincoln State Hospital. With this as a nucleus the Board during the 1935-1937 biennium organized a small engineering depart - ment which has charge of all major repairs and new construction in the institutions. During the biennium the total cost of the construc - tion handled by this department was $265,488.36. Had this been handled by private engineers, a conservative estimate of the cost would be 5% which amounts to $13,274.42. In addition to the con - struction the engineering department handled the writing of all speci - fications and the purchasing of many commodities such as, coal, light bulbs, furniture, steel for license plates and highway signs, leather, fly spray, and many other commodities. These commodities are handled on scientific basis with tests being made by the state testing laboratory at the University. During this biennium the Board started making development of future plans for the state institutions. The WPA furnished some of the help to make the preliminary surveys and to prepare sketches of the present grounds and buildings. A landscape architect was employed for about 6 months. After studying the conditions with the engineering department and the superintendents of the institu - tions, he prepared plans for a proposed 25 year building program. On these plans are located all the present buildings which are suitable for use during, the next 25 years. New buildinqs are also shown, together with new driveways, walks, and suggested plantings. The state also started a small nursery in the spring of 1937 and under the supervision of the landscape architect the seedling trees were selected which will be for the future planting at the institutions. Approxi - mately 60,000 seedlings were put out at a very small cost. These trees are being cared for by the inmates of the State Reformatory for Men. This furnishes additional labor for the inmates of our prison. The only building construction during this biennium was at Hastings. The Board instigated the policy of having their own in - spector in charge of the construction of buildings in accordance with the provisions of the statutes. A graduate engineer who has had 5 years experience on building construction was employed to super - vise the two new buildings at Hastings in addition to the field work - in construction of a sewage system, sewage disposal plant, and fire </seg>
            <seg id="p013">9 protection system at this institution. We believe by this method the standards of the building construction will be very greatly improved, and that the buildings will last considerably longer when construc - tion is under this rigid supervision. In April 1936 the Board of Control hired a director of education to coordinate the educational program in the institutions having schools. It w ; as felt this was necessary in order that the educational standards of the institutional schools and the qualifications of the teachers employed be brought up to the standards of the Nebraska Public School system. The first months of the educational direct - or's time were devoted to a survey of the educational program in all the institutions, including occupational thereapy, recreation, and li - brary facilities. It was necessary to make this survey in order to evaluate the type of activity that was being carried on and what steps were necessary to improve the program. Part of this evaluation ac - tivity consisted in giving the intelligence tests, achievement tests, ap - titude tests, and making subjective observations of methods and physical plants. Once this was accomplished the ground work was laid for the next school term beginning in September of the next biennium. This consisted in making budgets, drawing up plans for school room changes, looking for new personnel, making contacts with the educational departments of the State University and State Department of Education, selecting text books and references, inter - viewing possible teachers, purchasing school supplies, and arranging with the superintendents of the institutions for the new program. Since the employment of the director all teachers previously em - ployed have been asked to obtain Nebraska State Teachers Certi - ficates and all new teachers employed have been required to have them. Teachers have been asked to participate in the Nebraska State Teachers Association meetings and keep themselves profes - sionally qualified. The School for the Deaf in Omaha has, since the new director was emplo) r ed, purchased an audiometer and an audi - phone. In 1934 a previous Board employed a dietitian at one of the in - sane hospitals. This was the beginning of a dietetic staff which will consist of the one supervising dietitian who works out of the Board's office and 4 dietitians in the 4 major institutions. The first step in developing this staff was in using the one dietitian in the Board's office to advise with the present staff of cooks and matrons. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">10 By this method we are convinced the dietitians will be able to not only raise the standards of the meals for the inmates and employees but also provide balanced diets and effect a saving by suggesting substitutions where certain foods are high in cost. The records in - dicate that a substantial saving was effected in the 6 months that this plan has been in effect. The laundries in the state institutions have a very important place in the operation of the set-up. In July 1936 a laundry super - visor was employed, and a very great improvement in the laundry equipment has Deen accomplished. The records show that in the one year the costs for materials and supplies were materially de - creased. In a number of the state institutions medical care is a major portion of the cost. Likewise, the cost of drugs is a big item and in June of this year the Board employed a pharmacist to supervise the purchase of the drugs for the various hospitals and institutions. Practically all the drugs are purchased on competitive bids and the records show a very material savings over the plan previously used. Perpetual inventories of the drug supplies in each institution have been set up by the pharmacist and this is checked each month when orders come in for drugs. The Board supervises the thirteen dairies that are operating at as many hospitals and institutions, through a state dairyman who works oat of the Board's office. Through this supervision the herds have been materially improved and the cost of operating reduced through the planning of substitute feeds and the keeping of accurate records, so that cows that do not produce enough to pay can be eli - minated. During the past biennium the thirteen dairy herds at the State Institutions produced 9,455,312 pounds of milk valued at $179,621.72. This furnished all the milk for 8,000 of the approxi - mately 8,900 people at the state institutions. The main costs of pro - ducing this milk were the $90,381.00 worth of feed and $25,546.54 dairymen's salaries The deterioration of pastures due to the drouth, the shortage of feed and the subsequent high prices made the feed conditions dur - ing the past two years the worst we have ever encountered. We met this situation by substituting cheaper feeds and more careful management. We also butchered 993 of our most undesirable cows, </seg>
            <seg id="p015">11 heifers, and male calves, which not only saved buying so much feed, but also saved buying as much fresh beef, which had also raised in price. In the operation of the state institutions, it is impossible to show profits since the care of patients and inmates will always be an expense to the tax-paying public. The Board feels that in es - tablishing the state institutions the public expected certain definite results, and if these results are not obtained, the institutions are fal - ling below the purpose for which they are operated. The Board of Control has seriously accepted the responsibility for economical and efficient operation of the State Institutions, and felt that closer coordination of many activities would go far toward producing the results desired by the tax-payers. For example, by es - tablishing a dietetic staff the patients and inmates will be fed more scientifically at a lower cost, and by maintaining a small engineering staff, the construction work necessary to properly build and main - tain the institutions, will be of higher standards and at the same time will be done more economically. The same is true of the other various activities which are mentioned in the foregoing report. Respectfully submitted, WALTER E. HAGER, Chairman HENRY KEHRENS C. W. EUBANK </seg>

The following table will be found of interest as showing the population of the different institutions during the past two bienna : i A sssssvssr -msay June 30, June 30, * im e in past 1935 1937 biennium institution for Feeble-Minded 1,196 1,272 1 341 Girls' Training School 185 185 194 Soldiers' Home, Grand Island 229 206 238 Hastings State Hospital 1,511 1,514 1,529 State Industrial School 198 198 221 Hospital for Tuberculous 155 153 160 Lincoln State Hospital 1,225 1,227 1,247 Orthopedic Hospital 95 93 109 State Penitentiary 896 933 978 Nebraska Industrial Home 67 62 75 Soldiers' Home, Milford. 108 94 i 119 Nebraska School for the Blind™. 54* 58 65 Norfolk State Hospital 1,032 1,055 1,060 Nebraska School for the Deaf 199* 199 . 206 State Reformatory for Women 46 56 66 Home for Dependent Children.™ 116 112 126 State Reformatory for Men 335 317 i37 Total 7,647 7734 i ♦Average during school terms.

The Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded was opened and received its first patients on May 25, 1887, and during this period of fifty years there have been received at this date three thousand, five hundred and ninety-six inmates. Of the number received during the first year there still remain three. Many of our inmates have been here ten, twenty or thirty years, so it will be seen that this is a home as well as a school. They range in age from four years to seventy. The older ones of course have been here for many years. There is no age limit for admission, but we insist that applicants be feeble-minded in the true meaning of the term, this of course would exclude those whose minds have failed because of old age. Commitments are made upon application of some interested person, usually the parent or guardian. A decree is issued by the County or District Court. The court costs, the expenses of trans - portation to the Institution as well as the furnishing of proper cloth - ing are required of the relative if able to pay, and if so a bond in the amount of $100.00 is required guaranteeing the payment of $40.00 per year, or as much thereof as may be necessary to cover the cost of clothing and incidental expenses. If not able to pay, this ex - pense is borne by the County. A deposit of $40.00 is required upon admission to cover this expense, and on December first of each year a request is made for an amount sufficient to bring the balance up to $40.00 Immediately after admission physical and mental examinations are made and a blood Wasserman done. All possible prophylactic 25 </seg>
            <seg id="p030">measures are used to keep disease at a minimum. Typho-Bacterin and Toxin-Antitoxin inoculations and smallpox vaccinations are given all inmates. Every two months all inmates are weighed and a careful record kept for comparison. Monthly school reports are sent to the Superintendent's office, and at the end of the school year a complete report is made by each teacher showing the progress of every pupil under her care. We maintain a school for nine months in the year, and employ seven teachers besides the band and orchestra instructor. All subjects are taught up to and including the fifth grade. Some of our pupils are able to do a little more than this in some branches. Many children are kept in school from year to year although they do not make much progress. In this way we are able to prevent deterioration. Gymnasium, Art Industrial and Handicraft are given considerable attention. We find that many children who can do very little in the regular school work can be taught to do things with their hands. Boys and girls wjio have been denied the privilege of public school or who have been a burden in their home or a problem in the community, after a short time with us become useful citizens in our little community. We find that special school training along with good care, pleasant and comfortable surroundings, wholesome enter - tainment and useful employment works a miracle in these cases. In the way of entertainment provided we have church services on Sunday mornings. On Tuesday evenings we have the dances, attended by all of the inmates capable of taking part, and by many who come only as spectators. Employees are required to attend the dances and dance with the boys and girls. Everybody enjoys these dances and a great many of our inmates are excellent dancers. On Thursday evenings a picture show is given. A good part of the school time is devoted to the preparation of special programs, and these are given in our auditorium on special occasions, as Thanks - giving, Christmas, Easter, etc. We have as many children to parti - cipate in these programs as possible. In this way we keep up their interest, keep them busy. Idleness is bad enough for anybody, but worse for a feeble-minded person because unless they are kept busy, they will degenerate. Groups of our inmates have been taken before various organ - izations in the city to give entertainments. These programs have 26 </seg>
            <seg id="p031">been given before the Kiwanis Club, the Rotary Club, the Business and Professional Women's Club, and the Centenary M. E. Sunday School. Entertainments have been given in our auditorium to which the public has been invited. Our children as well as the teachers have been highly complimented on these programs. These enter - tainments have served a useful purpose in showing, the public what we are able to accomplish at this institution. We have sent out type - written matter to schools and different organizations that have in - quired about the work being done by our children. During the biennium we admitted 177 males and 154 females. 49 were discharged and 103 died. Our population at the end of the biennium was 1,311 in the institution, and the total number on parole or vacation was 135. Many of these will be back when school opens September first. We have on our waiting list at this time 117 males and 101 fe - males, making a total of 218. At least 150 of these are active urgent applications. Probably a number of the balance have been taken care of in some other way. Applications are arriving almost every day, and we are receiving the most urgent requests from county authorities and welfare agencies, insisting upon our taking applicants who are waiting. We have accepted up to the limit, and are now only able to accept when vacancies occur. Most of these applicants cannot be accepted for a long period of time unless more room is provided. During the biennium we sterilized 22 females and 14 males. The total number sterilized at this institution at this date is 179. This is all right as far as it goes, but I am convinced that we should have a broader, more comprehensive sterilization law than the one we now have, which permits us to sterilize those who are leaving the Institution. Under this law we have sterilized most of those who have left the Institution and who might marry or become parents of feeble-minded children. Occasionally one escapes, or is taken away on vacation and never returned. In the 1935 session of the Legislature two bills were introduced. One provided for the numeration of all feeble-minded in the State. The other provided for sterilization under certain conditions. The first bill passed and became a law. Its only reference to sterilization provides that no marriage license shall be issued to any person who 27 </seg>
            <seg id="p032">has been found to be feeble-minded and committed to the Commis - sion for the Control of the Feeble-Minded, unless one of the parties to the marriage shall have been sterilized. The other bill provided means for sterilization. 1. That those who are inmates of the Institution for Feeble- Minded should be sterilized before leaving the Institution. 2. That mentally defective boys and girls arriving at the age of puberty and who show signs of becoming sexually delinquent should be sent to the State Institution for sterilization. 3. It provided for voluntary sterilization. We are acquainted with many parents who have feeble-minded children and who would be glad to be sterilized if there were some pro - vision of the law whereby this might be done at the expense of the State. 4. It provided that applicants for marriage licenses who have been committed to the care of the Commission for the Control of the Feeble-Minded should be sterilized. All of this at the expense of the State. This bill also provided proper safeguard for the individual so that his rights would be protected if he were opposed to sterilization. My personal experience is that consent can be obtained in almost every case if the matter is properly presented. Sterilization is not a punishment, but a protection. It prevents the birth of children who, even if not defective, would otherwise be brought up in unfavorable environments by mentally diseased or jmentally deficient parents or by the State. It enables many handi - capped persons to many and to have a life normal in most respects, whose marriage otherwise would be unwise if not disastrous. A study of our present population which is 1,430, shows that 479 are related as brother and sister, or parent and child. 466 have defective relatives outside of the Institution. 135 are known to have relatives insane. It is well known that defective parents have fami - lies at least twice as large as normal individuals in the community. We may build buildings and make plans to take care of defectives, delinquents, criminals and paupers, but the demand increases yearly because we have made no effort to control this flood at its source. 28 </seg>
            <seg id="p033">I am convinced that defective parents are responsible for a very large percent of these people who must be supported by the State. I would suggest that a law along the lines provided in House Roll 219 of the 1935 Legislature be enacted, and I believe that this law along with the provision for the enumeration of the feeble - minded, would in a generation make a tremendous change in the de - mand for institution building. In estimating the per capita cost of maintenance, you will find the population figures at the end of the biennium are misleading, for the reason that a large number of the children go home for the sum - mer when our school closes at the end of May. In my last biennial report I called attention to the Nebraska Commission for the Control of the Feeble-Minded, which was. created by the 1935 Legislature. This law provides for an enumera - tion of all feeble-minded persons in the State, of any age. Since no appropriation was made for this commission, and all the expenses must come out of the Institution maintenance approp - riations, we have been compelled to confine our efforts to obtain this information by sending out requests to the County Superinten - dents, Superintendent of Schools, County Welfare Workers, and the State Child Welfare Bureau, as well as the Superintendents of other State Insitutions. In this way we have obtained the names of 1,244, and 238 of these are confined in other State Hospitals. During the first year of the biennium we completed installation of plumbing, heating, and water in the Girls' New Cottage, and moved in December 1, 1935. This cottage was designed to accomo - date 120 girls, the same as the girls' cottage that was completed in 1933. We have finished part of the attic in each of these buildings by putting in concrete floors and insulating the ceilings and walls against heat and cold, thus providing sleeping quarters for 46 girls. We have also put in 950 feet of 6-inch water main, and three new fire hydrants. We have also laid 376 feet of concrete walk extend - ing from the new cottage south to the Custodial building. A gran - ary with a capacity of a thousand bushels and a corn crib for a thousand bushels have been built at the farm. The roofs of most buildings have been repaired or replaced. All tin decks and felt roofs have been mopped with hot asphalt. All metal gutters have had a coat of red lead paint. 29 </seg>
            <seg id="p034">30 The basement of our newest building has been fitted up .for a sewing room. The walls which were of rough concrete have been given a coat of white plaster, a concrete floor put in, and 12 new or rebuilt power sewing machines installed. This practically doubles our sewing room equipment. This does not make an ideal sewing room, but under pressure of necessity we are very glad to be able to make this arrangement. Twenty girls are being trained here. Some of them become quite proficient seamstresses, and many use the knowledge gained here to become self-supporting when they leave the Institution. The sewing room more flian pays its cost of operation. During the biennium the sewing department produced 42,161 new garments and mended 237,485 garments. The Indust - rial Art department made a total of 1,157 articles during the bien - nium. The space vacated when the sewing room was moved to the new quarters has been remodeled to make more space for the ste - ward's store room. The 1935 Legislature appropriated $12,000.00 for laundry machinery, and owing to the increase in our population, and the run - down condition of our laundry this equipment was very badly needed. This appropriation has practically all been expended. We purchased two American Monel Metal Washers, 42 by 96", one Trojan 48" extractor, and two American tumblers 44 by 92". All of the machinery in the wash room has been reset on heavy concrete foundations, extending down to solid earth. One small washer was rebuilt and reinstalled. We have recently purchased from the In - stitution at Genoa, a practically new American four roll fiat work ironer, so that we are now able to take care ofl our laundry work very satisfactorily. The old stone and brick cottage is 50 years old, and of poor con - struction. This building houses patients of low mentality. The floors of pine have been wet most of the time, and as a consequence the sills and joists have decayed. The ends of the first floor joists have rotted off and no longer rest on the foundation. Twelve years I ago a concrete slab was put on top of this floor. This additional i weight has caused the floor to sag, so that we have found it necessary to set posts in the basement to support it. The walls are cracked from window to window, from the top to the foundation. There is &lt; real danger that this building may fall down and possibly cost the lives of one or two employees and perhaps a half hundred inmates. </seg>
            <seg id="p035">31 A tentative plan has been made for replacing this, building with one to accommodate one hundred fifty inmates, as well as provid - ing store rooms for the steward. This new store room is badly needed, because our store is badly crowded and a valuable stock of goods is stored in a non-fire-proof building. Our water supply is still inadequate, although there are indica - tions that the water level in our wells is rising. But we are facing a water shortage, and must keep in mind the fact that six thousand feet of second hand pipe laid from the institution to connect with the Beatrice water system, may give out at any time, in fact it has developed a number of leaks, demanding immediate repair. This pipe cannot be expected to last long. At the present time we are pumping directly from our wells to a small cistern near the stand pipe. From this cistern the water is pumped into a stand pipe and flows by gravity to a high pressure pump at the boiler house. From here it is distributed under constant pressure to every building and ward. The stand pipe serves only as a reservoir, but some time in the future we should plan to make a large underground reservoir so that we will be able to accumulate water during the hours that the demand is smallest. In this way it will not be necessary to pump our wells so hard. Owing to the lay of the land it will be possible to make this reservoir so that the water will flow by gravity to the high pressure pump at the boiler house and the cost of pumping into the stand pipe will be saved. During the winter of 1936 we raised our dam in Bear Creek three feet and dredged the creek above this dam, taking out about 200 yards of dirt, thereby increasing the storage capacity for use to a considerable extent. It was hoped that this would make it possible for us to have plenty of water for irrigating our garden, but since we have had very little rain during the summer this water is practic - ally exhausted at the date of this report. However, this supply of water'has made it possible to keep our lawns and trees in good con - dition, and save a very large part of our garden, but rain must come very soon or we cannot hope for very much garden stuff. Early in the spring of 1937 we raised our dam at the farm about five feet. It is estimated that the pond created by this dam should contain fifteen million gallons of water, but because of insufficient </seg>
            <seg id="p036">32 rain this pond has never filled up, but it may reasonably be expected to do so this fall or early in the spring. If so, this will provide water to irrigate a field of 65 acres that we expect to plant to corn next spring. I am convinced that we should make some effort to pump water from the Blue River to this institution, so that we may have an abundance of water when needed for irrigation. It might even be worth while to consider pumping from the Blue River to a filteration plant near the Institution since our wells do not produce enough water for our uses. This is only a suggestion but is worth consideration. The distance form the Blue River to a high point near the Administration Building is a mile and a quarter. While the roof on the old part of the boiler house has been recently repaired, we must keep in mind that this roof will have to be replaced soon. The walls of this portion of the building should be brought up to a uniform height before the roof is put on. In estimating our appropriation for general repairs, this should be kept in mind. Our Chief Engineer tells me that early in the next biennium we must plan to reset two boilers at an expense of about $5,000.00. One of, the things needed at the Institution is a vegetable cave. I would propose that we make this cave on the hillside im - mediately east of the boys cottages. We can do the excavating and most of the work with our own help, except for a little help in laying brick and tile. This should be a narrow cave so that the roof span will not be too great, because all of the dirt from the excavating should be put back on the top. It should be wide enough however, so that we may have bins on each side and a run-way wide enough so that a loaded wagon may be backed in and a team can be lead in and i hitched to the wagon to draw a load out. This roof of course should be covered with water-proof material, so that the dirt and moisture would not rot the roof. For a number of years we have been getting seedling trees from the State, and planting them in rows in our garden, so that each year we have a large number of trees that are suitable to be set out about the Institution. During these dry years we have lost a good many of these young trees, yet our percentage of survivals has been very high. We lost a number of trees in our orchard, mostly </seg>
            <seg id="p037">apple trees, due to the dry weather and borers. We replaced some of them this spring, but we find that a number have failed to leaf out, and will have to be replanted next spring. Members of the Board of Control have kept in close touch with this Institution and are familiar with our needs and with conditions in general, so that I need not prolong this report, and I want to ex - press my sincere thanks for their interest and cooperation. To all heads of departments and faithful employees who have labored dili - gently to help in the building up of the Institution, I offer my sincere appreciation. Respectfully, J. A. BURFORD, Superintendent. 33 </seg>

            <seg id="p051">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. It gives me pleasure to present the Twenty-second Biennial re - port of the Girls' Training School. In presenting this report I should like to state first that we have at all times and in all our train - ing endeavored to emphasize the fact that this institution is educa - tional and not penal, that its purpose is the same as any school — to prepare the girls for a useful life in society. It gives me pleasure to present evidence of slow but steady progress. We know that the basis of juvenile delinquency is an environ - ment in which some constructive element is lacking. When we real - ize that seventy and one-half per cent of the five hundred and thirty - eight girls admitted to the school in the past ten years came from broken homes, we can readily see what was lacking in many cases. It is, of course, true that not all girls who come to the school are capable or desirous of raising to the standards that we should like to have them attain. But we are many times thrilled with the sincere effort and success attained by the girl who had so little promise in the beginning. Realizing that religion is the foundation of education, we en - deavor to teach it in every day life but not stressing it until the girl forms a positive dislike for it. Oftentimes by memorizing passages of scripture and then applying them to every day life, the girls find they are happier when they live according to the teachings of the Bible. No girl is required to attend Sunday School or Chapel Ser - vices but these are made as attractive as possible and the girls con - sider it a privilege. Plenty of good religious reading matter is avail - able at all times, but no girl is forced to read it. When a girl enters the school,, a record is made of her church preference or affiliation and no girl is permitted to change this while she is in the school. 47 </seg>
            <seg id="p052">48 In April, 1920, all girls attending school were given the State eighth grade examinations and only four passed it successfully. The school at that time 'was not graded and the teachers were not ac - credited. That fall all teachers employed were qualified teachers and the school was graded. The following spring forty-eight girls successfully passed the eighth grade examinations with a high aver - age. A few years later the ninth and tenth grades were added. In the fall of 1928 the eleventh and twelfth grades were added. With the help of the Geneva Board of Education and the Superintendent of the Geneva school, we became a minor accredited High School. In May of 1929 a class of four girls received their High School di - plomas. This year we had a class of twenty-one girls, making more than a hundred who have finished their high school work. Some of these girls have gone on to university and received their degrees. Others have taken business courses and are holding responsible posi - tions. Some have married and are successful wives and mothers. With the assistance of our Educational Director, we will this fall have the required equipment and number of teachers to give us a fully accredited high school. The influence of music upon the human soul is being recognized more and more in all walks of life. There is no place where it can do more good than in a school for adolescent girls. No matter under what conditions the girl may have lived or what mistakes she may have made, there is that within her which reaches out, blindly groping for expression through the beautiful things of life. She may be unconscious of the nature of these yearnings, but their presence is a vital influence on her behavior. She does not reason how or why, she only follows this urgent impulse to express herself through whatever avenue is open. There is nothing that we can pro - vide for her that will satisfy this yearning as much as music does. The girls love to sing and many hours each day are spent with their music. Many difficulties that might easily develop into real problems are cleared away by a short time spent in singing. There is an orchestra of twenty-five pieces and two Glee Clubs with from twenty-five to thirty members. These furnish special music for the Sunday services and for all programs and entertain - ments. They are frequently asked to assist in programs outside of </seg>
            <seg id="p053">the school. Private lessons are given to girls who show special tal - ent. The sewing department is another favorite department. They are not only taught the rudiments of sewing but are taught some things about materials, color combinations, designing, etc. Each girl must spend several months doing sewing and art needle work. Any girl with any talent or desire to learn to care for her wardrobe is well equipped to do so when she finishes this course. The house work, cooking, and serving, and laundry work are all under the supervision of competent and experienced women, also the garden, dairy, and poultry work. Plenty of chickens, eggs, milk, and cream are furnished by these departments. We have not only fresh vegetables for summer use, but also if the season is at all favorable plenty for canning and storing away for winter use. We have been very fortunate in having Miss Clara Toland at the head of the Parole Department. Miss Toland is a woman of broad experience, a faithful conscientious worker, who gives freely of herself, her time, and her money. The girls have perfect confi - dence in her and look forward to her letters and her visits with a great deal of pleasure. , I It has not been easy, the past few years, with the scarcity of em - ployment and the abundance of liquor, to find good homes or the right kind of employment for our girls. Neither has it been easy for the girls to make the proper adjustments under these conditions. During this biennium we have had one hundred and four girls on parole. Six were returned because they failed to make satisfactory adjustments. We do not feel that this is such a bad record, but it is not as good as we should have liked, and not as good as we have had some.bienniums. The first major improvement was the installation of a much needed sewerage disposal plant, for Dunbar cottage, this has been a great relief and help to the cottage. Our cold storage plant is still in the making but will be a much needed and much appreciated improvement when finished. It was carefully planned and constructed, and we have every reason to believe that it will prove very satisfactory. 49 </seg>
            <seg id="p054">The new irrigation well and water system, while not complete, are far enough along that we can use the well for irrigation and their is an abundance of water. Very little repair work has been done on the buildings during this period. The main thing being the installment of window strips in the Administration and Center buildings. The roofs of these buildings were also repaired. Fanny Crosby cottage was repaired and painted on the outside. We wish to express our gratitude and appreciation to the ladies who made it possible for us to have new pianos for the girls living rooms. These have been appreciated more than we can tell. To my coworkers and all friends who have in any waj 1 contrib - uted to the success and happiness of the school, we express our thanks. We are most grateful to the Board of Control for counsel, fore - bearance and loyal support. Respectfully submitted, LENA E. WARD, .., Superintendent. 50 </seg>

In the spring of 1887 the ground was broken and the corner stone was laid October 7 of the same year. During this period there have been many changes as the Home was built for Civil War Veterans of whom there are but two living with us at the present time. Next came the Spanish-American war, of whose ranks we have 48, and of the late World War we have 102 veterans. The Home originally started with one main building and a small hospital and has since grown m to a large institution. Ac - cording to a recent inspection by the Federal Government it is one of the outstanding State Soldiers and Sailors' Homes m the Union. In the past biennium we have added three irrigation wells on our farm, and during the dry weather of the past two years we have been able, with the aid of our wells, to produce good crops as we have an abundance of water. We have constructed a sightly and durable coal house on the Burlington Railroad right of way, and at present we are installing new laundry equipment, for which the legislature of 1935 made a special appropriation. Trees and shrubs, which were grown m our own nursery, are being added continually to our landscaping with practically no cost to the State of Nebraska. The City of Grand Island has cooperated with the institution m every way, for which lam more than pleased. There has been no - change m the personnel of the institution during this biennium, and I wish to thank the Board of Control, and the officers and employees for the splendid cooperation during that period. Respectfully submitted, IVAN S. GALLANT, Commandant. 61 </seg>

During the biennium every effort has been made to keep the members of the Home, comfortable and contented. All expenditures have been kept within the allotted appropri - ations and the officers have at all times endeavored to operate the Home m an economical manner and at the same time furnish every - thing necessary for the comfort and health of the members. We close the biennium without a deficit, regardless of the unusual drouth conditions of the past two years. During 1936, extensive repairs were made at the boiler-room, part of the outside walls being torn down and rebuilt ; repairs were also made on the smoke stack. At the Culver building some of the porches were repaired.

            <seg id="p087">83 To the Governor and the Board o£ Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I hereby present to you the Biennial Report for the Hastings State Hospital, covering the period from July 1, 1935 to June 30, 1937. The changes in the personnel during these two years call for serious attention. The low salaries have only permitted us to em - ploy untrained personnel. These people remain with us only until they have obtained some training, then they leave to accept positions in other states doing similiar work at a better salary than they receive here. This situtation accounts for more than 100% turn-over in two years time. We have during the past two years, had an average en - rollment of 224 employees, and 232 have left our services. This necessitates that the staff continually train a personnel in routine and fundamentals instead of being able to devote their time to more advanced functions. It therefore reduces the efficiency of the work and tends to confuse the patient who continually must adjust him - sel f to new and untrained employees. The ward service, which has labored under the tremendous handicaps of turn-over in personnel, has profited by the untiring efforts of Miss Dingman, the director of the service. It is hoped that at the onset of this biennium such salaries can be paid that a nucleus of an organization can be retained, so that increases in sal - aries can be given to those who have completed sufficient training and give evidence of qualifications for responsible positions. It will be seen from the Statistical Table No. 1 that we have admitted during the biennium 423 patients, and during the same period of time discharged 243 — a turn-over of 57%. On Table No. 14 will be seen that 9% were discharged as recovered, 74% as im - proved and 17% as unimproved. These figures are not low com - pared with other institutions in the country working under similiar </seg>
            <seg id="p088">84 commitment laws, but still better results can be obtained after the aforementioned recommendations are followed. The Out-Patient Department, which formerly functioned chief - ly for patients on parole and relatives of patients, lias, during the past two years, been handling cases referred by physicians ; and dur - ing the past few months, patients referred by various welfare or - ganizations in the state, Child Welfare Bureau, and juvenile courts. Fifty-five such cases have been handled with considerable degree of satisfaction. It is hoped that we may continue to develop our Staff and Social Service Department so that our efforts in child psychiatry may increase. At the present time Salurda}' mornings are given to children's psychiatric problems, but this clinic should gradually carry its activities into various localities where the community has be - come aware of such problems. In other words, we should begin to look forward to a traveling mental hygiene clinic operating from the State Hospital as a base. Because of inadequate finances the work of the Recreational Department has been combined with that of the Occupational There - apy Department. It has functioned very satisfactorily under trained personnel. This department reports that in the two years 380 pa - tients have been treated ; that the average attendance is 60 per day : and that, during the two years, 54 patients have been sent home and 50 patients have been transferred to domestic occupation. During the summer months we have found the cabin on the Jacobson farm very useful. Groups of patients are taken there from 9 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon. Besides preparing their own lunch, music, singing, and the playing of games occupv their time. Groups of patients that are under a socialization program have been from time to time entertained in the home of the Occupational Therapist, and we are indebted to the management of the Rivoli Theater for providing weekly free admissions to the down town theater for this group of patients. The work of music and recrea - tion cannot be too strongly emphasized in an institution of this kind. Most interesting work has been the beginning of the hypogly - cemic-shock treatment for schizophrenic patients. Twenty beds are occupied with patients under such treatment which has given rather encouraging results. The entire institution population has been examined for tuber - culosis and we have in the past year completed the segregation of the </seg>
            <seg id="p089">active, cases. An attempt is made on two wards to give the patient reatment for tuberculosis. It is reaped, however? th a , adequa* nttent 7"°' *?***■ ** *™ Until * buiUHn^ is &lt;**«&lt;* *« the patients suffering trom tuberculosis. We recognize and appreciate the effective work of the Hoard 0 Control and the State Legislature in providing us daring the past bienmum with adequate kitchen facilities, with an adequate sewage disposal system, more adequate fire prevention, and with quarters tor housing approximately three-fourths of our employees. In conclusion, I wish to thank all of those who have visited our ins titution ami who have interested themselves in institutional affairs o bring about improvements in the patients' care in and out of the 1 lospital as well as in the conditions under which we work. Respectfully submitted, JUUL C. NIELSEN, M. D. Superintendent. 85 </seg>

            <seg id="p103">99 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I have the honor of submitting the Biennial Report of the Lin - coln State Hospital for the period covering two years from Tulv 1 1935 to June 30, 1937. The medical staff remains as it was two years ago. The mem - bers of the staff have manifested a keen interest in their work, and efforts directed to the restoration of patients through modern treat - ment have been quite vigorous. In addition to our regular medical staff we have had two inter - nes during the summer months, Dr. Cecil F. Baisinger and Dr. Rich - ard W. Gray in 1936, and Dr. Elmer H. Brock and Charles L. Park in 1937. They have done very efficient service for us. We have carried on a tubercular test on all of the patients in the institution and have caught up with the study and writing up of the patients' histories and other work that has fallen behind because of an insuffi - cient number of doctors on our regular staff. The only other officer who has been changed during the bien - nium was the matron. Mrs. Stella Clay, our former matron, re signed on March 4, 1936, and Mrs. Ola G. Hollingsworth was ap - pointed by the Board of Control to fill the vacancy. Religious services are held each Sunday afternoon at two-thirty o'clock. Rev. Thomas A. Maxwell, our regular Chaplain, conducts the services and the hour of chapel service is most profitable. In ad - dition to this, each Saturday morning the Priest visits the hospital and conducts Mass for the Catholic patients who are able to attend. The Christian Science Reader holds a service each Wednesday after - noon for the patients of that faith. All of these services help the i patients religiously and mentally. Amusements have been carried on as usual during the period. On Saturday afternoon the talking pictures are given ; each Friday </seg>
            <seg id="p104">night a patients dance is given;- and besides this, occasional enter - tainment is secured through the University players and others. For the past year we have been very fortunate in having the WPA orchestra, which is very fine, give us weekly concerts, some of them outside on the lawn and some of them in the chapel. These come during the summer months when we are not having our picture shows and dances. At the beginning of this biennium we had twelve telephone ra-| dios. Since the company has not been charging us anything for these radios for the past few years, they have been discontinued./ However, many of the wards are pretty well supplied with radios' All of them are radios which have been provided for some patient who is a resident of that particular ward, or in some cases they are provided by the attendant who has charee of the ward. In this way our patients are very well supplied with radio entertainment, which' could be improved by the State purchasing a few extra ones, which" I think would be a very profitable thing to do. T feel that the radio' bringing in news and entertainment from the outside world makes the patients feel more at home and less isolated than anything else 1 we are able to have about the hospital. We have seven croquet sets for the female patients, and they, seem to enjoy this game very much. We have noted that it has helped their mentality a great deal, and some patients who would ait and talk to imaginary people continually have ceased this and are ; now playing croquet. The men enjoy daily baseball on the lawn. On holidays we have some sort of entertainment, usually music and extra dinners. At Christmas time many of our patients receive' packages of eatables and presents, and the hospital takes on a holi- r day air which seems to have a good effect on the patients. On the Fourth of July we have an entertainment on the lawn for the pa-l tients. Most of them take pleasure in entering the contests, races,'/ etc., and the winner of each receives a prize. A number of our patients are taken to the State Fair each year and some of them look forward to this occasion with great interest' and seem to enjoy it very much. The garden at this institution, besides the potatoes, is usually about 40 acres, a demonstration of intensive gardening. We had a good garden in the Spring of 1935 and a good field of rhubarb. In 100 </seg>
            <seg id="p105">fact, we had been using the rhubarb about one week and the garden was doing fine, as we had rains up until that juncture, when a hail storm struck and completely ruined the garden. This Spring of 1937 we have been more fortunate with our garden than last year, and as this report is written our prospects for a bountiful garden are very good ; in fact, better than they have been for the past three years, and we expect it to be of financial benefit to the institution as well as a benefit to the health of our patients. In the year 1937, the outlook for corn and forage for the dairy herd for the coming year is much improved over last. In fact, at the writing of this report we are almost sure of at least good ensilage if not a good corn crop. Sewing and various other domestic duties about the institu - tion provide occupational pursuits for our female patients. The sewing room proves most useful in the making of clothing and bed - ding for the institution. We usually have about fifteen patients in the art room who do fancy work, furnishing the institution with table covers, etc. These patients make from thirty to thirty-five pieces a month. We have a show case in the center office contain - ing fancy work to be sold to the public, and we take many pieces to the State Fair for display and sale. The carpenter shop, furniture repair shop, paint shop, farm, garden, engine room, laundry, poultry farm, dairy, greenhouse, and lawn provide occupational pursuits for our male patients. Because of having certain tasks to perform, patients are happier and in many instances actually improve mentally. We regard these industrial pursuits as one of our most potent therapeutic agents. We only regret that we do not have an Occupational Therapv Department and regular occupational therapy teachers and rooms where this might be carried on with a great deal more profit to the patients. With these facilities they could take patients who are not ible to take part in the occupational pursuits upon the outside. This, I think, is one of the most important departments we could have ad - led to our institution at the present time, and one which we hope to lave in the near future. An appropriation was received from the last Legislature to build i water system for this institution and the Reformatory for Men. 101 </seg>
            <seg id="p106">This work has been accomplished, and we now have excellent water and good water pressure in case of fire. We also have installed a' chlorometer so that we may know that the water is pure for the patients at all times. In a hospital such as this, plenty of water is one of the most important things that can be had for health and pro-; tection. Hence, we feel that we are quite fortunate in having tin.* improvement completed during this biennium. You will note the statistical tables speak for themselves. L wish to call your attention especially to the number of patients treated during the biennium in the hospital and also the number that were paroled and discharged. We think this is a very good showing, taking into consideration the equipment and facilities we have to work with. We believe it could be greatly increased, and we could improve many more of the patients if we had better facilities such as are outlined in this report. The needs of this institution, you will note, were marked out in the annual report of 1935 and 1936. Since that time we have plan - ned at this institution a future building program. The Legislature has been in session during the past winter and has made their appropriations, hence, it would be useless to list the buildings that we feel we should have, as our needs have not changed since the annual report was written one year ago. The things that were said at that time I think hold equally true at this time. I feel we have accomplished a great deal in having the planning for this future building program and the charts made by Mr. Fitzgerald and his aids, who have been working on this in conjunction with the Board of Control and ourselves during the last few months, {t calls for certain buildings, and the locations are all selected. At this time the lawn is being landscaped. We need a building very badly for patients, both men and women, as we found in our survey that we are taking care of 3Q0 patients more than we have capacity for. We are asking for a building for patients and an administration building, that the old central building be reconstructed at a later date, which will enable us to care for more patients and also have occupational therapy work, laboratories, etc. I estimate that with a reconstruction of the central building and an administration building, we could house many more employees and at least fifty more pat- 102 </seg>
            <seg id="p107">lents. This in itself would give us quite an outlet for the reason that we could move our employees from the receiving hospital, place them in the reconstructed center of the main building, and at the same time increase the room for at least fifty patients. There is ample room to establish a beauty parlor for the lady patients, which I think should be done. We should also have fever-treatment rooms and offices for doctors and other officers. Our receiving hos - pital would be adequate for all of this if we had an employees' build - ing. In. addition our outside units, including the engine room, laun - dry, and dining rooms for employees, are going to be inadequate in a short time; the dining rooms in particular when we add new em - ployees to bring our institution up to a hospital basis such as I think it should be. If this program was carried out, including the ward building and the employees' building, it would enable us to house many more patients in room now being occupied by employees. Furthermore, our staff should be enlarged to include social wel - fare workers, psychiatric workers, and more physicians.. These things should come gradually but they should all be thought of and the institution gradually built up to this end. I would call your attention once more to |the very necessary im - provement that we need in the way of a fence labout the institution yards. The Pioneer Park has been located, as you know, just back of the hospital, and several places of busines are located near our front door, so it becomes more and more imperative that we should have a good fence about the institution campus, the garden, and the dairy barn to prevent those who are thoughtless in driving through and those who might intentionally care to tresspass on the State's ground to cause any unnecessary trouble. In conclusion, I thank the Governor and the members of the Board of Control for their courteous consideration and for the con - fidence, kind assistance, and advice they have uniformly extended to me throughout the biennium. I also thank the officers and em - ployees associated with me who have been loyal and faithful during the year. Respectfully submitted, D. G. GRIFFITHS, M. D. Superintendent. 103 </seg>

            <seg id="p124">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. It is my privilege to submit for your consideration, the Twenty - fourth Eiennial Report of the Norfolk State Hospital, for the per - iod ending June 30, 1937. At the beginning of the period under consideration there were present in the Hospital, 1,057 patients, 536 males and 521 females. During the period there were 205 patients admitted, 122 males and 83 females. There were on parole at the beginning of the period, 91 patients, 52 males and 39 females. There were discharged during the present biennium, 116 patients, 70 males and 46 females. Fif - teen men were transferred to the Veteran's Hospital at Danville, Illinois, during this biennium. 102 patients died at the Institution during this period, 56 males and 46 females. The population at the Institution at the end of the biennium was 1,055 patients, 533 males 522 females. Again we begin the biennium with an over-crowded condition and a waiting list of over fifty patients. It has been mentioned in previous reports, the handicap under which we labor under the present conditions, and I believe this handicap is fully realized by our Board of Control, as well as the general public. The over - crowded condition of the Nebraska State Hospitals is perhaps no different than in many other states. In fact, due to the depression the past few years, I note in nearly every report received from other state hospitals, the one common cry is "over-crowding." To all of us concerned, this condition is indeed very unfortunate. More than this, there seems to be no end on the demands of the institutions of this type, which brings us face to face with the problem of the continuous care of an ever increasing population. It occurs to me that perhaps our approach or remedy for this condition has been wrong, and that we should be thinking more of prevention than we have heretofore, and more time should be spent in research work. I would particularly urge our Board of Control to give the matter of research departments for each state institution considerable thought and study. 120 </seg>
            <seg id="p125">In the past two years much has been written by authorities along this particular line, and it seems to be the consensus of opinion that State hospitals are the best adapted and the only real place for research work in psychiatry. To make our institution a research center, the expense of equipment would be very small, but it would be necessary to provide adequate salaries in order to employ ex - perienced psychiatric research men. It is my judgment that an in - crease of twenty thousand dollars a year in our salary budget would take care of the needed added trained doctors, technicians, welfare workers, etc. I am confident that a research department in our in - stitution is, in the end, the only answer to our problems. Fine buildings, good equipment, adequate working conditions, all of these things we associate with well managed hospitals are essential, but unless they eventually lead to art increase in the dis - charge rate, shortening the hospital residence and lengthening the time the patients spend in the community, the increased cost to the tax-payer is not justfied. The medieval beliefs about mental abberations still exist to a greater extent than is commonly realized. Most of it is subcon - scious, and therefore is more dangerous and more difficult to eradi - cate. The only answer to this is public education along a never - ending process. The burden of responsibility of doing this rests up - on the hospital. The goal of such educational effort should be more than to add to the prestige of the hospital. The ultimate purpose should be mental health. No program of mental hygiene can ever hope to be successful which does not take into consideration the State hospitals. The mental hygienist cannot always be successful. There must be commitments, and the understanding psychiatrist knows when to utilize the resources of the institution. The question is frequently asked, "What do you do to get a patient well besides locking him up?" "What medicine can be given to cure mental illness?" "Is surgery of any value?" An attempt to classify the actual therapeutic procedures of a mental hospital brings out some rather startling results. Just what does the institu - tion do for the patient beyond segregating him from the community ? General statements can be made regarding therapy. To classify the therapeutic procedures and what they accomplish offers difficulties that few administrators realize until they have undertaken the task. Any educational program should include the therpeutic program of the hospital.

            <seg id="p126">tional. The individual tax payer is not so much interested in the amount of money that is being spent as he is in what he is getting for his money. The hospital that thinks only in terms of the cure of the patients is not fulfilling its function to the fullest extent. This is the day of preventive medicine. Psychiatry should be thinking in terms of prevention as well as cure. It should be a primary goal of every State hospital to formulate and carry out educational measures which are specifically directed towards the prevention of mental ill - ness. But, a real danger exists in too much enthusiasm for this par - ticular phase of publicity. The education must not proceed any more rapidly than the actual results will justify. There has been in the past, a strong tendency to "over-sell" mental hygiene. We have been prone to promise more than we can deliver. Conservative statements based upon actual knowledge, and performance, are proper. Startling information and exaggerated conclusions based upon insufficient data will do great harm to the whole movement. Hospital publicity must be dignified, interpretative, and educa - tional. It must constantly; stress the fact that the institution is part of the community. The public must learn that hospital psychiatrists are not individuals who have failed to make a living in their pro - fessions and have had to crawl in under the beneficient protection of a State government, and that mental nurses are not uneducated, illi - terate, and brutal individuals who show their sadistic tendencies by mistreating patients. We must teach society that mental hospitals are directed by honest, well-trained, scientific men who are trying to render service to the patient, and that mental nursing calls for train - ing, character, personality, and enthusiasm for an idea. A sense of proprietorship and community loyalty can only be built slowly and laboriously but it must be one of the goals of our educational pro - gram. In conclusion of this report I desire to express my grateful ap - preciation of the support and cooperation given me by the officers and employees of the hospital, and especially I wish to thank the Hoard of Control for the unfailing kindnesses they have shown me at all times, and for their consideration and support. Respectfully submitted, G. E. CHARLTON, M. D. Superintendent. 122 </seg>

Admission to the school is through commitment by court and is confined to sane boys under 18 found guilty of crime (except homicide), or boys under 16 who are beyond parental control. Boys are required to remain until 21 years of age unless sooner released by court order or paroled by the superintendent. 138 </seg>
            <seg id="p143">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. In the twenty-four months ending June 30, 1937, 206 boys have been received into the State Industrial School, Kearney, Nebraska. They were committed by County and District judges of Nebraska for incorrigibility, delinquency, and theft. In age the boys are from eight to twenty-one years. The buildings and equipment of the State Industrial School are valued at $300,000.00 The fertile farm of 602 acres is divided into two parts by United States Highway Number 30. The north por - tion rises to a high hill on which are located the white buildings of the Institution. The south portion, between the highway and the Union Pacific Railroad, is black loam Platle Valley soil, the choicest in the world. Here, midway between the Atlantic and Pacific, Neb - raska's delinquent boys are housed, clothed, fed, taught, and trained. Ten years of public school work are provided ; in addition, typ - ing, business arithmetic, and bookkeeping are taught in the commer - cial department. In the 'educational system, stress has been placed upon vocational training. The teaching of trades and industrial operations, including theory and technique to resultant skill and precision, acquired through daily practice, is a goal zealously to be pursued. This kind of manual training appeals, more than does the ac - ademic, to industrial school boys. Here both physical and mental efforts are utilized. Beneficial results of this work are to the youth immediately visible and appreciable. Boys troublesome to their teachers in academic work have shown themselves industrious and successful in vocational classes. Common school boys have descended from annoyances to de - linquents. Vocational education has demonstrated itself a prevent. 139 </seg>
            <seg id="p144">tion of delinquency. In this school it is a corrective agency. The skill and knowledge gained by a boy pursuing a trade. will divert j him from crime to industry. Cooperation with his fellows, pride in good workmanship, real - ization of property values, consideration for the rights of others, respect for properly constituted authority, practice in assuming re - sponsibility, the desire to surpass, are qualities of manhood assimilat - ed by boys who are carefully directed in vocational training. Properly certified teachers direct the academic education of the sdiool boys of this institution. These teachers are selected for their teaching strength and their tact in discipline: The first ten years of public school work is outlined for the students by the course of study furnished by the Department of Ed - ucation of the State of Nebraska. The merit system is the basis on which the government of the school is builded. The boys who are committed to this institution by the courts enter here with a clean record so far as their standing in behavior is posted in the ledger of conduct. From that clean entrance base all future good conduct is rewarded with merits allotted to each boy for good traits and practice. Forty merits daily is the formal number each boy gains. For outstanding good conduct he receives ninety more. When the number of merits reaches 18,000, the boy is eligi - ble to parole. By this time the parole officer has made a study of the boy's home conditions and surroundings. The boy is returned to his home; or, if the parole officer prefers, the boy is placed in the care of a more promising home, under the guidance of more cultural foster parents. Boys who enter the school in the wrong spirit, continuing mis - behaviors and bad conduct, receive demerits and prolong the time they remain in the institution, denying themselves the opportunity of early parole and liberty. A large majority of the boys cooperate with the provisions of the system ; and thereby banish to a minimum all punitive practices. Yes, the merit system is a strong factor toward clean school government. 140 </seg>

This fruit produc - ing orchard is admiringly observed by passing tourists, by surround - ing neighbors, and by boys who love jams and jellies. In the 24 months closing June 30, 1937, the fruit from the trees and vineyards has, by the boys of the kitchen departments, been canned to the amount of 22,749 quarts. 62,350 pounds of fresh fruit have been supplied to the dining tables of the institution, by this orchard's trees and vines. A talented nurse, a good doctor, an able dentist, and «i $26,000.00 hospital are the agencies by which the health of the boys is maintained at high standard. The longer the period a boy is with - in this school, the stronger and healthier is the boy. In the last two years in this school death has claimed one boy. Serious contagious diseases have been avoided. Many pale and undernourished boy's entering the school, have developed into strong ruddy young men. 18 boys have had tonsils removed. 229 boys have had dental care. Medical examination has been offered each entrant. Physical handicaps have been corrected. Hospital diets have been provided. Faulty eyes have been supplied with glasses. Blood tests have been given, and proper medical treatment ad - ministered. Clean athletic sports have been enjoyed. 198 young men, in daily average, cared for in this State Indus - trial School are housed in five cottages. Age, size, and inclination determine the cottage groups. Over each group of forty boys, one man — the cottage father — and one woman — the cottage mother — preside. Each entrant's vocational fitness and characteristics are studied in the receiving cottage. The boy is then assigned to one of several details or trades, among them the following : poultry raising, broom making, carpentei'ing, cooking, laundering, mechanics, painting, printing, tailoring, shoemaking, gardening, dairying, and farming. Instruction in music is stressed. We are proud of our State Industrial School band of 26 with instrumentation as follows: 3 clarinets, 1 piccolo, 6 cornets, 3 altos, 4 trombones, 1 baritone, 2 sousaphones, 2 saxophones, 1 bass drum, 3 snare drums, and cymbals. </seg>
            <seg id="p146">The band gave concerts Sunday evenings on the school campus ; also playing for fairs, picnics, community gatherings and in stately parades. During the summer of 1936 the orchestra of ten pieces fur - nished music for the chapel services held in the auditorium of tin: gymnasium. An attractive and popular organization has been the State In - dustrial School drum corps. Its membership numbers 20. The corps has given beautiful drills on the school campus. It has given drilling exhibitions in Kearney, on State Teachers College Athletic Field, Buffalo County Fair Grounds, and Holdrege Athletic Field. The boys of our farm with 2 tractors and 21 good horses till the fertile soil of our 602 acre farm. City boys, coming to this school, have developed into efficient farm workers. What a beauti - ful transition is that, when a city idler developes into a working agriculturalist. By the work of the boy agriculturalist, in this bien - nium, the farm has yielded 9,540 bushels of potatoes, 838 tons of alfalfa, 416 tons of sugar beets, 330 tons of ensilage, and 17 tons of sudan grass. 83 acres of garden in two years produced vegetables to the value of $23,360.90 including the potatoes with value of $11,448.90. Twenty acres of orchard provided fruit in value of $3,538.75. Our Holstein herd of 116 cattle is the source of much pride. Its value amounts to the sum of $11,600.00. The boys of the dairy department are taught one of the most valuable and most practical of businesses. The proper watering, feeding, cleaning, milking and doctoring of choice dairy cows is indeed a profession. The boys learn much of value to them whether they become farmers, dairymen or stockmen. The milk given by the cows of this herd has weighed 975,916 pounds ; or 9,759 hundred-weight ; or 443 tons. In liquid measure these weights equal 114,801 gallons of this valuable white food. Tn market value this milk amounts to the large sum of $19,180.49. The dairy has done a large part in furnishing ideal food to the entire population of the institution. Our spotted Poland China hogs have been a great resource. 373 are in our lots at the close of this biennium. 651 have been sold 142 </seg>
            <seg id="p147">bringing to our cash fund $13,609.67. 106 of these animals have provided our tables with fr«Jsh pork, with a market value of $4,273.52 We have in our flock 3,956 Leghorn chickens. 4,503 have been used as food on the tables of the institution. The value of this fowl is $2,748.90. The eggs from our 700 hens curing the biennium have numbered 15,075 dozens; their value $2,713.^0. This detail affords the boys working thereon an excellent opportunity to master a business that is supporting thousands of families in this nation. The proper care and marketing of chickens and their eggs is a particular and intensive study. In the institution laundry, boys learn by doing this important work. In the laundry all the garments of the school population are washed, dried, and ironed. An experienced laundryman teaches this very steady and remunerative business. The boys in the patch room department have patched, remade, and repaired 19,520 garments in 24 months. Our spacious gymnasium gives excellent opportunity for indoor recreational exercises. Volley ball and basket ball are the leading games played. Last winter a carefully planned and executed tour - nament at basket ball instilled interest, excitement and athletic spirit into the minds of our boys. At the close the victors were liberally banqueted. On Sunday afternoon at 2:40 the chapel auditorium is used for religious services. Sermons are delivered by the leading ministers of Kearney. During the nine months of the year, commencing the first week in September, talking moving pictures on each Wednesday evening are displayed for the boys. The best pictures are shown and much enjoyment is had. In the trades building a large central dining room accommodates all the boys of the school while they partake of their meals under the supervision of officers, both ladies and gentlemen, who aid each boy quietly but sociably to enjoy his full share of healthful, nourishing food. A State Dietitian, through the institution matron, through the cooks outline the menus and prepare the foods. 143 </seg>
            <seg id="p148">The boys of this school are trained to practice correct habits in the hope that they will continue the practice throughout their lives. Wholesome play is supervised and encouraged. Cleanliness is de - manded. By team work in athletics, by properly arranged competition, by careful parole supervison, by inspirational talks, by correct work relationships, by religious instruction in Sunday School and Church, Nebraska's Industrial School is earnestly attempting to build up a citizenship that will be a resource to our government of state and nation. Worthy citizenship and actual spirituality are the high ideals of this school. Truthfulness is fostered among the boys by the material short - ening of institution time when constancy in this virtue is recorded. The development of trustworthiness is promoted in like manner. The institution trees, lawns, and white buildings are pleasing to the eye. Sanitation is closely watched and sought. Heartily do I thank you, my coworkers, probation officers, judges and executive officers, for all aid, help and encouragement, in this important work with boys. To the Honorable Members of the Board of Control, 1 express genuine thanks for all aid, helpfulness, and cooperation. Respectfully submitted, R. V. CLARK, Superintendent. j 144 </seg>
            <seg id="p149">REPORT OF THE PAROLE DEPARTMENT Herewith is submitted the report of the Parole Department of le State Industrial School covering the work done during the two ear period beginning July 1,1935 and ending June 30, 1937. To place properly eligible boys on parole and thereafter to sup - rvise their conduct to the extent that they may continue in the ex - ellent training and development received in the school ; are the ims and duties of the parole department. During the two year period 275 boys were placed on parole, 38 in homes throughout the state and 37 in homes out of the state. )f the 275 boys 240 were in the school for the first time, 30 were ere for the second time and 5 were here for the third time. 47 oys were paroled by the order of the Board of Pardons. A case record is kept of each boy entering the institution. The lay a boy enters the school a history of his home, and his home sur - oundings, and home conditions is begun. All available information s gained concerning a boy's home through welfare workers, county •fficals and others interested in this work. Long before a boy is eady to go on parole the parole department has a record of the gen - ial home conditions. Several weeks before a boy actually leaves he school the parole officer make a final investigation of the home nd completes the parole arrangement with the boy'* parents or arties who assume the responsibility of the parole. This final ar - angement is carried on by a personal visit to the boy's home where ic exact prerequi sites and future parole conditions can be investi - ated. A slight improvement has been noted in the demand for boys &gt; work on farms. It is hoped, as conditions improve, more and lore homes will be open to boys desiring to live and work on arms. Nebraska being an agricultural state it is natural to look &gt; the farms as the source of opportunities for those boys seeking a velihood from the soil. . During the past two years 69 boys were 145 </seg>
            <seg id="p150">placed in new farm homes in addition to those boys going back tc their own farm homes. Good farm homes are always in demand Board, room and a satisfactory wage are asked for each boy. The parole officer has made 250 home investigations previous t( the actual paroling of the boys from the institution. A large per centage of the homes is found unsatisfactory for various reasons Many homes are found favorable but a system of supervised parr* must built up within the home and in the community in which a bo} lives. In such cases other responsible parties are relied upon prof&gt; erly to supervise the boy. By a personal investigation a closer feel ing of cooperation is built up between the parents and the school The success of any parole is in proportion to the understanding ant cooperation of the three parties included in the parole agreement namely the boy, the parents, and the parole officer. By working to gether much can be accomplished. Valuable assistance has beei received from the many county officials and welfare workers throughout Nebraska. All have been generous in their time anc help. It is through this splendid help that boys are kept on the righ path growing into good citizens. Boys are placed on parole for a four month probationary peri od. At the end of this four month period the parole officer visits the boy, the boy's sponsor, and any other individuals interested ir the boy; to ascertain the feasibility of establishing the parole on!': permanent basis. If the proper recommendations are made by th&lt; parties interested, and the boy is making satisfactory progress, th&lt; parole is sanctioned and continued until the boy is discharged frotr parole by age or by law. Violation of parole cause a boy's retun to the institution. An individual parole officer is secured for all boy: going on parole. It is the duty of this individual parole officer t&lt; be interested in the boy's -welfare, to endorse the monthly parole re port, and to keep the parole department informed as to the boy's uel fare. Parole supervision of the boys on parole is handled by means b monthly reports to, and visits by, the parole officer. Each individ ual on parole must report monthly. Every boy on parole, in addi tion to being paroled to a responsible party, must have a secont sponsor or friendly advisor, who will take an active interest in sak boy. The friendly advisor interviews the boy at different intervals endorses his monthly parole report, before it is sent to the school! 146 </seg>
            <seg id="p151">and acts as an added check in safe-guarding his conduct and behav - ior. In such a manner a check is had in his home, and the communi - ty in which he lives. In Omaha and Lincoln, city probation officers check each monthly report of boys paroled to these cities. Such a plan is beneficial, causing a closer adherence by boys to the parole agreement and fewer parole violations. Boys on parole the first year must report monthly. After being on parole one year, quarter - ly reports are required. After being on parole two years, semi-an - nual reports are required until the boy reaches maturity. When a boy fails to report, immediate inquiry is made by the parole officer as to the cause of the failure. This close check on each paroled boy has produced a marked decrease in parole violations and has proven helpful and beneficial. 497 visits to the paroled boys have been made by the parole of - ficer. The extent of territory to be covered and the scattered loca - tion of homes compels visiting to be done in a systematic manner. The system of an "individual parole officer" for each paroled boy provides a thorough and satisfactory means of supervision. Parolee is interviewed at least quarterly by the parole officer in addition to the monthly interview by "individual parole officers." There are 349 boys on parole from this school between the ages 10 and 21 years. These paroled boys are located in Nebraska and a few neighboring states. 209 of these boys are on our active parole list. 140 are on our inactive list or among those required to report at longer intervals. The duration of reporting is determined by the faithfulness and regularity of the boy, in making his designated re - ports. Eacii year many paroled boys reach 21 years of age, and arc automatically discharged. The work of parole rates in importance with the training at the institution. Only by thorough follow-up work and efficient super - vision of boys on parole can the institution training bcome perman - ent. It is the desire and purpose of the parole officer ever to be helpful to paroled boys. Respectfully submitted, E. H. SCHINDLER, Parole Officer. 147 </seg>

During the past two years our medical work has been greatly increased and the facilities for the care of patients have developed steadily. Last year we gave eight hundred seventy pneumothorax treat - ments, and this year one thousand five hundred sixty-one. During this year 5 cases have been bilateral. We gave our first pneumo - thorax in February 1926 and during that year 113 treatments were given ; in 1927, 91 treatments; in 1928, 183 treatments; in 1929, 227 treatments; in 1930, 149 treatments; in 1931, 169 treatments; in 1932, 127 treatments; inl933, 421 treatments; in 1934, 245 treatents; and in 1935, 469 treatments. During this year we have done 27 phrenic interruptions. Last year we did 17, making a total of 44 during this biennium. During the previous biennium we did 11. We have had average results with phrenic operations and pneumothorax collapse therapy as judged by patients becoming bacilli free. We have used lipidol in a number of cases of bronchiectasis for diagnosis and treatment with usual results. Ultra-violet light treat - ments have continued in many cases, with approximately 2,000 treat - ments during the biennium. Light is used in abdominal, laryngeal, skin and other extra pulmonary tuberculosis where the lung condition does not contraindicate such treatment. Other surgical procedures done during the past year are as fol - lows : appendectomies, 2 ; casts applied, 3 ; ganglion removed, 1 ; in - grown toe nail removed, 1 ; keloids removed, 1 ; oophorcctomy, I ; partly expelled fetus removed, 1 ; rectal abscesses drained, 6 ; rectal cyst removed, 1; tonsillectomies, 5; wart removed, 1. Seven acci- 159 </seg>
            <seg id="p164">dents required surgical care, namely, scalp wounds, 2 ; knee injury, 1 ; finger cut, 1 ; iris and cornea cut with glass, 1 ; fractured bones in foot, 1 ; fractured radius, 1. The following special treatments were done during the year : de - compressions in air cases, 9 ; oxyperitoneum, 6 ; spinal punctures, 9 ; thoracentesis with and without irrigation, 86 in 15 cases; neo arsph - enamine treatments 48 in 6 cases. We use care in selecting cases for treatment as neo arsphenamfne causes exacerbations in some cases of tuberculosis. i Last year 175 differential blood counts were made, and this year 482; last year 101 Wassermans and this year 252 with 13 positives. Previously few sedimentation tests have been done, but during the past year we have made 481 sedimentations. The number of sputum examinations last year was 700 and this year 2,238. Last year we did 997 urine examinations and this year 1,129. We have done other laboratory work from time to time as indicated, including ex - amination of pleural fluid, blood sugars, gastric analysis, spinal fluid examinations, sputum cultures for fungi and tubercle bacilli. Last Fall, from the Milford Institution we obtained a second - hand dressing and instrument sterilizer which we have used almost constantly since. We have bought some new equipment for the operating room and more instruments, and on March 25th of this year we increased our nursing staff by the addition of a surgical nurse. i We are taking many more x-rays. During the year ending July 1, 1934 we made 240 chest x-rays. The following year 200; last year 285 and for the year ending July 1, 1937, 436. A few months ago we purchased a coryllius thoracoscope and have used this on 4 occasions on 2 patients. As yet we have no special report on intra-pleural pneumolysis, but I am glad to say that one of these patients has shown very marked improvemnt. We plan on doing more of this kind of work this coining year. During the past year each new patient has reported to the denist as a matter of routine. Dental x-rays were taken in 28 cases. 256 extractions were done, 141 fillings and 4 sets of dentures were made, beside cleaning, treatments and other necessary dental work. As usual we have been giving special attention to the repair and improvement of the physical plant. We have done as much or more 160 </seg>
            <seg id="p165">han we ordinarily do. Many of these things are small in extent. I vill not enumerate them as they are too numerous. In spite of a record breaking hot dry summer last year we pro - luced practically all of our fresh vegetables for summer and fall ise and canned a total of 3,211 quarts. We also stored some car - ots, cabbage, parsnips and potatoes (both sweet and Irish) for vinter use. I desire to express my appreciation to various individuals, firms ind organizations that have given of their time and money for the jood of our patients. In concluding this report I desire to express my appreciation or the support and cooperation given me by the officers and em - )loyees ofjthe Hospital. I wish also to thank the Board of Control or the kindness that they have shown me at all times and for their lelp aria cooperation in all matters. I can assure you that it is horoughly appreciated. Respectfully submitted, L. T. SIDWELL, M. D. Superintendent. 161 </seg>

            <seg id="p177">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I herewith submit the Sixteenth Biennial Report of the Orth - opedic Hospital for the period beginning July 1st, 1935 and ending June 30lh, 1937. During this period there have been 311 new pa - tients and 404 returned parole patients enter the hospital for treat - ment. There were 473 surgical operations 1,587 observations, 698 casts applied, 400 braces ordered and fitted, 1,124 x-rays taken, and 1,101 parole patients seen in the clinic. A glance at the above fig - ures will reveal that much work was done and many patients cared for during the past two years. Several changes in the personnel of the hospital occurred since July 1st, 1935. Over half of the nurse aides have resigned to accept better positions elsewhere. On a whole, it is becoming more diffi - cult to obtain suitable help on account of the low salaries offered. As far as possible, general repairs and improvements were made throughout the hospital buildings, nurse's home, and engine plant. In the Administration building the floors of the small boys' and girls' ward as well as the floors of the program room were re - finished and ,the walls redecorated. The walls and floors of the various rooms were refinished and the outside of the Administration building was repainted. All the hospital beds, bed stands, and chairs were repainted. Redecorating was done throughout the buildings where the need was greatest. Parts of the engine plant and ice ma - chinery have been overhauled and are in better condition than they have been for several years. No new buildings were under con - struction except a new fire proof paint shop was built on the already existing coal storage walls. This addition fills a great and urgent need especially on account of the fire hazard in connection with the old paint shop which had to be abandoned. In December 1936, the elevator shaft and the installation of a new Otis elevator was completed. This long awaited help was great- 173 </seg>
            <seg id="p178">ly appreciated by all and relieved the tremendous task of aiding the children up and down the runways. N6 one except those who did the work realized how much work and time it took to convey the children up and down from one floor to another. A great improvement resulted from the tearing down of the old Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital building, and we are in great need of a modern new structure to supplant this building so as to afford more hospital beds, school rooms, an auditorium, swimming pool, and much needed apartment rooms for employees. The crowded tondition of our employees is critical and some provision should be made to aleviate the situation. An effort has been made to keep the hospital grounds present - able to the public and it is hoped that each year they may be more attractive. During the last half of this biennium, considerable aid was given by the Crippled Children's Division of the State Child Welfare Uu - reau, in helping the return of former patients and paying for the ap - pliances which the parents were unable to furnish. They were also instrumental in bringing new patients to the hospital and in helping with the care after the patient left the institution. By coordinating the services, better follow-up work can be done and more can be ac - complished during a given period. I wish to thank the various clubs, societies, business houses, and private individuals for their gifts and interest in the patients of the Orthopedic Hospital. We are thankful to the Governor, State Legislature, Hoard of Control, and others, who are concerned with the welfare of this in - stitution, for the appropriations and the helpful acts in our behalf.

            <seg id="p189">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I hereby submit for your approval the biennial report of the Nebraska State Penitentiary, Lincoln, Nebraska, for the period end - ing June 30, 1937. We have done considerable painting during the past year. We have painted the hospital, inmates dining room, dining room base - ment, administration building and guards kitchen. We have paper - ed and painted the Deputy Warden's apartment and painted the Warden's house on the inside. The new dairy barn is almost completed and we are beginning to fill the silos at the present time. We have reinforced the outside wall on the west which was in bad condition. We have removed and replanted trees to establish a new parking space for cars. Up - on doing this we have removed the cars from the street in front of the institution. This has always been a hindrance as the street is narrow on each side of the parking. The old laundry was moved to its new location in the old shop building and remodeled at an expenditure of approximately $5,000. The building once occupied by the laundry has been torn down inas - much as it has been condemned. If we are to have a Ten Year Building Plan I would like to recommend the following items for your careful consideration : We should have an outside dormitory and kitchen to take care of two hundred inmates working at various jobs on the outside of the institution during the summer months. This building should be constructed as soon as possible to eliminate the possible clanger of passing this large number of men in an out of the gates daily. Our power plant furnishes power for the State Capitol Build - ing, Orthopedic Hospital, State Hospital, and State Reformatory as 185 </seg>
            <seg id="p190">i well as the many needs here at the Penitentiary. We have a modern and nicely constructed power plant and during the coming months we will require various additions to run in its present efficiency. The prison water supply is far from adequate and I suggest that you consider connecting the Penitentiary with the plant at the Lincoln State Hospital. We should have a steel gate for the front of the institutioin and do away with this open system we have now. There should be a gate at the front where a guard would be stationed to find out the business of each person who desires to enter the Penitentiary. Our institution is one of a very few in the United States that has the open front allowing anyone to come up to the turnkey without any questioning. There should also be a receiving room for freight and express at the East Gate. The Railway company will deliver our freight to the institution if there is a receiving room. This would eliminate many trips to town each day as our freight is very heavy. We take this means of expressing our thanks to the Honorable Board of Control and to the Governor for their kind cooperation in handling the affairs of the institution during the past year. Respectfully submitted, JOSEPH O'GRADY, Warden. ■■•■■"■■•"' \ 186 </seg>

            <seg id="p207">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. We hereby submit the Twenty-Sixth Biennial .Report of the Nebraska Industrial Home for the period beginning July 1, 1935 and ending June 30, 1937. During this period we have cared for 146 girls and 92 babies. There have been 41 babies discharged with the mother, 5 without, 38 in temporary homes, 1 babe was trans - ferred to another institution, and 1 babe died. We also lost 1 moth - er, the first mother since 1930. We consider this a remarkable record. The girls that are afflicted with syphilis and gonorrhea are put immediately under treatment. The two babes born of the syphilitic mothers have both shown negative Wassermans. Upon entering the Home the girl's application blank is signed, she is then taken to the sewing department where she is fitted out in the clothing which the state furnishes; she is then turned over to the nurse and is directed about her bathing, given a shampoo, and instructions of how to care for herself. The doctor takes her Wasserman, a smear, and she is given a Mantoux test. If this test is positive, an x-ray of her chest is taken to ascertain whether or not she is now a tubercular patient. A thorough examination is made of teeth and tonsils. If there is any physical defect and any chance, whatsoever, of remedying it, this is also done. The girl is assigned to a task such as her physical and mental ability will permit. She is trained under efficient supervisors in our different departments. If we find a girl especially fitted for some particular line of work, we encourage her in every way possible to follow this up. Our detail work is divided into periods of eight weeks each. Cleanliness, accuracy, dependability, neatness, punctuality are es - pecially stressed. We endeavor to have each girl realize that she is building her own record, not only during the time she is in the Home but for the 203 </seg>
            <seg id="p208">day that she again takes her place in society. Fifty per cent of our girls have Jcept their children during this biennium. Our girls are greatly interested in our Sunday School, Young People's Meeting, and the preaching services. If at any time a mother wishes her babe baptized and her own pastor can come, or he recommends some one else, this privilege is always freely granted. Our ambition is to help the girl to become stronger in her own chosen faith. No one denomination is stressed. We have no means of entertainment only what the girls, them - selves, can supply. Special plans are made bv the supervisors to have any holiday an outstanding one. The training of the girls has been in housework, preparation and serving of meals, all types of laundry work, sewing, proper care and feeding of children. In our sewing department, every girl that is mentally capable has been taught to cut and fit garments, and each one has made her own outgoing wardrobe aside from helping with those who are not able to do so. Of the 88 admissions in this biennium, 70 have come voluntari - ly, 15 court commitments and 3 transferred from other institutions. The health of the population has been very good indeed. Since we are not taking the general public into our nurseries, we do not have epidemics. The tables at the close of the report will show what has been accomplished in our various departments. The following improvements have been made: repair of roofs on all buildings, contracts have been let for painting the outside of the hospital and 2 main buildings and laundry, floor covering for the office and 1 hall, one new rug, abutments have been placed under the North Building, reinforcing the floor, milk room cement floor repair - ed, fire escape on South Building rebuilt. I wish to express my appreciation to the members of the Board of Control for the help they have given us. I also desire to thank the members of my statf for their able assistance and untiring efforts in making this a happy, worthwhile home for each girl. Respectfully submitted, M. EVELYN MEYER, Superintendent. 204 </seg>

            <seg id="p219">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. This report covers the activities and program of the Nebraska School for the Blind, Nebraska City, Nebraska, for the period be - ginning July 1, 1935 to June 30, 1937. The first year of the bien - nium was noteworthy on account of the severe epidemics which attacked our institution and interfered greatly with the program of our school. The second was practically free from sickness so that the two years stand out in contrast in this matter of health. Proba - bly the worst in this regard was followed by the best, or at least one of the best. During the first year we had a total enrollment of thirty boys and thirty- four girls. We regard- it as very remarkable since always in previous years the boys had predominated, frequently the number of boys and girls being in a ratio three to two. During the second year the predominance of girls over boys in the matter of enrollment was still more noticeable, since the records show that twenty-nine boys matriculated as against thirty-nine girls. In the first year the ratio was as forty-seven to fifty-three per cent and the second year as forty-two to fifty-eight per cent. What reason there is that more girls should now need the service of this school than boys is not un - derstood by me. Yet it is probably some fundamental cause as this same phenomenon is observable in other institutions within the United States. There is no question but what the ratio of defective vision between male and female is shifting. This has caused a re - arrangement in quarters for the boys and girls and I anticipate that we shall have to continue this present plan unless some unforeseen cause arises. During the biennial period we have enrolled seventy - nine different pupils which is a high number, the largest in all of the years of my tenure as superintendent. We close the biennium with the same corps of instructions as we had at the beginning, save that we have had Miss Margaret Hoshor 215 </seg>
            <seg id="p220">as the special teacher of Helen Siefert during the last year. Thit has been due to the organization of a special deaf-blind departmeni of which I shall speak later. We graduated from our regular high school course one boy am two girls during this last year. The following are the five graduates during the biennium : Class of 1936: Charles Borden, Lincoln County; Ewalc Warnsholz, Seward County. Class of 1937: Elsie Eberhardt, York County; Marlin Flock- Frontier County, Virginia Staunton, Jefferson County. In earlier reports I have spoken of our effort to give our pupil? not alone the subjects which come in the course of study but extra - curricular activities; as well which broaden them and help them in their contacts after leaving our school. Our pupils have continued to attend the movie theater, the older ones who have such a desire be - ing permitted to go approximately once each week. In this wt have had the generous permission of Mr. W. W. Booth, the owner of one of the large cinema houses. Parties have been arranged by the teachers and instructions given as to proper social behavior. Camp fire groups have carried out programs. Our children have sung in churches and took an active part in the singing festival at Syracuse What I have given in particular is broadly representative of the whole scheme and attitude. Under our general school set-up we have daily convocations on what are known as the regular school days from 8:00 to 8:20 each morning. On Sunday mornings there is the regular Sunday Schoo in lieu thereof. Our convocation period is devoted more frequently to reading passages from the scriptures than to any other one sub - ject but we are not limited to this. Teachers are encomaged to bring in special work done by students. What stands out in the work of one class may be interesting to our whole group. Some days the superintendent feels should be devoted to counsel and admonition. Every other week it was planned that a local preacher of the ministerial association should act as chaplain. All of these provisions have kept this morning exercise from becoming sterotyped and formal. State and national holidays have been given special attention with programs consisting of songs, instrumental selections, readings, 216 </seg>
            <seg id="p221">dramatic scenes and talks on various leaders and inspiring patriots. Each year our school plants trees and naturally since we are located at the source of Arbor Day, we extol the benefits of arboriculture beauty. Mr. L. L. Coryell has continued his interest in our school by the regular presentation of money for the children to secure pleasures which they could not think of otherwise. He has provided trips for teachers and done innumberable kindnesses for many of our people. In September we received Helen Siefert and Elmer Meglemre under the terms of the special appropriation made by the Legislature. Each had a special teacher. It was soon found out that Elmer could not make headway and the Board of Control removed him to the institution at Beatrice. Helen Siefert, under the painstaking and devoted care of Miss Margaret Hoshor has made splendid progress. She has given a number of demonstrations over the state. Helen is primarily a manual student and it is anticipated that a year at the New York Institute for the Education of the Blind will develop her more rapid - ly than remaining in her native state. After a year of work in the great city it is expected that our little girl will return and remain for the concluding years of her student work at our school. It has been deemed wise by the Board of Control to place all of the teachers in our school on a basis of certification equal to that of the teachers in the public schools. We are complying with the wishes of the Board in this respect and will have all of our teachers so accreditied at the time of the opening of school in September. The biennium closes with our property looking the best in many years. In this spirit I send greetings to the Board of Control and to the Governor and thanks for helpfulness and cooperation. Respectfully yours, N. C ABBOTT, Superintendent. 217 </seg>

            <seg id="p231">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I beg to submit herewith the Thirty-fourth Biennial Report of he Nebraska School for the Deaf, covering the period of the school's ictivities from July 1, 1935 to June 30, 1937. The school was started in 1869, in Omaha, and had an attend - mce of twelve pupils in its first year. The attendance during the jast biennium reached a total of 247, of which number 205 were in school on the closing day in June. The approximate ratio of the leaf to the hearing in the state, country, and world population is one leaf in every two thousand persons, and the ratio necessarily prevails imong children of school age. In the history of the school, covering a period of 68 years,1392 mpils have received of its benefits, of this number, 284 have gradu - ited, 205 are still on the school roll, and 903 have left school after :aking limited courses. Our school course carries pupils, entering at the age of five or six years, through fifteen grades, beginning in the preparatory de - partment, where they spend three years, then passing into the regular grades, twelve in number, and graduating in the twelfth grade. The course of study embraces the branches usually taught in the elementary and grammar schools, with a number of high school studies subject to change, as the peculiar wants of the deaf child re - quire. The school strives to keep abreast of the progressive spirit of the age and nothing is left out of the course of study that will be o f jenefit to the child. Every deaf child is given an opportunity as far as possible to learn speech and lip reading. Every possible effort is made to encourage and promote speech. Those who qualify and desire a ligher education are prepared for admission %q Gallaudet College, Washington, D. C. 227 </seg>
            <seg id="p232">228 Vocational training of the child is carefully considered at I early age. The child is given an opportunity to express his lil|e and dislikes of the basic vocational art subjects, and his backgrouo and abilities are studied to determine what occupation or trade h or she might best take up as a life work \ Several subjects are give at the school, such as cabinet-making, carpentry, cement finishing painting, printing, art, drafting, handicraft, domestic science, cfo mestic art, laundry, . janitor training, gardening, farm-mechanics barbenng, and typewriting. In addition, a child may his last yea in school, through the "work-study plan," be given an opportunity*, learn a desired trade not offered in our school, such as watch repaid ing, shoe repairing, dry cleaning, etc., should it seem advisabfe Shop or trade language is stressed at all times. An extra curricular program for the children is carefully plat ned and sponsored by competent persons, some of the most populk activities being the Social Clubs, Literary Clubs, Boy Scouts, Can? Fire Girls, Aero-Club, Young People's Meetings, the Student Coufr cil, and regular school parties. The health of the child is carefully guarded at all times J regularly employed doctor and a nurse take care of the usual chili ailments, and each child is given a physical and dental examinatioi at least once each year, usually as soon after entering school a possible. Every child participates in an intermural or athletic pro gram if he is physically able,.under the guidance of competent teacE ers. The physical development goes hand in hand with the menk development. Our school is a member of the Nebraska State Hit School Athletic Association; and our boys compete with "hearij boys" in competitive sports, such as football, basketball, track, etc! During the past two years, considerable improvements to build ings and grounds have been made by workers furnished by the W.I A. This organization furnishes workers, while the state furnishe all materials needed and used. Our school building, erected in 1929, is still lacking a wing o unit, to complete it. The original architect's plan includes this unit and the completed building would provide ten additional schoo rooms and an assembly room, all much needed for carrying on th school work successfully. At present, ten of our twenty-thre classes occupy rooms in other buildings, rooms not intended for us </seg>
            <seg id="p233">229 is school rooms, therefore not adapted to securing the best results, t is hoped that the next session of the legislature will provide for :ompleting the school building, making it possible to bring all school :lasses then into one building, securing advantages not now available. In conclusion I wish to thank the Board of Control for the in - erest it has taken in the work of the school, and especially for pro - viding a new Audiometer for testing the hearing of each child as well is a new Audiphone with ten head sets to aid in speech correction, ind necessary equipment and material for adding barbering, art, ypewriting, drawing, and physical education to our course of study. Money was made available for a summer school session at our insti - ution for children with defective speech. At this report is compiled, he school has been in operation only one month. It is impossible to evaluate this service in this report. The eagerness with which the :hildren accept the instruction offered indicates that much may be iccomplished. Also I want to express appreciation of the faithful service of the teachers, officers, and helpers who have contributed 50 much toward the success of this school. Respectfully submitted, J. W. JACKSON, Superintendent. </seg>

Also when the crime com - mitted is a felony, the convicted woman may be sentenced to the Reformatory. 238 </seg>
            <seg id="p243">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I have the honor to submit the following Biennial Report of the State Reformatory for Women, covering the period ending June The object of the Reformatory for Women, whose establish - ment was authorized by the Legislature of 1919, is to "furnish a suitable home, proper care, education and training in the industrial arts, to enable women convicted of crimes to fit themselves for use - ful lives." It is our greatest desire to accomplish each of the above objects in a manner highly approved by you. In providing a suitable home, we stress clean and wholesome meals, clean rooms, clean bodies and clean thoughts. The population has responded to these in- a very commendable manner. It has also been a great joy to have on our staff a new member as spiritual director, who not only preaches and teaches but comforts many who have lost faith. The girls may come to their recreation room at regular times each day. Misconduct bars them from this privilege. Good books and good magazines are provided. There too, they listen to the radio, knit, or do art work of their own. In order that they have proper care physically, we have Dr. Stewart Bell of York as physician. He is assisted by a graduate nurse, who spends full time at the institution. During the two years which this report covers, 64 cases of venereal diseases have been successfully treated, and 13 babies of syphilitic mothers delivered. In addition to this, Dr. Bell has rendered fine cooperation in reliev - ing many by operations. Since we have inadequate hospitalizatioti it is necessary to use the local hospital for general operations. We need a hospital which should be provided for us when conditions permit. We have appreciated so much the splendid cooperation of Dr. Nielsen, Superintendent of the Hastings State Hospital, in pro - viding psychiatric treatment. 239 </seg>
            <seg id="p244">240 The education and training in industrial art have been greatly appreciated by most! of the population. Classes in music, home nursing and care of the sick, and home economics are conducted. The dairy barn has been painted on the interior by the girls and much pride is being displayed in its care. The chickens too have done well and in this industry we are guided by bulletins and suggestions from the State Agricultural College, thus using the benefit of knowledge acquired by actual 1 experiments. The sewing is supervised by a sewing instructor. We are delighted to have been permitted to make 7,522 garments for other institutions. This with our own sewing, a total of 11,472 articles has not only provided work but has been a means of making a small amount of money. The gardening, even with the odds against it, has been of some help. Each kitchen has a very fine ,work table made by the Prison Indus - tries. These add greatly to the appearance and convenience of the kitchens. The girls have cooked and served several luncheons. The proceeds to be used in a manner approved by you. The girls have learned much from these experiences for quite a few have been fortunate enough to be placed in a home where they would need to know some of the refinements of domestic art. We are looking forward to the installing of a new disposal plant and the completion of our new well. For both of these we express our gratitude. It is the plan of this institution at all times, to release the ones committed to our care in the best possible condition. We have been able with the assistance of the Child Welfare Bureau, to find very fine homes for a number of the younger girls, and to them we are grateful. And to you and the many, including my entire staff, who have given such fine cooperation in the past year, I express my sincere appreciation. Respectfully submitted, BLANCHE M. CLOUSE Superintendent. </seg>

            <seg id="p257">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I present herewith the Biennial Report of the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children for the period ending June 30, 1937. We have received 147 new children into our Home and 207 have gone out into new homes during these past two years. Many have found permanent homes by adoption, others have had personal in - terest given them in free homes. Older boys and girls have been happy in wage homes. Our children have responded well, develop - ing into persons with every indication of good citizenship. It has been most encouraging to note the response made by the children to the care and interest which has been made possible for them by the State of Nebraska. &gt; When these children come to us, they are oftentimes poorly nourished, with many resultant effects apparent from their past modes of living. Some have been pushed about in their local com - munities until they are timid, and afraid. We try to overcome all this. The normal attitude di the children toward everyday life, and the happy expressions upon their faces after they have been at the Home for a time, are often commented upon by visitors. We try to make our institution as much a normal home as it is possible for an institution to be that. We engage caretakers and workers of a high type. They are well educated; they love children, are understanding and sympathetic, and are sensitive to the needs of childhood. Our children do the things that children do in the average homes today. They have parties, inviting their friends from church, school, and everyday life. They belong to clubs, Hi Y, Girl Re - serves, etc. They are allowed to attend all school functions, taking an active part. Many of our boys and girls hold offices in these associations. They meet people often and well. They have their home get-togethers, make candy, pop com, listen to the radio, play 251 </seg>
            <seg id="p258">the piano, dance, sing, and read. Some boy is always in the process of taking his radio apart or putting it together. They fuss and quarrel as other families do, but we are told by visitors and neigh - bors, and, of course, we believe it, that there is less of it according to the number of children than in the average neighborhood. Per - haps there is more understanding developed than we find elsewhere many times. Homes broken by death or otherwise furnish the background from which our children come. They naturally are under a strong emotional strain. They enter our school where others are in this emotional state, or have recovered their balance from it. Because of this, understanding and companionship are found. The girls are taught all phases of house work and home life as much as possible. The older boys live on a farm and do truck gardening and farming. In this manner these children are given opportunities that have many times been denied them in their local communities because of the social position of the family. By participation in these activities they gain self-confidence and 'poise. The health of our children is given particular attention. It is our idea that many a child has been called, or may become, a problem because of a health condition. He may have been slow and accused of being dull because of a physical defect that medical science can remedy. We have a medical staff manned by some of Lincoln's best physicians. A pediatrician is at our service day or night. He makes tri-weekly calls and is chairman of the staff. An eye, ear, nose, and throat specialist has given attention to the needs of our children with the highest degree of efficiency. He calls regularly once each week and receives us in his office at any time. A gyne - cologist calls at*, the institution and receives us at his office at any time. A surgeon calls for consultation, makes examinations and cares for the major surgery. A registered nurse is in charge of the nursery, keeps medical charts, and supervises the nursing of all illness in the institution. Our small hospital unit has been vecy use - ful for minor operations, isolation, etc. For the past biennium we have maintained an eight grade school. The course of study for Nebraska rural schools is followed but modified to meet the needs of the institution particularly to meet the need for more individual instruction. A very close relationship is had with this course of study and yet it is tempered to meet the 252 </seg>
            <seg id="p259">individual child. Shop is taught as an extra activity, to all boys in and above the' fifth grade. Sewing is taught in the same grades to the girls. Art and music are stressed. An operetta as well as several other programs are given by the school each year. The needs of our children could better be met by this system, seemingly, than by any other. Our first venture into this part of the work was the "room for individual instruction," started in 1931. This proved much more valuable than our fondest hopes and gave us courage to reach out for a school that would give to. our children that parti - cular intangible something they so much needed. The extra activities of the school are various. In the past year field trips have been made to the State Capitol, Morrill Hall, Gooch's Mill, Arbor Lodge at Nebraska City, Peru Normal, the Lincoln Water Works at Ashland, and the State Fisheries at Louisville. May Day was observed by outdoor sports and festivities. High school children attend the public high schools and the Teachers' College High at Nebraska University. These children take part in most school activities. The boys play on the baseball, basketball, and football teams. Some take part in chorus. This last year one boy entered the state music contest in vocal solo work and was rated "Excellent ;" one girl sang in a sextette, rating "Excellent ;" six sang in a chorus, making the same rating, and one girl played in the orchestra. We have been much helped in planning our school work the past year 1 by the assistance and encouragement given by Mr. Harold G. Salter, director of education for the Board of Control. I wish to express appreciation to the corps of workers for their untiring efforts and loyalty. Without this the work accomplished would have been impossible. To the members of the Board of Control, I express my appreciation for 4 their personal interest and the consideration given to our problem. Respectfully submitted, EFFIE J. MOUDEN, Superintendent. 253 </seg>

            <seg id="p273">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I have the honor to present herewith my first, but it is the Eighth Biennial Report of the State Reformatory for Men, for the period beginning July 1, 1935 and ending June 30, 1937. Complete financial and statistical tables are included. Following the death of our highly respected first superintendent, the late A. W. Miller which occured on November 11, 1935, I was promoted to superintendent and with the cooperative help of all offi - cers and employees of this institution, we are making an honest ef - fort to help Nebraska's first offenders regain their' self respect and better prepare them to return to good and useful citizenship. Ralph A. Johnson, who was our steward, was promoted to assistant superintendent and Mr. Lynn Cunningham from Gurley, Nebraska, was appointed steward. The general health of our inmates is good. Each inmate as he enters the institution is given a thorough physical examination by our regular physician, Dr. B. A. Finkle. Correctional treatment is started at once if needed. Emergency operations are taken care of, some in our hospital quarters, but the more serious cases are taken to the Orthopedic Hospital. We are, however, very much handi - capped in giving specialized treatment for eye, ear, nose, and throat ailments, as well as bad teeth. Our major improvement this biennium is our new water line, a 10" cast iron main from the Lincoln State Hospital to our new meter station, with 8" main to the barn and Administration Building, and 6" main supplying water to the other buildings. We have in - stalled eight fire hydrants with pumper connections, and have open - ings in main for five additional hydrants. Two hose carts equipped with new fire hose have been purchased. A fire squad has been appointed. A new high tension power line from the State Peniten- 267 </seg>
            <seg id="p274">268 tiary has given us arequate power and light. One new transformer for the lighting circuits, and three for the power circuits have been erected outside of our fence, all wires from the transformers to the distribution panels are underground. Rewiring of our shops has eliminated another fire hazard. Two refrigeration storage rooms with automatic controls have been added to our present ice machine. New china dishes have been secured for the inmate's dining room to replace the old alumi - num ware that has been in use for the past several years. This is a vast improvement and will give our dining room a more cheerful appearance. Other replacements are also necessary. Floors and windows are in need of repair. Our dairy herd is increasing steadily. We are now installing a creamery and will pasteurize all milk, then our surplus can be sup - plied to other institutions. We are also remodeling our cow barn, and building new cattle and calf sheds. A new horse barn has been completed. Owing to the loss of so many trees by drouth, we have started a nursery of seedling trees which is progressing very well. Our farm and garden crops for the season of 1936 were a com - plete failure, first the hail and then the severe drouth. However, this 1937 season we have farmed 1,088 acres, renting 1 the majority of the same on the share basis, and the crop outlook is favorable. Our early garden was good. The drouth of May and early June ruined our sweet corn and early beans, but the recent rains have given us prospect of a late garden crop. All surplus garden products are taken care of- in our canning factory. Our storage space is inadequate. Materials used for the auto license plates and road signs are purchased in large quantities. The finished plates have to be stored until time of delivery. Our canning factory supplies and products also have to be stored. The space we heretofore used has been remodeled to accommodate a portion of our creamery. Our license plate factory makes all automobile license plates, road signs, and hunting and fishing badges for the State of Ne - braska. This year we also will make the. automobile license plates for the State of Wyoming. We are very proud of this factory for it </seg>
            <seg id="p275">is a very modern and up-to-date place for our young men to work, gives them trade training and they receive some remuneration for their work. This is the only department where this is done. We should like facilities to institute more vocational and trade training for our young men. Our grade school is also in need of more equipment. All in - mates who have not finished the eighth grade are required to attend school part of each school day during the winter months. Our library is in need of new books. 'All of our books are very much worn but we try to keep them in repair. The new current magazine subscriptions which were authorized last year have been greatly appreciated. They are checked in and out of our library just as the books, but the demand is greater than the supply. We are thankful for the donations of used books from our friends. Our recreational program is a very important part of our daily schedule. Twilight baseball games are most popular. Almost every evening our entire population is at the bleachers. Visiting teams from the city often come out to compete. This season we. have also included soft ball and this has proved popular. It has encouraged many more boys to take an active part, as tournaments arc played between the different departments of the institution. Horse shoe is also a favorite, especially for the kitchen and dining room help, for they have the playground privilege whenever they are off duty. Football is played in season. Teams from the city come out to com - pete. A wonderful asset toj our institution is our sound projector movie machine. Our inmates prize their movie privilege and so it automatically serves as a disciplinary measure, together with being educational and entertaining. , Duringithe winter months the supervised activities are our or - chestra, harmonica band, glee club, and boxing. We have no avail - able space for a gymnasium room so outdoor basketball only can be played. Chapel services are held every Sunday afternoon with clergy - men from Lincoln churches in charge. All inmates cheerfully attend and derive much benefit from these services. Catholic Mass is held every Sunday with Catholic Chaplain, Father Przudzik, in charge. All of our boys of this' faith are administered to by him. The First 269 </seg>
            <seg id="p276">Church of Christ hold morning services here each Sunday and all who care to may attend this service. Rev. H. Erck, University Pastor of the Lutheran Church, has for the past several years during the fall and winter months, conducted a Bible class each Monday evening at this institution. This class is well attended and Rev. Erck has proved a real friend to our boys in spiritual guidance. He stands ready and willing to help whenever called upon. I am thankful to the Governor, and to members of the Board of Control, for the cooperation and helpful advice given me and my co - workers in meeting the many problems constantly coming before us. Respectfully submitted, H. W. JESPERSEN, Superintendent. 270 </seg>

            <seg id="p295">To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. The following report covering the activities of the Genoa State Farm from July 1, 1935 to June 30, 1937 is respectfully submitted. In accordance with the provisions of an act of the Senate of the United States on June 23, 1934, the Genoa Indian School, in - cluding land and buildings and all furniture and equipment remain - ing at the institution, was given to the State of Nebraska by the Federal Government. The property was accepted by the Fiftieth regular session of the Legislature in 1935 and designated as the Genoa State Hospital. Because funds were not made available to recondition the institution suitable for an insane hospital, it was not used for that purpose dur - ing the 1935-1937 biennium. In 1937 the first Unicameral Legislature designated the insti - tution as the Genoa State Farm to be used for the two-fold purpose of raising and processing agricultural products to be used in the other state institutions and to provide an outlet for some of the trusty in - mates from the State Penitentiary and Reformatory for Men. The property of the Genoa State Farm is divided into two separate tracts: the first contains 305 acres adjacent to the City of Genoa, Nebraska, on the east. The improvements on this tract con - sist of buildings for housing of inmates, dairy and horse barns, laundry and power house. In addition to the above buildings there are others now vacant that will be used at a later date for the housing of industries, such as canning, meat packing, vocational training, etc. The second tract of 325 acres is located five miles northwest of Genoa on Highway No. 39. We have developed an irrigation system on this farm and will use same for the raising of vegetables for other institutions as well as our own. There are adequate farm buildings on this farm with the exception of cattle and hog sheds. Two sheds 289 </seg>
            <seg id="p296">290 should be built to give protection to live stock in case of storms. Beaver Creek traverses the west boundary of this farm and affords ample water for live stock as; well as irrigation. Prior to the establishment of the Genoa State Farm the insti - tution property was operateq as a State Farm with five employees. Other than farming and stock feeding no work was done in the way of general repairs except as it became necessary to prevent deterio - ration of buildings, fences, windmills, etc. A survey of all buildings made in the month of May 1935 showed that of the 63 buildings, with the exception of 1 1 buildings, all showed roofs in more or less leaky condition, down spouting and gutters were also in a bad state of repair. We were successful in getting a project through the Works Progress Administration to take care of roofs and general repairs. Practically all roofs were renewed or repaired and painted, new gut - ters and down spouting was put on as well as drainage blocks at corners of buildings. It was necessary to replace all windmills, and practically all fences were rebuilt. Six hundred feet of sewer tile was salvaged from an unused line through the pasture and relaid to the dairy barns. Aii expenditure of over $5,000 was made for general repairs, including a new riser pipe to our water supply tank. Approximately 200 head of cattle and as many hogs were fed out and sent to Lincoln for butchering. This stock was fed out on cheap feeds such as molasses, rye, and silage. Good results were obtained and we topped the Omaha market with hogs that were fed out on barley, molasses and a little cotton seed cake and tankage. Hogs that cost from $7.76 to $8.40 per hundred, ready for market sold at from $10.10 to $10.65 per hundred. A small irrigation plant was installed at the West Farm in 1936 with good results. This plant was operated a total of 1,009 hours and the increase in production paid for the plant. A new irrigation system has been installed under a Works Progress Administration project. This plant is 80% complete at this time. Water is being pumped from Beaver Creek with a double suction 8" pump discharg - ing 1,800 gallons per minute. One hundred twenty acres are under ditch at this time and thirty acres more will be placed under the ditch in 1938. The supervision and engineering on this project was wholly from our own force. The total cost to the State of Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p297">braska, exclusive of W. P. A. funds, for the installation of this plant will not exceed $1,800. Many of the W. P. A. workers were farm - ers from this locality and I do not believe that we could have had any more satisfactory labor if they had been normally employed. Among other activities about 240 head of cattle were summered and about 80 head of cattle were wintered for other institutions. Also 90 head of heifers were grown from yearlings to dairy cows and sent to other State Institutions. We have suffered from drought the same as other localities in the State of Nebraska but by using substitute feeds we have been able to hold our costs down. The administration of the affairs of the institution are through the superintendent and an employed personnel of seven men ; these consist of a farmer, storekeeper and poultryman, gardener and can - nery supervisor, dairyman and trucker, day captain, assistant farmer, and farm laborer on the West Farm. It will be necessary to employ a general engineer and later on a night guard. Rules of conduct are laid down for the inmates as well as rules governing the care of stables, etc. We follow out very closely the rules and regulations governing an organization in the Regular Army of the United States. No bars are used and inmates are not restrict - ed except as to the area into which they are permitted to go. The morale is very good and we have very little trouble in governing the members. Church services are held each Sunday. Attendance is not compulsory but services are well attended. No funds have been allotted for the amusement of inmates and the recreation ( consists of fishing in the power canal and playing baseball. A large room has been equipped with a piano and radio which was left here by the Indian School. We have also subscribed for $25.00 worth of magazines. Normally the men are working 8 hours per day, S]/ 2 clays per week, unless an emergency makes it necessary for them to work longer hours. During the canning season it is necessary to work at night. In our relationship with the men we are considerate and fair in all things but firm and do not tolerate any infringement of rules and regulations. 291 </seg>
            <seg id="p298">t 292 With the use of inmate labor on a prison farm to produce articles required by the institutions, it will be possible enlarge upon our present activities and develop the following. This can be done with a great saving to the State of Nebraska and at the same time teach a useful occupation. It is recommended that the following activities be developed as rapidly as possible. PACKING PLANT: This packing plant should have a storage capacity for 400 head of cattle and 200 head of hogs. It is anticipated that 400 head of grass fattened cows would be : purchased in the fall of the year for immediate slaughter and storage. A like number of low cutters for feeding purposes would also be purchased to be butchered as fast as j the stored carcasses are moved out to other institutions. Home 1 ] grown hogs fattened after the cattle would also be butchered. Plans are now being prepared for remodeling one of the present commis - sary buildings to be Used for this purpose. TANNERY: In connection with the packing plant we should have a tannery to furnish leather for the Prison Industries. Hides are worth at this time 7 cents per pound and leather from 45 cents to 65 cents per pound. Butcher hides weigh from 45 to 50 pounds per hide. SOAP FACTORY: A small soap factor}' would take care of the non-edible fats and effect a saving. TANKAGE: A small tankage plant would take care of by-products which would be otherwise wasted. DAIRY AND CREAMERY: The daily consumption of butter at all institutions is 500 pounds. A dairy to take care of the needs of the institution and to furnish whole milk to the creamer}' should be maintained, but not to exceed 50 cows. The balance of the milk to operate the creamery could be purchased locally. If a creamery with a capacity of 250 pounds were installed, it would require the whole milk from 400 cows. If this milk was purchased locally, it would be a great benefit to the community. </seg>
            <seg id="p299">CHEESE: As proper temperature and humidity play a great part in the manufacture of cheese, there is no reason why we should not have a cheese factory since it is possible with the use of air conditioning ma - chinery to create practically any air condition. GARDENING: Gardening will be one of the major industries of this institution. With the additional land now leased it will be possible to have 180 acres under irrigation in 1938. If our garden crops are confined to the vegetables needed by the institutions, we should be able to furnish a large share of the staple canned goods to the various institutions. CANNING: A cannery has already been installed and is in operation. Used machinery was purchased and installed for the canning of corn, to - matoes, beets, string beans, etc. Additional machinery will be necessary for the canning of peas. The cannery has been installed with an idea as to the future needs of the institutions and additional machinery can be placed as it is required. SORGHUM MILL: * A sorghum mill will be borrowed this year and a test made on sorghum cane to determine the feasibility of planting a large acreage. We have an experimental tract of three acres planted to black amber sorghum cane. It is our intention to press this cane and cook the syrup in steam cookers. The pulp will be used for ensilage. APIARY: There is ample feed here in flowers and alfalfa to support all the bees we will require to furnish honey to all the institutions. POULTRY: It would be possible to raise all chicks necessary to supply all State Institutions. About 30,000 chicks were used last year We are cooperating with the State University in this matter and the Univer - sity has agreed to furnish us chicks from accredited flocks of their own, from w}iich we are to establish our foundation ilock. We have a flock of 500. producing hens and 1,100 pullets that will be in production in November. 293 </seg>

            <seg id="p301"/>
            <seg id="p302">LIVE STOCK: Mares should replace the geldings we have and an effort be made to raise horses for the various institutions. With 12 brood mares to start with it would not be long before we would have quite a sizable herd of horses. VOCATIONAL TRAINING: A vocational training school should be established to instruct in the theory as well as practice in the various activities of the in - stitution. This training should include shop work, plumbing black - smithing, welding, costkeeping, and tractor mechanics and operation. BRICK PLANT: With the extensive building program needed, the State will re - quire many thousands of brick and tile. We have in the spoil banks ot the Loup River Public Power District canal, which traverses the Genoa property, practically an unlimited supply of brick clay. This spoil bank is within 200 feet of our power house. A spur of the U P. Railway could be built and would act as a fuel spur and also for the hauling ot clay products. A brick and tile plant would give em - ployment to 20 or 30 of our men and would materially cheapen the cost of construction of future buildings. CONCLUSION: The possibilities of this institution, from a humanitarian stand - point as well as from financial economy to the State are much great - er than one can realize. With the development of the major portion of the activities out - lined in this report we believe that the services of 200 men can be used ten months, out of the year, two months could be devoted to school and vocational training. In concluding this first report I desire to thank the Board of Control, Warden O'Grady and Deputy Warden Olson of the State Penitentiary for their splendid cooperation in helping us get estab - lished. I also wish to thank the employees who have been with me for the past two .'years for their loyalty, industry, and untiring efforts m assisting in the operation and management of the insti - tution. Respectfully submitted, P. C. SHOCKLEY, • Superintendent. 294 </seg>
