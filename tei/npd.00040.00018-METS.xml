            <seg id="p004">To The Rural Teachers of Nebraska; Greeting: The old education is no longer sufficient; the teacher who continues in the "rut" must give place to the live, active, re - sourceful teacher. The new day brings new demands, and the old school which contented itself with the giving of knowledge in the rudiments of the subjects of the curriculum is giving way to a new institution which will render greater service to the rising generation. It is demanded now of the teacher that she be able to induce the learner to live within the light of the knowledge gained. We are beginning to consider knowledge which cannot be socialized as of small value. This means that life materials must find a place in the course of study and teachers must be prepared and must be willing to teach them. It is therefore with pleasure I commend this bulletin. Its outlines and sug - gestions are so complete and so lucid that a teacher who has the proper initiative, even though possessing little instruction in the subject covered, should have no trouble in reaching satis - factory results. The work herein presented is in direct harmony with the program of the State Department of Public Instruction. I trust that many teachers will find a place for this interesting and profitable phase of the new education. Very sincerely, A. 0. Thomas State Superintendent of Public Instruction. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">LUNCHES FOR THE RURAL SCHOOL. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOME ECONOMICS. AIM OF BULLETIN. The immediate purpose of this bulletin is to aid the rural school-teacher in the problem of the noon meal of the pupils. Since the preparation of one warm dish gives an excellent basis for a study of foods, which will be of use to the young house - keeper, it is planned that this bulletin may be used in connection with, or may be followed by, the lessons of the Girls' Cooking Clubs of the Agricultural Extension Service of the University of Nebraska. Wherever a warm food has been added to the cold lunch at school, parents and teachers have seen good results. Greater interest in school work, better grades, better health, and less need of discipline, particularly in the latter part of the day, are im - mediate results. Increased interest in home work is often found. This bulletin contains suggestions that will help the busy rural teacher to undertake the warm lunch without adding too greatly to her already heavy burden. While the work must be adapted to local conditions, it should always be planned to develop responsibility and initiative in the pupil. Social qualities may be developed. Teamwork requires tact and a spirit of cooperation, whether this is exercised in a ball game, in the home work of a large family, or in the preparation of a rural school lunch. The partaking of a lunch, served in a sanitary, attractive manner, may be a real and much needed part of an education. The tactful teacher can do much to get better standards of sanitation by encouraging clean hands and a clean, orderly room in the preparation for the lunch. The informal good times enjoyed while eating together at the noon hour have had equally good results with the diffident child, the boisterous boy, and those pupils needing American standards of home life. Cooking at school invariably encourages the girl to do more of this work at home. School credit for home work is a large problem, and needs to be solved differently in various localities. Wherever the mothers and teacher cooperate, the results have been satisfactory. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 Extension Bulletin 32, College of Agriculture. INTRODUCTION OF SCHOOL LUNCH WORK. Experience in Nebraska suggests that there is a feeling in many quarters that this work will add greatly to the school expense and decrease the value of the regular work. In a few cases, the schools have approved of the plan and introduced a very good equipment which the inexperienced, untrained, or over - busy teacher has not been able to use well. Careless work has resulted, and the plan has been called a partial failure. It cannot be recommended too strongly that a modest beginning be made until the interest of the parents, on one hand, and the ability of the teacher to organize the work well, on the other hand, assure the success of its development on a larger plane. The donation of a few utensils and food by some of the patrons may be the initial step which will later gain the support of the entire district. EQUIPMENT. The amount of space and money available, as well as the conditions in the community, must guide the teacher in planning the equipment. The aim must be to have a sanitary, convenient equipment which contains nothing that cannot be copied in the homes of the pupils. If it is planned to prepare only a small variety of foods for the warm lunch, a very few utensils and the heating stove will give good results in the hands of a capable teacher. If it is desired to prepare as many as possible of the foods which may be used in the home, a broader training will be given and a fairly complete equipment will be needed. This may include a combination cupboard and worktable, necessary utensils, oil stove, fireless cooker, shelf or cupboard for keeping the chil - dren's lunch boxes, water container, garbage pail, tea towels, dishcloths, holders, aprons, and paper napkins. The worktable can serve two purposes: First, a place to work upon; and second, a place for storing utensils and general food supplies. Its construction should afford a safe and clean place for keeping the supplies. A well-made dry goods box, about 40 inches long, 27 or more inches wide, and 33 inches deep, may be made to serve the purpose. Shelves must be built in. The simplest, but least satisfactory way to close a cupboard is to place a curtain of washable material in front of it. A great improvement, easily accomplished, is made by replacing the curtains with a door which can be fastened tight. The accom - panying illustration shows a dry goods box with an improvised door which has been covered with oilcloth by the pupils and teacher. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Lunches for the Rural School. 7 Fig. 1. — Simple equipment in use in Hamilton County, Nebraska. More space will be provided by placing another dry goods box, rather high and narrow, on top of the worktable. This can be nailed down, in order to keep it firm. Shelves may also be built in this cupboard and thus enable the worker to obtain many of her supplies without bending her back. Drop leaves built in at the side extend table space and at the same time do </seg>

Castors lift the box from the floor and facilitate moving. White paint or paint matching the woodwork in the schoolroom im - proves its appearance. A white oilcloth, which is easily washed, may be used to cover the top and the shelves. Paper serves the same purpose and can be easily changed. A more elaborate cabinet is shown in the accompanying photograph. If manual training is given to the boys, this cabinet Viz- 2. — Complete equipment for rural school*. </seg>

The important features are the adjustable shelves, the drop leaves, and the economical use of door space. The aim is to use as much as possible of the space from the floor to the ceiling rather than the floor space, which is not over - abundant in most rural schools. Two or three girls can work at this table. The lower part is 33 inches high, 39 inches wide, and 27 inches deep. The upper part is 37 inches high, 36 inches wide, and 13 inches deep. Cup hooks fastened to the under side of the shelf save shelf space. Hooks and a knife and cover rack make the door serve more than one purpose. This cabinet would have been easier to make and more satis - factory if the outside had been plainer and if the doors had been set on hinges at the outer edge of the cupboard. UTENSILS. The following is a fairly complete list of utensils, with ap - proximate cost. This group of utensils has been used in the preparation of all kinds of foods, as well as in canning fruits and vegetables. The utensils are large enough for the preparation of food for 20 or 25 students.

The following equipment, costing less than $5, may be used in connection with a two-hole kerosene stove or even with a heat - ing stove. In the case of the jacketed stove, used in a number of rural schools in Nebraska, the space between the door and the fire box may be used for baking potatoes and for cooking food in a casserole. A bean jar or a covered milk crock is in reality an inexpensive casserole. Containers may be improvised from baking powder cans, pickle jars, molasses cans, etc. Tops of fruit cans may be melted off and the cans used for supplies. SERVING DISHES Serving dishes may be brought from home as needed. On the other hand, there are several reasons in favor of the serving dishes being the property of the school. They can be uniform, thus obviating any distinction between the various homes. Attractive dishes of good quality can be purchased for a moderate price. The list includes cups and saucers, plates about 8 inches in diameter, sauce dishes, teaspoons, knives, forks, water glasses, and paper napkins. STOVE. A good oil stove with two burners can be bought for $7.50. The oven costs from $2 to $4. Frequently, a second-hand oil stove can be secured at a very reasonable price. PIRELESS COOKER. In order to save fuel and attention on the part of the teacher and pupils, a fireless cooker may be used. In Figure 3 is shown a homemade fireless cooker which has given as good results as expensive ones on the market. Details of the method of making and using a fireless cooker may be obtained from the Agricultural Extension Service of the University of Nebraska.

A hot cereal, served with cream, makes an excellent lunch and one that can easily be prepared in the rural school. Fig. 3. — A homemade fireless cooker SHELF FOR LUNCH BOXES. There should be a definite place in a rural school for keeping the children's lunch boxes. A double shelf with a curtain serves the purpose well. It should not be located too near the stove nor where food can freeze, and it should be kept clean and free from dust. The curtain may be made by the sewing class, and of material that blends with the color scheme of the room. PREPARATION AND SERVICE OF SCHOOL LUNCH. Whether the equipment is new or has been used the previous year, the first work should be on general housekeeping, the cleaning of utensils, labeling and arranging supplies, and getting acquainted with the equipment and plans for the work. The better this part of the work is done, the more smoothly the remainder of the work will progress. Originality and responsi - bility should be fostered equally. The method of obtaining supplies must be decided in con - ference with the patrons. In a few cases, the school board and a number of the patrons have furnished money with which the teacher has bought materials. In more cases, it has been found </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Extension Bulletin 32, College of Agriculture. satisfactory for parents to furnish food. Each pupil may bring enough apples, potatoes, eggs, or other supplies for himself. Usually it is better when one home furnishes all that is needed of one article. A simple record should be kept to insure fairness. Some elasticity is necessary, as housekeepers often wish to send a supply of that which they have on hand, such as meat at butchering time. When the dish to be prepared at school time has been decided upon, the pupils should be given suggestions for the remainder of the lunch. Practical dietetics can be taught in this way. As soon as the study of foods is well begun, the pupils will be able to do this planning themselves. A very elementary knowledge of food composition will make them object to bringing from home, cheese or meat for a lunch to which baked beans are added at school. An appreciation of fruit and vegetables in the diet may lead to a greater variety in the home garden the next spring. Such teaching undoubtedly has an effect upon the dietetic customs and the health of families. The actual work of preparation must be planned with the aim in mind of doing the work as quickly, skillfully, and in as clean a manner as possible with little use of school time. The making out at first of a list of utensils will call the pupils' attention to the saving in using as few utensils as possible, and to foresight in planning. Here is a splendid field for practical sanitation. The refuse which is not taken home by the pupils for chicken feed should be burned, if possible. Fortunately, there usually will not be the tin can problem. Should some parents send food in tin cans, the teacher should be above criticism in her disposal of the cans. If they are needed for containers, the tops can be melted off. Probably the best method of disposing of inedible, incombustible garbage is burying it well below the depth of cultivation. The cleanliness of dishes and linen cannot be too strongly insisted upon. Parents may well use these things as a means of judging the value of the work to their children. Most girls, and in many cases boys, enjoy keeping things clean and in good order if they are given the right start in this direction. The amount of water available may decide whether the towels can be washed at school. If possible, this should be done. Various plans of service will suggest themselves to the teacher, whereby the food can be quickly and neatly served. A large pitcher for the pouring of liquids, a long-handled dipper, and a large spoon and fork are needed for this work. Paper napkins may be placed on the desk tops and one hot food served by two </seg>

The preparation for service of the food, the dish - washing, and the general straightening up after the meal can best be done by groups of two to four of the older girls, who take their turns in this work. The smaller children and the boys may be allowed to help. Figure 4 shows this simple service in a rural school in Nebraska. Fig. 4. The lunch hour in a Hamilton County school. TYPICAL LUNCH.

Flour, j c. White sauce Fat, 5 c. Salt, 1 T. Pepper, 1 t. DIRECTIONS FOR PREPARATION. Wash potatoes with a brush, pare, and cut into one-half inch cubes. Place in the upper part of a double boiler over the direct flame. Half cover with boiling water and boil covered </seg>

Place the vessel over hot water in the lower part of the double boiler and add the milk. Mix the flour, salt, and pepper with the fat or with sufficient milk to form a thin batter. When the milk is hot, pour the flour mixture into the potatoes and milk and stir carefully. Cook at least 10 minutes and serve very hot. UTENSILS NEEDED. Dishpans, double boiler, quart bowl, tablespoon, teaspoon, stirring spoon and ladle, paring knife, and newspapers. VARIATIONS. 1. If the potatoes are mealy and likely to become mushy, they should be boiled and added to the thickened milk (white sauce) just before serving. 2. Potatoes may be boiled with or without the skins, or baked and then pared and diced. Cooking in the skin gives more flavor. There is also less loss of food value, particularly of the mineral matter. 3. If half cream is used in place of milk, no other fat is needed and only half as much flour. 4. Chopped parsley may be sprinkled over the potatoes when served. (Parsley can be grown in a window box in early spring or late fall when it can be protected from frost during the week-ends. ) 5. Grated cheese may be sprinkled over the potatoes before serving. This adds to the flavor and, if sufficient cheese is used, this may be the main dish of the meal. 6. Left-over creamed potatoes may be used in cream of potato soup or in scalloped potatoes. The water in which potatoes are boiled makes a good addition to any vegetable soup. PLANNING ON PREVIOUS DAY. 1. Supplies Potatoes, 1 peck or 15 of medium size. Milk, 1} quarts. Butter, bacon, or other fat, I c. 2. Serving dishes If these are not furnished by the school, each child should bring a plate and a fork. 3. Suggested remainder of lunch Bread and butter. Meat or cheese. (May be in the form of sandwiches.) Fruit or sauce. Pie, cake, jelly, or preserves may be brought if desired, but are not needed if there is plenty of fruit and other food. </seg>

(These pupils may write the recipe on the board after the dinner is served.) PREPARATION. 1. Before school. — Wash, peel, and dice potatoes. Place in cold water in the upper part of the double boiler. Drain peelings, wrap in paper, and place in the stove, or put aside for the pupil desiring to take them home. Partly fill the teakettle. 2. Before recess. — Light fire under teakettle so as to have boiling water at recess time. 3. During recess. — Pour the cold water oft* the potatoes. Pour on boiling water and place over the flame. Refill the tea - kettle and place on the stove, using the heating stove whenever possible. Prepare the flour mixture for the white sauce. Place the flour in a mixing bowl, add half as much water or milk, and stir to a thick, smooth paste. Add liquid until the mixture is of the consistency of thin cream. 4. After recess. — When potatoes are nearly tender, add milk, and place over the lower part of the double boiler containing hot water. When the milk is hot, add the flour mixture and stir until smooth. 5. At noon. — Provide for heating of dishwater. Serve creamed potatoes to pupils, wash dishes, and arrange cabinet. RECIPE FILES. Recipe books published by manufacturers of foods are usually obtained free or for the postage. Recipes are so abun - dant that the difficulty is in keeping them in available form. A recipe filing cabinet is by far the best arrangement. Cards 3 by 5 inches should be used. They can be purchased at any book - store. Paper cut in this form is less durable but equally con - venient while it lasts. On these cards, all tried recipes may be copied. Notes regarding the amount and other points of interest should be made. The cards may be kept in regular redpe boxes, which may be purchased for 25 cents or more. Any pasteboard box of suitable size, such as may be obtained free from a dry goods store, is equally convenient. Guide cards may be purchased or </seg>
