There is now in the hands of the printer, for publieH - n. manuscript of the opinions rendered by this depart- tent and a list of the many cases now pending in the several ouits. in which the state is interested. Oil account of the adoption of the prohibitory amend - neiit. in the light of experience of each of the other states in ('nion which have adopted a similar one, in order that Mine may be made effective as contemplated by the u-ople. it is absolutely ( ssential that a sufficient appro - iriation to this department be made to meet the necessary xpeiiM's of investigating alleged violations and prosecuting those who violate the law. The failure to make ample appro - priation fin- this purpose would weaken the force and effect of law. which should not be tolerated. Inasmuch as the coun- ty attorneys are required to discharge their duties in many respects in conjunction with this department, power should be vested in the attorney general to remove any county at - torney who declines, when requested in writing by the at - torney ireneral. to prosecute case-- gfwiag out of the liquor traffic, and proceed with the prosecution himself. An ap - propriation for this branch of cases alone should be $100, - 000. xxxiii </seg>

Session Laws of 1913. being the Blue Sky law." It would seem that the answer to the &lt;iuestion propound - ed would depend upon the definition of a "carrier," and in section fili'4. Revised Statutes for 1913, the term "com - mon carrier" is defined as to include all cor|x&gt;rations, com - panies, individuals and association of individuals, their lessees or receivers, appointed liv any court whatsoever, that may now or hereafter own, operate, manage or con - trol any railroad, interurban or street railway line, oper - ated cither by steam or electricity, or any other motive power, or part thereof, or any express company, car company, limping car company, freight and freight line company, telegraph and telephone companies, and miii other artier rafpgad in the transmission of mes - s;iire&gt;. or trmmsportmtiom of pm*»t*§er» m freight for hire.

Therefore, it would clearly ap|&gt;ear that a "jitney bus and transfer company" would come within the purview of the statute and the decision, and is to he deemed a "common carrier." Section 7.X, Revised Statutes of 1913^ known as the stock and l&gt;ond law, provides that a common carrier or public service corporation, organized and incorporated, or hereafter incorporated, under or by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, mmtf mmm ifffrl, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness i&gt;au&lt;ible at jHiiods of more than tirelre mouths after the dutv thereof, uhen nee- </seg>

It would seem that the questions involved in the inquiry your department have not been passed upon directly by ie courts of this state, but similar statutes have been naeted in manv of the states, in some of which the stat- tts are almost identical, and the statutes have been sus - liued by the courts on the ground of public necessity in roteeting the public against the harmful and deleterious iiiiediciits that enter into the manufacture of the com - ioii commercial vinegar, and the fraud and inisrepreaenta - ion practiced in its manufacture and sale.

The section of the statute, above referred to. defining uli fee. does not di&gt;t inguish between resident and non &gt;id(iit applicants, hut provides that: "The said board may grant certificates of registration without rther examination to the licentiates of such other boards of phar- &lt;y, and graduates of such colleges of pharmacy, as it may deem per upon payment of a fee of five dollars, whic i shall be good y until the first regular meeting of the board thereafter."

In the first instance, it would seem that an examination iglit be required by the board of secretaries, discretion- \. however, with the board. In the second instance, it mild seem to be permissible that a further fee of $."&gt; iirht be charged for such examination, rather than a fee prescribed for the annual renewal of the license. Whether the fee in question should be $5 or si' is not ade plain bv the statute, and it would seem to be within ie province of the board proper to determine that matter &gt;r the board of secretaries. The former custom of the hoard af secretaries in chary - g a fee of $l'."&gt; in the instances referred to, is absolutely legal and should not be permitted. Very respectfully. WILLIS K. REED.

A county treasurer is not required to account in his settlement with the county, for money received by him for correcting the county assessor's books.

It is hut proper to say, however, in this connection that the right of a county treasurer to receive any money from the county in the first instance for correcting the county assessor's hooks is very doubtful. "A contract between a county and one of its officers, wnereby such officer undertakes to i&gt;erform extra-official services, for which the county undertakes to pay him compensation in addition to the fees or salary allowed by law, is in violation of said section and will not support an action for such extra compensation."
