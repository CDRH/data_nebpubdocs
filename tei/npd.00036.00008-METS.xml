            <seg id="p007">COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC LANDS AND BUILDINGS Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 1, 1916. To His Excellency, John H. Morehead, Governor: Sir: In compliance with the constitutional requirement, I have the honor to submit the following report of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, who is also the Secretary of the Board of Educa - tional Lands and Funds, for the biennium beginning December 1st, 1914, and ending November 30th, 1916. Under the present law, the Board of Educational Lands and Funds is the custodian of the Capitol Building, Governor's mansion and State Fair grounds. During the past two years, under the direction of the Board, im - provements were made as follows: A building — being an extension and enlargement of the Arsenal Building, erected on the State Fair grounds, was erected at a cost of $3,412.00. It was necessary to enlarge the building on account of the' large shipments made by the U. S. Government of clothing, shoes, guns, wagons, etc., and if these goods are not properly taken care of a great deal will be damaged and at times will be a total loss. A new boiler was installed in the boiler house on the Capitol Grounds at a cost of $1760. Various improvements through the Capitol Building have been made, including Secretary of State's office, vault in basement for use of Supreme Court and improvements on the elevator. During my administration the State has become the owner of the following escheat lands: In Hayes County, south half of section four, township six, range thirty-four, which is now yielding a yearly rental of $187.20. In Holt County, southwest quarter of section twenty-five, township thirty-one, range twelve, yielding a yearly rental of $62.40. In Keya Paha County, southeast quarter of section nineteen, town - ship thirty-four, range nineteen, yielding a yearly rental of $62.40. I visited these lands in person and have raised the appraisements where I found the same too low. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT In Nemaha County, lots three and four, block one, in Calvert's ad dition to Auburn. I would recommend that the Legislature appropriate sufficient amount to improve the building and have new sidewalks constructed as the old ones are in a dangerous condition, and also pass a law that the above described lots may be sold at auction to the highest bidder. During the 1915 session of the Legislature, at my request and sug - gestion, the appropriation for re-appraisal of school lands for leasing purposes was increased $2,000.00, making the total amount for that purpose $4,000.00, and as a consequence the school lands in nineteen counties were re-appraised, with the result that the yearly income was increased $28,000.00. In October, 1915, the school lands in the south half of Cherry County, containing 125,000 acres, were ordered re-appraised for leas - ing purposes, which would undoubtedly increase the yearly rentals $7,000 or $8,000. Up to this time the County Board have failed to make the appraisement, and have not given a good and valid reason for the appraisement not being made. But, even with the increases that have been made in the various counties, the State is not receiv - ing from rentals what it ought to. I would recommend that the laws be amended in such a way as to enable the State to secure a fair rental for its school lands. The law-makers may rest assured that a majority of the citizens and tax - payers will appreciate any effort they put forth in this direction. I am also of the opinion that it will be better for the State to hold the title to its school lands and not sell any more than it is ab - solutely compelled to under the present law, as the time is not far dis - tant when all the school lands will more than double in value. The State is improving very fast and with the great increase of irrigation and also the progress in our dairy business, there will certainly be a great demand for grazing lands. When six months old calves sell for $30 to $32 per head and three year oW cattle sell for $75 to $95 per head, grazing land will be in great demand and the State ought lo be able to receive a large income in rentals from its lands. Review of Appraisement It is generally known that when a lease holder, who is entitled to purchase land from the state, makes application for such purchase, the land in question is appraised for sale purposes, by the supervis - ors or commissioners of the county wherein it is located. This val - uation thereupon becomes reviewable by the State Board, to determine whether the appraisement is adequate or otherwise. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">REVIEW OF APPRAISEMENT 9 During the biennium just closed. 18,224.66 acres in thirty-eight counties have been reivewed by me personally and individually. The county officers' valuation of about $210,000.00, was raised to $250,000.00 and this increase of $40,000.00 was approved by the Board. During my first term 19,24:! acres in twenty-five counties were purchased and reviewed by me personally. The county officers' valua- tion of about $226,000.00 was raised to $256,000.00 and this increase of $30,000.00 was approved by the Board. As the purchaser pays the expense of the county officers' appraise- ment, the increase in review is net, less the small cost of review by the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings or other represents tives of the Board. Re-appraisement of Leased Lands During the biennium, the lands under lease in nineteen counties of the state have been re-appraised and the new valuation approved by the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. The appended table shows the counties thus affected: County Old Value New Value Increase Arthur $ 5.835.20 $ 27,464.00 $ 21,628.80 Cedar 13,687.27 57,250.79 43,563.52 Cheyenne 24,987.00 74,930.00 49,943.00 Deuel ! 12,367.57 27,699.91 15,332.34 Dundy 34,424.62 57,637.41 23,212.79 Franklin 37,745.36 98,386.80 60,641.44 Grant 9,294.00 30,910.00 21,616.00 Hooker 14,335.90 35,647.18 21,311.28 Kearney 12,106.99 31,733.00 19,626.01 Kimball 13,839.44 31,538.28 17,698.84 Lancaster 17,859.10 55,623.98 37,764.88 Lincoln 82,618.91 96,374.62 13,755.71 Logan _ _ 9,212.00 19,272.00 10,060.00 Madison 5,320.00 19,060.00 13,740.00 McPherson 9,008.00 17,210.00 8,202.00 Morrill 39,586.25 66,262.33 26,676.08 Perkins 36,466.69 46,230.88 9,764.19 Sioux 57,690.89 103,584.38 45,893.49 Thomas 10,315.35 15,050.42 4,735.07 $446,700.54 $911,865.98 $465,165.44 </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT During my first term the lands under lease in seven counties were re-appraised and the new valuations approved by the Board of Educa- tional Lands and Funds.

Add to this the expected increase on yearly rentals in Cherry County of at least $7,000.00, which will make a yearly increase in total rentals of $52,219.18. The State'* School Fund The temporary school fund is derived from the following sources: Interest on permanent school funds, rentals on lands under lease, in- terest on balance due on lands sold, bonus received as premium to se- cure lease contracts, interest on delinquent rental and interest and money received for licenses, fines, fees, etc. This temporary school fund is apportioned twice a year to the dif- ferent counties in the state for the support of the public schools. The permanent school fund is derived from the sale of educational lands, escheated lands, and 5% of the purchase price of government lands sold within the state. This fund is invested in interest-bearing bonds in amounts at present as follows Common School $8,968,560.33 University _ _ 236,603.00 Agricultural College Endowment 576,500.00 Normal Endowment _ 81,150.00 Bessey Endowment 1,835.00 Total _ $9,864,648.33 </seg>

I have also attached hereto the rules and regulations now governing the sale and lease of educational lands which may be of interest to prospective lessees and purchasers. A table of the fees charged in this depart - ment is also shown. In conclusion, I wish to thank my fellow members on the Board for their uniform kindness and courtesy to me.

            <seg id="p018">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 18 RULES AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO THE LEASING AND SALE OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS The following paragraphs are intended to answer a majority of the inquiries made by prospective lessees and purchasers of Educational Lands as well as many questions asked by county treasurers. The state seldom has any unleased lands, and then only at or about the time auctions are held as described hereafter. These auctions occur generally but once each year at the offices of the various county treasurers. Lease Contracts The Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings may at least once in each year designate a day and hour for offering in a public manner, at the office of the county treasurer in the respective counties, lease con - tracts on all of the educational lands, which may be subject to lease in that county at the time of such offering. The same shall be subject to lease at an annual rental of six (6) per cent on the appraised value. Provided, that if two or more parties desire -to lease the same land, the officer having control of the auction shall lease to the person who will pay the greater amount of cash bonus in addition to six (6) per cent on the appraised value as annual rental. Lease rentals are due in two installments, January 1 and July 1 of each year. If not paid within six months after due, the lease holders are declared delinquent and notice is sent them if their postomce addresses are known; if unknown, advertisement is made in a newspaper. Ninety days after date of such notice lease contracts are declared forfeited and are subject to auction thereafter. (See fees.) Delinquent lease holders are not permitted to bid at the sale of the lands they have forfeited, but at any time before the land is actually put on the auction block they may reinstate their leases by paying all back rentals and penalty fees. (See Fees.) All school lands under lease are subject to appraisement every five (5) years, if the Board of Educational Lands and Funds so elects. Any lessee of land situated within the area irrigated or to be irri - gated from irrigation works constructed or controlled (or to be con - structed or controlled by the United States or its duly authorized agen - cies) or any lessee of any 40-acre tract or government subdivision, any part of which is under irrigation, may purchase the same. (See Sales.) The holders of lease contracts executed prior to July 9, 1897, are given the right, at the expiration of said contracts, to make application for and receive new lease contracts upon said lands, and they will not be required to compete for the contracts, and the rate of rental will be the same as stipulated in the old contract; Provided, That all of the rental due on the old contracts has been paid. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">LEASING AND SALE OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS 19 Leases dated prior to July 9, 1897, may also be converted into sale contracts, the lessee making application to the county clerk, the county commissioners appraising the land for sale purposes, and the Commis - sioner of Public Lands and Buildings reviewing such appraisement The lessee thereupon pays one-tenth of the principal and interest at five (5) per cent from date to the first of the following year. If lessee has ai - reaily paid his rental for the sime period, he is refnndtd this amount. He surrenders his lease contract and receives a sale contract running twenty years. (See Sales.) I Leases dated on July 9, 1897, and after (at the expiration of twenty - five years from the first of January next following date of lease) are not subject to renewal excepting upon the terms and conditions pertain - ing to new leases. Lessee may surrender the premises or release them under ordinary competitive conditions, he being entitled only to the mov - able improvements on the land. The amount of school land authorized to be leased, direct or by re - newal, to one person is limited to 640 acres. Sale Contracts A lease holder whose lease may be converted to a sale, desiring to purchase the lands described in his lease, should apply to the county clerk in which the land is located, to have same appraised by the county board for the purpose of sale. Such appraisement shall be subject to re - view and approval by the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, before the same shall become effective. Upon the sale of any lands on which full payment is not made the Commissioner of Public Lands and Build - ings will issue a sale contract running for a term of twenty (20) years, showing the land purchased, the amount paid, the amount due and the time when the interest and principal are due, and on the payment of such amount, according to law, the purchaser or his assignee shall be entitled to a deed of such land. The contract holder has the privilege of making payments on the principal at any time and in any amounts, which should be done just on or before January 1, thus reducing the interest of the ensuing year. The owner of a sale contract may, at any time, pay any portion of the purchase price thereof to the treasurer of the county in which the land is situated: Provided, all interest at that time earned and due has first been paid; and when the principal is paid in full, other than at the first of the year, interest upon the obligation having been paid for the entire year, the county treasurer receiving such principal payments may refund to the payor, out of any interest money then in his hands, the interest so paid in advance in excess of the amount earned and due at the time said final payment is made. Refund receipts are furnished by the Land Commissioner for this purpose. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 20 All unpaid principal on sale contracts draws interest at five (5) per cent per annum, payable annually on January first of each year, in ad - vance. Sale contract holders making final payment to county treasurer should also surrender their contracts, that same may be forwarded to Land Commissioner with receipt showing the full payment Deeds are ordinarily issued once each month immediately following the meeting of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds which author - izes such issuance. No educational lands shall be sold for less than seven dollars per acre, nor for less than the appraised value as approved by the Board of Educational I&gt;ands and Funds. NOTES The Board of Educational Lands and Funds meets on the second Tuesday of each month. No assignment of a school land lease or sale contract is valid until re - corded in the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buillings, and will not be recorded if any interest or rental is due at the time said assignment is offered for record. The original sale or lease contract must be sent in with the assignments or the latter cannot be recorded. The contract will be returned with the recorded assignments. When a subdivision of not less than forty acres in any contract is assigned, a new number is given the assigned portion on the ledger ac - count, and a copy of the original should be given to the assignee. A fee of seventy-five cents is required for such copies. When assignments are made as above, the original contract must be reduced and the interest or rentals as the case may be is adjudged to the new conditions. Whenever a lease or sale contract becomes lost or destroyed, a certi - fied copy of the same may be procured by filing an affidavit of lost con - tract. Fee for recording affidavit fifty cents, and for each certified copy of contract seventy-five cents. Such copies may be used in lieu of the original for the purpose of passing title. When interest on a sale contract or rental on a lease contract is not paid when due, county treasurers will collect "penalty" interest at 7 per cent for the time purchaser or lessee has been tardy in making such payments. . Improvements on leased land, and the owner's equity in land under sale contract, are subject to taxation. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">LEASING AND SALE OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS 21 County treasurers are requested to send in school land receipts at least once each week. Sometimes tardiness in this particular leads to considerable unnecessary correspondence and occasionally to delinquen- cies being charged against contract holders who are not in arrears but whose receipts have not been sent in to the Land Commissioner's office. Lands escheating to the state under alien act are appraised, leased, and purchased, in the same manner as educational lands. If lessee shall be in default of rentals for six months, or if purchaser shall be in default of interest for one year, County Treasurers shall collect delinquent notice fee of fifty cents, as set forth in table of foes under heading of "For Notice of Forfeiture." Fees For the issuance of a lease or sale contract $0.50 For recording assignments, for each contract assigned 50 For recording affidavit of lost contract 50 For certified copy of a contract 75 For recording any instrument, each 100 words 10 For copies of maps or plats, each hour's work 40 For notice of forfeiture of lease or sale contract 50 For reinstatement 50 For recording order of forfeiture, where redemption is made before auction, for each tract of forty acres or less 50 Where publication in newspaper is required in lieu of ordinary de - linquent notice, the actual cost of such publication is charged where redemption is made. , Note — Fees payable to the state should be remitted by draft or money order payable to State Treasurer. Personal checks and stamps are not acceptable. </seg>

The first Manual of Surveying instructions was issued by the Govern - ment in 1855, the year following the initiation of the Public Surveys in Nebraska and Kansas territories, and it provided that along the lines surveyed, the surveyors should note among other things, Intersection by line of land objects, the distance at which the line entered and left every settler's claim and improvements, prairie, river, creek and bottom, swamp, marsh, grove, etc. with their direction; dis - tances to the beginning of ascent and arrival at the top and the foot of all remarkable hills, and Intersections by line to water objects — such as rivers, creeks, lakes and ponds, and their width. The land surface — whether level, rolling, broken, or hilly. Character of the Soil — whether first, second or third rate. Character of the timber — in the order in which they predominate. Bottom lands— to be described as wet or dry and subject to inunda tion or not. Springs of water — whether fresh, saline or mineral and direction of the streams flowing from them. Lakes and ponds — character of their banks, height, and depth of water, and whether pure or stagnant. Improvements — Towns and villages; Indian towns and wigwams, houses, cabins, fields and other improvements, coal banks, peat land, salt springs and licks. Roads and trails — direction to and from what place. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING 27 Rapids, cascades, or waterfalls, with approximate height. Precipices, caves, sink holes, ravines, stone quarries, ledges of rock and kind of stone. Natural curiosities, interesting fossils, petrifactions, organic remains; all ancient works, such as mounds, fortifications, embankments, ditches, etc. At the close of each mile of line there was required a brief summary of the character of the land surface. At the close of the township subdivisions there was to be a general description of the character of the surface, kind of soil, quality of tim - ber and grass, whether containing rivers, creeks, lakes and ponds and location of springs; in general, a summary of the natural physical features of the township. The surveyors entrusted with the establishment of the meridians, standard and township lines were required to do the same, so that they were a check on each other. This written record of 2246* townships and fractional townships is the basis of information of the natural physical features of the land throughout the State. 'Number of whole townships 2,074; number of townships made frac - tional by state boundary lines 172. The data which they furnish, although made from thirty-five to sixty-two years ago, is the basis of original information, sought after by land owners and prospective investors. In the sandhill region of the northwest part, which was, in the early history of the State, considered wholly or in part worthless, or adapted for grazing purposes only, hundreds of townships were surveyed before a settler had located therein; the result was that the monuments of survey were so obliterated by the elements that for many years it has been a difficult matter for settlers to make their locations with certainty. To ren - der assisance to the settlers, the Government has had several surveying parties in the field for several years making resurveys of townships where imperatively needed and petitioned for by the settlers, and where the title to at least fifty per cent of the land was still in the government. During the last nine years 183*4 townships have been resurveyed by pro - rating the remeasured distances between original corners when found according to the reported lengths of lines in the original survey. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">■ LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT So far as this office has been advised, these resurveys have given gen - eral satisfaction, although there are instances where the new lines are at so great a distance from where the original lines were claimed and supposed to be, as to cause parties to feel that they had a just griev - ance, but in general the benefits acruing from having fixed lines and a final settlement of their contentions over the boundaries, is an overbal - ancing offset to any loss or damage they may have sustained. The time, however, is close at hand when the minimum amount of patented lands will compel the Government to withdraw all its parties from Nebraska resurveys. The only recourse the settlers, in many town - ships, will be to private surveys, or applications to this department. During the period of nine years, above mentioned, the Government has resurveyed to date 183% townships, excepting two townships in Knox County and nine in the west ranges of Dundy County; all of these resur - veyed townships are located in the sandhill country north of the Platte River and west of range 11 west.

            <seg id="p031">DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING 31 On September 3, 1915, an order was issued by the National Forester that the Loup Division of the Nebraska National Forest shall be known as the "Bessey Division" and the Forest Service Nursery near Halsey, Nebr., as the "Bessey Nursery." The field notes of resurveyed townships by the Government are being constantly received from the General Land Office at Washington and placed on file, and until these resurveys have progressed as far as can be done, by the General Government, they cannot be classified and con - veniently arranged and properly bound; with the maps thereof it is differ - ent, for they can and are being indexed and filed in their proper order. During the last four years, as time could be spared, I have been in - dexing and abstracting the field notes and maps of surveys, and during the biennium the work has covered the field notes of original surveys from Range 24 West to the Colorado and Wyoming boundary lines; the manuscript for the maps are ready to be typewritten. The work of pre - paring the manuscript copy of resurveys has begun but on account of their general lack of continuity, especially of the township boundaries, slow progress has been made. The field notes of original surveys east of the 6th Principal Meridian includes 155 volumes, in which is included all of the State boundaries and retracement and resurvey of the north boundary in 1893, and the connections of Missouri and Iowa, with the Nebraska surveys across the Missouri River. For convenience the index of original surveys west of the 6th Prin - cipal Meridian began with Volume 201 and closed with 759, making the actual number of volumes of notes of original surveys 714. Four volumes of retracement surveys during the progress of the original work have been indexed; there is still sufficient reports and field notes of examina - tions of original surveys for several volumes to be indexed and bound. The plats of original surveys east of the 6th Principal Meridian in - dexed during the preceding biennium numbered 640. The township plats of surveys west of the 6th Principal Meridian for convenience began with 701 and are numbered consecutively to 2859 — of this number 130 are corrections, duplicates and resurveys, leaving a total of 2729 township maps of original surveys. There are yet 257 maps of Standard Parallels, Guide Meridians and township lines west of the 6th Principal Meridian to be indexed and bound. There have been recently received from the General Land Office at Washington fifteen maps of recent township resurveys in the western </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT part of the State: additions to this will be made as rapidly as the field notes and maps of the surveyors can be examined, and approved by the Commissioner of General Land Office. The constant deterioration of the bindings of the old volumes of field notes requires constant care and during the biennium fifty volumes have been rebound in khaki or binders' cloth. The Legislature of 1913 passed a law making it unlawful for any civil engineer, county surveyor, private surveyor, "locator" or any other person to establish or perpetuate any corner in imitation of corners estab - lished by the Government in the survey of the Public lands, by digging "quadrangular trenches" and "witness pits" or of "witness pits" in either dimensions, distance or direction as adopted by the General Land Office, and punishable by a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $50 for each and every violation, and be liable to the party or parties for any and all damages sustained. A few violations have been reported, but the of - fending parties were notified of the provisions of the law and of their liability. The law has been very beneficial in preventing in a Urge meas - ure a continuance of the practice. The Legislature of 1915 passed a law to require road overseers in the construction and maintenance of highways, when they had knowledge that any corners of land surveys in their district are being lost or de - stroyed by public travel, grading hills or making fills, to notify the county surveyor who is authorized to proceed forthwith to perpetuate said corners in the most permanent manner, by setting monuments of durable material or establishing witness corners in at least two directions and make a record of the same within thirty days, and providing a penalty for the failure of the said overseers to so notify the county surveyor by making them liable for the expense of the restoration of such corners lost or destroyed and for any damage sustained by the interested land owners, has had a very salutory effect in preventing the loss and destruc - tion of many corners and bringing forcibly to the attention of road over - seers that they have no authority to permit the destruction of corners by the traveling public or by workmen in the construction or maintenance of the highways. There is objection on the part of authorities allowing payment of the surveyor's fees as provided, on the ground of want of authority and a waste of public money, and that it is the duty of the land owners to care for their corners. Since the public by its constituted authorities has appropriated the lands for public travel, failed to perpetuate the corners along the route as provided by law, destroys the landmarks by its constant travel and per- </seg>
            <seg id="p033">DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING 33 mits their destruction by the authorities having the construction, main - tenance and care of the highways, the expense of their perpetuation should fall upon the public. The law should be amended so that the surveyor's fees could be paid from the township funds where counties are under township organiza - tion. The vicious practice of subdividing sections into their legal subdivis - ions by measuring from one corner only, followed in the states by county and private surveyors for 1 nearly a hundred years, was corrected by the passage of House Roll No. 14, Leg. 1915, and emphasizes the Federal law of February 11, 1805, by the provision that corners to be established by measurement, shall be so done by measuring the whole line between origi - nal or legally established corners; and that corners which are u&gt; be established at the intersection of straight lines, shall only be done after the whole lines have been coursed with the instrument and measured. A further provision is that if surveys made in violation of the Act and the laws of the United States, the "Circular of Instructions" of the Com - missioner of the General Land Office and "Circular of Instructions to County Surveyors" by the state surveyor, shall be absolutely void and not admissible to record. These laws emanated with others from this office and the anticipated beneficial results have fully justified the favorable action of the commit - tees and their final passage. The "Circular of Instructions to County Surveyors," a treatise of 68 pages on proper methods of conducting resurveys, identification of cor - ners in the prairie country, subdivision of sections, etc., published by this office in 1914 continues to meet with marked favor by not only the sur - veyors of the State but with Government surveyors engaged in resurveys, and by judges, lawyers and land owners; it is to be regretted that at the time there were not available funds to accompany it with a chapter on town and city resurveying as there are frequent calls for such a work from this office. It is hoped that sufficient funds may yet be provided Applications for examinations and surveys to settle disputes are made to the Commissioner and referred to this department. On account of the increasing demands on the time of the state surveyor, very much of the field work during the biennium has been executed by the regularly appointed deputies under direct instructions and official supervision of the state surveyor. It has been the policy of the commissioner to have fewer deputies, who could devote all of their time to the field work and be in closer touch with the methods and requirements of the office, than many whose services could only be had at intervals. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT It has been my experience through nearly a half century spent in making original surveys, retracements of old lines ami searching for cor - ners, that the first and principal interest of the land owner is the identi - fication and preservation of the original land marks; and the experience of this department in the settlement of disputes during the fourteen years of its existence, has been the question of the identification of original cor - ners and correction of illegal and wrongful subdivision of sections. It has been our aim to have deputies of experience in land survey - ing and who have made a study of the complex conditions under which corners are found and be able to interpret their varied appearances. To successfully handle the complicated cases of disputes referred to this office, requires surveyors of experience in land surveying with special training in searching for corners and a patient and persistent enthusiasm in the prosecution of the work entrusted to their care. Field Work During the biennium twenty-eight applications for surveys have been filed and twenty-six surveys executed and two continued. </seg>

Owing: to the lateness of the season end not being pro - vided with funds to meet the expenses of the trip, he was unable to comply with the request. The completion of the survey will, therefore, have to go over to another season. Numbers 189 and 190 were continued at request of the applicants to permit them to procure additional evi - dence as to the original location of corners. It is possible that they may yet be completed this season. Fees The only sources of revenue of this department are derived from copying field notes and maps for county and private surveyors and in - dividuals, filing applications for resurveys, examination of the notes and maps of surveys made by the department and the per diem of the state surveyor when engaged in field work; the per diem of the deputy state surveyors being paid them by the parties having the survey made is not a source of revenue. The abnormal rainy season of 1915 greatly retarded the work of sur - veys and also prevented the filing of applications, especially in the sand - hill region for resurveys of townships where more than 50 per cent of the land has been patented. During the past season surveys have been made as rapidly as the weather and the available suiveying force would permit. Some Surreys During 1915 the state surveyor spent 35% days in the survey at sec - tion and subdivisional lines and survey of submerged and waste land caused by back water from a hydro-electric power dam across Beaver Creek at St. Edward, Boone County, resulting in judgment being rendered in three trials in the district court in the total sum of $3,600.00; IVt days in Sioux County and 2Vt days in Custer County, making a total of 45 days at $6.00 per day, making a total of $270.00, which has been turned into the state treasury to the credit of the general fund.

            <seg id="p037">DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING 37 On application of the board of commissioners of state institutions he surveyed the reservoir site of the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane at Lincoln. In 1885 a lease was made to the State of a tract 150 feet wide by 225 feet long for a reservoir site, which was constructed on top of the hill overlooking the hospital. In 1904 while making a draft of lands belonging to state institutions, he discovered that the lease covered a tract along the road and directly in front of the main building, a half mile north of where it was intended and where the reservoir was constructed. In the survey of the actual site it was discovered that all of the res - ervoir north of the cupalo of the dome is on adjacent lands of another. This required 2% days for which no per diem was charged and no ex - pense incurred as all assistance was furnished by the superintendent of the hospital. Resurvey No. 182 of the east five tier of sections T. 21 N., R. 46 W., was made by Deputy E. C. Simmons in 1915, the Government having previously resurveyed the exterior lines and the west tier of sec - tions. In the execution of this survey by Mr. Simmons, no evidence was found of the original survey by David V. Stephenson in October, 1879. Resurvey No. 199 of the east, west and north boundaries and subdi - visional lines of T. 22 N., R. 48 W. was begun early in November of 1816. No original corners having ever been seen within the township and more than 50 per cent of the land having been patented the settlers of the township joined in an application for a resurvey. In these resurveys of townships, all original corners that are found and recognized are used, and the distances between them prorated according to the U. S. law for the restoration of lost corners. Survey No. 195 was to discover original corners alleged to have been ignored in a survey many years ago in Antelope County and also by the district and supreme courts. In the past when lands were comparatively cheap, many surveyors were careless or took it for granted that certain appearances were the original corners rather than make an exhaustive search to determine the lawful corners, that in suits of ejectment or to quiet title, the full merits of the question were not brought out so that unjust decisions were often rendered. Now, since land has acquired a soaring value, many persons are looking into the matter of former careless surveys for the purpose of regaining lands which they consider rightfully belong to them. In </seg>
            <seg id="p038">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 38 order to do this an exhaustive examination must be made of the location of alleged falsely claimed original corners or corners wrongfully and il - legally established, and search made for the original corners before bring - ing suit. Such cases were No. 195 above cited and No. 197. The applications for surveys submitted to this department for set - tlement have been mostly those of irreconcilable disagreements between neighbors, dissatisfaction with local surveys, complicated conditions and neighborly unfriendliness, and a mixture of political sentiment, which most county surveyors are willing and anxious to unload. This office has never failed to respond as promptly as possible and render the best ser - vice at its command, and in non-partisan manner by giving every oppor - tunity for all interested parties to be present and be heard either per - sonally or by his agent to the end that all the available evidence may be obtained to assist in a just, equitable and legal settlement of the con - troversy. Out of the 199 surveys made, this office has been advised of only one survey, No. 70, in Custer County that has been directly attacked in court. Collateral questions, such as adverse possession, have arisen in two cases. Again I call attention to the condition of the surveys of the sites and the lands of the State contiguous to the different state institutions. The monuments or land marks are usually a decayed stake, small un - marked stone, an iron spike or short iron rod, sometimes having for wit - nesses a fence post long since removed, a telegraph or telephone pole afterwards changed to another location, or a tree without a definite de - scription that has disappeared. The monuments are usually as perishable material, of indefinite description, are traveled over by the public, worn out, crushed and broken or covered over so that no person has any defi - nite knowledge of their location, so it is thrown upon the surveyor the arduous and expensive task of finding these landmarks or restoring them from the best data obtainable. The State should resurvey its institutional lands and erect permanent and conspicuous monuments at all its comers. Full and complete notes and maps of surveys by this department are made in duplicate; one copy is filed in suitable bound volumes and the other sent to the county sur - veyor for record. In addition to the regular duties of the state surveyor, the Legisla - ture of 1911 made an appropriation of $2,000 for the purpose of assisting in the marking of the "Oregon Trail" through Nebraska by the erection of suitable monuments under the supervision of the state surveyor, the state regent of the Daughters of the American Revolution and secretary </seg>
            <seg id="p039">DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYS 39 of the State Historical Society. The appropriation has been expended in payment of monuments and suitable inscriptions and necessary field ex - aminations of locations, necessary to a complete and unquestionable iden - tification of the "Trail" and locations of special historic interest. The main "Trail" enters Nebraska from Kansas near the south - west corner of Gage County, traverses the counties of Jefferson, Thayer, Nuckolls along the Blue River, crosses the divide through Clay, Adams and Kearney to Old Fort Kearney on the Platte, thence along the south side of the Platte through Phelps, Gosper, Dawson, Lincoln and Keith counties to the old California Crossing in Range 41 West; thence over the divide through Deuel and down through historic "Ash Hollow" to the North Platte River; thence along the south side of the North Platte through Garden, Morrill and Scotts Bluff counties, past Chimney Rock, Steamboat Rock, through Mitchell Pass to old Fort Mitchell on the west bank of the river and directly west of the town of Scottsbluff, thence west through Mitchell Valley, across Horse Creek to the Wyoming line, a dis - tance approximating 425 miles. Along this highway all the monuments have been placed excepting five whose locations have not yet bnen selected. In the division of the territory among the three members of the com - mission, all of the territory west of Dawson County was assigned to the state surveyor. In the performance of the duty assigned him he selected the sites, made and procured the necessary measurements and surveys to definitely identify the locations by reference to known landmarks and made the drafts of each for the commission's report. </seg>
