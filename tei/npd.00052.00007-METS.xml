            <seg id="p003">SECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE 3 September 30, 1922. Herewith I submit the 30th annual report of the Building and Loan Association of the State for the year ending June 30th, 1922, compiled from reports required by Section 17, Arti - cle 19, of the 1919 Session Laws. This report shows an increase in the gross assets of $7, - 923,716.00, or 9.4 per cent over the 1921 report. Receipts and disbursements show practically the same ratio of increase over the former year, but do not equal the record of 1920, the exact increase being $4,937,741.45. Five new Associations were added during the year, mak - ing eighty reporting. The Associations are rapidly recovering from the adverse conditions of 1921 and the larger Associations are seeking good loans and report very few foreclosures. Every consistent consideration should be shown to these Associations in their program of "Home Builders." Very respectfully J. E. HART, Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce. Hon. S. R. McKelvie, Governor, </seg>
