            <seg id="p007">TWENTY-NINTH ANNUAL REPORT. EXPERIMENTAL WORK. The work of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station for the current year has been as follows: The funds for the Station are secured from three sources, namely: The Adams and Hatch appropriations are received from the Federal Government in amounts shown by the financial statement of this Report. The Experiment Station also uses certain other funds appropriated from the general University maintenance and set aside by the Regents at their annual meeting for the maintenance of departments in the College of Agriculture and the Experiment Station. Direct appropriations are also made by the Legislature for certain specific purposes, such as hog cholera investigation and the work of the State Entomologist and State Botanist, who are respectively Entomologist and Botanist of the Experiment Station. These appropriations are under the control of the Regents of the University and are ex - pended for the purposes authorized by the Legislature. The State makes direct appropriations also for the main - tenance of the Substations at North Platte, Valentine, and Mitchell, Nebraska. An appropriation is also made for the Agricultural Extension Service of the College of Agriculture. The farm of the Nebraska School of Agriculture at Curtis is available for demonstration purposes. Under the law, the Adams fund must be expended strictly for original research and cannot be used for general administra - tion, for printing, or for farm demonstration purposes. The Hatch appropriation may be used for general administrative purposes, for investigation, and for printing bulletins reporting experimental work. State funds are used for general administra - tive purposes, for investigation, and for printing bulletins and reports which are of a more general character than is permitted by the rulings governing Federal funds. The growth of the College of Agriculture has gradually required the use of additional State funds, so that the percentage of State funds which can now be used for purposes of investigation is much lower than in former years. Plans of work are prepared by each department at the be - ginning of the calendar year, covering the lines of investigation proposed for the current year, so that the work of the Station may progress systematically to accomplish the largest results. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska. |:tically no funds are left unappropriated at the beginning of fiscal year to prosecute new lines of investigation which have been anticipated. Problems requiring original research are lys pressing for investigation, but funds for taking up these lines have been so limited in the last few years that few new ects have been undertaken. Plant Diseases. — The leading lines of investigation during the year have had to do with potato diseases and with the Illinois Potato Diseases. A study of the physiological peculiarities of two species of Fusarium associated with potato diseases is being conducted at the University of Chicago by Professor G. K. K. Link, who is on leave of absence for this purpose. These studies have progressed so far that we are able to say that both of the organisms may, under certain conditions, produce wilting symptoms of the foliage, and under other conditions may produce rotting of the tuber. This is a continuation of the work of Research Bulletin No. 2. It is evident that temperature is a very important factor in determining the behavior of both of these species. One of the two species which is best known as a wilt producer is found to make most rapid growth at high tem - peratures, while the other species, which is a tuber-infecting and rot-producing organism, makes its most rapid growth at low temperatures. Considerable work has been done to determine the possibility of securing selected strains of potatoes which are resistant to Fusarium attack, particularly to leaf roll and associated diseases. Our results have been exceedingly satisfactory and it is expected that at the close of the coming season we shall be in position to make a small distribution of resistant stock for seed purposes. Work has also been done on the anatomy of the sweet potato tuber showing the origin and development of tubers in general. This work is being published in the Botanical Gazette. Apple Canker. The most successful treatment discovered for the apple canker consists in removing the infected part and dis - infecting and covering the wound, asphaltum paint or lead paint being normally used for this purpose after proper disinfection of the wound with corrosive sublimate solution or other disin - fectants. Spraying Experiments.— A comparison of different methods of spraying orchards has shown that a fine spray under a moder - ate pressure is more economical and gives better results than when applied as a coarse spray under high pressure. Apple Blotch (Phyllosticta solitaria) has been controlled with Bordeaux mixture applied 14 to 25 days after the petals fall, </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Twenty-ninth Annual Report. 9 depending upon the season. The results of this experiment will soon be offered for publication. Hill Selection of Potatoes. — The object of this experi - ment is to determine the possibility of isolating high-yielding strains of potatoes by tuber line breeding and to note whether or not hereditable variations arise within tuber lines. Silage Investigations. — Chemical studies of silage mix - tures have been made where alfalfa has been combined with green sorghum (cane) or with grain or molasses, to improve its keeping qualities. It was found that a mixture of alfalfa and cane pro - duced a good quality of silage, whereas in alfalfa alone undesir - able forms of putrefaction took place. Putrefactive bacteria develop because of lack of acid, which is produced in normal silage from the carbohydrates present in the green plant. The alfalfa plant is deficient in carbohydrates. Press Bulletin No. 46, "Alfalfa Mixtures for Silage," gives the results of our recent studies on this subject. Soil Investigation. — A study of the organic constituents of soils shows that the organic compounds studied are not toxic to plants in the soil in the concentration in which they are liable to occur. Studies along this line are continued. Corn Breeding Experiments.— A thoro study is being made of the possibilities of increasing the yield of corn thru various methods of breeding and seed selection. Two standard varieties of corn, one white and one yellow, were used. Fourteen different varieties were used in producing crosses. Satisfactory yield tests were secured from the crosses made the previous season. Fifteen different methods of corn breeding are being compared. A large amount of data has been secured. Water Requirements of Crops.— The relative use of water by oats and wheat was compared with that by corn and sorghum. Three hundred and twenty-five potometers (soil cans) were operated during the year. These were situated within a field of growing grain of the same character as that grown in the poto - meters, so that the exposure to climatic elements was as nearly representative of field conditions as possible. The influence of soil fertility, soil moisture, and climatic conditions upon transpira - tion were also investigated. The effect of different sized poto - meters upon the growth of the plant was studied; also the effect of different exposures upon the transpiration of the same crop was carefully measured. Research Bulletin No. 6, now in press, gives a summary of several years' work on the use of water by growing plants. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska. 10 Variety Testing and Breeding. — Very satisfactory progress has been made in testing varieties and strains of small grains. A large number of strains of Turkey Red wheat and Kherson oats were tested in the nursery. Thirty-five new winter wheats were obtained and tested in comparison with our standard Turkey Red wheat. Several hundred variety hybrids were made for testing next year. Soy Beans. Three of the old varieties of soy beans and seventeen new varieties obtained from the United States Depart - ment of Agriculture were tested during the season. Several of the new varieties are promising and will be continued another year. An effort is being made to secure a variety of soy bean which will be sufficiently productive to be profitable and which will ripen in a normal season in this region. Crop Rotations and Fertilizers. — Crop rotation and fer - tilizer experiments were inaugurated in 1915. It is expected that it will be necessary to continue this work for many years before the effects of fertilizers on our Nebraska soils can be definitely determined. Beef Production. — Cattle feeding experiments have been carried on during the year to compare the following rations: Alfalfa hay and silage, used in various proportions for rough- ness. Corn and cottonseed meal in various forms, used as a con- centrate. The results of this experiment corroborated the results of a former experiment in showing the most economical ration at the prices charged for the various foods to be corn and alfalfa hay without a commercial protein ration. Pork Production. — An experiment in pig feeding was carried on to determine the relative values of tankage and alfalfa hay in supplying protein to a ration in which ear corn and shelled corn were used. The results showed that the cheapest gains were made upon a ration of ear corn and alfalfa hay. The addition of tankage to the ration of shelled corn and alfalfa increased the rate of gain and lowered the cost of gain when compared with shelled corn and alfalfa hay. However, this cost was higher than the cost of gains made with ear corn and alfalfa hay. Experiments are in progress to determine the cost of gains in feeding shelled corn and tankage thru self-feeders, the corn and tankage being fed separately and the hogs permitted to eat of either food at will. The pigs ate of the corn and tankage in the proportion of 12 parts corn to 1 part tankage. Charging the </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Twenty-ninth Annual Report. 11 tankage consumed at $2.50 per hundred, the corn consumed in eight weeks (54^ bushels) brought 99 cents per bushel, by credit- ing the gains at 6 cents net per pound. Sheep Feeding. — A lamb feeding experiment was under- taken, beginning August 28, 1915, and continuing for 90 days. Seven different rations were fed. The gains made varied from 0.18 pound per day to 0.27 pound per day. The net profits varied as follows: In this experiment, the lambs upon grass pasture with corn and oil meal made materially better gains than any other lots. The lot running in a cornfield receiving alfalfa hay after frost did not make as favorable gains as could normally be expected, owing to disturbances while the feeding experiment was in progress. A second experiment in feeding is now in progress, using corn silage, alfalfa hay, and prairie hay for roughness, and corn with different protein concentrates for grain. This experiment will be completed about March 1. Eleven lots each containing 28 western lambs are being used for this. Corn Silage versus Alfalfa Hay for Milk Produc- tion.— Three years' experimental work to test the relative values of alfalfa hay and corn silage in milk production in- dicates: With the quality of silage and alfalfa hay which has been fed in these experiments, when corn silage is worth $3.50 per ton, alfalfa hay is worth $8 per ton to produce milk. When the prices of alfalfa hay run higher than $8 per ton, the value of corn silage for milk production will increase in the same ratio. This would indicate that where alfalfa hay is cheap and abundant the use of silage will not lessen the cost of milk production unless it can be produced at a lower cost than is charged for it in these experiments. The advantage of silage in increasing the number of animals which can be kept upon a limited area by saving the roughness Corn and oij meal on grass pasture $ Lambs running in a cornfield with cottonseed cake and alfalfa hay after a frost Corn, alfalfa hay, and silage Corn, alfalfa hay, rape pasture, and turnips Lambs running in a cornfield with alfalfa hay after frost . .

The silo must also be given credit for its value as a means of holding over feed in years of abundance for use in years of crop scarcity. Corn Silage versus Alfalfa Silage for Milk Produc - tion. — Corn silage has given more favorable results than alfalfa silage, due largely to the improper fermentation of alfalfa silage, which affected its palatability. Our recent experiments have shown that a mixture of one-half green sorghum with one-half green alfalfa makes a good quality of silage, but the feeding value of this mixture has not been compared with corn silage. Soiling System for Dairy Farmers. — A study of the soiling system under Nebraska conditions shows that a variety of crops may be used to furnish a succession of green feed for soiling purposes. The following table shows the various crops and areas suit - able to produce soiling crops for a herd of ten milking cows: Plan for Soiling Crop on a Basis of Ten Cows. 8/10 10/5-10/20 I J 10 " ; 1 1/2 Some work has been done to determine the desirability of using soiling crops in place of pasture crops in Nebraska. This work is as yet incomplete. So far as the experiment has gone, it indicates that butter fat produced from soiling crops will be more expensive than where produced upon silage or pasture. Among the soiling crops used, alfalfa produced milk and butter fat at the lowest cost; but, since alfalfa is not available in its green form thruout the entire season, other crops will be needed to fill in the gaps between the different times of cutting.

            <seg id="p013">Twenty-ninth Annual Report 13 Practical experience has shown that when pastures are depended upon for the main source of feed during the summer months, the cows do not attain their maximum yield. It has been shown also that when the milk flow is once diminished by unfavorable conditions, it is impossible to bring the cows back to a normal yield when conditions again become favorable. The solution of this problem, which confronts nearly all Nebraska dairymen, lies in adopting preventive measures. In other words, Nebraska farmers must be prepared to supplement the pastures by means of soiling crops or by the use of silage. Owing to the cost of labor and the relatively low value of the land and the crop, soiling, with the exception of alfalfa, appar - ently is less efficient than silage under Nebraska conditions. The important point is, to provide a succulent food, such as silage or soiling crops, during the hot, dry period of the summer, so that the dairy cow may be kept up to her maximum yield thruout this period. A New Cream Cooling Tank.— A cooling tank has been designed by the Department of Dairy Husbandry which has proved to be extremely satisfactory for use in cooling milk and cream where ice is not available but where a stream of cold running water can be secured. This tank can also be used with ice if desired. It is being extensively used by farm dairies. It is manufactured locally for Nebraska use, and by the American Creamery Butter Manufacturers' Association for general use thruout the United States. Cow Testing Associations.— Three cow testing associations are operating with the Department of Dairy Husbandry. In these associations about twenty-five fanners agree to join the association and pay $1.50 per year per cow to have monthly tests made of the milk flow and the butter fat production of each individual cow, thus giving at the end of the year a record of milk and butter fat produced, together with a careful estimate of the cost of food consumed by each animal. This gives a rather accurate estimate of the profit or loss produced by the various cows in the herd and frequently shows that cows are being kept at a loss where other cows in the herd are kept at a substantial profit. The testing of individual cows is looked upon as the surest and quickest method for herd improvement by the farmer dairyman. Hog-Cholera Serum Production. — During the past year the serum plant has produced 5,241,800 cubic centimeters of serum and virus. There has been a marked falling off in the demand for serum, due to a decrease in the cholera thruout the </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska. State. We have on hand at the present time serum for all normal demands and can supply serum in any quantities desired for the Nebraska trade. The results of the serum used during the past year have been most satisfactory. We have also sent out during the past year 96,892 doses of blackleg vaccine upon application of farmers in different portions of the State. THE NORTH PLATTE SUBSTATION. The same lines of inyestigational work are being pursued as during the past years with changes and additions as experience has shown advisable. A report of eight years' work in crop rotations and tillage methods has been published as Bulletin 155. This confirms the opinions already expressed that while better methods of tillage and better selection of seed tend to produce higher yields, yet climatic conditions may be so severe as to render crop production by any method unprofitable during cer - tain years. The fact is also emphasized in this bulletin that while certain extremely intensive methods of tillage may increase the yield above ordinary methods, at the same time these in - tensive methods may increase the cost of production dispropor - tionately to the yield. Yield alone is not a proper measure of the value of a certain method of tillage. On the whole the results secured during these years indicate that the most profit - able methods of production are the methods that employ a rather small amount of labor per acre and at the same time accomplish the ends of good tillage. Sudan Grass. — During the season of 1915 the results secured from Sudan grass grown for forage were not especially encourag - ing. While the tonnage per acre was about the same as sorghum the Sudan grass forage is not relished by the cattle so much as the sorghum forage. Irrigation. — On account of an abnormally wet season, with a precipitation of 1.73 times the normal, pumping water for irrigation was not tried sufficiently to give any dependable data. Conifers. — These conditions, however, were very favorable for transplanting conifer trees. There were about 6,000 conifers, chiefly Bull Pine and Jack Pine, planted in fields or transplanted in beds. With practically the same method of handling the trees, almost perfect stands were secured in 1915, where failures had been experienced during previous years of normal rainfall. Ornamental Shrubs. — Many shrubs and ornamental trees heretofore untried at this Station were planted. While the list of ornamental plants that have proved hardy under these condi- </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Twenty-ninth Annual Report. 15 tions is not as long as a similar list at Lincoln, yet there are sufficient shrubs entirely hardy to make home decoration as practical, from this viewpoint, as in eastern Nebraska. Most prominent among these shrubs are the Honeysuckle, Mock Orange, Spirea Van Houttei, Flowering Almond, Berberry, Privet, Tamarisk, Cut Leaf Sumac, Golden Elder, Buckthorn, and others. Pork Production. — The work in pork production is being continued. Mature brood sows have been carried during the period of pregnancy on alfalfa and water with fair success, tho we deem it a better practice under normal conditions to feed a light grain ration of 1 pound of grain daily per 100 pounds weight of the hog with a good quality of alfalfa hay in a rack. Stewing or cooking alfalfa has increased the rate of gains slightly and decreased slightly the food eaten per 100 pounds of gain. How - ever, the cost of stewing the alfalfa probably is greater than the advantages gained. The proportions of corn, tankage, and alfalfa hay eaten from self-feeders by fall shoats during the winter, where skim milk formed a part of the ration, were corn 85.1, alfalfa hay 8.1, and tankage 6.8. The food consumed for 100 pounds of gain was corn 291.5 pounds, alfalfa hay 27.8 pounds, tankage 23.5 pounds, and skim milk 258 pounds. The Dairy Herd. — The dairy established during the pre - ceding biennium is progressing favorably. It will, however, require some time to develop a herd that can be used for exact experimental purposes, since young, undeveloped cows do not serve for experimental work. That we have some cows in the herd that should serve as excellent foundation stock is shown by the records given below of a seven-day test of three heifers. A perusal of the records given in the Holstein-Friesian Blue Book indicates that these heifers are worthy of a place in the best herds in America.

The rate of gain of the three lots was nearly the same but a trifle in favor of the lot fed silage. The gain per head weekly in </seg>
            <seg id="p016">Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska. 16 this lot was nearly 2.5 pounds. With corn valued at 60 cents per bushel, cottonseed cake at $30 per ton, silage at $4 per ton, and alfalfa hay at $8 per ton, the lambs fed cottonseed cake gave a little more profit than those fed either of the other two rations, but probably not sufficiently more profit to warrant the feeding of cottonseed cake when the price is much above $30 per ton. Four dollars per ton was too high a price for silage to permit the lambs fed the ration containing silage to produce as much profit as the lambs fed either of the other two rations. The cost of 100 pounds of gain was $5.70 upon a ration of corn and alfalfa hay. Growing Live Stock. — In a country where grain production is uncertain during a considerable proportion of the years, but where forage may be grown almost every year with a great degree of certainty, it seems a wise practice to utilize to the fullest extent ajl the forage and grain produced. This neces - sitates the keeping of live stock. As a means of preserving the immature crop and of holding feed in reserve to tide over un - favorable seasons, the silo has a valuable and permanent place in dry land agriculture. We are also convinced that for these conditions the pit silo has many advantages, chief among which are its low cost and permanency. A pit silo 13 \ feet by 30 feet, capacity 75 tons, was made on the Substation farm last fall. The labor and material were as follows: 31 sacks cement 6 loads of sand I85 days' labor excavating 4§ days' labor — plasterer and helper 3 days for one horse Device for drawing out silage cost about $10. The cooperative work in dry land farming investigations with the United States Department of Agriculture is continued. THE VALENTINE SUBSTATION. During the past year a dairy herd has also been established on the Valentine Substation and a study of the use of native forage as a dairy ration is continued. An extensive bulletin covering the Sand Hills conditions and the results of experiments conducted for several years is in press. Potatoes. — The growing importance of the potato industry within the Sand Hills country and the increased interest in their cultivation appeared to warrant a new series of experiments, and for this purpose seed of a number of new varieties was </seg>

One of these, known as Maule's Early Thorobred, has greatly outyielded the Irish Cobbler and every other variety with which it was placed in competition, producing clean, well-matured, even-sized tubers of splendid quality. In connection with this, and all other experiments con - ducted here in 1915, it ought not to be overlooked that weather conditions were abnormal, with a temperature much below normal, and precipitation more than twice the average of the five preceding years. Another potato experiment to try to determine what effect the continued growing of the same potatoes on the average light sandy soil of the district has upon the vitality and other qualities of the seed so produced, and whether the practice of producing seed on some soil within the Sand Hills section distinctly different in character from that on which the crop itself is to be raised would have beneficial results, comparing those obtained in this way with those from seed produced without any radical change of soil conditions, and both with the results obtained from im - ported seed of the same variety, was begun this year. If it could be established that the change of seed obtained by growing it in say the muck soils of the wet valley or dry valley bottoms and planting out on the lighter uplands where the great bulk of the potato crop is grown was a distinct benefit, such knowledge would be of great benefit to potato growers. Winter Wheat. — Some experiments with specially early maturing winter wheats were begun on the heavier and lower soils of the Substation, with the object of comparing their suit - ability for growing in a rotation with corn. Alfalfa. — Several new varieties of alfalfa were tested during the 1915 season. Of these the most promising and interesting on account of its origin and the color of its flowers is Hansen's Semi-palatinsk, a yellow flowered variety imported from the uplands of Asia. It is evidently a good drouth register, being low set in the crowns, and having its leaves and stems quite exceptionally fine. Its somewhat recumbent habit of growth points it out as more suitable for grazing than for hay production. In common with all other varieties of clover and alfalfa grown here, it matured little or no seed last year. The experiences obtained during 1915 went to confirm the conclusion previously arrived at, that the safest way to obtain a stand of alfalfa on the lighter class of Sand Hills soils is to sow it on </seg>

For this purpose great care should be taken when breaking to see that the work is thoroly well done; otherwise, trouble from grass will develop. Milk Production. — More than half of the cows with which the dairy at the Valentine Substation was stocked were of the common sort. These are being gradually replaced with grade Holsteins and with pure-bred Holsteins of our own raising. Complete records of production and cost are being kept, and experiments with different concentrated feeds are being con - ducted. THE SCOTTSBLUFF SUBSTATION. The work of the Scottsbluff Experimental Substation, carried on in cooperation with the United States Department of Agricul - ture, has continued along the same lines as formerly. The irrigation rotation work and the dry land rotation and tillage work of previous years has been continued. Corn is being grown under irrigation to determine when and how to irrigate it and handle the crop under western Nebraska conditions, so that a corn crop may be grown in a short season and still mature before frost. The best varieties of potato stock and the best methods of tillage and irrigation for this crop are being extensively studied. Experiments have been undertaken to determine the relative value of forage crops as pasture for dairy cattle. Records are kept of the amount of pasture per acre secured from different mixtures of pasture grasses. The results to date indicate that irrigated land may profitably be used for the pasture of dairy cows. The value of irrigated alfalfa for hog pasture and the utiliza - tion of locally grown crops such as corn, wheat, barley, and sugar beets has been studied. Sugar-beet molasses is being used in winter feeding. Sheep feeding experiments are being carried on, special attention being given to the use of local crops, such as beet tops, mangels, and alfalfa hay. THE CULBERTSON DEMONSTRATION FARM. The Demonstration Farm at Culbertson, Nebraska, was ordered sold by the last Legislature, no appropriation being made for its support. This farm has been sold by the Regents in accordance with the instructions of the Legislature, to Mr. S. E. Solomon of McCook, Nebr., and the University will give pos - session on March 1, 1916.

Advertising was carried on in a sufficient number of leading papers of the State to give wide publicity to the fact that the farm was for sale. An effort was made to sell this farm for the highest cash price, but the bid of Mr. Solomon of $8,000 was the highest definite offer secured. THE STATION STAFF Within the past year the following changes in the Station staff have taken place: Professor W. J. Morrill has resigned to accept a position as Forester in the Colorado State Agricultural College. Professor P. B. Barker has resigned to accept a position as Extension Professor in Agronomy at the University of Missouri. Mr. W. M. Osborn has resigned from the North Platte Station, to become Superintendent of a Federal Station at Lawton, Oklahoma. Mr. Homer L. Nye has resigned on account of the sale of the Culbertson farm by order of the Legislature. Mr. L. L. Zook has been appointed by the United States Department of Agriculture as Agronomist at the North Platte Station, in charge of their cooperative work, succeeding Mr. W. M. Osborn. IMPROVEMENTS. A Dairy Industry Hall is being erected at the University Farm, for College and Station work. This building, when com - pleted, with its equipment will cost approximately $175,000. The building should be ready for use by September, 1916. A Horse Barn has been erected at the University Farm, to accommodate both College and Station horses, at a cost of $30,000. This includes a judging pavilion and other facilities for College instruction and work which are not connected with the housing of horses. A heating plant has been erected for College and Station purposes, together with steam tunnels and additional boilers, costing approximately $52,000. Plans have been drawn for an Agricultural Engineering building to be used for both College and Station work, and the contract will be let so that work will begin in the spring of 1916. This building is estimated to cost about $150,000. Scottsbluff.— The dairy stable at the Scottsbluff Station has been enlarged and improved, at a cost of $600 or $800. North Platte. — At the North Platte Substation a cottage has been erected, of hollow tile with stucco, costing $3,000. A shed for dairy cattle has been erected, of concrete covered with stucco, 32 by 96 feet, costing $1,250. </seg>

            <seg id="p022">22 Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska. ANNUAL REPORT AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SERVICE. The first appropriation for Agricultural Extension work was made for carrying on Fanners' Institutes for the biennium of 1897-99 and amounted to $3,000. Until the year 1906, practically all of the work was Farmers' Institute work. After that, Exten - sion Schools and Boys' and Girls' Clubs were put in as a part of the extension work. The first Extension School was conducted in Pawnee County during the winter of 1906-07. In September, 1911, the title of the department having the extension work in charge was changed from Farmers' Institute Department to Agricultural Extension Department with a Superintendent in charge. In 1914 the title was again changed to Extension Service of the College of Agriculture with a Director in charge. In 1915 the State Legislature passed and the Governor signed a law which accepted the provisions of the Smith-Lever Act. The Extension Service is organized coordinate with the Experiment Station as a part of the College of Agriculture. The Service itself is divided into departments or divisions with an executive officer in charge of each. At present the divisions comprise the following: County Agents, Boys' and Girls' Clubs, Home Economics, Information Service, Movable Schools, and Special Meetings. The Extension Service bears the same relation to the College of Agriculture as does the Experiment Station, and the College is organized as a part of the University. A close cooperative relationship exists between the State Board of Agriculture, the State Horticultural Society, the State Department of Public Instruction, and other State departments and societies, not by law but by agreement. County associations, known as County Farmers' Associations, taking part in the direction of the County Agent Work, cooperate with the Extension Service, and there are also Farmers' Institute Associations and other local organiza - tions which cooperate with the Service. The revenue for the extension work comes from four sources: (1) Smith-Lever, (2) State appropriation, (3) United States Department of Agriculture (4) local contributions. The use of Smith-Lever money is limited by terms of the Smith-Lever Act. That portion of the State money which offsets Smith-Lever funds is limited by the same Act. The State money is appropriated for agricultural extension work including Fanners' Institutes. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Twenty-ninth Annual Report. 23 United States Department of Agriculture money is limited by project agreements, and the local money is raised for special extension work in particular communities.

ISIS The Extension Service is housed in Agricultural Hall at the University Farm, which building also contains the administration offices of the College, Station, and School of Agriculture, as well as the library and some classrooms. A total of 36 extension bulletins has been published. Cir - culars and leaflets from the various divisions have been printed as occasion has demanded. Extension specialists or persons especially prepared to write material for bulletins, circulars, and leaflets prepare the material. The publications are distributed upon special request and to a mailing list which is kept at the College. The work of the Extension Service in all its divisions is put on a project basis. These projects are kept on file at the Ex - tension Service and at the States Relations Service Office of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, together with progress reports on the same. The county agents have their work on a project basis, as do also the extension specialists in the various depart - ments at the College. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska. The general condition of the extension work is good and the outlook for the coming years is bright. The sympathy of the people in the State for the work is increasing, and the demand at the present for extension workers far exceeds the ability of the Extension Service to supply. UNIVERSITY OF NCMASKA COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE EXTENSION SERVICE • COUNTIES HAVING COUNTY AGENTS ■ COUNTIES HAVING PRELIMINARY ORGANIZATIONS FARM DEMONSTRATORS IN NEBRASKA 1915 COUNTY AGENT WORK Eight counties have carried on the County Agricultural Agent work during 1915. Those counties, together with the County Agents, are as follows: Gage County 0. H. Liebers Seward County A. H. Beckhoff Thurston County J. F. Coupe Dakota County Hugh Raymond Madison County A. G. George Dawes County C. S. Hawk Kimball County G. 0. Unruh Boxbutte County F. M. Seidell </seg>
            <seg id="p025">Twenty-ninth Annual Report. 25 In addition, eight counties have temporary Farmers' Associa - tions formed for the purpose of undertaking County Agricultural Agent work as soon as the counties can be properly organized. These temporary associations were formed this year, or have been in effect previous to this year. Four other counties this year have started a movement to organize for conducting County Agent work. Hog Cholera Control.— Practically all of the County Agents took up the project of hog cholera control as the leading feature in their work. They have vaccinated over 12,000 hogs in the effort made to control and eradicate this disease. In all but two instances the County Agents have succeeded in con - fining the disease on the place where it first appeared. By quick action and by community cooperation they have succeeded in isolating the outbreaks, cleaning up after the disease has abated, and preventing the further spread. Where outbreaks have occurred they have held community meetings, have formed anti-hog cholera clubs, started clean-up campaigns, and have encouraged the people of the neighborhood to take action against spreading the disease. This has probably been the most valuable work accomplished by the County Agents. Farm Management Record Work.— All the County Agents have secured records of farm businesses in their counties. These farm records have been summarized and tabulated to show the factors which influence profits on the farm. Altogether the County Agents have 339 complete records of farm businesses. Most of these have been summarized and returned to the farmers with suggestions for improvements in the management of their farms. In this work the County Agents were assisted by the Department of Farm Management of the College of Agriculture, and by Messrs. H. F. Williams and R. R. Spafford, Farm Manage - ment Demonstrators. Crop Improvement Work. — A total of 688 demonstrations were started by County Agents for the purpose of improving farm crops. Of these, 184 were to show the value of treating seed oats for the prevention of smut. Twenty-two demonstrations were started to show the superiority of home grown seed corn compared with imported seed corn. The adaptability of certain forage crops to various parts of the State was shown in 32 demon - strations with feterita, 50 with Sudan grass, and 42 with sweet clover. The value of inoculating alfalfa seed was shown in 46 demonstrations. The value of rolling and harrowing winter wheat was shown in 26 demonstrations. One hundred thirty </seg>
            <seg id="p026">Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska. 26 demonstrations were undertaken with corn, and 10 with pastures. Demonstrations in the seeding of alfalfa were undertaken in 34 instances. In the work with potatoes, northern seed was compared with home grown seed. In Gage County there was an increase of 92 bushels to the acre in favor of northern grown seed. In Boxbutte County it was determined that the seed of potatoes affected with dry rot reduced the yield at the rate of 76.88 as compared with clean seed. Potatoes affected with scab and treated gave a yield of 30 bushels per acre more than the same potatoes not treated. Clean potatoes, that is, free from scab, gave an increase of 73 bushels per acre over scabby seed that was not treated. This work was in cooperation with the Depart - ment of Agricultural Botany, University of Nebraska. Orchard Improvement Work.— Forty-two orchards were used by the County Agents in demonstrating the practicability of pruning and spraying in order to insure clean and marketable fruit. A few trees left as checks in these orchards produced practically no clean marketable fruit this year. Live Stock Improvement Work.— In work tending toward the improvement of live stock, the County Agents have been instrumental in getting better sires introduced into their counties and have formed several breed associations, and in one case a County Live Stock Improvement Association. Testing cows for milk production has also been undertaken for the purpose of weeding out unprofitable cows. The testing of cattle for tuber - culosis has been taken up in two counties. In both cases a strenuous campaign has been made to have all cattle tested, especially those which furnish dairy products to towns and cities. Agricultural Engineering Work. — With the assistance of the specialist in agricultural engineering several drainage projects have been started in four of the counties. In every case they have been successful, and they now stand as demonstrations to show the value of proper drainage. The installation of water systems has been demonstrated in several of the counties. Plan - ning and laying out farmsteads has also been given considerable attention. Attention has also been given to the proper con - struction of the different types of silos. In five instances this year, observation trips have been made by farmers and the County Agent to study the various types of silos found within the county. With the cooperation of the County Superintendents of Schools and with the assistance of extension workers in charge of club </seg>
            <seg id="p027">Twenty-ninth Annual Report. 27 work, the County Agents have succeeded in getting 944 boys and girls enrolled in some form of agricultural or home economics work. These boys and girls have undertaken on their own responsibility to grow an acre of corn, a plat of potatoes, a garden, raise a pig, or do cooking and sewing work. The County Agents have addressed 131 schools in their counties in the furtherance of this work. Meetings. — Up to December 1 approximately 345 indoor meetings had been held by the County Agents with a total attendance of 14,628. At a number of these meetings the County Agent was assisted by Extension workers from the College of Agriculture. In addition, 62 field meetings were held during the season at which time inspections were made of the various demonstrations carried on in the counties. These meetings were attended by 2,489 farmers. Farmers' Exchanges. — Fanners' exchanges have been estab - lished in all of the counties employing County Agricultural Agents as a part of the county associations' work. By using the County Agent's office as the medium of extending information of things held in the county for sale and of things desired for purchase, these offices have been the means of conducting a business amounting to $41,102.20 up to December 1. This in - cludes the transfer of breeding stock, other live stock, seeds, and grains, farm machinery, etc. In Boxbutte and Kimball Counties the activities of the County Agents and the local Farmers' Associations in attempting to find a better market for potatoes succeeded in getting buyers to come to those counties, which raised the price of potatoes from 5 to 7 cents per bushel above that paid in neighboring towns. Three carloads of potatoes were sold thru the farmers' exchange of Boxbutte County, netting the owners $142 above the local price paid at that time. BOYS' AND GIRLS' CLUB WORK. Special emphasis in this division has been given during the past year to coupling the club work more closely with public school work. The club age is from 10 to 18 years inclusive.

About 800 specially prepared farm record books will be placed in the hands of farmers in the next three months. These will be closely supervised by men in charge of the Nebraska Farm Management Survey. Reports compiled from these record books will demonstrate the extent to which farm profits are affected by certain factors largely within individual control. HOME ECONOMICS WORK. During the year 1915 women's meetings were held at 244 points, with a total of 500 meetings. The total number of women in attendance at all meetings was 43,085. Twenty-three Short Courses were held, including 13 first - year, 3 second-year, and 1 third-year Short Course, as well as 6 Junior Short Courses. The total attendance at the morning and afternoon sessions was 9,830. One-thousand three hundred and eighty women attended the evening sessions, making a total of 11,210 women in attendance at Short Course sessions. The average attendance at day sessions was 72. The average weekly attendance at day sessions was 578. During the year, 64 talks were given at women's club meet - ings, and 4,552 women reached in this way.

Talks on home dressmaking and the planning and arrangement of the kitchen have also been given, as well as talks on health questions. At short courses about half the time available is given over to the study of foods, while the other half is about equally divided between textiles and the home. The most important follow-up work is the formation and assistance of women's clubs for the study of home economics. A number of libraries have been assisted in selecting home economics literature. Junior Short Course programs are so planned that each girl in attendance has a chance to do individual work in cooking as well as in sewing. Special equipment has been provided for Junior Short Courses. UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE EXTENSION SERVICE WOMEN'S CLUBS ASSISTED IN 1915 During the year from January 1, 1915, to January 1, 1916, the women's club section of the home economics work had requests for outlines from 373 women's organizations, — mostly women's clubs. This means that these clubs are devoting their time either wholly or in part to some phase of the home economics work. Averaging the membership at 45, which is conservative, because </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Twenty-ninth Annual Report. 31 several run over 100 and very few under 20, 16,785 women, have been assisted in planning work. One hundred and two of these clubs are purely rural, and in many instances are the social center of the community life. These are heartily encouraged to meet even tho they do not expect to do any home economics work. In every instance thus far they have written for work to do. Some of them are doing excellent work. The remaining 271 clubs are in towns ranging in population from less than 100 to the city of Omaha. Seventy-nine clubs have been visited. Talks have been given, work has been planned, and any other service that seemed most helpful for them has been rendered. In this way 3,830 women have been reached. The Extension Service helped in organizing six rural clubs. We have had several calls for assistance by women who are assisting girls in the high school by what is known as the Crete plan. We have given what assistance we could. In addition to this work many special meetings and extension schools were held, and much individual assistance given in home planning and managing.

Other special meetings were held with an approx - imate attendance of 30,000. Eight Extension Schools of agriculture and home economics were held with an attendance of 12,600. INFORMATION SERVICE. The Extension News Service has been used in every county in Nebraska during the past year and by 91 per cent of the papers representing 97 per cent of the circulation. The total number of subscribers to these papers last year was 1,158,639. In addition 623 special items have been furnished, represent - ing 900,000 words. With these items were furnished 93 cuts, and 67 photographs, or 160 illustrations. The papers using these special articles and the illustrations represent an aggregate circulation of 632,348. During the past year the Extension News Service and special articles have been used in at least 14 States. The papers known to use the Service in these States have a circulation of 2,502,786. These States are Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Georgia, District of Columbia, Florida, and Washington. The Extension News Service has been translated into German, Bohemian, Polish, Swedish, Danish, and the tongue of the Indians. During the past year 11 extension bulletins have been edited of the general series, 34 pamphlets, and 32 miscellaneous outlines, recipe sheets, and circulars, or 67 extension publication, in addi - tion to the 10 bulletins of larger size of the Agricultural Experi - ment Station. Beginning September 1, the agricultural editor, in charge of Extension and Station publications, was given supervision over the making of charts for the College and the filing of charts and stereopticon lantern slides for the Extension Service. </seg>
