That the results in former bulletins ■ l&gt;e compared readily with the results here reported, the MM :es for feed and hogs have been used. During recent years the e of both corn and hogs has risen. The average price paid for i by the Substation during the three years under consider;! was «")!.:&gt; cents per bushel and the average net price received hogs was $7.04 per Itt pounds. These prices give much more At on the hogs than the prices used in this bulletin, which are as follows: Where chopped alfalfa or alfalfa meal was a part of any ration the experiment, all the grain was ground. The alfafa meal was :ed with the grain ; the chopjied alfalfa was put into the trough I the grain poured over it. The feed was weighed separately each lot at each feeding time. The hogs had access to water all times unless the weather was such that the water froze ckly.

The purpose was lo les, Ihe ad\ isaliilit v of feeding a ration of cho|i|&gt;e.l alfalfa hay mixed witli an eipial weight of ground grain, and of feeding the alfalfa hay in a rack ami feedittg shelled coin in a trough. Kaeh id' these two rations was fed to 10 sows from early in November until the lirst or middle of March, or for 1U1 days on the average. The feed con - sumed daily amounted to l.i:: pound* of grain and 0.19 pound of alfalfa hay per HHI poUll Im weighi of the sows in the lots fed liay in a i ark. The cori wpondiiig figures for the bog* fed chopped alfalfa hay ami chopped grain mixed are 1.04 pound* of grail and 1.05 of alfalfa hay. The average daily gain of the sows ting alfalfa from a rack was (i.Tii |toiind per head. &lt; if those eating eqaal amounts by weigh) id corn and chopped alfalfa hay. the average daily gain was O.Til pound. The sows eating alfalfa from the rack were fed 1 liushel mole grain but ate 4110 pounds less hay daring the winter than the other sows. The average cost of feed for wintering a sow fed graiu and alfalfa hay in a tack was x."&gt;.j!i. The average cost of feed for wintering a sow on half grain and half chopped alfalfa hay mixed was «6.92. The average gaia in weight of ihe sows led ihe fin inir ration was SKI pounds, and of the bitter ralion. !H&gt; pounds. The gain produced by the two rations was nearly ihe same, but Ihe cos; of feed for wintering a sow mi the laliou of corn and alfalfa mixed was fl.tCI more than on Ihe other ration. With the prices of feed and boga as stated, ihe average gala in weight of the sows fed alfalfa hay in a rack more than paid for the feed eaten, while the average gain on the sows fed half grain and half alfalfa lacked $1.25 of paying the cost of the feed eaten. I The average of the four tests shows that it required n.'.i buahela ■orn and Sli pounds of alfalfa hay. or S.Si Imshels of corn and poaada of chopped alfalfa hay. to keep a sow weighing : !

The alfalfa increased this to l'.4S jMiiinds. which is still too light a ration for the most protitahle results when fattening hogs. However, this ration gave the hogs as much hulk as they would eat, which may lie an advantage, and brought them forward to the time of farrowing sufficiently fast and in a high enough condition of flesh. I That no ti-oulile occurred at (he time of farrowing and that •ly large, healthy litters were farrowed is an indication that ration has some merit. A smaller |»erceiitage of alfalfa proli f would have given cheaper as well as faster gains, hut would e made the gilts too fleshy unless the amount fed had been t considerably below a full feed. I The feed eaten by the average gilt during the four and one-half nths was e&lt;jual in value to 1&amp;6 bushels of corn. It cost a few ts more to winter a gilt than an oM sow, as these hugs were itered, but the period for the gilts was two weeks longer ami ) the gaiu per head was greater than with the old sows. The cost of wintering the gilt was less than that of wintering the sow, since the gilt made more gain than the old sow for the I eaten. Slow gains are usually more ex|»ensive than fast ns. The value of the sow ready to farrow in the spring above value of the unbred sow of the same weight in the fall should •onsidered when studying the cost uf gains made on sows while ng wintered. FOOD COST OF THE 50-POUND PIG. We have endeavored to determine the cost of the feed used in producing the average 50-pound pig raised on the Substation farm during the past four years. The sows were wintered as in - dicated on the previous pages. The record covers only the period from the time the sow was put into winter quarters, abort No - veinlter 1, until her spring litter had been weaned and the pigs had reached an average weight of 5(1 pounds. I All feed eaten by the sow during the time indicated above and feed eaten by the pigs until their average weight was 50 pounds h is charged to the sow. She is credited with the gain made in weight l&gt;etw-een the time she went into winter quarters and the le her pigs reached the 50-pound weight. She is also credited h the total weight of her pigs when their average weight was pounds. There is no account taken of any cost except that of feed. Later, interest on investment, and risk — excepting the risk on young pigs — are not taken into account. These figures are in - tended to give the cost of the feed used in producing a 50-pound </seg>

These 62 pounds are credited to the sows at $5.!)0 per 1M nds. »The average cost of the feed per sow from fall until she far - ■ed was f(i.!t,S, or the equivalent of 11.52 bushels of corn at 47 ts per bushel.

This is the net t of the feed used in producing the litter to the average weight &gt;0 pounds per pig. An average of 11.1 pigs was fan-owed per sow. The average weight of each pig at birth was 2.4 pounds. When the average weight of the pigs was 5(1 pounds each, then the average number of pigs per litter was only (1. 55.

SHORTS FOR PIGS ON ALFALFA PASTURE iMiring the summer of 1012 two lots of 25 ]&gt;igs each, while grazing on alfalfa pasture, were fed shelled corn, and a similar lot of 25 pigs kept under like conditions was fed a ration of three - fourths corn and one-fourth shorts. One lot of pigs fed corn gave exactly the same gain with the same amount of feed for 1"" |Hiunds of gain as the lot fed corn and shorts. The other lot fed corn gained slightly faster and \tsed less grain for 100 pounds of gain than the lot fed corn and shorts. There were two other lots of 25 pigs each kept under the same conditions. The pigs in one lot were fed corn and those in the other lot were fed half corn and half shorts. Of these two lots, the latter gained somewhat the faster and required less feed to produce 100 pounds of gain. Hut with shorts valued at $24 per ton and corn at 47 cents |ier Imshel, the pigs fed only corn made the cheaper gains. The profit was nearly the same from either ration. The results from the two lests. while not conclusive, would not warrant one in feeding shorts with corn to pigs grazing on alfalfa pasture when the price per ton of shorts is higher than that of corn. SOAKED OR DRY CORN FOR PIGS ON ALFALFA PASTURE t During the summer of 1913, three lots of from 20 to 25 pigs li running on alfalfa pasture were fed dry shelled corn, while i-e similar lots were fed shelled corn soaked from one feed until next. Two of the lols fed dry corn made faster and cheaper us than the corresjKUiding lots fed soaked corn. Of the other i lots, the one fed soaked corn made the faster and the cheaper ii. hut its companion lot fed dry corn did not give normal nits. The record of other similar pigs indicated that the pigs this lot did not do as well as would reasonably have l&gt;een •etad. The results of the six lots indicate that there was no antage in soaking the corn for these pigs. FIVE SUMMERS' RECORD ON GILTS.

We believe this was due to the weather being much more favorable. The change noted in the ranking of the various lots, we attribute largely to the difference in the weather. It has been our observation that corn and alfalfa give better results in comparison with rations containing mill feeds, when the winter is open and the weather mild. It seems apparent that during unfavorable weather it is an advantage to give a ration that will induce the hogs to eat more feed. Usually hogs will eat more corn when fed some tankage, oil meal, or shorts with the corn. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">17 &gt;i makes the ration more costly, and it may not be profitable le hogs would eat the game amount of corn and alfalfa with the mill product. iWe have observed also that when hogs were out of condition iriety of feeds has stimulated the appetite, caused the hogs to more, and thereby give more profitable results than corn and lfa, but when the hogs were in good condition and the weather trable we have not found any ration superior to corn and al a with the usual prices of f&lt;M&gt;dstutfs prevailing. A ration of 1 and a small percentage of a mill product having a high pro - content usually has given faster gains with less feed for 100 nds of gain than corn ami alfalfa, hut usually under normal iitious this ration lias not given as much profit as corn and WHEAT AND RYE COMPARED WITH CORN FOR FATTENING HOGS WITH AND WITHOUT ALFALFA HAY.

I Oa SeptemU'i- ■"&gt;. 1911, a lot of 04 pigs was divided into two form lots of 32 pigs each. The average weight of those in Lot was 112 pounds and of those in Lot 1M, 115 pounds. From i date until November 14. 10 weeks, each lot grazed on alfalfa ture. Lot 155 was fed .i.:'&gt;4 pounds of ground corn daily per pounds of the weight of the pigs, and Lot 156 was fed 3.30 inds of a mixture of two-thirds corn and one-third shorts. The pigs fed corn gained 0.05 pound more per head daily than those fed corn and shorts and ate 19 pounds less grain for 100 pounds gain. Using the prices given in this bulletin, shown on page 5, the pigs fed corn alone gave l.(i times as much profit as those fed corn and shorts. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">/ ork t /OuMtiiOfi. 21 From November U, l'.tll, to January 2, 1912, the two lots of hugs were kept in dry lots and were fed the grain rations indi - eatod above with alfalfa hay in racks. The weather was so ex - cessively cold that the gains on both lots were low and quite expensive. I&gt;uriug this winter j&gt;eriod of seven weeks, Lot 155 was fed 2.48 pounds of grain daily per 100 pounds of the weight of the pigs, and Lot 156 was fed 2.C0 pounds. The pigs fed the mix - ture consisting of 2 parts corn and 1 part shorts gained 0.06 pound more per head daily than those fed corn alone. The pigs gelling the former ration required 2 pounds more grain to pro - duce 100 pounds of gain than those getting the ration of corn. The profit per pig was 32 cents for those fed corn alone and 0.4 cent for those fed coru and shorts. If we combine the summer and the winter periods, we find the average daily gain was the same on both lots, and that e were required 16 pounds more of the corn and snorts than lie corn alone to produce 100 pounds of gain. The profit on pigs fed corn alone was almost twice as much as on those fed l and shorts. This is considering corn worth 47 cents per lei, shorts |24 per ton, and hogs $5.90 per 100 pounds. If the •ts had cost f 15.17 per ton it would have given the same profit orn at 47 cents per bushel in this test. On this basis, corn is th 75 cents j&gt;er bushel when shorts is worth f24 per ton. ALFALFA TEA AND ALFALFA TEA GROUNDS IN A RATION FOR WINTERING SHOATS. Kin February S. 1!»12, I'll fall shoats weighing about 50 pounds i were divided into two uniform lots of 10 pigs each. Another of 20 pigs weighing 70 pounds each was divided into two uni - u lots of IS pigs each. I The grain ration for all lots was ."5 parts corn and 1 part rts. Chapped alfalfa was kept in racks where each lot had ess to it at all times. The feed for Lot 157 was made into a :-k slop with warm water. The feed for Lot 158 was wet with made by stewing chopjied alfalfa for one hour. The alfalfa d for making tea for each feed amounted to about 20 per cent the grain ration.

All feed was the same for the two lots except that the i for Lot 157 was wet with warm water, while the feed for 158 was wet with warm alfalfa tea.

For Lot MS the alfalfa was stewed and both lea and ihe groonda mixed with the grain. This lot ate about alf more alfalfa than the lot that ate Ihe alfalfa that had not n slewed. tl'he two lots made marly the same gain with a slight ad tage in favor of Ihe alfalfa lea lot. This lot ate 12 pounds grata and S5 ]iounds more alfalfa to produce 100 pounds of i than the other lot. The cost of 100 pounds of gate on the : fed tea was 7 cents higher and the profit per pijj was 7 cents than on the piga fed Ihe alfalfa without stewing. The le s of this test do not indicate that the value of the alfalfa was eased liy stewing. ■The results of ihe two lesis would not warrant the fanner in iig to much, if any, expense to slew alfalfa for ho^s. SIMMARY OF AVERAGES AND ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Aii accurate record is kept of all grain and alfalfa fed to hojp&lt; dariag the year. The boga gram on about 40 acres of alfalfa pasture lull consume only about one-half of the alfalfa. A rental of s."&gt; per acre is charged to the hoj;s. An inventory of ihe boga by weight is taken March 1 each year. From the data thus ob - tained the following annual statements ale compiled. These statements gifc I fair idea of the cost of producing pork on a Nebraska farm, only thai the fanner should produce pork cheaper since he is working entirely for piolils and is not necessarily feed ing boga the more cosily or less profitable rations and does not suffer the loss occasioned liy freijiieut weighings, and other dis - turbing factors incident to experimental work. </seg>
