The same shall be subject to lease at an annual rental of six (6) per cent on the appraised value Provided, that if two or more parties desire to lease the same land, the officer having control of the auction shall lease to the person who will pay the greater amount of cash bonus in addition to six (6) per cent on the appraised value as annual rental. Lease rentals are due in two installments, January 1 and July 1 of each year. If not paid within six months after due, the lease holders are declared delinquent and notice is sent them if their postoffice ad - dresses are known; if unknown, advertisement is made in a newspaper Ninety days after date of such notice lease contracts are declared for- feited and are subject to auction thereafter. (See Fees.) Delinquent lease holders are not permitted to bid at tht it lands they have forfeited, but at any rime before the land is actually put on the auction block they may reinstate their leases by paying all back rentals and penalty lees. (See Fees.) All school lands under lease are subject to appraisement at any time the Board of Educational Lands and Funds so elect. All leases expire twenty-five years from the first day of January next ensuing after the date of the lease. All lessees have the right, at the expiration of their lease, to apply to the County Treasurer for new lease and receive the same without competition, at the same time surrendering the old lease, paying rentals six months in advance and a lease fee of fifty cents. This will do away with the public auction only in cases where the former lessee does not apply for new lease. In such cases, the lands will be advertised and leased at public auction to the highest bidder, and all improvements on the land shall be appraised by the County Board. Improvements to be included in such appraisements shall be all build ings, orchards, trees, fencing, wells, cisterns, windmills, pumps, tanks, irrigation improvements, and also costs for labor expended in breaking sod on said tract of land and reducing same to cultivation, and for alfalfa or other crops growing upon said land.
