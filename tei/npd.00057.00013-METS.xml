            <seg id="p002"/>
            <seg id="p003">FOREWORD To His Excellency, the Governor : The Board of Control herewith transmits the Fifth Biennial Report of the State Institutions of Nebraska for the period ending June 30, 1923. The biennium formerly ended on November 30 of each even-numbered year, but this date was changed by an act of the legislature, so that this report really covers a period of thirty-one months from December 1, 1920, to June 30, 1923. During the period, no change has occurred in the personnel of the Board, but several changes have been made in the chief officers of institutions. Dr. Beverly A. Finkle, superintendent of the Orthopedic Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska, resigned to enter private practice, and was succeeded on August 23, 1921, by Dr. J. H. Matthai. Miss Amy V. Stevens, who had been superintendent of the Home for Dependent Children, Lineoln, Nebraska, for a number of years, resigned on July 5, 1922, being succeeded by her sister, Miss Nellie Stevens. The latter served until February 19, 1923, when her resignation was received, and Miss Lena Driever was appointed to the position. We call attention with pride and pleasure to the fact that the report shows the institutions to have gone through the bien - nium without incurring any deficiencies ; although the cost of living, and consequently the cost of supporting the state's depen - dents, has certainly not decreased since the appropriations were made for the biennium. Some improvements of a permament character have been made at the various institutions during the period covered by this report. A hospital building, bakery and scullery have been erected at the Nebraska Institution for Feeble Minded, Beatrice, Nebraska ; a cottage for girls at the Girls' Training School, Geneva, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Burkett, </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Nebraska; a gymnasium building at the State Industrial School, Kearney, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, Nebraska ; a farm house and a barn at the Lincoln State Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a warehouse at the State Penitentiary, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Milford, Nebraska ; a kitchen building at the Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk, Nebraska ; a main building at the State Reformatory for Women, York, Nebraska. These buildings were badly needed, and they will have to be followed by others in the very near future if our wards are to be properly, efficiently and economically cared for. The legislature just past made provision for two or three buildings, but failed to see the necessity for several others that were urgently requested. Brief mention was made in the last report of the establishment of the Reformatory for Men at Lincoln, but the importance of the institution calls, we believe, for rather more extended notice. This institution was established as a result, primarily, of a wide recognition of the need of segregating young first-term offenders from more mature criminals. The legislature of 1921 authorized the establishment, therefore, of such an institution, making an initial approproation of $300,000. Of this sum the Board ex - pended $37,500 for 10 acres and a brick building known as the Hay ward Military Academy, later buying about 152 acres of contiguous land for the sum of $49,531.25. This land is used for farming, stock raising, dairying, and intensive gardening. Various trades are taught such as tailoring, shoe repairing, carpentry and joinery, brick laying, electricity, automobile repairing, launder - ing, engineering, firing, and barbering. The manual labor about the institution is, of course, performed by the inmates, of which there are at this date 189. Mr. A. W. Miller, the superintendent, is doing much constructive work with the young men committed to his charge, and we believe the institution is amply justifying itself. The difficulty of employing the penitentiary inmates at suitable labor that does not conflict too much with the prerogatives of the free workers of our state, has been pretty well overcome. The state still operates the fibre furniture factory which has been at the prison for some years, and has also established relations with the Oberman Company by which shirts are made and disposed of with a minimum of competition with free labor. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 INMATE POPULATION There are seventeen institutions under the control of the Board, and at this time (July 1, 1923) the inmate population is 5917, as compared with an average of 4980 for the biennium ending in 1921, and 4907 for the biennium just prior to that. The following table will be found of interest as showing the population of the different institutions during the past two biennia : Av. pop. Av. pop.

About 800 acres are rented in addition. Details of operation are given in the reports from the several superintendents which are appended hereto. The health of the inmate population has been generally good during the past biennium. We are pleased to be able to report that no epidemic has broken out at any of the institutions, and our medical men have been able to cope with such sporadic cases of contagious disease as have appeared. In conclusion we wish to express our appreciation of the efforts of the officers and employees of the various institutions in striving to bring about a betterment of the living conditions of the wards under their care. We wish also to thank the Governor for his manifestations of interest and for his assistance in the work of this department, and we trust that he will continue his efforts to help us provide better means of caring for the wards of the state.

            <seg id="p019">19 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. At this time attention at the Home is centered on the new hospital, now very near completion. The original appropriation of $125,000 was cut to $115,000 by the special session of the Legislature. This cut resulted in the south wing of the building being eliminated. The building will accommodate approximately 100 patients and fills a long felt want. The old hospital was inadequate and poorly equipped, lacking in proper toilet facilities, cooking conveniences, and satisfactory room for both patients and employees. The new building will permit the caring for members who are not strictly hospital patients, but who, because of infirmities, need more care than could be provided were they to live in other quarters. There is a large number in this class, both men and women, who will be greatly benefited by the conveniences the new building will afford. The fully equipped diet kitchens will greatly aid in the preparing and dispensing of proper food. Two large living rooms and two porches of wide exent will furnish no end of comfort for those who are to be cared for here. The hospital is three stories in height. A noteworthy feature is the ramp connect - ing the floors, thus doing away with stair-climbing, a laborious task for old people. A tunnel, 700 feet in length, connects with the old hospital, the main building and the power plant. Service wires, steam and water lines are carried through this tunnel. It was constructed with the view of using it for passage if necessary. It is the plan to completely renovate the old hospital and to make it habitable for those who desire to move in from cottages and take their meals inside. A dining room which can accommo - date 200 persons is a part of the new building. A much needed improvement has been made in the complete tearing away and building anew of the kitchen in the main building and also the dining room adjoining. The old kitchen was inadequate, unsanitary and in a dilapidated condition. It presents a different sight today with its tiled floor and wainscotting. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 We have been able to furnish the greater share of meat during the past winter from our own stock of cattle and hogs. Our dairy herd supplies our milk needs and we rely on our garden to provide vegetables. The population at the Home is gradually falling off but the new class of members now being admitted and the decline in general health of the membership results in the need of more individual attention which in part offsets an otherwise marked decrease in maintenance cost. As the members move into the main buildings and take their meals from the dining rooms, it will cut down the maintenance item, as the furnishing of rations to the outside colony is an expensive feature. The Grand Island Transit Company now furnishes bus service from Grand Island to the Home every half hour for 18 hours of the day. As the institution is nearly 3 miles from town, the worth and convenience of this accommodation cannot be over estimated. The next logical step is a paved driveway through the grounds, or. if not paved, some sort of surfaced roadway is almost a necessity. A hard surfaced road, properly curbed and landscaped would greatly enhance the attractiveness of the grounds to say nothing of its utility. During the next biennium a certain amount of repairs and renovating will have to be done on the convalescent, main and east brick buildings. These buildings are all old and it is difficult to keep them in proper condition, but if they are to be kept habitable many of the rooms will have to be painted, and. no doubt, a good deal of repair work done. In submitting this report, we, the officers and members of the Home, desire to express to the Board our appreciation for their co-operation and kind consideration of our needs at all times. Yours respectfully, ADDISON WAIT, Commandant. </seg>

            <seg id="p031">31 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I submit my report for the period ending June 30, 1923. The improvements made at the Home are supplemental to those reported November 30, 1920, and June 30, 1921, and are listed as follows : VVe built 80 rods of fence west of the New Hospital at a cost of $29.60 for posts and fencing. A brick coal house, with protection to the west kitchen door 17'xl3'x7', at the new Hospital, cost $156.16 for extra labor and material. A frame hog pen 12'x2S' with 5" hollow tile floor and cement feed floor 12'xl8' with cement trough^cost for cement and new lumber $55.37. * Changing office from second to first floor, changes made on second floor, carpenter, plaster, plumbing and labor, $203.59. New floor in pump house, lumber and nails, $95.00. Rebuilt entire fence on Home grounds, 200 rods, at cost for extra labor of $24.00. On Arbor Day set out thirty elm trees on Hospital grounds, all of which are growing. Mindful of the state-wide demand for the reduction ot taxes and rigid economy in the expenditures for State Institutions, com - bined with conditions over which I, seemingly, had no control, I regret that I could not have done more to bring the Home up to that standard that would compare favorably with the Home of any state. The Adjutant's report will give the usual statistics and present our conditions financially and otherwise. The general health of the members is good and the great majority contented. I cannot close without returning thanks to the Great Com- </seg>
