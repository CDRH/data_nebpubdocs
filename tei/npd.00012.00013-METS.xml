REPORT. 

To the Honorable John H. Mickey } Governor, and the Board 

of Public Lands and Buildings: 

I have the honor to submit the following report for the 
term ending November 30, 1904 : 

Upon taking charge of this "home" as commandant on December 
1, 1903, I found all of the funds in excellent condi 
tion excepting the fuel, engine, oils, and repairs fund, painting 
and repair fund, and improvements and repair fund. I 
do not consider that any person is particularly at fault for 
this condition of funds. The spring and summer of 1903, 
prior to my taking charge, a number of improvements and 
repairs were commenced and carried, later, to a successful 
completion, viz., resetting boilers, reconstructing the heating 
and water system, and painting, shingling, and repairing 
the main building and some of the hospitals. It was found 
that the repairs needed were so much more extensive than 
estimated that all of the appropriations for these funds were 
exhausted and deficiencies incurred. 

With this report you will find estimates for the coming 
biennium. I have carefully considered the prospective m 
of the institution, and in asking for a considerable increase 
in the appropriations for some of the funds, I feel that I am 
justified in so doing and only asking for appropriations 
necessary for the improvement of existing conditions. 

On December 1, 1902, there were 415 members; on N&lt;&gt;\ 
her 30, 1904, there was a membership of 464, an increase of 
49. In addition to this, there have been 16 applicat 
favorably acted upon by the visiting and examining board, 
who have, as yet, not been notified to report at the home for </seg>

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

ESTIMATED EXPENSES FOR THE COMING BIENNIDM, 

Ii addition to the above estimates, I desire to call your 
ation to some improvements to the Home which I deem 
lutely necessary. In view of the fact that there is acniodation 
for from 350 to 375 people in the Home, with 
jmbership of 100 in excess of that, I would recommend 
an administration building be erected, which would 
ide offices, officers' quarters, board room, guest rooms, 
len, and dining room, thus relieving the main building, 
placing about two-thirds of the first floor of that building

SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' HOME. 

for the accommodation of the members of the home. For 
this building I would recommend an appropriation of twentyfive 
thousand dollars ($25,000). 

11 addition to the west hospital for the accommodation 
•om thirty (30) to fifty (50) patients. (I respectfully 
your attention to Dr. Randall's report) For this build[ 
would recommend an appropriation of seven thousand 

1 would also recommend that a system of antiseptic sin 
be installed. The State Architect, Mr. Tyler, advises 
that it can be constructed for fifteen hundred dollars 
500). I would recommend that that amount be appro- 

K would also recommend that the system of fire escape be 
iged from the present antiquated system of a steep stairfour 
stories high to some more modern and safe appli- 

Klso that an addition be added to the cow barn for twentyt 
(28) more cows, estimated cost thirteen hundred and 
dollars ($1,350). 

Also that all farm buildings be painted, estimated cost 
three hundred and seventy-five dollars ($375) ; shingling iea 
house, estimated cost fifty -one dollars ($51) ; shingling seven 
cottages, estimated cost four hundred and ten dollars (f410) ; 
for painting seven (7) cottages, four hundred and fifty dollars 
($450) ; for painting east hospital, one hundred and fifty 
dollars ($150) ; for painting two east hospitals, three hundred 
dollars ($300) ; for scraping and painting standpipe, 
one hundred dollars ($100) ; for painting and repairs of all 
kinds, I would recommend an appropriation of three thousand 
dollars ($3,000). This last item is for the thousand 
little repairs that are necessary in a place of this kind. 

I would call your attention to tabulated statement of farm 
garden products raised, also cattle and hogs butchered 
on hand. In this connection will say that the stock of 
kinds are in excellent condition and that the crops of </seg>

farm and garden products can not be excelled. I have made 
this report as short as is consistent with efficiency. 

I a the management of the Home I have economized 
rever it was possible without detriment to the members 
he Home, and in this I have been assisted by the officers of 
Home. I desire to thank them and the members generally 
their assistance in making this a pleasant home. To the 
iting and Examining Board I am under obligations for 
1 and considerate treatment. To the Governor and the 
xd of Public Lands and Buildings I appreciate sincerely 
courteous treatment I have received. 

Respectfully submitted, 

W. S. Askwith, 

Commandant. </seg>

Col. W. S. Askwith, Commandant : 

Dear Sir — I have the honor herewith to submit my report 

for the biennium ending November 30, 1904. 

Since my last biennial report there have died at the home 

61, and 10 absent on furlough ; total 71 — 55 men, 16 women ; 

41 were buried at the home cemetery. One death was from 

morphine poisoning, whether with suicidal intention is not 

known, but she was a morphine habitue. 

On the 27th of May, 1904, a case of smallpox made its ap- 

pearance in the hospital. It was immediately removed to 

a tent on the prairie, one-quarter mile away, a pest house 

was built later, and every precaution by vaccination, fumiga- 

tion, and quarantine taken to prevent its spreading through- 

out the home There were four cases in all; no deaths; one 

case a man past seventy-six years, quite severe. All members 

were required to be vaccinated. The quarantine was removed 

first week in July. 

The crowded condition of the hospital is such that all avail- 

able space, the surgeon's apartments and dining room, in the 

hospital built four years ago, has been given up and con- 

verted into wards. All beds are filled and all small rooms 

designed for one bed each have two. I have no room in which 

to place new cases; have to treat many of the acute cases in </seg>

their rooms and left to the care of their room-mates. This 
is all wrong. The sick should be removed to a room in the 
hospital where a nurse can care for them. They deserve it, 
and the health and comfort of their comrades require their 
removal. There should be at all times several spare beds for 
the reception of sick and the hospital cases from new arrivals. 
There are quite a number of whose condition is such 
that they should be in single rooms by themselves, not 
crowded in, as they now are with others, to whom they are 
a great annoyance. There are several now quartered in the 
main building who should be in the hospital in rooms by 
themselves. The feeble condition of many of those admitted 
of late is in marked contrast with those coming two and 
three years ago. There should be added to the hospital at 
least forty rooms to be anyways adequate to meet the demands 
that will most probably be made upon this department 
during the next biennhim. 

I he helpless and mental condition is such of a number of 
ents that they have to be cared for like little children, 
strong men are required to lift and attend on them. We 
i been employing membere to do this work, but they are 
ing too old and feeble to perform such arduous labor, 
, by the time one gets familiar with his duties, he fails. 
another has to be secured and broken into the work. It 
dw almost impossible to find one who will take service in 
hospital. The time surely has arrived when younger and 
ng men must be secured for that work. 

The appropriation for employees' wages I would recommend 
be* increased so that four men and two women civilians 
can be employed for dav and night service in the new hospital. 


For drugs and instruments I would recommend that $2,500 
be appropriated for the next biennium. 

tam pleased to note the laying of rubber matting in the 
s and linoleum in the reception room of the new hospital. 
the removal of the toilet and bathrooms from the center 
le building to the outer wings has improved the sanitary </seg>

Elition of the same. The remodeling of toilet and bathiis 
of the two old hospitals, and calcimiuiug and repainthave 
made them more wholesome, improving their sauicondition 
very much. 

.May more of the good work go on for the health and comfort 
of the country's defenders would be, in my opinion. Unvoice 
of all good people of the great commonwealth ot 
l.n.ska. 

f hanking you for your very courteous and cordial Mpport 
the improvement of conditions about the hospital, I am, 

Very truly yours,
