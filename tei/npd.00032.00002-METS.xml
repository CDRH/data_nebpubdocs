            <seg id="p005">5 Report for the biennium, December 1, 1912, to November 30, 1914 To foster the public library development of the state, to act as a public library for the state at large, and to supervise the libraries in the state insti - tutions: these are the functions of the Public library Commission. The following report covers the work of the Commission in these three lines of activity for the past two years. Since our last report the library Commission has suffered the loss of Dr. W. K. Jewett who died on March 3, 1913. Dr. Jewett was one of the most interested members of the Commission and his genial presence and ready counsel have been greatly missed at the meetings. Mr. Malcolm G. Wyer, as librarian of the State University, has taken Dr. Jewett's place on the Com - mission and brings to it a wide experience and deep interest in library prob - lems. Miss Guess Humphrey, for eight years in charge of the traveling library department, resigned in October, 1914 in order to join her family in Miss - issippi. It was with much regret that the Commission accepted her resignation, for her efficiency has been a strong factor in building up the traveling library work. Miss Juliet Vore, formerly of the Lincoln City Library, was appointed to take Miss Humphrey's place and began work on October 15. From the time of its establishment the Commission has been under the necessity of giving up its rooms during the legislative sessions. As its work grew, this became increasingly difficult until at last it seemed inperative that permanent quarters be secured. In the already crowded State House it was not easy to find rooms but the Board of Public Lands and Buildings agreed to fit up two basement rooms for the Commission and they were ready for occu - pancy in the summer of 1914. Although the space is insufficient and the approach to the rooms from inside the building is bad, still the quarters are fairly satisfactory and better than any which the Commission has had pre - viously. LThe Secretary has attended the meetings of the American Library As - ation in Kaaterskill, N. Y. in 1913, The League of Library Commissions in Chicago in 1914, the State Library Association in 1913 and 1914, the Con - ference of Charities and Corrections in 1913 and 1914 and the State Federation of Woman's Clubs in 1913 and 1914. </seg>

            <seg id="p007">7 A large part of the work of the Library Commission is promoting the establishment, growth, and improvement of public libraries in the state. Through correspondence and personal visits, advice is given on every possible question of library development from the phrasing of the library ordinance to the planning of the library building. From the time when a group of citizens begins agitating the public library question, the Library Commission stands ready to give them the benefit of wide experience, to save them from the blunders which others have made and to point the way to successful library administration. While the Commission acts merely in an advisory capacity and can only suggest what seem the best methods, it is gratifying to know that its suggestions are usually followed and that a library which has been helped over the first difficult place turns to the Commission thenceforth with its The rate of growth and the condition of the libraries of the state are satisfactory. During the last two years, libraries have been established in Cedar Rapids, Gothenburg, Harrington, Harvard, Hooper, Beaver Crossing, Creighton, Murray, Salem, Wayside, and Shubert, while Benson, Dundee, and Ralston have made levies in order to contract with Omaha for the use of £ library. The libraries at Auburn, Crawford, Friend, Fullerton, Sidney, lding, and Stanton, previously established and maintained by clubs or ary associations, have become tax supported libraries. There are now only three towns of over 2,000 population which have not made provision for public libraries. These are University Place, Wymore and Wahoo. In all of these places, however, the question is receiving serious con - sideration. There are only 17 towns with a population of over 1,000 which have Earies. Appreciation of the work of the library is shown in increased The average levy is now 2 mills as compared with 1.7 mills of two ago, while 18 towns have levied 3 mills which is the maximum. EThe following towns have received gifts for library buildings from Mr - egie in the specified amounts: Bloomfield, $5,000; Broken Bow, $10,000; rell, $5,000; College View, $7,500; Columbus, $13,000; Crete, $10,000; Fairfield, $6,000; Fullerton, $7,000; Hartington, $10,000; O'Neill, $10,000; Shelton, $8,000; Sidney, $6,000; Stanton, $8,000; Gothenburg, $8,000; Harvard, $6,000; while J. W. Gilbert has given the town of Friend $7,000 for a library building. There are now 55 library buildings completed or under construction. As an instance of what a rural community can do in maintaining a library, I wish to cite the case of Murray. Murray is a village in Cass County which the census credits with 183 inhabitants. Two years or more ago the people of Murray organized a library association reaching far out into the country for members. The village not being incorporated and Cass County not having township organization it was impossible for them to vote a tax for the support of the library and some other means for its support had to be devised. It was decided to issue membership tickets at $1.00 a year, a family membership entitling each member of the family to a library card, and to issue other cards at ten cents a month. They rented a small two room building and furnished it from their own homes. Wall book shelves, tables and chairs, rugs and </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 ments had netted a small sum for the first purchase of books and with these and a few donations and a traveling library from the state they opened the library. E^n solving the problem of maintaining the library another problem is solved: the problem of the social life of the community. Musicales, ngtons, and amateur plays, bring the people together for wholesome recreation at the same time that they net the library a goodly sum for the book fund. A monthly evening meeting of the association is held throughout the winter at which public questions are discussed, with substantial refreshments following the discussion. A story hour is held on Saturday so that the country children can attend. A lyceum course of five good entertainments is conducted every winter. A reading club of women is doing systematic study. The library is even doing extension work in the neighboring district schools, sending out small collections of books from its own shelves; and when a particularly successful entertainment has been given in the village it is sometimes repeated in the district school houses for the benefit of the country people. In answer to the question as to whether it is all worth while one of the chief workers says, "When you see selfishness giving way to charity and that wall of prejudice melt under the rays of understanding; when you hear the conversation change from petty gossip to a discussion of the book they were reading or the thought they have made their own; when you are able to place in the hand of some lonely one a story that will cause him to forget his present condition; when the heroes or heroines of our best writers are becoming the ideals of your children and you are opening up a world to them that money cannot buy; when you feel a peace and contentment that you never experienced before, you know that you are really doing something worthy of consideration and you will say that it is all worth while." Krom considering the library undertaking at Murray we are led to a con - tion of what is now the chief problem in the library development of the rural library extension. Our towns, as we have shown, are fairly well provided with libraries, but towns, in an agricultural state, are after all merely centers of rural communities and any complacency which we may feel over the number of town libraries is dispelled at once when we consider that the libraries in these towns, in these rural centers, are not serving the farming communities around them; that there are hundreds of villages in the state too small to maintain libraries and that only 22% of the people of the state are taxing themselves for library purposes. The time has certainly come to do away with the city limits as a boundary for the district served by and supporting £ public library and to substitute the limits of the township or the county, until we have a strong system of county libraries can the public library e to its full development and serve not 22% but 100% of our citizens. E\ levy on a whole county, so slight as to cause no perceptible increase in individual's taxes, would maintain a library in a state of efficiency im - ble at present for our small libraries hampered by the insufficient revenue of a village or town tax. It would enable a county to have the services of a thoroughly trained librarian whose business it would be to see that the whole county, to its farthest corners, received the benefits of a well selected, well administered library. Instead of the rural school library, at present too often </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 a scant collection of books, selected by a teacher whose opportunity to know books is limited, and so ill-cared for that a year or two sees the books lost or in Utters, each school would be a deposit station of the county public library, where there would be kept a choice collection of books so that no child on the remotest farm would grow up without an acquaintance with the very beat in literature. Reading rooms in towns now unable to support them, books made easy of access in groups placed at different points in the county, or by parcels post from the central library, or even possibly by a rural book delivery wagon such as is used in the Washington county, Maryland, library: a large central collection of books well chosen and well cared for; these are the pos - rilities in a county library and all at such a slight expense as to be barely felt the average taxpayer. bThe possible effect of a county library on libraries already established 8 to be looked upon with misgivings by some libraries fearful of losing own identity. However under the provisions of the law any town already maintaining a library may be exempt from the county levy and keep its separate library organization, while it may, in so doing, also contract with the county library for such participation in its benefits as may be desired. A clear understanding of these provisions of the law should do away with any opposi - tion on the part of the libraries. To make possible the easy establishment of county libraries it will be necessary to amend our present law which has a provision that the question of establishing a county library must be submitted to the voters at a general election. All library workers know that the number of town libraries would be decidedly less were it necessary to submit the question of establishing them to the voters of the town. With no experience in the benefits to be derived from a library and moved by the ever present fear of raising taxes, the voters would defeat many a public library project, whereas if a library were once established and operated successfully for a number of years, the same citizens would heartily support it. In amending the law it is proposed to give the county commissioners the same power to establish libraries that is now possessed by the city council. With a satisfactory law and the rural communities awakening to the need of libraries, as is evident from the case of Murray and one or two town - ships, we should enter upon a period of rural library development worthy of a rich and progressive agricultural state. Nebraska Library Association. One of the strongest factors in raising the level of library work in the state is the State Library Association, with which the Library Commission co-operates closely. The Secretary of the Commission, from her acquaintance with the needs of the various libraries of the state, knowing their weaknesses E'l as their strength, is able to assist the executive committee of the State ation to arrange programs which result in the greatest practical help Two successful meetings of the Association have been held in the past biennium, one at Omaha in 1913 and the other in Geneva in 1914. The meet - ing at Geneva was in itself an index to the library development of the state. Even a decade ago such a meeting would have been impossible. There was </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 not at that time a town of less than 2,000 population with a beautiful library building in which to entertain the State Association; it would have been im- Eto get together sixty library workers; and that there should be public almost 500 miles from Omaha to furnish us with a president was These annual meetings do more than furnish the librarians with short cuts and practical hints: they bring together librarians in every line of library work, the trained and the untrained, and they get from their association with each other a bigger idea of library work and a fine professional spirit. The standards of the untrained are raised to approximate those of the trained, the librarian of the village library, in meeting the city librarian, finds that after all they are striving to the same end ; and the cataloguer and the filing clerk see the human reason for the whole machine. Appreciating the benefits of the Library Association, the Commission decided to hold district meetings from time to time in different localities, to bring together the librarians who seldom find it possible to attend the state meetings. The first district meeting was held in Norfolk in April, 1914 with eight libraries represented by librarians and trustees. The meeting lasted two days and consisted of informal discussion of the problems most pressing in all public libraries, book selection, work with schools, the library budget, and library advertising. Members of the Library Commission, Miss Tobitt of Omaha and Miss Drake of Sioux City assisted in the discussions. The meet - ing was an unqualified success and it is planned to hold a number of such meetings this year. Traveling Libraries CThe most direct service of the Library Commission to the people of the te is through traveling libraries. Loans of books which vary in size from a single volume to a collection of one hundred or more are made to individuals or groups of people who are without adequate public library facilities. The work of the department grows steadily and apparently is limited only by the supply of books. The requests each year far exceed the supply and we must greatly enlarge our collection of books if we are to meet the demands made En us and if we are to do, with any degree of completeness, the work for ch the Commission was created. During the biennium we have sent out 40,592 volumes in response to 1962 requests. This is an increase of 34% in volumes and 50% in requests over last biennium. We might easily have increased the number of volumes by 50% were it not for the scarcity of books which has made it necessary to send the fewest possible number of books in response to each request in order to make the books go around. A consultation of the map in the front of this report will show the geographical distribution of the loans and it will be noted that there are very few counties to which we have not sent books. The in - creasing number of books sent to the sparsely settled parts of the state is gratify - ing. Some go to places many miles from a railroad, often to a country school, where through the school and the religious services held in the school house on Sundays they reach the people of a large territory. Mere statistics mean little — so many books to so many places conveys little idea of the results of our </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 work. They are, in a measure, to be read in our letter files; in the letters for instance, from a homesteader's wife, or from a Sunday-school teacher in the sand hills, or from the members of a country woman's club, or from a rural school teacher teaching his first school; from these and many others come letters of appreciation which make the work of the traveling library seem a vital force for good in the state. Eis the policy of the Library Commission to co-operate in every possible ith all the educational agencies of the state; with the extension depart - of the State University and the State Agricultural School, with the i's clubs, and debating societies. For the extension course given by the American history department of the University there is always a steady demand for books, while we have been swamped by the requests for books for the extension courses in Home Economics outlined by Miss Loomis and Mrs. Davisson. In past years we have had so many requests from high school students for material for graduating essays, on such unsuitable subjects very often, that a year ago we prepared a list of suggestive titles and sent it out to all the high schools of the state. It met a ready response and we had considerable satisfaction, when supplying material for the essays, in knowing that we were directing the attention of our boys and girls to subjects for profitable study and discussion. Admitting books to parcels post has greatly lessened the expense of carriage on small groups of books and doubtless will increase our work with individuals and study clubs. At first we feared that we might have difficulty in collecting the postage due on outgoing packages but we find that borrowers seldom neglect to send it in. Not only is it cheaper to send books by parcels post than by express but it is much more convenient, particularly for our ttrons who live at a considerable distance from the railroad and express ice, but whose mail is delivered every day by Uncle Sam. Publicity While believing firmly in advertising for educational as well as com - mercial enterprises, we have always been in a position of hardly daring to advertise since we were already taxed to the limit of our resources. However, we do feel that it is desirable to let the people of the state know what is being done by the departments maintained by state appropriations and each year we have had an exhibit at the State Fair which has given us an opportunity to meet many of our old patrons, and talk to any one who might be interested. This year we were given a very good booth in the new building which gave us plenty of space to display our posters, maps and books. We are convinced of the value of the State Fair exhibit. This fall we have already had 125 inquiries for information in regard to traveling libraries and have sent out many books which we can definitely trace to our State Fair exhibit while there are doubt - less others which might be traced to it. Our friends do a good deal of advertising for us. An occasional reference to our work in the editorial columns of the agricultural papers, or by instructors at teachers' institutes or by county superintendents in their circular letters always brings results. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 our work in the next biennium. Eraries in the state institutions and to it has been made the appropriation 1 their maintenance. Their progress in the past two years is set forth in the lowing report by Miss Florence Waugh who has the work in charge. Library work in our state institutions has been developing steadily and we feel that the library as a part of the institution is growing in popularity. Everywhere the books and periodicals are well used. This biennium, aside from purchasing books, we have subscribed quite largely to periodicals, as in this way our readers are able to keep in touch with the outside world. I At the Boys' Industrial School at Kearney, it is necessary to duplicate our t in order to supply each of the play rooms of the different cottages with igazines, as a main reading room seems to be impracticable. The following riodicals are provided for the boys: St. Nicholas, Youths' Companion, •avel, National Georgaphic, Scientific American and Supplement, Technical orld, Popular Mechanics, World's Work, Field and Stream, Outing, Country mtleman, Saturday Evening Post, Boy Life, American Boy and Little The possibility of a reading room in one of our state hospitals for the insane is something that we are eagerly anticipating. At the Lincoln State Hospital the beautiful new recreation room is to be used on trial as a general reading room, and the experiment will be watched with great interest. The current numbers of the periodicals will be used here, the back numbers being sent to the wards in our present plan. We will endeavor to obtain all news - papers from the home counties of the patients and will also use attractive illustrated books here. Attendants will be in charge, and we expect a great deal of pleasure to be taken by the patients from this room. It is significant that in our three state hospitals, Norfolk with the smallest number of patients, has the largest book circulation. We think this is in a large measure due to the fact that the patients are allowed there to come to the library and make their own selection. At Ingleside, the number of attendants who take ad - vantage of the library is gratifying.

            <seg id="p014">14 is not a satisfactory substitute or vice verse. The men were asked to select from a list, the five magazines they would like most to receive. From these requests we have compiled lists of the mens' names by consecutive cell number. These lists are pasted on the cover of the magazine with the request that they be kept not longer than three days and passed on. The magazines are now circulating in this manner. The book circulation — 1141, a monthly average — shows the use the men make of the books. The total circulation for the bien - nium was 27,390 and of this 32.87% was non-fiction. We are trying to build up an interesting and practical collection of non-fiction to encourage the men to use their time profitably. We welcome any request from the men for non - fiction not in the library. If it is a book that will be of permanent value to the library it is purchased, if not it is borrowed from the city or University library. A supplement of books purchased during the biennium was printed and added to the catalogs. We have been very fortunate in the assistance we have had at the penitentiary, our present librarian and his predecessors giving splendid service. In writing of his library work with the men at the penitentiary, one of our former librarians says, "A prison library can be the drive wheel on the engine of discipline." This same man, whose first introduction to a library was in pur state prison, after his release sent in from one of our far western counties for a traveling library for the girls and boys of the community. The books had to be hauled thirty miles from the railroad. This fall he sent for another library and sent an additional request for books for the nearest school. Still later, another request was received from this same district. We are proud indeed of the work this man is voluntarily doing and to know that his interest in libraries is a permanent one. Newspapers and periodicals are popular at the libraries in our Soldiers' Homes. At Burkett, there is a good book circulation, especially in the winter E. The library is used more here than at Milford on account of having ian who receives a small salary for his services and who devotes regular ch day to his work. The librarian at the Hospital for the Tuberculous, one of the patients, is taking a correspondence course in library work through the Commission office. She is now cataloging the books in the hospital library. At the Industrial Home for Women we are trying to awaken an interest in helpful books by buying cook-books, gardening books, books on nursing sewing, etc. The books in the library at the State Home for Feeble-Minded are much appreciated by the children. We find these children wonderfully responsive to story-telling, listening with the interest of normal children, and remember - ing for months afterwards a story told. That a story has the power to con- Ctrate and hold their attention suggests that a librarian might be a valuable iition to the teaching force in schools for this class of children. E! library room at the Girls' Industrial School at Geneva had to be p on account of overcrowded conditions, but the books, which are xily divided among the school rooms, are to be shelved in a new build - g erected. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 We are also to have a room in a new building at the School for the Deaf, in which we will have a collection of beautiful picture books for small children. In no other institution do we consider a library more important than here, and when one realizes what books must mean to the deaf, it is a matter of wonder that the library is not more emphasized in schools for the deaf generally. We want reading to be a pleasure, not a task, to the deaf children in our state and to accomplish this it is necessary to create a love for books among the little children. There is a good collection of books at Omaha, but the library is almost too small to use for a reading room. The older children can take the books from the library, but the little ones who are hardly old enough to be responsible for the care of books, have not been able to have library privileges. It is for these that the new room has been planned, and we hope here to intro - duce all the little children to the many joys of "Story-book Land." At the Orthopedic Hospital, the library work has been especially satis - factory. Dr. H. W. Orr, the superintendent, is deeply interested in the educa - tion of crippled children, and after our library had been established two years, he thought the importance of the work justified the appointment of a librarian who would devote her entire time to the library, and Miss Eva Colby was appointed. Miss Colby is particularly well qualified for her work, as she was a patient at the hospital for several years and intimately understands the needs of her patrons. She is naturally fond of books, and aside from the instruction in library science furnished by the Commission, has taken the special course in children's work at the Iowa Summer Library School. Her time is divided between the various wards of the hospital, and the library room. In each ward, she tells stories or reads aloud once a week, and books are circulated among the bed patients each day. The ward work is done while the children who are able to be up are in school. A story hour is held for these children Saturday afternoon in the library. In the new building, soon to be completed at the hospital, the library is to occupy a beautiful, well lighted room, 23x55 on the first floor. The Commission is much pleased with the space that has been given for the library, and expect it to be one of the most attractive child - ren's rooms in the state. The Art Department of the Woman's Club has prom - ised to furnish a handsome picture for the room, and doubtless there will be similar contributions. The Boys' Progressive Club hold their meetings once in two weeks in the library. The programs consist of debates, current events, parliamentary drill and an occasional talk on some subject of interest. The aim of the club is to train the boys in citizenship and to direct them to profitable reading. The club membership is constantly changing, so a good many boys receive, we hope, some benefit and inspiration from these meetings. The Commission is grateful to Mr. J. L. Kennard, Dr. Edwin Maxey, Mr. Cloyd Stewart, Mr. Leslie Welsh and Mr. Victor Deakin for their assistance with the club. Mrs. Orr has a chapter of the Camp Fire Girls at the hospital. The law of the Camp Fire is "Seek beauty: Give service: Pursue knowledge: Be trustworthy: Hold on to health: Glorify work: Be happy." This organi - zation has been planned by specialists to develop the very best in girls and to awaken them to the true joys of living. Realizing what these clubs mean to the girls and boys at the Orthopedic, we long to see similar ones in all of our institutions for juveniles. We believe that a resident librarian, who had specialized in work with children, could accomplish results of real value and </seg>

The Library Commission wishes to express its appreciation of the services of all who are assisting— many without extra compensation— in the libraries of our institutions. The success of our work depends in a large measure on their efforts and we are indebted for their hearty co-operation. </seg>
