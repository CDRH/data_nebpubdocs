            <seg id="p005">SILO CONSTRUCTION IN NEBRASKA. BY L. W. CHASE. INTRODUCTION. This bulletin discusses briefly some of the types of silos which are being erected in Nebraska at the present time. A very much more complete bulletin on this subject, under the same title and the same number, is being published for distribu - tion on application. Tins bulletin gives the details for the erec - tion of the different types of silos. Those desiring to secure a copy of the same should ask for "Limited Edition" of bulletin on Silo Construction in Nebraska. No. 138. FORM OF SILO. Experience has shown that the best form for a silo is round with the walls perpendicular. The round silo does away with corners in which silage is likely to spoil. It gives the largest capacity for the amount of material in the walls, and where built above ground this form of construction resists the winds and the pressure of silage from within Itetter than the square silo. SIZE OF SILOS. When the silo exceeds 16 feet in diameter. .it requires more work to get the silage to the door than in the smaller silo. It also requires a larger amonnt to be fed daily in order to keep the silage from spoiling on account of its contact with the air. A silo of large diameter and not very tall has more spoiled silage in it per ton of good silage than a silo of greater height. The pressure on the silage is measured by the height of the silo and not by its diameter, so that the tall, slim silo will hold practically as much silage per square foot of wall surface as the short, broad one. On account of this greater capacity of tall silos, it is seldom advisable to build one less than 30 feet in height. Where built of masonry, or where well anchored and carefully looked after, they may economically be built higher, to give the needed capacity without getting the silo unduly large in diameter. In pit silos the diameter may be somewhat greater in propor - tion to the height. The box used in hoisting the silage can be dropped into any part of the silo wher« it is convenient to fill. BUI,. 138, AOR. EXP. STATION OF XKBK VOL XXV. ART VIII </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Silo Construction in Nebraska I and the heaviest part of the silage being at the bottom it is well to reduce the cost of hoisting the silage by making the silo as shallow as can reasonably be done and secure a good quality of silage. In this case, additional capacity may be secured by addi - tional diameter, provided the surface exposed is not so great as to affect the quality of the silage as it is being fed. Even with pit silos, it is doubtful if they should be built less than 24 feet in height. If this height cannot be secured below ground with - out difficulty, a part of it can be built above ground, in this way easily securing the height of silo which is necessary to give capacity and a good quality of silage, and not requiring expensive machinery for filling.

            <seg id="p007">&lt; ■ The essential features of a well-designed silo can be summed briefly as follows : 1. The walls should be practically air-tight. 12. The inner surfaces of the wall should be smooth and perpen - ■tar. 13. The inner surfaces of the walls should be free from corners, ind silos are more efficient and economical than other types. Kl. The walls should be sufficiently nonconducting to prevent ■ssive freezing. — especially so when the silage is to be fed ing cold weather. 15. The walls should be sufficiently firm or sufficiently well hored to prevent cracking due to settling or racking due to d. 6. The doors should lx- so designed that a minimum amount of silage has to be removed before they can be opened. 17. A good ladder should be provided with steps from 15 inches 18 inches apart and at least 31 inches away from the silo or Us of the chute. 18. The foundation should be heavy, well made, and reach &gt;w the froet line. 19. A good roof makes the silo more durable, adds greatly to appearance, and if tight assists materially in keeping the ge from freezing. » Silos which have the above features will he found convenient, lsc little trouble, and. when properly filled, will keep the silage perfect condition. TYPES OF SILOS. 1. Pit silos, built partially or wholly below ground. 2. Silos above ground, built of wood or of masonry. LThe stave silo is the most common of the wood type in Xe - ska. The masonry silo is commonly built of Concrete hollow blocks. Clay blocks or hollow brick. Solid concrete poured into a form, sometimes called the "monolithic silo. 4 ' Concrete plastered on metal lath. I All masonry silos should be reinforced with steel, and when reinforced are the most permanent and most economical form above-ground construction. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Silo VonatrvctioH in Xebraska WOOD SILOS. SWood silos in various forms arc used thruout the East, but Nebraska the wood stave silo seems more popular, altho duriug past year the wood silo known as the ''crib silo" has been in - duced and is receiving considerable attention. STAVE SILOS. Ehere are three general types of stave silos: the homemade stave, the homemade tougued and grooved, and the maun ired tongiied and grooved. Single-piece fir stave silo at Beef Cattle Barn, University Farm 1 Lincoln, Nebr. The first type mentioned is somewhat cheaper than the other types, tint it does not seem possible to hold silos in shape without tongued and grooved staves. Probably this is due to the fact that in the summer when the silos are empty the air gets on all sides of the staves and mm them to dry out much faster and to warp as they dry. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">a The second type of silo is as strong as any stave silo and as tiisilv cared for, but is more trouble to order. The third type should also have more convenient doors. SI LO WOODS. I Silos have not been in use long enough in Nebraska to warrant drawing of any definite conclusion as to lasting qualities, o white pine, homemade, plain, stave silos examined near aha after having been used eight years were very badly de - ed at the lower ends of the staves. A cheap white pine silo the University Farm was practically rotted out at the end of years' use, while a better grade of white pine silo which has n in use about eight and one-half years has just commenced lecay at the lower ends of the staves and is apparently in good dition above the first foot. 1 Conclusions drawn from Bulletin No. 100, Iowa State College. ce the merits of woods for silo use as follows : 1, Redwood ; 2, Cypress ; 3, Oregon Fir ; 4, Tamarack ; 5. White Pine; 6. Long-leaf Yellow Pine. ORDERING STAVE SILOS. tThe Manufactured Silo. — In ordering a silo it must be borne nind that the custom of silo manufacturers is to sell only the proper with the necessary anchor rods and also the rafters the roofs. In order to complete the silo, the following ma - als are needed : Silo floor, foundation wall, sheathing, roofing. nt, and chute. THE HOMEMADE TONQUED AND GROOVED STAVE SILO. tTliis silo needs all the material mentioned in the preceding agraph under ordering "The Manufactured Silo," and in addi - i needs the material for the silo proper with the anchors and ers. A silo 16 by 30 feet purchased in this way should not cost re than |260.00 for the material used in the floor, foundation, Is. and roof, including the paint. FOUNDATIONS. I The foundation for a silo is an important part which is often rlooked. It can be made of brick, clay blocks, concrete blocks, solid concrete. Probably the latter is as good as any of the ers and less difficult to handle. All foundations should go ow the frost line. II f the foundation is to hold a masonry silo, it should have a tting at least two feet wide and 18 inches deep, while if it sup </seg>
            <seg id="p010">ports a wooden silo, the wall should be from 10 inches to 12 inches wide with no special footing. When the staves are set M the foundation, they should be kept back at least five inches from the inside of the wall and tied well with anchors which have been previously set in the foundation. ERECTING THE SILO. Ehe best staging for erecting silos is made by building a single cage around the silo foundation, and on this erecting walks which the men may work while setting up the staves and ng the hoops. tThe door frame or the door staves should be set up first and mbed and stayed in at least three places. Staves can theu be up on each side of the door frame and attached to it by means vet laths or barrel staves. Care must be exercised to keep the er ends of the staves in a true circle and to keep the staves All staves should be stapled to the hoops in two places and preferably three or more. ■The anchors should be well set and protected from the rubbing ■attle. 1A roof adds materially to the appearance of a silo, keeps The silage from drying out. prevents storms blowing in. mih] ists in keeping the silage from freezing. The chute is essential to prevent the silage blowing away as it is being thrown down. It should be about three feet square and contain one or two windows. A ladder nailed alongside the doors, but on the chute, is very convenient to use when entering the silo. CARE OF STAVE SILOS. tThis type of silo should be well painted. The hoops should tightened two or three times during the summer and loosened ile filling in the fall. All anchors should be kept tight at all ies. and should the silo become out of plumb it should be aightened before l&gt;eing filled again. SILOS UNDERGROUND, OR PIT SILOS Wherever a cheap silo is desired and the soil is of a uniform texture and free from all danger of seepage, a pit silo can be used to good advantage. Such silos can be built quite cheaply and require less expensive cutters and a smaller engine for filling, and there is no danger of the silage freezing when in the silo. The greatest disadvantage in such silos is the inconvenience in removing the silage. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 tWhen silage ferments, which is during the first two weeks that s in the silo, carbon dioxide gas is thrown off. This gas is irier than air and is transparent. As it is heavier than air. it les to the lowest place and stays there unless carried away air currents or some other means. As a consequence, if the is partly filled and left standing a few days there is danger nough gas accumulating in the silo to suffocate people. As a Pig. 2. Semi-pit silo on Chase Farm, Pawnee City, Nebr. I ■caution it is always well to start the cutter and let it run five ten minutes before anyone enters the silo. If the silo is open, that the wind currents can blow into the top of it, these cur - its will carry away all the poisonous gases so that there will no danger. In the winter time when the silo is being used there is no danger, because the gas does not form in quantities at that time. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">u and furthermore the air in the silo is wanner than the outside air. hence air currents are set up which carry the gases away. TYPES OF PIT SII.OS. I There are three types of pit silos: (1) The plain hole in the und which very much resembles a dug well without any curb - ; (21 the semi-pit silo which has a part of the silo above mid and a part located in the ground; and (3) the bank silo, eh is a silo either located on the bank in such a way that by ueling in at the bottom a chute can be made up along the silo lilar to that of a silo which sets above ground, or where the sits so close to the bank that the silage can simply be own out at the doors and permitted to drop to the ground, ibably this last type of silo is the most convenient and in - *-nsive and most satisfactory of any silo that can be con - icted. OONSTRrCTING PIT SILOS. tThe pit silo is built down instead of up. The first operation o dig a trench around the top which has an inside diameter same as the inside diameter of the silo. This trench should as narrow as can be conveniently dug with a spade and as p as the spade will conveniently reach. Fill the trench with crete and when it has set remove the dirt from inside, down » depth of about six feet. When this depth is reached, the silo walls should be plastered. A mixture of one part of cement to two and one-half parts of screened sand is the best proportion for the plaster. Layers should be plastered on until the coat of plaster is about three - quarters of an inch thick or more. It will take two or three '&lt; nits to do this. K After the first section of the silo has been plastered, then take about six feet more of earth and plaster this in the same iner. Continue this process until the proper depth is reached. »Ry digging and plastering a silo in this manner there is no d of staging, and one has a good strong floor upon which to kWhen the bottom of the silo is reached, the floor can be put if desired. However, it is not material whether the silo has oor or not. I If a part of the silo is to be built above the ground, it can built before the dirt is thrown out, or afterwards, depending m the convenience of the farmer. » There are three ways to build that part of the silo which is &gt;ve ground. One is to make a form and build it of solid con- </seg>
            <seg id="p013">U set up metal lath on the foundation and plaster concrete onto the inside and outside of this. It is always well to have pit silos about three feet above ground, as this obviates danger of stock falling into them. The device used by most people for removing the earth is either half barrels fixed up in the form of buckets, or boxes with a trip in the bottom so that the bottom will drop down. These boxes are suspended from a hay carrier car and track which in turn is supported by pole tripods. I If the ground in not of a uniform texture, it is generally better wall a pit silo with some heavier material than plaster. To Fig. 3. Illustrating the va - rious stages of excavation of semi-pit silo. I this, metal lath can be tacked onto the ground and concrete stered onto this, or a form can be built and a concrete wall :ted. or one can use brick. REMOVING THE SILAGE. There are three or four schemes in use for removing the silage from pit silos. One is by hoisting it hand over hand in baskets or buckets, another is by dropping a box into the silo thru an opening in the roof and hoisting out by means of a hay fork car and track, while a third method is to arrange a hoisting device similar to the hoisting device used in the country store elevator. </seg>

            <seg id="p015">Silo Construction in KtHnukt 15 LAVING THE WALLS. Between each two CMMM of blocks in the mortar joint, a steel reinforcing bar is laid. This bar is preferably made of No. 3 hard wire. However, it can 1m- made of two No. 9 wires or one No. 6 wire and a smaller wire. There should be reinforcing at each motar joint. The doors are either of the intermittent tyj&gt;e or of the con - tinuous type. The intermittent type is much more easily con - structed tho not quite as convenient as the continuous type. The door frames must be well reinfon ed with heavy steel bars. These bars stand up and down on either side of the door with Fig. 5. Homemade single-piece concrete block machine. other bars running across Ix'tween the doors. The bars which lie in the mortar joint either hook around the vertical rods ad - jacent to the door or pass thru the mortar joints between the doors. BLOCKS. The blocks for concrete silos can be of almost any type or form. Solid blocks can be used, but are very heavy and trouble - some to handle. Straight-faced commercial blocks will make good silos. However, the silo must be plastered on the inside. Commercial Mocks with curved faces make good silos, tho they are generally so porous that they should be plastered on the in - side or at least should be washed with a good coat of pure cement. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">Hi homemade machine for making cement blocks. There are two types of this machine,— one for making a two-piece block, which makes an almost continuous air-space between the inside and out - side walls of the silo, and the other machine (fig. 5). which makes a one-piece hollow block similar to the commercial block excepting that it is so constructed that the inside face of the block is troweled. By troweling the fare of this block it is made waterproof and smooth ; hence the silo will not need to be washed with cement, nor will it need to be plastered on the inside. KThis machine can also be used for making foundations for ns and houses, or for making hog houses, poultry houses, or thing in the cement block line that is needed. SCAFFOLD. I The scaffold for block silos can be built on either the inside the outside of the silo. If it is built on the inside, it should instructed with four posts and a platform, the platform being which will move up and down at the discretion of the rator, a good grade of wire stretcher being used to raise the tform. This type of scaffold was devised by the Agricultural Sneering department of the Iowa State College and used by tu extensively and has proved very successful. It has also n used in erecting several silos in Nebraska, and has proved v efficient. ■ DAACQ ROOFS. Cement block silos as well as clay block silos and solid concrete silos should have concrete roofs. A concrete roof is much more durable than a shingle roof, is generally tighter, and prevents the freezing of the silage to a great extent, and is no more ex - pensive than a good shingle roof.

Three of these were erected with a form made by the Department, while one was erected with a form that was made on the ground where the silo was built. These silos require the same type of foundation that the con - crete block silos do, and should have a concrete roof, and it is also well to have a concrete chute, as it costs very little more than a good frame chute. FORMS. The forms for erecting the walls are preferably made by building up an inside framework of wood which is covered with one-inch material. If the forms are to be used on more than one silo, they should be covered with galvanized iron. The wood forms are erected in four sections and held together with bolted cleats which permit the form to shrink up so that it can be taken away from the concrete when desired and then raised. The outside form is made of a heavier grade of galvanized iron and riveted together into either two or four sections as de - sired.
