            <seg id="p004">1 TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA, DEPARTMENT OF BANKING, Lincoln, October 1, 1915. To the Honorables John H. Morehead, Governor; William H. Smith, Auditor of Public Accounts; Willis E. Reed, Attorney General, Members of the State Banking Board. Gentlemen : â€” I have the honor to submit herewith the twenty - third annual report of the Department of Banking covering the period beginning July 1, 1914, and ending June 30, 1915, showing the condition of the building and loan associations of the state at the close of busi - ness June 30, 1915, compiled from annual reports of the several build - ing and loan associations submitted to the State Banking Board, in compliance with the provisions of the building and loan act. Tabu - lated statements, detailed reports, and such information and com - ments as are deemed beneficial, will be found on the following pages. In submitting this report to you for your official consideration I desire to again call your attention to the remarkable growth of the building and loan associations under your supervision ; the net gain of the assets of these institutions being $4,522,457.32, during the year covered by this report. I believe that the building and loan associations of this state are as conservatively managed as are institutions of this kind in any other state. Personal knowledge of methods and management gives me con - fidence in the fundamentally safe condition of this branch of finance. However, I will call your attention to two items in the subjoined report. You will observe that the number of mortgages subject to foreclosure totals 581, and the aggregate amount of mortgages subject to foreclosure is $734,763.88; and the number of mortgages in process of foreclosure is 227, with an aggregate expressed in dollars of $238, - 018.06, making a grand total in process of foreclosure and subject to foreclosure approximating $1,000,000.00, which would indicate too great optimism, or want of sufficient caution, on the part of the manage - ment of some of the associations in placing loans. The Department continually urges conservatism in the placing of loans, especially on city, town or village property, which constitute the bulk of loans made by these associations. It is a well known fact, born out of experi - ence, that loans on urban property are much more hazardous than loans on farm property, due to the fact that the urban home owner, as a rule, feels more keenly and quickly any changes in the financial situation than does the farmer. The question of employment and busi - ness conditions places upon these loans a hazard that is too often forgotten by building and loan association directors in their anxiety to have their funds earning interest. It is deemed opportune, espe - cially at this time, to call attention to these matters, owing to a tend - ency at present to inflate prices. In the opinion of this Department the building and loan associ - ations are operating at a critical time. Mistakes are seldom made when money is close but with present easy money conditions the too optimistic building and loan management is bidding for future losses. Aside from this feature I can say to your Honorable Board that I am submitting this report with pardonable pride. The following amendments to the building and loan law enacted at the last session of the Legislature are wise, and justified by the growth and expansion of these institutions. Section 1. Any association of not less than five persons incorpo - rated under the laws of this state, which shall be organized within this state for the purpose of raising money to be loaned among its members, shall, in the furtherance of such purpose, and after having </seg>
            <seg id="p005">SECRETARY OF THE STATE BANKING BOARD 5 complied with the requirements of this chapter, be authorized and empowered to levy, assess and collect from its members such sums of money, by rates of stated dues, fines, interest and premium on loans, as the corporation may provide for in its constitution or oy-laws, and to exercise such other powers as are herein provided", every such corporation may, however, receive payments from its members in any amount, which, together with the balance formerly to the credit of the member thus paying, upon the books of the corporation, if any, shall not exceed the par value of the shares of stock held by him: Provided, no person shall hold in his own right more than five thou - sand ($5,000.00) dollars par value of investment stock in any such corporation and that no person shall vote as proxy more than five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars par value of stock in any such corpo - ration; Provided further, that any association in which the value of its assets are more than $200,000.00, and do not exceed the sum of $500,000.00, borrowing members may hold stock to the amount of $10, - 000.00, and in any association whose assets exceed $500,000.00 and do not exceed one million dollars, borrowing members in such associa - tions may hold stock in the amount of $15,000.00, and in associations whose assets exceed the sum of one million dollars, borrowing mem - bers may hold stock to the amount of $25,000.00, such stock in no case to exceed the amount of the loan; provided further, it shall be unlawful for any association to loan on any tract of land upon which one building is erected or to be erected, any amount in excess of the amount such association may loan to one borrowing member accord - ing to the foregoing provision. Provided further, however, that at any meeting of any such corporation, where not less than fifty mem - bers are present, it shall be lawful for sufficient proxies to be held by those present to represent the majority of all stock of the corporation. The words "Loan and Building Association," "Building Association," "Building and Loan Association," "Savings and Loan Association," or "Loan and Savings Association," shall form part of the corporate name of every such corporation. Section 7. Certificates of stock shall be issued to every member in the number of shares owned by him, on such terms and conditions in conformity with this chapter as the constitution or by-laws may pro - vide: Provided, however, that whenever any such certificates are made to the joint account of two or more persons, whether adults or minors over fourteen years of age, with a joint order to the corpora - tion that the moneys represented by such certificates or any part thereof, are to be payable to or on the order of any one or more of any such joint stockholders, that then the moneys so represented by such stock may be continued so payable, notwithstanding the death of one or more of the persons to whom such stock may be issued. The account so represented by said stock shall be payable to any one or more of such survivor or survivors or order, notwithstanding such death, and no liability shall be incurred by said corporation for amounts so paid. to such survivor and charged to said stock account. Provided, no money or stock represented by any such joint certificate shall be paid to any minor hut may be paid to his legal guardian. Every stockholder shall receive credit on the books of the association for all amounts paid by him upon his subscription for stock, together with his pro rata share of all dividends declared, as hereafter provided, and when the sum of such payments and dividends, less all fines or other charges, shall equal the par value of the shares of stock held by him, he shall be entitled to receive such par value, with such interest not exceeding the legal rate, as the directors may determine, from the time of maturity until paid. Holders of stock thus matured and mem - bers desiring to withdraw before such maturity, shall be paid the value </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OF THE of their stock in the order of the maturity of, or notice of withdrawal, of such stock. At no time, however, shall more than two-thirds of the unloaned funds in the treasury of the association, inclusive of such funds applicable to the demands of withdrawing stockholders, as hereinbefore provided, be applicable to the demands of holders of matured stock without the consent of the Board of Directors. Section 9. No loan shall be made by such association except to its own members, nor shall any loan be made to any member for any sum in excess of the par value of his stock, and the association shall have a lien on as many of the borrowers' shares as shall equal at their par value the nominal amount of the loan ; good and ample real estate security unincumbered, except by prior liens held by such association, shall also be given by the borrowers: Provided, all loans made upon the security real estate improved by the presence of buildings, shall not exceed in amount, two-thirds of the actual cash value of such security and all loans made upon the security of any other form of real estate shall likewise not exceed an amount equal to two-fifths of the actual cash value of such security: Provided further, the stock of such association may be received as security for a loan of the amount of the withdrawal value of such stock without other security. Provided further, that any association may have power temporarily to invest its idle funds or any part thereof to an amount not exceed - ing the amount of the reserve or contingent loss fund, in bonds or interest bearing obligations of the United States, or of the State of Nebraska, or of any County, Township, School District or other politi - cal division of the State of Nebraska, or of any incorporated city or village in the State of Nebraska. Xo evidence of indebtedness taken by said association for the return of any loan shall be negotiable in form, and whatever be its form, every such indebtedness shall be non-negotiable in law, and no such debt or evidence of debt shall be assignable or transferable in any manner so as to prevent the discharge thereof by payments to the association, except that bonds and interest-bearing obligations in which temporary investments may be made as hereinbefore provided, may be converted into cash as required by such associations in the conduct of its business. Very respectfully, E. ROYSE, Secretary State Banking Board. </seg>
