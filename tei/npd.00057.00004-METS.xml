            <seg id="p002"/>
            <seg id="p003">3 FOREWORD To His Excellency, the Governor : The Board of Control herewith transmits the Fifth Biennial Report of the State Institutions of Nebraska for the period ending June 30, 1923. The biennium formerly ended on November 30 of each even-numbered year, but this date was changed by an act of the legislature, so that this report really covers a period of thirty-one months from December 1, 1920, to June 30, 1923. During the period, no change has occurred in the personnel of the Board, but several changes have been made in the chief officers of institutions. Dr. Beverly A. Finkle, superintendent of the Orthopedic Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska, resigned to enter private practice, and was succeeded on August 23, 1921, by Dr. J. H. Matthai. Miss Amy V. Stevens, who had been superintendent of the Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln, Nebraska, for a number of years, resigned on July 5, 1922, being succeeded by her sister, Miss Nellie Stevens. The latter served until February 19, 1923, when her resignation was received, and Miss Lena Driever was appointed to the position. We call attention with pride and pleasure to the fact that the report shows the institutions to have gone through the bien - nium without incurring any deficiencies ; although the cost of living, and consequently the cost of supporting the state's depen - dents, has certainly not decreased since the appropriations were made for the biennium. Some improvements of a permament character have been made at the various institutions during the period covered by this report. A hospital building, bakery and scullery have been erected at the Nebraska Institution for Feeble Minded, Beatrice, Nebraska ; a cottage for girls at the Girls' Training School, Geneva, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Burkett, </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Nebraska ; a gymnasium building at the State Industrial School, Kearney, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, Nebraska ; a farm house and a barn at the Lincoln State Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska; a warehouse at the State Penitentiary, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Milford, Nebraska; a kitchen building at the Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk, Nebraska ; a main building at the State Reformatory for Women, York, Nebraska. These buildings were badly needed, and they will have to be followed by others in the very near future if our wards are to be properly, efficiently and economically cared for. The legislature just past made provision for two or three buildings, but failed to see the necessity for several others that were urgently requested. Brief mention was made in the last report of the establishment of the Reformatory for Men at Lincoln, but the importance of the institution calls, we believe, for rather more extended notice. This institution was established as a result, primarily, of a wide recognition of the need of segregating young first-term offenders from more mature criminals. The legislature of 1921 authorized the establishment, therefore, of such an institution, making an initial approproation of $300,000. Of this sum the Board ex - pended $37,500 for 10 acres and a brick building known as the Hayward Military Academy, later buying about 152 acres of contiguous land for the sum of $49,531.25. This land is used for farming, stock raising, dairying, and intensive gardening. Various trades are taught such as tailoring, shoe repairing, carpentry and joinery, brick laying, electricity, automobile repairing, launder - ing, engineering, firing, and barbering. The manual labor about the institution is, of course, performed by the inmates, of which there are at this date 189. Mr. A. W. Miller, the superintendent, is doing much constructive work with the young men committed to his charge, and we believe the institution is amply justifying itself. The difficulty of employing the penitentiary inmates at suitable labor that does not conflict too much with the prerogatives of the free workers of our state, has been pretty well overcome. The state still operates the fibre furniture factory which has been at the prison for some years, and has also established relations with the Oberman Company by which shirts are made and disposed of with a minimum of competition with free labor. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 INMATE POPULATION There are seventeen institutions under the control of the Board, and at this time (July 1, 1923) the inmate population is 5917, as compared with an average of 4980 for the biennium ending in 1921, and 4907 for the biennium just prior to that. The following table will be found of interest as showing the population of the different institutions during the past two biennia : Av. pop. Av. pop.

About 800 acres are rented in addition. Details of operation are given in the reports from the several superintendents which are appended hereto. The health of the inmate population has been generally good during the past biennium. We are pleased to be able to report that no epidemic has broken out at any of the institutions, and our medical men have been able to cope with such sporadic cases of contagious disease as have appeared. In conclusion we wish to express our appreciation of the efforts of the officers and employees of the various institutions in striving to bring about a betterment of the living conditions of the wards under their care. We wish also to thank the Governor for his manifestations of interest and for his assistance in the work of this department, and we trust that he will continue his efforts to help us provide better means of caring for the wards of the state.

            <seg id="p019">19 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. It is our pleasure to submit to you the Seventeenth Report of the Nebraska Industrial Home covering the period ending June 30, 1923. Since May 1, 1889, Nebraska has afforded a refuge for one thousand three hundred seventy-three of her unfortunate girls and young women. During this biennium one hundred sixty-two girls have received care ; of this number eighty-three were under eighteen years of age; thirty-five under sixteen; forty-four were either in school or staying at home ; the others were earning their own way. Most of those admitted came to us voluntarily and many more sought the shelter of the Home, but from the fact that they must agree to remain one year, they went to maternity homes where they were released as soon as possible. Nebraska's object in maintaining this Home is not alone for care at a time when most needed, but to give her wards a chance for training, which better fits them to become helpful citizens and members of society. From eleven to twelve months is a very short time to prepare the young girl to again face the world after her down-fall, for she knows that her mistake is not forgotten and she feels that she will probably meet scorn at every turn. These young mothers seek our advice and guidance so much of the time, and we are ever ready to help them, but do it as far as we can, in such a way that they finally make their own decisions, thus building stronger characters. When the different kinds of work are assigned, we endeavor to make the girls feel that each one is responsible for her part. Lack of training, knowledge of life and the ways of the world, and proper surroundings are the immediate causes of the downfall of our young people, so if we are to help them we must make up to them what their home has lacked. One of the saddest conditions of the homes from which our girls come is the lack of sympathy and confidence between parents and their children. So many of those under our care tell us in their heartbroken way that they </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 have been misunderstood in their homes and their mothers and fathers will not talk over the things nearest the girl's heart. This Home endeavors to keep our girls surrounded with such cheery, congenial atmosphere, that upon returning to their own homes they find they have grown entirely away from their old environment of evil and ignorance. More than fifty per cent of our girls keep their babies, and while this is very commendable, is it the best for mother and chiid ? If the girl can go to her own friends with her child it would seem well, but in most cases they prefer new surroundings, for fear that at some future time their babe may be made to suffer their shame. Many of our girls make excellent mothers and with a little help would make good. This is the crisis of the girl's life and if there was someone, understandingly following up these cases, fewer girls and their babes would again become wards of the state. The longer we are in the work the more keenly we feel the need of follow-up work. It is very necessary for the girls to feel that they have someone to whom they may go for comfort and advice at this critical time in their lives. The Superintendent corresponds with these girls as far as possible, giving encouraging reports to those who have had to relinquish their babies, regarding the welfare of their babe, and showing an interest in all their undertakings. However this does not take the place of coming into personal contact with them. We recognize the fact that a parole officer would be handicapped in visiting these girls for the reason that the state has no jurisdiction over the voluntary cases, and the girls and their friends might resent such visits. It would undoubtedly simplify matters if the officer was one who had won the confidence of the girls during their time in the Home. Except for the influenza epidemic last February, the health of the girls and babies has been excellent. There were no fatalities among the adults, eight babes passed away under one month of age, two under six months. We think this quite a remarkable record for statistics show that the death rate among illegitimate children is much higher than among the legitimate. We have been very fortunate in finding excellent homes for our babes. We make the investigation as thorough as possible before placing a child, for it is very bad to have to change from place to place. We visit the homes and many of the foster parents bring the children back so that we may see them. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 The only recreation for our girls is the use of a good library, and such parties as we can arrange. There are many times when our girls need something from the outside world to keep their minds from their own trouble, and our little social gatherings be - ing just among ourselves fail to do this. We have wished that a moving picture machine could be installed, and such pictures, obtained that would not only be entertaining but educational. Xew floors were laid in the two rooms adjoining the sewing department, a door-way cut, which has greatly relieved the crowded condition. Three steel ceilings were replaced and painted, the walls of one of the rooms painted, the steel ceiling in our parlor also was painted. This painting was all done by the girls. A tile chicken house was built, the chicken yards changed, which was a much needed improvement. Our flock of chickens is much healthier and noticeably more productive. An exhaust fan was installed in our kitchen which was much needed for ventilating purposes. In conclusion, I desire to express my appreciation and gratitude to the members of the Board of Control for their confidence, consideration, and co-operation at all times. I wish also to thank my co-workers for their hearty support, able assistance and for the congenial atmosphere each one has helped to create. Respectfully, M. EVELYN MEYER, Superintendent. &gt; </seg>
