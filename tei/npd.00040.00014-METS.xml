            <seg id="p003">WHY, WHEN, AND HOW TO SPRAY 1 BY J. RALPH COOPER The time has arrived when spraying must be considered as a part of the regular orchard work. Fruit growers can no longer secure, or expect to secure, profitable returns from their orchards unless they practice thoro and systematic spraying. During the last three seasons an average of 72.5 per cent of the fruit in un - sprayed orchards was so badly damaged by insects alone that it was fit only for vinegar. Fungous diseases have caused almost as much damage. Insects and fungi have caused a total loss in many orchards. The average loss due to both in the orchards under observation during the last three years was 86.6 per cent. During the seasons of 1913, 1914, and 1915, extensive tests were made in orchards in various parts of the state to determine how much of this loss could be prevented by spraying, what materials to use, and how and when to apply them. It was found that practically all loss from either insects or fungi can be prevented by spraying, at an average cost of about 24 cents per tree for an ordinary mature tree. The average value of fruit in unsprayed orchards, determined by the price which the fruit actually brought on the market, was $1 .67 per tree. The average value of fruit in the sprayed orchards was $7.38 per tree. After paying the cost of spraying, this left a net gain of $5.47 per tree due to spraying. In order to control insect and fungous enemies it is necessary to understand their life history and habits. Much labor and money is often wasted in spraying at the wrong time. In spray - ing for chewing insects of any kind, the poison must be placed on the plants before or just as soon as the insects arrive. Hence, it is imperative that the orchardist know at what stage of its life cycle the insect feeds on the plants and at what season of the year the feeding stage occurs. If spraying is done too long before the insects appear, the material may be washed off; but the insects may have burrowed out of reach of poison if it is not applied until after they have begun feeding. In spraying for fungous diseases the fungicide must be applied before the spores germinate. If the spores have germinated and parts of the new growth have entered the foliage or fruit, it is impossible to prevent fungous injury. ■This is a brief review of Research Bulletin No. 10, "Spraying Experiments in Nebraska." issued by this Station. Anyone interested in the details of the investitatioiu will be furnished, on application, a copy of the complete bulletin. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 158 SPRAYING FOR THE CONTROL OF INSECTS CODLING MOTH This insect passes the winter as a larva, or worm. About the time apple trees are in full bloom these worms begin pupating, or transforming themselves into moths. The moths emerge and begin laying eggs about three weeks after the petals have fallen from the apple blossoms. The first or spring brood of worms hatch from the eggs within a very few days. Some of them go immediately to the fruit while others feed a day or two on the leaves and then move to the fruit. About 80 per cent of the worms enter the apples at the calyx end. The remaining 20 per cent enter the sides of the apples where two fruits touch or where a leaf or twig touches the fruit. The worms live to maturity in the fruit, emerge, and transform to moths which in turn lay eggs for a second or summer brood of worms. Normally there are but two broods of worms in Nebraska, but the length of time necessary for eggs to hatch and for worms to grow to maturity and transform to moths depends upon the temperature and weather conditions. During hot, dry seasons much less time is required than during cool, moist weather. Hence, worms are much more abundant. The chart shown in fig. 1 will give an idea of the abundance and rate of development of the different stages in the life history of the insect during the hot, dry season of 1914; while the chart shown in fig. 2 will show the same for the cool, moist season of 1915. Fig. 1 — Shows blooming period of apples, rate of development of codling moth, and dates when spraying was most effective for both codling moth and scab in 1914 The codling moth feeds only during the larval or worm stage. Hence, in order to prevent injury, spraying must be done just before the eggs hatch. But by the time the first-brood eggs </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Why, When, and How to Spray 5 begin to hatch, the calyces of the apples have all closed, and the worms which enter the apples at this point are safe from poison because the spray cannot be forced into the closed calyx cups. The calyx cups may be filled with poison if spraying is done immediately after the petals have fallen. After studying the life history of the insect it is very evident that three sprays are necessary to prevent damage to the fruit during a normal season,^-one just after the petals have fallen; one three weeks later, just before the first-brood eggs begin hatching; and another just before the second-brood eggs begin to hatch, as indicated by the black squares at the bottom of the chart in fig. 2. But during hot, dry seasons it may be necessary to spray four or even five times as indicated by fig. 1. The efficiency of a spray schedule for the control of codling moth depends very largely upon the thoroness of the petal-fall application. However, this application is not in itself sufficient, even tho every calyx receives a good dose of poison. Approx - imately 20 per cent of the first-brood "worms" normally enter Fig. 2 — Shows blooming period of apples, rate of development of codling moth, and dates when spraying was most effective for both codling moth and scab in 1915 the fruit at various points other than the calyx, on unsprayed trees. The spray materials lodged in the calyces certainly will cause some of the larvae which would otherwise enter the calyx to seek other points of entrance, so that the percentage of the larvae which enter the fruit from other points must be appreciably increased. This is borne out by the fact that even with the most thoro calyx spraying during the last three seasons 20 to 40 per cent of the worms were controlled by the late applications. The first application should be made immediately after two - thirds to three-fourths of the petals have fallen. The spray </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 158 should be applied as a coarse mist directly against the face of the open calyces. In order to apply the material properly the greater part of the spraying should be done from the tower. A good arrangement, where the trees are large, if a large capacity machine is used, is for two men to work from the tower and one from the ground. The material should be applied downward with a stroking motion of the rod, beginning at the extreme tips of the branches and following down to the trunk. In this way, there is a minimum danger of missing any of the calyces. More material is needed for this application than for any other. The pressure should be 225 to 250 pounds. The next spray should be applied about three weeks later and should consist of a fine mist. The main object of this application is to cover all growing parts of the tree thoroly. The material should be directed both above and below with long stroking motions, beginning at the tips of the branches. The exact time for applying this spray is immediately after the moths begin to deposit their eggs. The correct time may be determined by collecting larvae early in the spring and keeping them confined until they pupate and emerge as moths. Repeat the operation for the second brood and if necessary, the third brood. By doing this and noting weather conditions, every orchardist should be able to spray so that he may secure the greatest efficiency from the materials used. The best materials will give, at best, poor results if used at the wrong time. The third (or second-brood) spray should be applied im - mediately after the eggs laid by the first brood have hatched. It should be applied in the same manner as the preceding spray. In abnormal seasons like that of 1914, when, owing to favor - able conditions, the moths emerge early and multiply rapidly, a third-brood spray is necessary where thoro spraying during previous seasons has not reduced the infestation to a minimum. THE PLUM CURCULIO The primary injury done by the curculio consists of small holes made in the apples in feeding and for depositing eggs. This is only a small part of the injury, however. These punc - tures cause the fruit to become ill-shaped and knotty, and admit fungi. The beetles or adults pass the winter under trash and rubbish, and come out and begin feeding on the new leaves before the blossoms open. As soon as the fruit sets they begin feeding on it and depositing their eggs. Considering the following facts known in regard to the life history of the plum curcujio, it is evident that by taking advantage of certain habits of the insect its control is comparatively easy and certain: </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Why, When, and How to Spray 7 1) The adults hibernate during the winter under trash and rubbish in the orchard. 2) After a winter of fasting they are very voracious and in the spring commence feeding on the new leaves and buds before the blossoms are open. 3) The larvae are unable to live to maturity in the apples when they remain on the tree. Only those larvae which are in the apples that fall early reach maturity and become beetles. 4) The larvae begin entering the ground to form their pupal cases and transform into beetles about the middle of July. This continues up to the middle of August or later. The pupal cases are placed at an average depth of one to two inches. Therefore, control measures which suggested themselves and which have proved effective are: the removal of trash and rubbish, accompanied by early spring cultivation; thoro spray - ing with arsenate of lead before the blossoms open, followed by the regular codling moth schedule; the removal of windfalls, which may contain larvae, from the orchard; and, lastly, thoro cultivation of the orchard from the middle of July to the middle of August. SPRAYING FOR THE CONTROL OF FUNGOUS DISEASES APPLE SCAB One of the determining factors in the production of apples in Nebraska is the prevalence of apple scab. Notwithstanding the fact that its destructiveness is well known and that reasonably sure methods of control have been published, this disease alone damages more than 50 per cent of the fruit of the state. As a matter of fact, the loss is often even greater than it appears. The young apples drop prematurely, due to the attacks of the fungus upon the flowers before and during the blossoming period, and on the young fruit later. This was especially noticeable during the seasons of 1913 and 1915. At blossoming time the bloom was as heavy on the unsprayed as on the sprayed trees. The set of fruit on the sprayed trees was much heavier than on the unsprayed trees, and the number of apples which dropped prematurely much less. In unsprayed orchards the foliage is sometimes so severely injured that the fruit never attains salable size, and scarcely any growth is made by the trees. It often takes two or three years of thoro spraying to bring the trees back to normal growth and productiveness. Scab also impairs the keeping quality of fruit. At harvest time in 1915 several boxes of Winesap, Arkansas, and Ben Davis apples were stored. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 158 8 A part of each variety came from trees having considerable scabby fruit and a part from trees having no scab. All the fruit was free from visible scab when packed. Some of the fruit was placed in cold storage and some in cellar storage. When the fruit was examined in January, 1916, 10 per cent of the fruit in cold storage was scabby and 68 per cent of the fruit in cellar storage was scabby. The fruit in cold storage was held a few days before being stored and was taken out 2 days before being examined Fig. 3 Shows a leaf affected with apple scab and one free from scab Time of Infection — Apple scab is a cool weather disease and thrives best under conditions that allow shade and moisture. Under ordinary conditions the period of greatest infection is from the time the leaf buds begin to unfold until two or three weeks after the petals fall. Where there is an abundance of dead leaves under the trees the period of infection may be prolonged by the continued development of spores or seedlike bodies in the leaves during a long period of wet weather. During the cool, damp weather of 1915, there was a great deal of loss due to a second infection occurring from the latter part of July to the middle of August. To this late infection is attributed a large part of the loss in storage due to scab injury. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Why, When, and How to Spray 9 The writer is of the opinion that infection occurred before picking, because clean fruit from a scab-free orchard developed no signs of scab, even tho stored in the same package with heavily scabbed fruit in the same cellar where so much infection was found. If I { Bfl I Fig. 4 — A light infection of scab on the fruit Varietal Susceptibility — It has been found that none of the common varieties are entirely free from scab, altho many varieties exhibit a great deal of resistance.

            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 158 10 Scab was always found to be more prevalent where no cultiva - tion was practiced and decidedly less in evidence where thoro, early and late cultivation was practiced. Sanitation, that is, the removal of old leaves, windfalls, and mummied apples, together with clean culture, will go a long way towards controlling the scab infection. The proper spacing of the trees in an orchard, good air drain - age, and the right amount of pruning will lessen the infection of scab to some extent. However, with an ideal orchard and the best methods of sanitation, clean fruit cannot be grown in Nebraska unless the orchards are properly sprayed. Spraying will control the disease if done at the proper time. This time depends upon the time of infection. The spray must be applied before the infection in order to prevent injury. There - fore, since there is always more or less infection at or just before the time the blossoms are out, if the weather conditions are favorable, it follows that spraying for scab must.be done before this time. What is known as the cluster-bud stage — just as the flowers of the clusters are separating and showing "pink" but before the individual blossoms open — is the proper time for this application. A second application at the petal-fall stage and another two to three weeks later are as a rule required to insure protection. During this time new surfaces of fruit and foliage are being rapidly exposed and are liable to infection. Another spray in the latter part of July or the first part of August may be necessary to prevent late infection in seasons such as that of 1915. In order to secure the best results it is necessary that the grower watch the weather conditions carefully and regulate his schedule accordingly. Thousands of bushels of apples have been lost in this state because the grower delayed spraying on account of rainy weather, fearing the spray would wash off. This is just the time when protection is needed to prevent infection. There is rarely a season in Nebraska when, because of wet weather, there is not sufficient time to spray; and if it is only possible to work for a part of a day at a time, spraying should proceed. Ordinarily the spray material will dry in 30 minutes of sunshine so that it will adhere well thru any ordinary hard washing rain. APPLE BLOTCH This fungus attacks fruit spurs, twigs, and rapidly growing shoots as well as the leaves and fruit. On the fruit spurs, twigs, and water sprouts, small cankers are formed in which the fungus lives over winter. The fungus injures the leaves by killing the tissues in small </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Why, When, and How to Spray 11 irregular spots. These spots often appear in great numbers scattered over the surface of the leaf. Badly infected leaves turn yellow and drop prematurely, or die and remain on the tree. Fig. 5 — Blotch cankers on twigs On the fruit, the disease first appears as a very small, light brown blot with very irregular fringed edges. The blotches spread rapidly, and often, where they are numerous, run together and cover almost the entire surface of the fruit. The fungus kills only the outer portion of the skin so that the continued growing of_.the fruit causes the fruit to crack. yfff) Fig. 6 — Blotch on mature fruit </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 158 Infection — The cankers in which the fungus passes the winter are the chief sources of infection. Spores are produced during the warm, moist weather of spring. They are readily carried by the rain and other agencies to the young fruit, leaves, and twigs, producing the first spring outbreak of the disease. The most extensive infection begins 4 to 5 weeks after the petals have fallen, altho some infection probably occurs during the remainder of the growing season. Bordeaux mixture is superior to lime sulphur for controlling blotch. For this purpose the 3-4-50 (3 lbs. of bluestone, 4 lbs. of lime, and water to make 50 gallons) is recommended ; tho, if a good grade of fresh stone - lime is used (not air-slaked or hydrated lime), the 3-3-50 formula is equally good. During dry weather the 4-4-50 formula has given good results but is not so safe when used during wet weather. Three weeks after the petals fall is soon enough for the first spray for blotch; and in orchards no more badly infected than 15 per cent to 45 per cent, this spray, followed by another applica - tion of fungicide when spraying for the second brood of codling moth, is usually sufficient. In orchards more heavily infected, another application of Bordeaux mixture 15 to 20 days after the 3-weeks spray should be made. Ordinarily only such varieties as Mann, Missouri, Maiden Blush, Northwest Greening, and Ben Davis are seriously injured by blotch. CEDAR RUST This disease has two stages. The first stage occurs not on the apple but on the foliage and twigs of cedar trees, where it appears during the fall and winter as small, brown knots com - monly called "cedar apples." With the warm weather of spring these "cedar apples" produce large masses of orange-colored jellylike material which contains spores or seedlike bodies. These spores are carried by the wind and other agencies to apple trees, where they produce the orange-colored rough spots on leaves and fruit. Little cedar rust has been noted in Nebraska during the last few seasons owing, no doubt, to the extreme dry weather. How - ever, the disease often proves very destructive. The disease may be controlled by destroying all cedar trees in the neighbor - hood of the orchard, but often the cedar trees are too valuable to sacrifice. A report published from this Station by Emerson in 1903 (Bui. 88) shows that the first or cluster-bud spray has comparatively no effect on the amount of injury from rust, but that the petal- </seg>

In order to secure the best results, spraying should be done as soon as the knots on the cedar trees, known as "cedar apples," begin to enlarge and show gelatinous orange-colored exudations. Fig. 7 — Cedar rust on apple leaves SOOTY BLOTCH AND FLYSPECK Sooty blotch and flyspeck are considered by most pathologists to be caused by the same fungus and were so treated in the observations on which this report is based. The fungus attacks the fruit late in the season and works entirely on the surface. The discoloration reduces the salability of the fruit. The fungus is most abundant during wet seasons and does the most damage </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 158 14 to fruit in the lower parts of the orchard where air drainage is poor, where the trees stand too close together, or where they are not properly pruned. Fig. 8 —Sooty blotch or fly speck on fruit Observations indicate that with proper pruning to admit air and light the disease will be incidentally controlled in spraying for blotch and scab. BORDEAUX MIXTURE VS. LIME SULPHUR Bordeaux has long been considered as the standard fungicide, but it causes so much injury to both fruit and foliage of apple trees that it has been thought advisable to secure a substitute. The most serious injury occurs when Bordeaux is used for the petal-fall or calyx spray. As the fruit grows older it is less liable to injury, tho if the spraying is done during wet weather, or if wet weather follows soon after the spraying, some injury may occur even after the fruit is full grown. Very little injury, how - ever, follows the use of Bordeaux for the last spray of the season and there is practically no injury when Bordeaux is used for the cluster-bud spray. Attempts have been made at the Station to prevent Bordeaux injury by adding an excess of lime to the mixture when spraying, or by spraying the trees with lime water after each rain, but no benefits were secured from either method. Lime sulphur has proved the most satisfactory substitute for Bordeaux. However, this material also causes some injury to fruit and foliage when spraying is done during extremely hot, </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Why, When, and How to Spray 15 Fig. 9 — A severe case of Bordeaux injury on fruit dry weather. Lime sulphur has been found practically as effective as Bordeaux in controlling all of the ordinary fungous diseases except apple blotch. For the control of blotch, Bordeaux is much more effective. Fig. 10 — Lime sulphur injury on fruit Because Bordeaux injury is greatest during wet weather and on young fruit and because lime sulphur injury is greatest during dry, hot weather, it is possible to interchange these two fungicides in the schedule so that practically no spray injury will result. Neither Bordeaux nor lime sulphur will produce russet on the fruit when used for the first or cluster-bud spray. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 158 Lime sulphur must be used for the calyx or petal-fall spray. Lime sulphur should be used for the 3-weeks spray except on varieties infected with blotch. Even if blotch is present lime sulphur should be used if wet weather prevails, but an application of Bordeaux should be made as soon as possible after the weather becomes clear and settled. If a fungicide is used for the fourth spray, it should be Bor - deaux if the weather is extremely hot and dry, and lime sulphur if the weather is cool and damp. If only one fungicide is to be used thruout the season, it should be lime sulphur. As a rule even where russeting is negligible, fruit sprayed with Bordeaux is not so bright colored and attractive as fruit sprayed with lime sulphur. It is the opinion of the writer that a great deal of the so - called spray injury to the leaves is due to infection by fungous diseases. It was noticed that during the last few seasons both Bordeaux and lime sulphur injury were as a rule more noticeable in orchards where there was an infection of blotch or scab. The spray when applied where infection has already occurred finds a ready entrance into the leaves at the affected points and easily destroys the surrounding portions. HOME-BOILED VS. COMMERCIAL LIME SULPHUR A comparison of the efficiency of home-boiled and commercial lime sulphur was made in 1915. Altho no definite conclusions could be drawn, the indications are that the home-boiled product when properly made is as effective as the commercial. Slightly less spray burn was found on the plats sprayed with the home - boiled material where only the clear liquid was used. Lime sulphur containing sludge causes more severe burning than where the clear liquid is used. This was demonstrated in a rear-by orchard where lime sulphur containing sludge was used on a part of the orchard while the remainder was sprayed with the clear liquid. Both leaves and fruit were damaged where the sludge was used. Grit or hard materials of any kind in the solution may cause russeting by being thrown against the surface of the fruit with considerable force, thus destroying the waxy covering of the cells or the cells themselves and allowing them to be more easily injured by the corrosive action of the spray. COMMERCIAL PREPARATIONS SOLD AS FUNGICIDES Several preparations, sold as fungicides by various com - panies, have been tried out, but so far nothing has been found to take the place of the two standard fungicides. Several brands of prepared Bordeaux were found to control fungous diseases </seg>
            <seg id="p017">Why, When, and How to Spray 17 practically as well as the regular Bordeaux but did considerable more damage to fruit and foliage. Atomic sulphur and soluble sulphur were used with the results that, while scab was usually controlled, the damage to fruit and foliage was so great as to make the use of either disastrous. Sulphur in either form would be desirable because of convenience in handling and reduction in freight, could the disagreeable feature of injury to the fruit be eliminated. PENETRATION VS. MIST SPRAYING The filling of all calyx cups and the thoro covering of all parts of the tree, fruit, and foliage with the least expenditure of labor and material and with a minimum amount of injury to the fruit constitute efficiency in spraying. The evidence secured during the last three seasons indicates that more injury is done by using solid stream or Bordeaux nozzles than by using those of the hollow stream or mist type, while there is practically no more efficiency secured. Even for the petal-fall spray, nothing is gained by using the Bordeaux type of nozzles. Coarse mist nozzles operating under 225 to 250 pounds pressure will throw a penetrating heavy mist several feet thru the foliage of an ordinary tree and will fill the calyx cups as readily and cover all parts of the foliage more evenly and thoroly than will the Bordeaux type of nozzle. CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF SPRAYING The argument is often advanced that it does not pay to spray when a crop is not expected, or when the insect infestation or the fungous infection is light. This is a fallacy. The orchardist can - not afford to neglect spraying just because there is no promise of immediate returns. Spraying will more than pay expenses in the benefit to the following year's crop. At Florence in 1913, only a part of a 30-acre orchard was sprayed. The whole orchard was sprayed in 1914 and 1915; but at harvest time in 1915 the effect of the thoro spraying received by but a part of the trees in 1913 was still decidedly noticeable. The effects were so evident that the packers, who were not acquainted with the facts of the case, found a decided difference in the grades of fruit from the two parts of the orchard. At Omaha one plat was chosen in an orchard which had been well sprayed for five years and one in an adjoining orchard which had never been sprayed. Neither plat was sprayed in 1915. In the first plat the 1915 crop showed 11.15 per cent insect injury and 33.12 per cent fungous injury. The second plat showed 94.62 per cent insect injury and every apple was injured by fungi. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 158 At Beatrice two plats were chosen, one of which was sprayed in 1914 and one which had never been sprayed. Both were sprayed in 1915. The fruit from the first showed 5.75 per cent insect injury and 22.84 per cent fungous injury. The fruit from the second showed 12.83 per cent insect injury and 57.32 per cent fungous injury. These data, while not exhaustive, serve to indicate the im - portance of continued effort in insect and disease control. COST OF SPRAYING The cost of spraying depends greatly upon the efficiency and capacity of the machine used. The capacity of the spray machine must be determined by the size of the orchard and the length of time available for applying the petal-fall spray. The time from the falling of the petals to the complete closing of the calyces is usually seven to ten days. It is not safe to allow more than what can be sprayed in five or six full days for one machine. Fig. 11 — A good type of barrel pump A barrel pump is efficient for orchards of 300 trees. During the three seasons the average cost of spraying with a barrel pump, including labor and material, was 30 cents per tree for four sprays. A double acting horizontal or duplex hand pump was found to be efficient for 300 to 400 trees. The average cost of spraying with this outfit was also about 30 cents per tree for four sprays. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">Why, When, and How to Spray 19 Gasoline-engine-driven pumps range from 3 gallons per minute to 12 gallons per minute in capacity, and are efficient for about 150 trees for each gallon per minute. This would be 450 trees for the smallest and 1,800 trees for the largest outfits. The average cost of spraying with power outfits during the past three seasons ranged from 20 to 25 cents per tree. Fig. 12 — A Triplex machine of 10 to 12 gallons per minute capacity Power machines are the most satisfactory where the orchard is large enough to warrant their use tho not necessarily more efficient than a good type of hand pump outfit when the latter is properly used. With any outfit the nozzle capacity must be regulated to fit the capacity of the pump. No outfit will do good work when the pump is unable to supply the liquid fast enough to maintain a good pressure. It makes little difference whether a double acting horizontal pump or an upright duplex or triplex pump is used if the capacity is large enough and it is well made; provided that plenty of power is supplied to operate it at full capacity, and that the outfit is not too heavy. However excellent in all other ways, an outfit is not dependable unless it has a good pressure regulator. It must be remembered that efficiency in spraying is secured only by doing the work thoroly and at a time that will prevent infestation and infection. Protection by spraying is preventive rather than curative. A spray applied at the wrong time is little better than no spray. Spraying in a half-hearted way is often worse than no spray. It costs money but does no good. It is cheaper to buy an efficient machine than to "kill time tinkering" with a poor one. </seg>
