            <seg id="p005">5 BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. To Governor Chester H. Aldrich: In the submission of this report the Board of Education takes what we believe to be a pardonable and worthy pride in the self-evident prog - ress that has been made by the schools under their control during your administration. This feeling we are quite sure meets with a responsive approval by yourself and the citizenship of the state. It is doubtful indeed if any other department of public affairs in our commonwealth can point to more definite and satisfactory results. The wisdom of the legislature of 1911 in providing so generously for the maintenance of these institutions has been abundantly proven by the improved condi - tions which obtain in our public schools wherever the influence of teach - ers sent out from them has been permitted to prevail. Your attention in this report is called to the importance of the service rendered by the State Normal Schools of the state and the ideals of the faculties and Board of Education in the preparation of teachers for the public schools, and to the needs of the Nebraska State Normal Schools for the next biennium, together with data and information showing the progress made during the past biennium and showing the use made of the appropria - tions for buildings and maintenance granted by the legislature of 1911. EFFICIENCY THE SLOGAN. Efficiency is the slogan in education today, just as it is the slogan in every other line of human effort at the present time. Only a few years ago special training for teachers was permissible, but not considered necessary. Special training was not necessary for service in any voca - tional line and was not strongly required for law and medicine. It was not required of men in the government service except in the most tech - nical lines of work. Anybody could farm. Many people believed sin - cerely that American enterprise and ingenuity were satisfactory equiva - lents for special training not only for war, but for every form of voca - tional and professional service. Conditions have changed completely. This change has come upon the public mind in less than two decades.. It came as a result of the disappearance of the frontier. So long as there was a free homestead of good land for every citizen and so long as the richest soil could be purchased at low prices all interest and enterprise centered in expanding rather than on economy and efficiency. The work of the schools was no exception to this general tendency. But the moment that all good </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 BIENNIAL REPORT tinue, naturally gTowth started in the direction of economy and effi - ciency. Men are more willing to do the right thing when necessity forces it upon them. Necessity forces the fanner to do more intensive farm - ing and at the same time to preserve the strength of the soil. Necessity forces the banker and the merchant to be more economical and to ob serve more efficient methods than formerly in order to maintain the profits which were impossible during the days of rapid expansion of farming territory. Better efficiency is demanded in" every trade, in all industrial pursuits, and in every calling where there is labor and the PUBLIC DEMANDS EFFICIENCY. The public naturally and wisely demands better school efficiency. It demands economy in the use of funds, but it demands of tax payers and the legislature larger appropriations of money not only for the sup - port of the public schools, but for those institutions which prepare teach - ers for this more efficient service. The public believes that the only certain way of increasing school efficiency is to place professionally trained teachers in every school throughout the state. The local unit will increase the pay for these efficient teachers, but the public expects the State Normal and other training schools to provide an adequate sup - ply of trained teachers for the schools of the state. KEEPS ABREAST THE TIMES. The State Normal Schools have been established and supported by the state for the purpose of improving the teaching service of the state. Nebraska supported the State Normal Schools long before the public awakened to the value of professional training. The law makers in Nebraska have, however, kept abreast of the times in the matter of appropriations for education and in passing laws in the interest of the schools. A law was passed in 1903 requiring a minimum of Normal training on the part of every one certificated to teach in the public schools. Laws were passed in 1905, 1907, 1909 and 1911 constantly in - creasing the requirements in professional attainment for teachers' cer - tificates. The last legislature amended the law pertaining to" teachers' certificates giving Nebraska the most up-to-date law along this line of any state in the union. The same legislature increased the appropria - tions for the State Normal Schools and for normal training in the high schools of the state. THE VALUE OF NORMAL INSTRUCTION. Nothing yet written puts more vividly the value of professional training than what was said in an address fifteen years ago by the late J. Sterling Morton, the author of Arbor Day, whose home was at Ne - braska City. The following is quoted verbatim: </seg>
            <seg id="p007">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 7 "We demand for Nebraska educated educators. We demand pro - fessionally trained teachers, men and women of irreproachable character and well-tested abilities. We demand from our legislature laws raising the standard of the profession and exalting the office of the teacher. As the doctor of medicine or the practitioner at law is only admitted within the pale of his calling upon the production of his parchment or certificates, so the applicant for the position of instructor in our primary and other schools should be required by law to first produce his diploma, his authority to teach, from the normal schools. "We call no uneducated quack or charlatan to perform surgery upon the bodies of our children, lest they may be deformed, crippled and maimed physically all their lives. Let us take equal care than we in - trust the development of the mental faculties to skilled instructors of magnanimous character that the mentalities of our children may not be mutilated, deformed and crippled to halt and limp through all the cen- turies of their never-ending lives. The deformed body will die, and be forever put out of sight under the ground, but a mind made monstrous by bad teaching dies not, but stalks forever among the ages, an immortal mockery of the divine image." THE IDEALS OF THE FACULTIES. The faculties of the State Normal Schools of Nebraska are com - posed of men and women of exceptional ability, of thorough professional training, of scholarly attainments and years of successful experience in public school work. They strive by means of institute work, by means of attending teachers' meetings and visiting public schools to keep them - selves in closest touch with the actual conditions of these schools. They are men and women of highest school character and of strongest human sympathy. There are few in the faculties of these schools who fail to show a genuine interest in student organizations and student activities and few indeed who are not deeply interested in the welfare of every student in his classes. This heartfelt interest in these young people who are soon to go out as teachers in the public schools gives to the public schools each year hundreds of teachers whose lives are fully E rated to the high and noble work of teaching. That which was in the early day as the "Peru Spirit" has become the possession system of State Normal Schools in Nebraska. Eiother feature of the work of the faculties of these schools is the to connect the work of the school more closely with the work home and community. The emphasis placed on work in normal training and domestic science is to train for actually doing the things of the home and the things these young people will be called upon to do after leaving school. Emphasis is also laid on the practical phases of other subjects. The members of these faculties are leaders in the </seg>
            <seg id="p008">BIENNIAL REPORT 8 movement for a form of vocational and practical work in the schools such as will have a very positive bearing and value each year in prepar - ing boys and girls for actually doing something in the world. SCHOOLS OF THE PEOPLE. It has been often said, "As the teachers, so the school," and may tnot also say that as the State Normal Schools so the teachers of the « of Nebraska? There is no danger of attaching too much import - e to these schools of higher learning which contribute so directly to the work of the common schools of the state. Money used wisely to in - crease the efficiency of the common schools is never wasted. The legis - lature of 1913 can render a valuable service by providing for increasing the efficiency of the State Normal Schools, a service which will, through better trained teachers, bring immediate returns to almost every pre - cinct in each member's county or district. In this respect the State Normals, together with the common school, may be truly designated aa the schools of the people. . BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS. Liberal provision was made by the legislature of 1911 for additional buildings and other permanent improvements for the different schools. CHADRON. An appropriation of $12,000 was made for a heating plant at Chad - ron. The contract for the construction of this plant was awarded to the Eon Reinforced Concrete Co. at $10,893.50, complete, including all ssary equipment for its operation. This left unexpended of this opriation, after deducting the architects' fees, a sum deemed suffi - : to construct an addition to the plant which will be used to house the department of Domestic Science. When no longer required for this purpose it is the plan to convert it into a storage room, a very necessary accessory to the plant. Dormitory. Included in the general appropriation for Chadron was an item of $5,000.00 for general repairs and dormitory. With this fund it was the intention to repair and remodel the old academy building and convert it into a dormitory for girls. However, after due investigation and con - sultation with builders and architects, the board concluded that the fund was not sufficient and the plan inexpedient. The old academy building is located almost a quarter of a mile from the main building and on the crest of a hill of considerable elevation. To make it useful in any sense as a dormitory would necessitate the construction of a walk of more than </seg>
            <seg id="p009">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 9 ri feet. It could not be heated with any degree of economy from main plant and to install an individual plant would be very ex - pensive in maintenance. In supplying it with water the same condition would have to be met. Taking into consideration the expensive connec - tions, together with those of repairing and remodeling, it became at once evident that the fund was insufficient and the entire plan wa» therefore abandoned. This appropriation, with the exception of a small portion used for emergency repairs on the main building, will lapse rthe treasury and the incoming legislature will be asked to provide the construction of a modern dormitory near the main building. KEARNEY. K appropriation of $55,000 was made for the construction of a ring to the Kearney building. This contract was awarded to W. ssley at $53,732.50 for the wing complete, including plumbing, heating and wiring. The contract has been completed in a most satis* factory manner. The new wing was occupied throughout at the opening of the school in September. The completed building presents a stately and magnificent appearance and emphasizes the many advantages of housing the entire school in one main building. PERU. For Peru, an appropriation of $12,000 was made for adding a sec - ond story to the Library Building, a final consummation of the original plans for the building. This contract was awarded to W. J. Assenmacher &amp; Co. at $10,150.00, the plumbing to Elmer Dovel at $1,124.00 and the electric work to the Standard Electric Co. at $250.00. This second floor is now occupied by the department of Expression. WAYNE. Wayne was granted a new building to be known as the Library and Science Hall, and an appropriation of $55,000.00 made for its construc - tion. The contract for the building was awarded to F. P. Gould A Son at $42,960.38, the plumbing to B. Grunwald at $4,983.00, the electric wiring to the Standard Electric Co. at $870.00. The corner stone of this building was laid under the auspices of the Grand Lodge of Masons, Hon. Henry Gibbons, Grand Master, officiating, assisted by other grand lodge officers and prominent Masons from different parts of the state. It is now completed with the exception of a few minor details and is occu - pied by the school. Sewer and Water. Bovision was made for the construction of a sewer and water for ayne school. This contract was awarded to Lewis &amp; Leeder at i.00. The system has been completed and is in successful operation. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 BIENNIAL REPORT ACCOUNTING. Acting upon the recommendations of State Accountant J. W. Tulleys, uniform system of accounting has been adopted for the schools which not only lessens the work for the office forces, but makes a more com- plete and accurate checking possible. Where before each institution had bad its own particular method of arriving at a given result, now all do it in the same way and have the same forms ESTIMATES. Estimates for the different schools are submitted with the reports of each respectively. The board has carefully considered all with full approval, believing them to be reasonable and necessary. The past two legislatures have set a pace in providing for normal education which has met with the approval of the people and we can not now afford to take a backward step. BOARD EXPENSE. The last legislature set aside $3,500.00 for the necessary traveling and office expense of the board. It is believed that this sum will be ample for this biennium. However, the constantly growing demand for frequent meetings and inspections has led the board to believe it prudent to ask for an appropriation for the coming biennium of $4,000.00.

            <seg id="p013">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 13 REPORTS OF PRESIDENTS STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. CHADRON. Chadron, Nebraska, December 31, 1912. To the Board of Education of the State Normal Schools. Gentlemen: — I am pleased to submit herewith a report of the State Normal School, Chadron, Nebraska, for the biennium now closing. Growth of the School. The school was first opened June 5, 1911, in the city high school building, the new building for the Normal School not yet being com - pleted. During the summer term, 1911, we enrolled 111 students in the normal school, excluding the model school. The enrollment for the school year, September, 1911, to August, 1912, was 367 in the normal school, and 38 in the model school. This enrollment has been most gratifying to the principal and fac - ulty. The student body has also been of a high order of ability, and there have been students entered in the more advanced classes, so that we issued during the summer of 1912, six first grade state or life pro - fessional certificates, and another student completed the course, but chose to remain in for advanced work instead of asking for the certifi - cate that had been earned. We have now in our senior class seven - teen members. These will receive first grade state or life professional certificates at the close of the school year, 1912-1913. Additional Quarters for Model School. PWe have found it necessary to rent from the city additional room in r that the model school might be enlarged to provide opportunities the senior class to do the practice teaching required by the rules of the board. We are now using the West Ward city school building for model school purposes. This building is some fifteen blocks from the Normal school, making it quite inconvenient for students and teachers to a.ttend classes in the Normal school and do the practice and observa - tion work required in the model school. Faculty. Ee development of the school has necessitated additions to the fac - ) that we now have eleven teachers in the Normal school and four model school. In addition to these, the board has selected a libra - id one other teacher to begin work January 6th. Some of the </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 BIENNIAL REPORT departments are overcrowded. This is especially true of the English department, where there are seven classes in operation and but one reg - ular teacher. This situation should be relieved as soon as possible. Domestic Science. Under the order of the board, dated July 30, 1912, it will soon be possible to establish a Domestic Science department. We have frequent inquiries for Domestic Science work, and we have constantly to turn away students from the fact that we have not this department in opera - tion. Its opening will be a great help to other departments of the school. Manual Training. We have a relatively large percentage of young men and boys who are interested in the various lines of Manual Training. It will be well to complete the excavation under the main building and fit out the rooms for Manual Training work. Gymnasium. We have been hampered by the fact that no space was available for gymnasium in the building. It is recommended that adequate pro- vision for a gymnasium be made in the new buildings asked for. Additional Room. There are only eight class rooms available in our present building, nor is there room available for library purposes. Our library has to be kept in the rear of the assembly room. Also, in the assembly room, we have a less number of seats than we have students in attendance, so that it is not possible to seat all of our students in our assembly room at one time. It is, therefore, eminently desirable that adequate provision be made for the present attendance at the school and for a reasonable growth within the next two years. For this purpose, I have submitted to you in a separate report a request for an addition to the present build- Dormitory for Young Women. It is also very necessary that we have a dormitory for young women where they will be under the care and direction of the Normal school. At the present time, young women must find boarding places about the city. It is not always possible to find desirable homes for them. Par - ents reasonably insist that their daughters have pleasant surroundings and the best opportunities. This can only be secured by the state estab - lishing and maintaining a dormitory for young women. Agricultural Education. EV'e wish to increase the opportunities for agricultural education, ially in view of the fact that we are training teachers who, in will go out and teach in a purely agricultural community. The state </seg>
            <seg id="p015">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 15 already has splendid experiment stations. It is desirable that we add such facilities as will enable us to demonstrate the experiments that have been worked out successfully in the experiment stations maintained throughout the state, especially those at Valentine and Scottsbluff. It is not desirable that any original experiments be carried on. What we need is equipment sufficient to demonstrate the successful experiments of the stations already maintained, and to give our teachers practical illus- trations of the utility of established agricultural principles.

Tooley, rretary Board of Education, Anselmo, Nebraska. My Dear Sir: — I beg to hand you herewith the fourth biennial re port of the State Normal School at Kearney. Very respectfully, A. O. THOMAS. GROWTH OF THE SCHOOL. The growth of this institution is remarkable. We are just entering upon our eighth year. The buildings and equipment have been taxed to their utmost capacity from the first day. How we ever succeeded in getting along with the heavy attendance and the one small central build - ing is more than I can now understand. The addition of the north wing gave us some room to expand our departments, but the addition of the south wing has given us an opportunity to establish all the departments of the school on a substantial footing and have an opportunity to collect E" il and apparatus necessary for the strong work required by a having for its purpose the preparation of teachers. You will be ted in the following statistics: Matriculations, 4,242, or an average of over 600 matriculants each year. This counts no student twice. It is a safe estimate that by the close of the eighth year our list of matriculations will reach 5,000. Our total enrollment is about 8,000. We have issued 407 elementary state certificates based upon four years of secondary education with profes - sional training. We have issued 411 diplomas from our higher coarse, bearing privilege of life certificates. We have issued 243 life certifi - cates. We have conferred 6 degrees on four years' collegiate work, and 20 diplomas from the department of commerce. This is a most remark - able record and one to which we point with unusual pride. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">BIENNIAL REPORT 34 THE COST OF EDUCATION. While we have established a high mark in attendance for so young an institution, we believe we have also established a record for econom - ical and effective expenditure of the funds of the state. We believe we have conserved the state's interests to the fullest extent. The state has invested in permanent improvements: E Besides this, the City of Kearney donated to the state the present litory, the grounds, sewer and water connections and perpetual wa - rights from the Kearney Canal, together with $5,000.00 in cash, h was used in the repair of the dormitory and general improve- Efhe appropriated funds for salaries, maintenance, repairs, furniture equipment, office supplies, commencement expenses, postage, tele - e, telegraph, freight, drayage, water, fuel, lights, principal's travel - ing expenses and all other appropriated funds for the eight years amount to $405,040.00. This is an average of $95 for each matriculant and $50 per capita on enrollment. Deducting the amount of money used for per - manent improvements, the per capital expenditure is very much reduced. We do not believe this record can be duplicated by any Normal School and college expenditures in any other state. BUILDING FUNDS. In the expenditure of the money appropriated for building, the State Board of Education has conserved the interests of the state and has shown wisdom in the plans used. The building as it stands at present is 361 feet long, with a maximum depth of 122 feet, and three full stories. The original, or main building, is semi-fireproof, while the two tigs are entirely so. We have been unusually fortunate in getting ch for the money expended. The Shallenberger wing at the present time accommodates the library and reading rooms on its first floor. The second floor is devoted to the Departments of Music, English, Latin, His - tory, Reading and Elocution. The third floor is occupied by the De - partments of Agriculture and Biology, given over in most part to the Eratories. The Aldrich wing on its first floor accommodates the el Schools, the second floor the Departments of Education, German, lematics, Civics, etc. The third floor is occupied exclusively by the Iain building _ I 50,000.00- forth wing 50,000.00 iouth wing _ 55,000.00 [eating plant _ 15,000.00 furniture, equipment and other improvements 50,000.00 Making a total of _ $220,000.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p035">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ■ Physical Sciences. The original building accommodates the Model High School and the Kindergarten Department on the first floor; the second floor the Departments of Art, Commerce, the Debating Societies and Ad - ministrative rooms; the third floor contains the Chapel, Domestic Science Department and the Young Womens' Christian Association. HOW THE NORMAL TOUCHES THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF THE STATE. We shall graduate this year about 125 students from our higher course. These will take up their work principally in the graded schools cf the state. Few, if any, will find their way back to the elementary or rural schools. We shall probably graduate from the elementary course about 30 teachers who will go, in large part, to the rural schools. But this does not give a fair understanding of the very helpful relations of the Normal school to the common schools of Nebraska. There are those who endeavor to make comparisons of the Normal schools with other parts of our educational system, and try to disparage the Normal school in its endeavor to uplift the rural districts. From present indications our enrollment for this year will reach 1200 to 1400. Two-thirds of these people will not return next year. That means that 800 students who attend the Kearney Normal this year will go back to teaching, and a larger portion of them will take up their work in the rural school. It is a safe estimate to say that 600 or 700 teachers yearly, with more or less professional training representing a term or a year, will go back to teach in the district school. However, many of these will return later on to complete their course in the Nor - mal. There are, on an average, about 3,000 teachers entering the pro - fession annually. It can readily be seen that the State Normal School is a vital force in the preparation of teachers for every grade of public - school service. About 2,000 teachers will be supplied each year to the schools of the state by Kearney, Peru, Wayne and Chadron. Nebraska has about 10,000 teachers. This means that the four Normals supply annually about one-fifth of the teachers of Nebraska. I wonder if any state in the Union can show a system of Normal training schools so close to its public school system. The Kearney Normal provides for its summer session of eight weeks a special rural school organized and conducted as nearly as possible un - der the same conditions as those found in rural districts. Besides this, our courses of study and program throughout the year deal with the problems of the rural as well as the city schools. CHANGES IN PROGRAM AND REQUIREMENTS During the last six years constant changes have been going on in connection with the curriculum and the requirements of the Normal </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 BIENNIAL REPORT Schools, due largely to an attempt to unify the work of the institutions preparing teachers. Too much change of this sort unsettles, in a large measure, the conditions of the schools and deos not permit them to crystallize ideals. Our courses of study are now well balanced, our re - quirements, in a large measure, just, and meet the demands and the exi - pencies of the times. It seems now that in order best to conserve the interests of our schools, the present programs, courses of study and re - quirements should be constant for at least a period of years. Students Ering upon courses like definite information in regard to the require - ts in order that they may plan their work with intelligence and with onable assurance that they can carry out these plans. THE MODEL SCHOOLS. EIn order to conduct a school for the preparation of teachers, a sys - i of Model Schools is necessary. We have a system covering the dergarten and two years of high school, with all intervening grades. In the kindergarten are usually about 20 pupils, while all of the other grades to the high school contain from 8 to 12. The model high school usually requires from 30 to 36 pupils. These pupils- do not matriculate and are not counted in our enrollment. These schools are conducted in the most up-to-date and scientific manner. They constitute the peda - gogical laboratory of the school. Students who are preparing to teach must teach in these schools one year under expert criticism before being graduated from the higher courses. These model schools, in large meas - ure, form the chief difference between the Normal School and the college. CO-OPERATION. Perhaps the greatest factor in building up the Kearney Normal to its present high standard and attainment is due to the thorough co-opei ■ tion of the faculty. Eighteen members of the present faculty came in with the organization of the school eight years ago. They have labored conscientiously, courageously and effectively, laying aside, in large meas - ure, their own personal interests for the upbuilding of the school. Dur - ing the first years they were poorly paid, the highest salary at that time being $92 per month. But there was no complaint. The State Board of Education has recognized the ability of the members of the faculty and has done its best, under the appropriations, to increase their pay as rap - idly as possible in order to bring them up to the salaries paid by the public schools and by other institutions of similar character. Some years ago a wage schedule was established, but the maximum salaries have never been paid. I believe that these people who have labored so long and so faithfully and so uncomplainingly on the small salaries they have received should be advanced to the maximum salary as rapidly as possible. In paying teachers it is not usually taken into consideration that the average teacher who prepares himself for such a calling as a life </seg>
            <seg id="p037">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 37 work easily invests from $5,000 to $10,000 in his education. This is his capital invested. In many instances he gets no recognition whatever of this capital and no interest on his investment. He gets a wage scale on a par with men in other vocations who have spent little money and time in their preparation. CHAPEL AND GYMNASIUM. While we are well supplied with room at the present time for our departments and for the general work of the school, we are very much handicapped for want of a suitable chapel and gymnasium. The original plans call for an annex which is to be used for the chapel and gymnasium and which will cost about $65,000. During the last term our present chapel would seat only about half our number, and during the present year we are unable to get all of our people into the room. ESTIMATE OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR KEARNEY STATE NORMAL FOR THE BIENNIUM APRIL, 1913, TO APRIL, 1915. Maintenance: Office supplies and printing I 1,800.00 Fuel, water, light 8,000.00 Freight, telephone, telegrams, drayage, postage. 1,600.00 Furniture and equipment 8,000.00 Commencement NtuM Physical education 1,500.00 Domestic science 1,400.00 Agriculture 1,400.00 Total $ 24,500.00 General repairs and improvements $ 8,000.00 Principal's traveling expenses 800.00 Salaries for biennium 113,000.00 Employees' wages 12,280.00 SINGLE TAX At the close of the year 1910-1911 the students initiated a plan to provide for the expenses of the various school interests such as athletics. lectures and entertainments, subscriptions to the Antelope, and such other matters as were of interest to the school in general. At the open- ing of the present year those students who desired to do so entered an agreement to pay $3.00, covering all such expenses. Most of the stu- dents supported the measure, and the work of financing the various or- ganizations of the school is decidedly easier this year. Students who do not enter this agreement and who attend all of the functions of the school enumerated above will find their expenses more than double the single tax. Our students are in hearty accord with the measure </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 BIENNIAL REPORT CONDITION OF FUNDS. It will be observed from the following report that our funds are low, and the only way to prevent a deficiency is to cease purchasing. The Kearney Normal prides itself on the fact that it has never presented to the legislature a deficiency, and by carefully husbanding the small bal- ances herein reported we shall be able to close the biennium without a deficiency and without breaking the record already established. The low conditon of our funds is accounted for by the fact that it was necessary to equip both north and south wings during the present biennium with- out more than our usual appropriations.

Gentlemen : I am pleased to submit herewith the biennial report of the Peru State Normal School, including an estimate of the funds needed for the next biennium. The biennium just closing has witnessed a remarkable increase in the advancement of educational standards and ideals, not only in Ne - braska, but in every part of the country. Normal Schools have come to a better appreciation of their functions, their possibilities, and their limitations. Nebraska in particular is constantly making better provi - sion for the education of her boys and girls. In keeping with the gen - eral trend of educational ideals, the Peru State Normal School has endeavored not only to meet the needs of the schools of Nebraska as they arise, but to anticipate them and to prepare teachers to supply the constantly increasing demands made upon her for trained teachers from all sections of the state. Teaching standards are higher today than ever before in Nebraska, as evidenced by the certification laws passed by the Legislature of 1911. Peru Normal has adapted its course of study to meet these advanced requirements. Peru has proved that it merits the confidence expressed by the last legislature which appropriated every dollar that was asked for by the school. It has continued with an unrestricted growth in the face of the establishment of the additional state normal schools at Chadron and Wayne. The increased number of new students annually taking advan - tage of the opportunities offered at Peru is indicated by the matricula - tion fees received during the past three years as shown by the records in the state treasurer's office. (Matriculations collected for the summer school of 1910 and the year following were $2050.00; for the summer school of 1911 and the year following were $2755.00; for the summer school of 1912 and the fall term up to November 30, $2790.00. It is probable that by the close of the present year the matriculation fees will have reached $3000.00.) In the number of the "finished product" there are very few schools in the United States that surpass Peru. The number of graduates from the higher courses during the past three </seg>
            <seg id="p066">BIENNIAL REPORT 66 years has averaged one hundred seventy, while the number for the present will reach approximately two hundred. Practically all of these graduates find positions in the city and town schools of Nebraska, while tre are hundreds of students who do not complete the course, but who out into the rural and village schools all over the state. Method of Checking Out Graduates. C'ermit me to congratulate the Board of Education on its present od of checking out applicants for graduation for all the various grades of certificates. We are confident that this method has done much to standardize the work not only in the state normal schools them - selves, but in all the private and denominational schools of the state that are empowered to grant teachers' certificates. Function of the Normal School. The Peru Normal holds that the function of a normal school should be to prepare teachers for all the different positions required in Ne - braska schools. As a result of this policy, courses are offered with the special view to preparing teachers for the rural schools of the state. In - asmuch as such a large percentage of the teachers of Nebraska are in rural schools, we believe that no small pait of our effort should be di - rected in this one line. The large model school in connection with Peru makes it possible and highly desirable to train supervisors for the various art and industrial courses offered in Nebraska public schools, as Agriculture, Manual Training, Domestic Science, Public School Music, Public School Art, Commerce and Playground Supervision. The model school also offers exceptional opportunities to those preparing for prin - cipalships or superintendences of the Nebraska schools, inasmuch as it offers exceptional opportunities for actual supervision of classes, prac - tice in planning courses of study, practice in the criticism of teaching, and the solution of just such problems as would be met with out in the schools of the state. We deem it a wise provision of the Board of Edu - cation that extended cur courses to study through two years of additional collegiate work, thus granting the degree Bachelor of Education upon its completion. The rigid requirements for this degree make it the full equivalent of the bachelor's degree from any standard college. Faculty. The Board of Education has baen most fortunate in its selection of new faculty members during the biennium. The raising of standards of scholarship, which makes it necessary that all faculty members em - ployed in the Normal School proper shall have at least a degree equiva - lent to the Bachelor of Arts in the standard college, has proved a wise measure. I would recommend that this requirement be extended to in - clude not only those who teach in the regular departments of the normal </seg>
            <seg id="p067">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 67 school, but also to all who are employed hereafter in the training school. The newly elected faculty members have all been men and women, almost without exception, who are in sympathy with public schools and public school methods. Rce the chief burden of the work of the normal school is conceded he preparation of teachers, the faculty members should be en - d to continue in close vital touch with the public schools of the state. This should be done by frequent visits to the rural and city schools from time to time. Since the salaries now paid are too meagre to permit extensive visitation of these schools, I would recommend that the Board of Education set aside from the general funds each year at least $500.00 to bear the actual expenses of transportation for faculty members who spend at least one week in the public schools of the state. In Wisconsin and other states where this plan has been tried, the re - sults have proved so gratifying that they would not think of discon - tinuing the practice. With a faculty composed of such men and women as are now employed in the Peru State Normal, it is doubtful whether any other school in the country has a superior body of teachers. The 1911 Appropriations. EAs mentioned in another part of this report, the Legislature of 1911 ropriated every dollar that was estimated as necessary for the bien - n just closing. I am pleased to report that every dollar of the ap - propriation has been used for the exact purpose for which it was appro - priated. There was but one thing which we could not accomplish with the funds appropriated, that we expected could be accomplished at the time that the appropriation was made. This was fencing and laying out plans for parking the campus. This was made impossible because of a fire which on December 13, 1911, destroyed the entire pumping plant with all its contents. To rebuild this plant, purchase a new engine and repair the pump required an expenditure of approximately $1000.00. There was also a fire in the chapel last winter that damaged the build - ing to the extent of $150.00. These losses not only consumed the $500.00 which we expected to use on improvement of the campus, but reduced the general repair fund approximately $700.00. Notwithstanding this lsos, we think it will be possible to meet all needs of the institution for t remainder of the biennium without the deficit of a single dollar in department. ESTIMATES FOR NEXT BIENNIUM (For the Biennium beginning April 1, 1913, and ending March 31, 1915.) • Maintenance $ 26,000.00 Salaries, including principal and teachers 135,000.00 Employees' Wages 12,500.00 General repairs and improvements. 12,000.00 </seg>

The following is a de- tailed explanation of the estimate for 1913-1915: (The total amounts to $272,300.00. The apparently large increase is due to the fact that we have estimated $75,000.00 for a Normal Training and Industrial Build- ing, together with equipment for the same.) Maintenance. The maintenance is $1000.00 in excess of the estimate for the pre- ceding biennium. This will be necessary in order to supply heat, light and care for the repairs in the new building asked for, and doubtless needs no further explanation. As noted in the various divisions of maintenance, some modifications have been made from those used two years ago, as it has been found by careful account of the expenditures that the former division was ill-proportioned . Salaries. It will be noted that the estimate for salaries is $19,000.00 in ex- cess of the appropriations for the biennium just closing. This is ex- plained by the following: </seg>
            <seg id="p069">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 69 1. With the rapid increase in enrollment and the number of stu - dents graduated, it has been found impossible to handle all the prac - tice teachers in the training school with the force of critics that were employed at the beginning of the last biennium. At least two teachers on full time and one teacher on half time with an average annual salary each of $1200.00 for the full time teachers, and $600.00 annually for the half time teachers will be required. This amounts to $6000.00 for the bi - ennium. Then the Manual Training and Domestic Science departments, established two years ago, and started by one teacher each, have grown to such proportions that at least two additional teachers will be neces - sary to properly carry on the work of these two departments. Indeed, it has already been found necessary to employ these teachers in the closing weeks of the biennium. The average salary for each teacher will be $1200.00 a year, making $4800.00 for the biennium. This is a total of $10,800.00 increase necessary for the increased teaching force alone. 2. At least $8000.00 should be used in increasing salaries during the next biennium. This will be but an increase of $4000.00 a year, to be dis - tributed among forty-five faculty members, which would make, if pro - portioned equally, less than $90.00 a year per capita. This is bat a mere pittance as compared with advanced cost of living, and the advance in all other professions. It is absolutely essential that salaries be increased in order that the normal school shall be able to hold its best men and women. Many of the public school positions in the state are offering better advantages for the talent required in the heads of departments in the normal schools. Then, too, other states are outbidding us and taking away from us some of our strongest men and women. It is but parsimony to permit this practice to continue. Employees' Wages. This item is about $500.00 in excess of the appropriations of two years ago. It has been necessary during the present biennium to pay the salary of one janitor at least one whole year out of the general re - pair fund .This amount, $12,500.00, will enable us to pay employees without drawing on other funds of the institution. General Repairs and Improvements. As compared with the appropriations two years ago, this item is $3000.00 less than asked for then. We shall be able to make $12,000.00 meet the needs in general repairs because of the great amount of work done out of the last appropriation. Some of the larger items for which this will need to be used the present biennium are: New floor in gym - nasium; new floor in basement of library; a new roof for Science Hall; twenty-foot addition to the top of the standpipe (this is necessary as a means of fire protection, the present standpipe not offering sufficient pressure to carry the water to the top of some of the main buildings) ; a </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 BIENNIAL REPORT separate steam line to two or three of the main buildings; six complete toilet outfits with all fixtures; new cement walks; new arch -door for en - fine house. The foregoing items will cost approximately $2500.00. At least $2500.00 will be needed for converting the basement of the old main building into a Manual Training shop, and $1000.00 for fencing and improvement of the campus and Normal School grounds, including park - ing the same. This leaves but $6000.00, the amount actually needed and appropriated for the usual repairs. Metal Stacks and Other Equipment for Library. FThe appropriation of $12,000.00 made by the last Legislature for ing an additional story on the library, was barely enough to pay for building alone. There was, therefore, no money for furnishing the same. We now have on hand approximately two thousand volumes for which we have no stack room in the library. We also have over $3000.00 of the library fund with which to purchase books, but no shelf-room for the books. It will be necessary to expend from $3000.00 to $5000.00 in steel shelving and other equipment for the text-book and reference library. My recommendation would be to transfer the old shelving that is now in our reference library to the textbook library and then purchase new shelving for the reference library. This shelving should extend from the floor to the ceiling, and by means of the installation of a glass floor thus affording twice the amount of shelving space that we now have. It is a serious loss to the students of the Normal School not to have access to the later editions of the most modern reference books. Principals' Traveling Expenses. This itm is $200.00 larger than the last appropriation. The establish - ment of two additional state normal schools necessitates meetings of the Board of Education at these various schools, and since the principals are required to be in attendance at all these meetings, the increase will be found scarcely sufficient to meet these needs. Past experience war - rants the statement that the allowance heretofore made has not covered more than half the actual traveling expenses incurred by the principal, this necessary attendance at the different teachers' associations, board stings and various educational functions of the state. New Boilers for Heating Plant. CIt is necessary that another battery of boilers be installed in the ting and power plant. We have but one battery consisting of two boilers at the present time that can be relied upon to furnish enough heat and power even under the most favorable weather conditions. Should a breakdown occur ,it would be necessary to close the school in severe weather. The best estimate that can be obtained indicates that at least $3000.00 will be required for the installation of the two boilers necessary. It should be noted that while the capacity of buildings has </seg>
            <seg id="p071">STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION 71 Fl increased from 25 to 33 1-3 per cent since the present heating plant installed, there has been no increase whatever in the capacity of heating plant. Equipment for Manual Training, Domestic Science and Agriculture. When it is remembered that there has not been expended to exceed $3000.00 for equipment, for the installation of Agriculture, Domestic Science and Manual Training, the amount asked for in this item will be considered very conservative . The equipment in these departments wu designed to accommodate the number of students that were then regis - tered in these departments. Since that time the registration in the Man - ual Training and Domestic Science Departments has increased from five hundred to eight hundred per cent, while a large increase has also been shown in the Agriculture courses. This item covers for the Manual Training, the purchase of twenty-four new benches, five new turning lathes, a number of forges, band saws, with the complement of tools necessary; for the Domestic Science, additional sewing machines, kitchen utensils, gas ranges, table linen, dishes, sufficient to treble the present equipment; for Agriculture, a small plot of ground of at least two or three acres for experimental purposes in addition to the laboratory equip - ment such as is required in any well equipped Agricultural laboratory. Normal Training and Industrial Building. CThe present crowded condition of our model school building alone is cient warrant for asking for this appropriation. Added to this need is the exceedingly congested departments of Manual Training, Do - mestic Science and Agriculture which are now crowded in little rooms over the heating plant. We have called your attention before to the in - creasingly large number of graduates annually, approximating two hun - dred for the present year. We find it almost a physical impossibility to arrange for the practice teaching that is required by the law of Ne - braska .Then, too, in the Manual Training and Domestic Science De - partments we have had to refuse entrance to these departments to scores of students over the state because of lack of room. With this condition now existing but two years after their installation it would be difficult to determine the magnitude that they will attain within the next bien - nium It .is absolutely imperative with the present enrollment in these departments, that we provide additional room for them in a new building. E^e propose to accommodate all these departments by the construc - and equipment of a normal training and industrial building. This provide a place for the training school in a building with modern &gt;ment for the industrial work as it should be planned and carried n the schools of the state. It will also provide room for the expan- </seg>
            <seg id="p072">72 BIENNIAL REPORT •ion of oar public school courses, Agriculture, Domestic Science, Manual Training, Clay Modeling and Pianoforte departments. It is probable that very few normal schools in the United States have a larger training school than the Peru Normal, and it is certain that with three or four possible exceptions, no other normal school in the nation has so many, graduates annually from its advanced courses; and yet the building in which these graduates must do the practice teaching required by law ia ■o ill-adapted for this purpose that it would not be tolerated in the poorest city districts in Nebraska. While the walls of this old building, part of which were constructed over forty years ago, are in apparently good condition and would serve very well the purpose of an industrial building, they are absolutely worthless for the purpose of a training school building. While Nebraska is pre-eminently an agricultural state and among the wealthiest, the appropriation of $75,000.00 to enable us to offer facilities for training teachers and for industrial education is ex - ceedingly small compared with the appropriations made by neighboring states for this same purpose. From two to three times this amount is not unusual as an appropriation for a training school alone, while this appropriation is designed to provide facilities for a training school and all supervisory courses of industrial education for which teachers must be prepared in Nebraska. As pointed out under the estimates made to the 1911 legislature, permit me to repeat that I have attempted to be conservative, asking only for the actual needs of the institution that will make it serve to the best advantage the educational interests of the great state of Nebraska. We have conscientiously endeavored to avoid the extremes of exaggerated estimates on the one hand and parsimony on the other. We have not inflated our estimtaes with the thought that they would stand a liberal pruning by the legislature and still be sufficient to meet our actual needs. In short, we have asked for nothing more than the actual needs of the institution. Respectfully yours, </seg>

This left a discrepancy in the institutional cash ac - count just equal to the sum of these items. Under the authority of the board given July 18, 1911, Prin. D. W. Hayes and State Accountant Tulleys went over the books in the auditor's office and veri - fied the statement that these items had never been returned to the institutional cash funds. Acording to recommendation of State Accountant Tulleys we have charged these items to the cash funds, thus establishing an exact balance in the institutional cash account.

            <seg id="p132">132 BIENNIAL REPORT WAYNE Wayne, Nebraska, December 1, 1912. To the State Normal Board of Education. Gentlemen: — I take pleasure in submitting herewith a detailed statement of the receipts and disbursements for the biennium now clos- ing, also an estimate of the needs of the school for the coming biennium. In addition to the regular funds required for the maintenance of the school, we are asking for an appropriation for a new central building. The last session of the legislature gave us $55,000 for the erection of a library and science hall. This is now in use and affords excellent quar- ters for the library, chemistry, physics, biology, geography, agriculture, domestic science and household arts. The old building is now being used for part of the work of the training school, public school music and the department of commerce. The building is in bad condition and has been pronounced unsafe by the state archietct. We are asking for an appropriation of $85,000 for a central building, to be used for general class work and for the administrative offices. This should be a thor- oughly modern, fire-proof building. A statement of the needs for the next biennium follows Maintenance $22,700.00 General repairs 8,000.00 Principal's traveling expenses 800.00 Salaries — principal and faculty 84,490.00 Employees' wages 8,030.00 New building and equipment _ 86,000.00 Maintenance is divided as follows Printing and office supplies $ 2,000.00 Fuel and lights 8,000.00 Postage, telephone, telegraph, freight, express 2,000.00 Furniture and equipment 8,000.00 Commencement expenses 500.00 Manual training and domestic science 1,200.00 Agriculture _ „... 1,000.00 Very respectfully, U.
