            <seg id="p018">QUALIFICATIONS OF PERSONNEL 2. Pursuant to the above statement reference procedure to be used in selec - tion of qualified
                personnel to administer the State Assistance Plan a procedure was developed involving a partial Merit System as the basis of selection
                of said personnel. This procedure was developed as follows: In October, 1937 a questionnaire was sent to all counties in the State
                requesting their choice of a procedure to be used. A Merit System was the preference indicated. In December 1937 at the meeting of the
                Nebraska Association of County Commissioners, Supervisors, Highwa&gt; Commissioners, County Clerks and Registers of Deeds, held in
                Omaha Dec. 14, 15 and 16, we were invited to speak before the Association and explain a proposed Merit System plan. Following this
                explanation the Association passed a resolution to the effect that a Merit System be installed and given a one year's trial and that a
                committee be appointed from members of the Association to assist in work - ing out this plan. Such a committee was appointed and was
                composed of Mr. W. A. Bruce of Verdigrc, Mr. John Forsyth of Niobrara, Mr. Joe W. Leedom of Gordon, and Mr. Verne M. Hagarity of
                Aurora. A plan was worked out in conformity with the above resolution and with the hearty cooperation of the committee together with
                cooperation of members of the Washington and Regional Social Security Board. MANUAL 3. Pursuant to the above statement reference a
                State Manual this depart - ment worked out a State Manual covering procedure rules and regulations pertaining to the categorical
                assistance programs as well as the various certifications for Federal Agencies including VV. P. A., N. Y. A., F. S. A., C. C. C, and
                F. S. C. C. CERTIFICATIONS Beginning January Ist, 1938 the State Assistance Department took over the administration of the
                certification for the above agencies. This had been the responsibility of the Nebraska Emergency Relief Administration (NERA) up until
                this date. The administration of certification for these activities increased the responsibilities of this department very materially.
                Some idea of this may be obtained when we note from the following the number of persons or families receiving benefits under each.
                W.P.A. $30,151.00 28,893 persons N. Y.A. 3,118.00 4,846 persons (includes Student Aid and Work Project F. S. A. 6,053.00 8,562 cases

                included in the NERA ac - tivities the State Assistance staff was but slightly increased, i. c., six persons, four of whom assumed
                responsibilities in the State Assistance Pro - gram in addition to their NERA responsibilities. 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p019">! RECHECKS • •.•'; One of the first policies of the State Board of Control, concerning the ! • administration of the State
                Assistance, was to recheck eligibility of catc - • gorical recipients as it was felt that many were on the rolls who were not i
                eligible. This was especially true in the case of Old Age recipients. This ' recheck was begun in June, 1937, at which time there were
                28,839 persons in ! Nebraska receiving Old Age Assistance. In June 1938 there were 26,351 r persons in Nebraska receiving Old Age
                Assistance notwithstanding the fact j that during the 12 months' period involved 3,404 new recipients were added j. to the rolls. -- ,
                ¦ ¦ BLIND SUPPLEMENTATION &gt; Since the inception of the State Social Security Program certain county j funds had been used to
                supplement State Assistance Funds and thus secure •¦¦ Federal matching on same. County Blind Assistance funds were supple - | mentcd
                in some counties. The fact that this procedure was not -followed* ; out uniformly throughout the state has raised a question by the
                Social ; •** * Security Board as to whether these funds can be matched by Federal funds. ';* We are endeavoring to clear up this point
                in order that there will be no 1 exceptions taken by : the Social Security Board on the funds already matched I under this procedure.
                The original request for Blind funds specifically f indicated that county supplementation was expected and the subsequent i s requests
                (o the Social Security Board for Blind funds carried the same •' notation. We trust that this matter will be cleared up so that there
                will be I*-".; no funds with-held from the State. (Ref. H. R. No. 3, Sec. 6 and 13.) : A. D.C. SUPPLEMENTATION ;• ¦ \ proposed
                supplemental plan was submitted to Washington providing for counties to supplement their Aid to Dependent Children funds in ac - ;
                cordance with the provisions of H. R. No. 3,; Sees. 6-13 but in order to I conform with the Social Security Board Regulations this
                procedure must be mandatory and uniformly administered throughout the state and as it did not meet these requirements the request was
                not granted. AUTHORITY BOARD OF CONTROL The authority of the Board of Control to make rules and regulations covering the
                administration of the Assistance ¦ Program has been pretty ;- generally accepted by the counties. The Statutes provide (Ref. H. R. No.
                3, Sec. 10) that the County Boards "may employ such clerks and assistants as may be necessary to enable it properly to administer its
                duties." This -. same statute (Sec. No. 3, Sec. No. 7, Sec. No. 12, and Sec. No. 17) apparent - j ly grants the State-Board of Control
                necessary powers to administer the ¦ program in conformity with the State Plan, yet because of two varying i interpretations of the
                State Attorney-General's office, regarding the authority '. of the Board of Control to set up standards of qualifications covering
                personnel employed in the State Assistance Program the Social Security Board has requested that this point be cleared,up definitely as
                to whether ' or not the State Board of Control has authority to establish and enforce rules and regulations pertaining to personnel
                qualifications of County 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p020">Assistance Committees. This question came up originally at the time that ¦' the Nebraska State Plan was accepted in August
                1937 and an opinion from the Attorney-General's office was rendered at that time—final acceptance of the State Plan being with-held
                until said opinion was received in Washington. ESTIMATE OF FUNDS AVAILABLE . j The Auditor's report entitled "State Assistance Fund
                Statement of I Receipts for the period from July 1, 1937 to June 30, 1938," indicates that i the receipts for this year from all
                sources were $4,626,930.62. Analyzing this we note that $1,382,964.53 will be one item that will not be available in total during the
                next year of this biennium, i. c., unexpended balances. There will be another factor resulting in a shortage because of the i
                allocation of funds to counties on a population basis. Many counties are ! accumulating surpluses which are not available to counties
                where their needs i are in excess of their allotments. These surpluses come out of the total [ appropriation of $7,500,000.00 and
                remain in a fund which will revert at the 1 end of the biennium to the General Fund. •' i ,"¦."} WINTER INCREASES In the fall of 1937,
                with the consent of the Governor and State Auditor as provided by statute, increased allocation's were made to counties in order to
                enable them to more adequately meet the needs of categorical assistance . recipients during the four winter months of December, 1937
                January February and March, 1938, and December, 1938, and January, February and I March, 1939. Th IS meant that increased expenditures
                from the $7,50000000 i would be made for the above eight months,: over and above the original al- I locations, and presupposed either
                a reallocation of the State Assistance ' Funds tied up by the 1-10 cent error and the accumulated surpluses in I counties whose
                allocations on population basis were in excess of their 1 needs or a drastic cut in all Assistance allocations during the last three
                months of this Biennium. It is anticipated that the Legislature which meets in January, 1939 will take the necessary steps to provide
                for the reallocation of those funds. 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p021">PERSONNEL SELECTION . The most important factor in the successful operation of a public assistance program is the personnel
                engaged in its administration. ; ; . The Board of Control recognized this problem and chose, the merit system after discussing the
                matter with and receiving the endorsement'of the Nebraska Association of. County Commissioners, Supervisors, Highway Commissioners,
                County Clerks; arid Registers of Deeds. A committee appointed by the Association will work with the Examining Board md the State
                Director of Assistance in studying contemplated plans before they are put into actual practice ".; ..*"" : A statement of policy
                outlined in the Regulations for the Merit System in the State and County Assistance Offices, approved by the Bdard of Control and to
                be issued in July, 1938, contains these significant paragraphs: "In order to assure an efficient and economical administration of the
                functions of the State and .County Assistance programs and to provide equal opportunity for all qualified persons to compete for
                positions 1-in the State and County Assistance Departments, the Board of Control has adopted regulations to_ carry out the_merit
                principle. All appointments shall be made on a non-partisan merit basis. Except for provisional appointments, positions shall be
                filled from registers of eligibles established by merit examinations. "It will be the policy of the Board of; Control to make possible
                a career service in the State Department by making promotions based on efficient work and providing tenure in office for those who
                give satisfactory performance and to encourage such a policy in county assistance ad - ministrations." . ; ; ¦:'.¦...:¦&gt; The merit
                system is to be officially inaugurated in July, 1938. The Regulations describe the organization for the merit.system in the following
                way: ; .'...."*. '"¦ . " ¦¦'. *." - ..¦.;¦ "Examining Board. The Board of Control shall appoint a committee which shall be known as
                the Examining Board. The Examining Board shall be: composed of three members who shall be known to have a knowledge of public welfare
                administration, and to be interested in the improvement of public administration and in the selection of efficient personnel.! They
                shall be public-spirited citizens with recognized standing in their respective fields, and shall possess reputations for impartiality.
                The Examining Board shall form its own organization and designate a chairman, vice - chairman, arid a recording secretary whose duty
                it shall be to keep a complete record of .the .'transactions* of .'all* meetings. The Supervisor df Personnel shall attend all
                meetings of the Examining Board and participate in the discussion, but shall have no vote. Members of the Examining Board shall, be
                responsible for all preparations for holding arid grading examinations, including the determination of number of examining centers,
                arrangements for space, securing and instruction of proctors and oral interviewing committees; for the approval of test questions; for
                holding and grading all parts of the examination; and for establishing and maintain - ing of eligible lists and for. certifications
                from such lists. It shall, also, be the duty of the Examining Board to promote public understanding of the purposes, policies, and
                practices of the merit system. Meetings of the Examining Board shall be held as often as are practical and necessary at the call of
                the chairman or by the Board of Control. : 9 </seg>

                incurred, including travel and maintenance while engaged in the performance of their duties." In July, 1938, the Board of Control will
                appoint this examining board. The Regulations further state: "A Division of Personnel shall be established and shall be headed ' by a
                Supervisor. Under the direction of the Director, and in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Control, the
                Super - visor of Personnel shall supervise all activities of the Personnel Division; a lid it shall be his duty to administer and make
                effective the provisions' of these rules and regulations, including the preparation and administra - tion of classification plan and
                compensation plan (State Department and assistance to County Assistance Committees as requested); transfer; promo - tion, layoff, and
                dismissal of employees; evaluation of employees' services; maintenance of a service roster card for each employee, and other records
                and files; certification of individual pay vouchers or'employee pay rolls; recommendations for changes and improvements in these rules
                anil regulations; preparation of monthly and annual reports of the operations of I the Personnel Division and of the distribution,
                turn-over, and other ma trers relat/ng to employment: and to do all things lawtul which he deems necessary or desirable to secure the
                successful operation of the merit system in accordance with the provisions; of these rules and regulations." The Examine Board will
                give public announcements of all examinations at least three weeks in advance of the closing date for the receipt of appli - cations.
                Such notice is to he posted in the State Assistance Office; in M county assistance offices, and in other conspicuous places in towns
                and cities of Nebraska. Announcements will be sent to libraries, American Legion posts. Boards of County Commissioners or Supervisors,
                reemployment offices, schools and universities, post offices, state and local organizations, labor unions, and applicants who have at
                one time or another made appli - cation for a position with the State Department of Assistance and Child Welfare. It is expected that
                the press will publicize these examinations at frequent intervals. ANNOUNCEMENTS Applicants will be required to meet certain entrance
                qualifications specified in the announcements, except that persons already employed by the Department of State Assistance and Child
                Welfare previous to July 1, 1938, will be permitted to take the examinations for the positions which they then hold, even if they do
                not meet the minimum qualifications for the positions. The written lest will relate to matters which will test the capacity and fit -
                ness of the applicants to discharge the duties of the positions for which they ¦ apply. Examinations will consist of written tests,
                oral tests, rating on edu - cation and experience, ratings on thesis submitted, or combinations thereof. '• Written tests will
                probably be conducted in eleven centers: Omaha, Lincoln, Norfolk, Ainsworth, Chadron, Scottsbluff, North Platte, McCook, Grand i
                Island, Broken Bow, and Pawnee City. The Examining Board will ask ! reliable persons in each center to serve as proctors. For the
                purpose of ' 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p023">concealing from the Examiners the identity of the: persons taking the as - sembled competitive tests, the test papers of
                the candidates will bear only identification numbers, which numbers will be assigned to the examinees at the time of the application.
                In all examinations, the minimum rating or standing through which eligibility on a register may be earned will be seventy per cent.
                Each examination will consist of one or more of the following elements: (a) rating of education and experience; (h) written test; (c)
                oral interview. An applicant's grade is to be based upon a weighed sum of the various factors of the total examination. Failure in any
                part of the examination will dis - qualify the applicant in the entire examination. All applicants for the same position will be
                accorded uniform and equal treatment in all phases of the examination procedure. • ORAL EXAMINATIONS For the oral examinations, the
                Examining Board will appoint an Oral Examination Committee consisting of four members who are interested in the improvement of public
                administration and the selection of efficient personnel. : ¦¦'-'¦ . '¦¦¦ Each candidate will be notified by mail of his rating as soon
                as the examinations are scored and: the registers established. Theldate set for this notification is January I, 1939. Eligibles shall
                be entitled to information as to their relative position on the register upon their request and upon presentation of the proper
                identification. • There will be, no doubt, much interest shown in the mechanics of the merit system. The Regulations provide for the
                establishment of re - gisters. :';'.' '¦ '. . ¦ ¦¦ ... ¦'. '¦¦". '.."'-¦"¦ "After each examination, the Examining Board shall prepare
                State and County registers of persons whose rating in the examination is not less than seventy per cent. The names shall be placed on
                the register in order of each rating starting with the highest. The life of each register shall normally be one year beginning at the
                date of its establishment." Probably even more interest will be manifested in the certification of eligibles. • •'¦"• ¦¦¦'. -
                "Whenever a vacancy occurs in any position in the service or when - ever new positions are established, notification shall be
                submitted by the Appointing Agent to the Examining Board upon a prescribed form. This requisition shall state the number of positions
                to be filled, together with the title of the position and any other pertinent information required. In addition, desirable special
                qualifications for the particular job under consideration may be indicated, such as sex, color, or particular experience." The
                following procedure is used for the certification of eligibles to the State Department: . ¦;¦--- '¦¦"''¦',:&gt;. ¦¦ • • "Upon receipt
                of a requisition for any one position, it shall be the duty of the Examining Board to certify in writing the three Highest names on
                the most appropriate register. When there is more than one vacancy 11 </seg>
            <seg id="p024">— _ __ _7l7Z__ i ¦ in the same class of position, the number of names certified irom tKe same register shall be five times
                the number of positions to be filled divided by three. (Fractions shall be considered as the next whole number.) Any Appointing Agent
                who has considered and rejected the name of a given eli - gible on a particular register for three separate positions may, at his own
                option, make a written request to the Examining Board to omit that name for any subsequent certification to him from the same
                register." County Assistance Boards requisitioning staff members or replacements will use the method described below: "Upon receipt of
                a requisition for any one position, it shall be the duty of the Examining Board to certify in writing the five highest names on the
                appropriate county register; or if there are fewer than five names, the entire register, plus the three highest names irom the
                appropriate state-wide register. Such lists shall show the ranking of each person on the State and County eligible list. If there is
                no appropriate county register, the Examining Board shall certify to the Appointing Agent the five highest names on the appropriate
                state-wide register. If, after care - ful consideration of the names, the Appointing Agent does not make a selec - tion, they shall
                notify the Examining Board that none of the names are ac - ceptable and shall request a provisional appointment pending the establish
                - ment of a new register." The Regulations provide that all positions in the state and county assistance programs will be included in!
                the merit system except for the following: (a) members of the Board of Control, (b) Director of Assistance, (c) the members of County
                Assistance Committees, and (d) the members of the Examining Board. Sixteen types of positions, at the present time, are under the
                merit plan including State and County technical positions. Examinations will be given for the following positions: STATE OFFICE Field

                Assistance, Aid to Dependent Children, and Blind Assistance, with the certification of cligiblds to the W.P.A. and to N.Y.A. for work
                projects, with the determination of eligibility on the basis of need of applicants for F.S.A. grants, with the selection of enrollees
                for C.C.C.j with the determination of eligibility for (surplus commodities, with inter - agency correspondence. The staff of the
                division is composed of the Supervisor oi the Division, the Assistant Supervisor, nine Field Represent - atives, three Field
                Reviewers, a Case Correspondent, Chief of the Certifica - tion section and eight Case Reviewers, an Assistant Supervisor of C.C.C.
                Selection, sixteen stenographers and clerks. The Division had charge only of the categorical program until Janu - ary 1, 1938, when
                the Nebraska Emergency Relief Administration termin - ated its work and turned over its responsibilities of certification to federal
                agencies to the State Assistance and Child Welfare Department. The Supervisor of the Division of Assistance is responsible for the
                efficient functioning of the assistance and service programs named above in the ninety-three counties of the state, for seeing that
                high standards of service and personnel are maintained, and for assisting the Director in his administration of the state program as
                he requests. The Assistant Supervisor takes major responsibility for the certifica - tion to federal programs, making many of the
                contacts with the agencies concerned, establishing state policies for these programs with the approval of the Supervisor and Director
                of Assistance, supervising the field Staff in their W.P.A., N.Y.A., C.C.C, F.S.A,. and Surplus Commodities responsi - bilities, and
                meeting with county bonrds and directors concerning these programs as need arises. He also assists the Supervisor in carrying out
                responsibilities of the categorical prog!am. The Field Representatives are responsible for the work of the local offices with regard
                to categorical as iistance and certification to federal programs, and for serving as liaison persons between the state and the county
                offices. More explicitly, their duties include (a) stimulating and directing the quality of social case work in the counties,
                evaluating county work for development and quality, anl for conformity to regulations; (b) interpreting and explaining to county
                boards and staff state policies with reference to investigation of applications, budgeting, record keeping, person - nel standards,
                etc.; (c) consulting witi the county staff regarding specific problems, procedures, and methods tc be used; (d) conducting hearings on
                cases appealed to the state department after a careful review of the county's decision; (c) informing the state department through
                reports concerning local programs and condilions affecting them; (f) coordinat - ing the work of all state representative of the
                department in the district; esablishing cooperative relationships w th other public and private agencies 14 </seg>
            <seg id="p027">and programs in the state. The Field Representatives in the Nebraska program have had active participations in determining
                policies of the divis - ion and of the department. ..'.:. All of • them meet the. established minimum standards of social work
                training and experience in the field, a definite part of which must have been in supervisory or administrative capacity. In the
                Certification Section, applications, rejections, cancellations of cases in the three categories of assistance are carefully reviewed
                to insure eligibility for aid and satisfactory social plans with the individuals or families rcceving aid. Modifications are also
                submitted i&gt;y the counties for review every three months for ADC cases and every six months for OAA and BA cases. Because a large
                proportion of County Assistance Directors and Visitors had no preparation by training or experience for their work, the Certification
                Section has been able to give valuable help through their study of case records, and to maintain more. nearly uniform standards of
                work from county to county. All Case Reviewers, as well as the Chief of the Section, have had social work training and-| - -or
                successful experience in the field. As quickly as counties submit adequate case records indicating thor - ough study and sound social
                planning, they are given responsibility for reviewing their own cases. As of June 30th, thirty-three of the ninety - three counties
                are reading their own Old Age Assistance modifications, and nine others have been selected and will begin reading on July 1.
                Twenty-nine are reviewing their Aid to Dependent Children modifications, nine others having been appointed to begin on July 1. A total
                of forty - two counties have been selected to review Old Age Assistance cases, thirty - eight Aid to Dependent Children, representing
                a total of fifty-two counties accepting this responsibility in one or two categories. This is in contrast to July 1, 1937 when eight
                were reading Old Age Assistance modifications, seven Aid to Dependent. Children, representing eleven different counties qualified to
                be given responsibility, for reading Old Age Assistance or Aid to Dependent Children modifications, or both. Field' Reviewers make
                official study in the field of a sampling of Old Age Assistance cases.in the counties to which they are assigned. Twenty - nine,
                counties have been reviewed to date. Home visits and a study of the recipients' resources are made as.part of the social audit.
                Individual case schedules and a county summary are prepared for each county showing the. quality of work, the personnel, relationships
                of the county staffs to recipients, board, and community. Copies of the completed schedules are given the Field Representatives as a
                basis for supervision. If it seems advisable, the Director and Supervisor, or Assistant Supervisor, together with the Field
                Representative visit the county board in an effort to secure a more satisfactory program. Beginning in July, the Aid to Dependent 15 </seg>
            <seg id="p028">Children program will also be studied as part of the.field review. Eligi - bility for membership in the American
                Association of Social Workers is necessary to qualify for the position of Field Reviewer. Centralized in the Case Correspondent's
                section of the Division are the handling of inter-agency inquiries, complaint letters, letters requesting information, as well as the
                intervi swing of applicants and recipients of aid, and others seeking informatior relative to'the program. Permanent files are
                maintained for all cases ndjed, and monthly reports are pre - pared which show the number, type, and sources of inquiries. . In order
                to insure uniform ac ministration of the Blind Assistance program in all counties of the state it became essential that a clear defini
                - tion of the term "blindness" be addp cd. The definition recommended by the Social Security Board was accepted in determining
                eligibility for Blind Assistance from the standpjint of visual disability. Eligibility for Blind Assistance is restricted to persons
                with visual acuity of 20 -|- 200 Snellen Scale or less in the better pye with correcting glasses. In July, 1937 an Advisory Committee
                of thne certified opthalmologists, named by the President of the State Medical Society, worked with the State As - sistance Department
                in formulating jlans for eye examinations and treat - ment, arranging for reviews by a Consulting Opthalmologist, and advising on fee
                schedules. A list of approved ophthalmologists and physicians skilled in the diseases of the eye whose qualifications were approved by
                the Advisory Committee was made jvailable to County Assistance Direc - tors. AH recipients of Blind Assista ice were re-examined under
                the new regulations, the Consulting Ophthalmologist verifying and approving or rejecting medical data submitted by tile examining
                physicans. One of the valuable achievements of the year was; the development of the State Manual, outlining regulatio and procedures
                of several divisions of the Department. Included in the &lt; ection on the Division of Assistance are chapters on The Application, '
                'he Investigation, Budgeting, Other Procedures, Fair Hearings, State and County Residence Certifications for W.P.A. and N.Y.A.,
                Eligibilty for Surplus Commodities, and Eligibility and Procedures for Selection of C.C.I:. Enrollees. The first steps have been taken
                in the establishment of a staff develop - ment program for the education of ccunty and slate staffs. Early in the program, the County
                Assistance Directors organized themselves into five district associations. Although the fir it programs were devoted to discus - sions
                of mutual problems and to til presentation of talks by the heads of the state departments and other ag:ncies, they have developed, for
                the most part, into discussion groups covering case work techniques. Leader - ship has come from the Field Repres mtatives, other
                state staff members and the universities, and more recently from county staff members them - selves, with active participation by the
                entire organization. These associa - tions have resulted in the development of workers; the careful supervision 16 </seg>
            <seg id="p029">of the field Representatives has brought about marked improvement in attitudes and quality of work. Although these are
                important, they are only a part of a complete staff development program. .; The Division of Assistance has responsibility for
                coordinating the Assist - ance program with other related public and private programs, and the establishing of cooperative
                relationships with other agencies engaged in related programs. Chief among these agencies are the Public Health Department, Vocational
                Education Department, Labor Department, State Employment Service, Unemployment Compensation Department, N.YA, W.P.A., C.C.C., and the
                private family and other social agencies. Assisting the Director with : the interpretation of the program to the general public is
                another function of the Division. The Supervisor, and other members of the Division, have given talks and led discussions before
                groups of school children, civic organizations, private clubs, staff and volunteers: of private agencies, staffs of other public
                agencies. Materials are also provided committee chairmen of local and state organizations, and County Assistance Directors, so that
                they may interpret to local groups the program of the State Assistance Department. In July, 1936, in twenty-seven counties of the
                state the County Assistance Directors were responsible for the administration of categorical aid and certification to federal
                programs. On July 1, 1937 there were forty - eight such counties. As of July Ist, 1938, eighty-five counties were unified with one
                central office and an Assistance Director responsible for making certifications, administering categorical aid, and usually issuing
                direct relief. Several factors contributed to this improvement. 1. Financial encouragement was given from the Nebraska Emergency
                Relief Administration which paid half the ':¦:• Director's salary and.some mileage in counties where a qualified worker was employed.
                ' : ¦ . 2. Counties were led to see the advantages of coordination :. "'¦;'¦•. from an efficiency and.economy standpoint. 3 The
                demonstration of the practicability of unification . . in some, counties had a definite influence in its adoption in other counties. .

            <seg id="p137">SURPLUS COMMODITY DISTRIBUTION SECTION ONE &#132; Federal Surplus Commodities are made available for distribution to duly
                certified persons in Nebraska as a second step in a Federal relief program. ¦ .'..¦¦ .( The first step is the purchase of surplus
                commodities existing in various portions of the United States under the Provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. In order to
                assist agriculture, these commodities once bemg purchased are to be disposed of without economic loss. j. Thus, in order to dispose of
                these items they are made available for d.stnbution as surplus-commodities to persons who have been certi - ned as eligible to receive
                them. J The surplus: commodities are shipped/ freight paid, to the state in wh,ch they are to be distributed. After they are received
                at the designated receiving stations any additional distribution costs must be paid by the state and participating counties. ; . j.
                The distribution of Federal Surplus Commodities does not contemplate the d.splacement of regular existing commercial activities. The
                option determming whether a county will take advantage of these commodities o r| not rests entirely with the County Boards. If the
                County Boards desire to ; ava.l themselves of these commodities, they enter into agreements with the State Agency covering rules and
                regulations regarding the storage and handing of the various items offered. If a county does not desire to avail itself of th.s
                program they sign no agreements with the State agency and no commodities are received by them. j The following tables give a report of
                the extent of the Surplus Com - modity Program during the fiscal year July 1, 1937 to June 30, 1938. 125 </seg>

                j Fifty years ago Charles W. Birtwell said, "The child'problem 1 . is an.integral part of this whole vital and urgent question .. .
                Who shall say how far the number of the wretched might be reduced if, ¦¦¦'.. first, every friendless and exposed child should be given
                such protec - tion and opportunity as an informed and determined community has the power to afford: and if, secondly, the causes that
                lie back'of the juvenile exposure should be sought; out, and their due recognition secured in education, in indutry, in the home, in
                the church, in our courts of justice, in state and municipal government, in public opinion, - in a word, in all the fundamental
                institutions of society?" INTRODUCTION In the modern program of social welfare our cardinal principle should be "an ounce of
                prevention is worth a pound of cure." Modern social service is not satisfied with meeting only the problems of public assistance. The
                emphasis is changing from "cure" to "prevention." Our emphasis in public welfare, today must be on child welfare - the child is the
                plastic material, property directed his potentialities for good are great; when the child is without opportunity for this direction,
                the loss to society is much greater. Modern social scientist's realize that the more thought and energy expended upon the child, the
                mqre lasting and profitable the invest - ment. Child Welfare implies adequate physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual development.
                It is only through the constructive development of the child that the man will be able to cope successfully with the problems of adult
                life. In the passage of child welfare legislation and the appropria - tion of public funds for services to children, the public has
                recognized that childhood is the time for preparation; afterwards but little can be accomplished. Money spent for constructive
                community programs for child welfare services means a decrease in the eventual costs of maintaining jails, prisons, reformatories, and
                in/meeting the costs of the mentally ill, physically sick and crippled, and the dependent. .'¦¦'. In general it can be said that today
                child welfare problems do not call for initiating new programs, they require rather the evaluation of the use of our existing
                programs. True,, in certain instances the legal basis for services and the administrative procedures should be strengthened.
                Appropriations play an important part; but it is more important to emphasize that the appropriations be used for developing and
                improving the constructive community services. The techniques: and practices of meeting the problems in child welfare' are known to
                us, whether we work with delinquent children, the unmarried mother or meeting the subsistence needs of the dependent child. It is
                unnecessary to administer the social 135 </seg>
            <seg id="p148">: ¦ ¦ . ! &gt; -'¦¦-¦¦ '¦ ¦i! . ] ¦ ¦"¦-¦' ii welfare needs on a trial and error basis. The problem is one of improv- j 1
                ing our administration, in response to a demand from a well informed . Ji community, intelligent in the matters of Social welfare. A
                public agency ; j program can be no better than the majority of the people desire. "WATCH- i I FULNESS IN THE CITIZEN IS THE SALVATION
                OF THE,STATE." !&lt;v ¦ ¦ \ I ¦ ¦ '¦'. ' ' i ! I ;-../¦: "lj; -¦¦.-¦ " -.¦"llj RECENT CHILD WELFARE DEVELOPMENTS IN NEBRASKA '• j! The
                last complete report on child welfare in Nebraska was issued by the )| State Child Welfare Bureau in its report to the Governor,
                December. 1, !j 1936. A partial report was made as part of the first annual report of the "j j Board of Control's Department of
                Assistance and Child Welfare issued '' j in December, 1937, for the year ending June 30th, 1937. Although the child j'j welfare
                program as originally outlined in the department's plans prepared ' i): following the passage of the Nebraska Assistance Act by the
                legislature in if special session in December, 1935, has not been greatly expanded, the ad- |S ministration of these plans has made
                for a continually developing program. . ij; The most significant and far reaching development in Nebraska's services l!:; to its less
                fortunate children was made in May, 1937, when the legislature !•' abolished the State Child Welfare Bureau, first created in 1919,
                and assigned. ijj the work of the bureau to the Director of Assistance and the Board of Con- jj'i trol. This made it possible to
                integrate all the child welfare functions on |j| the State level and to establish under the Board of Control one division to jjj
                administer and supervise these services—supervision and licensing of public m and private child welfare institutions and agencies,
                juvenile probation, | juvenile parole, medical care for the physically handicapped children, and )!i the social service work of the
                State children's institutions. Practically, this !jj" means the most effective service for the child at a minimum cost to the tax-
                ,'i! payer. The duplication of administrative procedures and professional ser- . l!i vices is eliminated. This means also consistent
                policies in all {phases.of j child welfare work. The Crippled Children's Services program and the ii work of the Orthopedic Hospital
                have also been coordinated and placed ii I under the Child Welfare Division. ¦ 1 In accordance with the mandate of the law that Child
                Welfare and !i! Crippled Children's Services be extended particularly to rural area|, Federal l'\ and State funds have been used with
                a view to strengthening and Extending : j[ ¦ services in these areas. This has been done by the employment of properly ¦ ¦&gt;!
                qualified persons to serve assigned areas ih the State and to act as con- j sultants in all matters pertaining to child welfare. In
                addition the Federal grant-in-aid to the State for Child Welfare Services has been usqjd for. the establishment of properly qualified
                child welfare workers in fiv&lt;[ selected demonstration counties. I The facilities for child study which have been established during
                the past year are particularly noteworthy. For the first time Nebraska's children in need of constructive study may have the services
                of a competent 136 </seg>
            <seg id="p149">The childrens institutions with which the Child Welfare Division is psychiatrist, psychologist, and pediatrist as a part of
                the Child Welfare Di - vision program. The statutes first m?de it mandatory in 1920 that competent | psychological and psychiatric
                study be given and although subsquent laws also made mental and physical examinations mandatory, it was not until the past year that
                these facilities have been made ¦available for even a limited number of children. As a part of the child study program a foster home
                department has been set-up and is financed from federal funds granted to the State for special Child Welfare Services. • ¦'. : To meet
                the needs for persons with training in child welfare work a part . of the Federal grant-in-aid for Child Welfare Services has been
                used to develop an in-service training program. ' ]'¦ '-..' - -:: :' -¦ ."¦;'..' ¦'¦ ¦'¦ ¦¦ ;¦ . ¦'. - | : .Services To County . I
                Through consultation work with the juvenile courts on children's cases and through demonstration case work services on selected cases,
                the work of the juvenile court in many of the rural counties has been considerably strengthened. Probation is niore frequently used.
                In some counties the Juvenile court procedure as envisioned by the persons who secured the pass - age of the juvenile court law has
                only recently been set up—previously in these counties juvenile cases were handled in the same manner as those of adult offenders.
                '¦¦¦."• ; ;.:¦ ¦' ; The Child Welfare Division's work with the State children's institutions all of which was begun during the past
                year, marks the greatest advance in improving Nebraska's program for the child in need of public welfare ser - vices. When the
                Nebraska Survey of Social Resources' was published in January, 1937, the inadequacies and the meagreness of the social services in the
                children's institutions were reported. Although the program is not one that can be worked out in a short period of time, the initial
                steps have been taken. The work with the children's institutions begins with consultation services to the juvenile court and other
                county welfare agencies, and con - tinues through the successive steps of commitment, institution intake policies, institution
                treatment progam, parole, and follow-up services. In addition to the direct services for the child, considerable emphasis has been
                placed on the developing and strenthening of community resources! to meet the problems of the dependent, neglected, handicapped, and
                delinquent child. A large part of this job has been the stimulation of the development, in, ac - cordance with the provisions of the
                statutes, of local public social j services for these children.' ,-.';:- : .'¦'.-;: In the establishment of these recent child welfare
                developments, an at - tempt has been made to consider and plan for the whole problem of child welfare. The efforts of the State
                agency, the local public agency, and the private agencies are being coordinated to the end that every child will receive the services

                and their relationships to each other and extra-depart - mental activities. The administrative organization also illustrates the

                chiid welfare l-l functions originally assigned to the Child Welfare Bureau,2 and responsible jj to the Board of Control for the
                social service activities performed! on behalf of the State children's institutions. These fatter duties consist of. acting as . j
                agent for the Board of Control in all matters pertaining to placing out and | receiving custody of children for the Board ot Control.3
                In May 1937, the \\ Director of Assistance delegated responsibilities to the Director of the '¦¦ H Child Welfare Division for the
                activities assigned in the statuies to the fj Director of the Child Welfare Bureau (with the exception of the supervision ij of the
                local administration of Aid to Dependent Children). In addition to .jj the work outlined here the director is responsible for
                coordinating', the Child Welfare Divsiion with the other divisions in the Department of Assistance I and Child Welfare and to
                coordinate the work of the Child Welfare Division with that being done for children by public and private agencies, and io cooperate

                under the provision of the grant-iri-aid from the U. S. Children's Bureau.4 In addi - tion to these units the specialized services of
                the department consist of psychiatric, psychological, and medical services. A discussion of these services is to be found, elsewhere
                in this report.s The service units of star tistics and finance in the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare are responsible for
                these functions in connection with the Child Welfare Divi - sion work. . •¦'• :. ¦'. : ¦ Figure Two : ; Map Showing Child Welfare

                functions of the Child Welfare Division arc handled by a field work unit. Each of nine district child welfare con - . sultants is
                Assigned a district consisting of from one to fourteen counties.* The district consultants headquarter in their assigned districts and
                work out of the-district offices which are located in central and strategic points. The county demonstration services are financed
                from the Federal grant - in-aid and are supervised by the supervisor of Child Welfare Services' (Federal) who is responsible to the
                director of the Child Welfare Division. The foster home project is a demonstration service for the placement of children from the
                State Home for Dependent Children and the supervision of children who are in foster homes as part of the study program in con- :
                nection with the medical, psychological, and psychiatric services. i :&lt;Under the provisions of the Federal Social Security Act
                money is made available to Nebraska for the extension of services to children in rural areas and areas of special need. This money, is
                not matched by State Funds . sSee, Section VI, Special Services. T" 6See, Figure 2 (map showing district). i 139 </seg>
            <seg id="p152">In genera), the State department is organized to perform four major child welfare functions: (1) social service activities
                in connection with the State children's institutions; (2) supervision and consultation = services for county welfare departments; (3)
                supervision of private institutions and agencies; and, (4) educational work. I County Unit Of Administration . It is not possible to
                discuss administrative organization tor child welfare without mentioning the place of the county unit Although under the Nebraska law
                the local unit of administration is not an integral part of the State administrative set-up, it is the primary unit of administration
                in the operation of the Nebraska plan. The concept of the local administra - tive unit for social work administration has many
                obvious. advantages over the alternate plan of State centralized administration. The county or district as an operating child welfare
                service unit must function'as an integral part of the State child welfare program. Only in this way is opportunity for personal
                contacts to be made. The decentralized! or local unit of administration makes it possible to give immedate aid when child welfare
                problems arise and makes for more flexibility and adaptability in the program. The administrative philosophy in the Nebraska child
                welfare program has been the strengthening and developing of he local unit as a primary administrative agency. The emphasis in the
                child welfare organization is to build an und this unit of administration the consultation and specialized services of he State
                department. The progress in building county units has been necessarily slower than the establishment of the central agency facilities
                because; first, prior to January, 1936, the Child Welfare Bureau functioned as a State centralized department with little or no
                working relationship with local units; second, although the statute gives a legal basis for a local administra - tive unit, local
                personnel is not available or is not sufficient to handle the work because of lack of public interest and funds; and third, th&lt;j
                County Assistance Committees, specifically charged by statute with responsibility for local administration of child welfare, have had
                insufficient staff to per - form the many public assistance activities as well as the child welfare work. 140 </seg>
            <seg id="p153">m CHILD WELFARE SERVICES "Child Welfare services" is a term used to describe the activities oi the Child Welfare Division
                for children other than those services con - sidered as crippled children's services or institutional services, In general)
                these'activities include consultation services on varied children's • cases referred by cdunty Officials) persons interested in:
                children's problems, and . public or private agencies. The safeguarding of children of illegitimate birth and those whose homes or
                environmental conditions make such protection necessary constitutes but a part ot the many duties of the child welfare workers.
                Likewise, the assisting of schools in handling attendance and conduct problems and the providing of psychometric information in a
                selected number of cases are services which the Child Welfare Division renders, upon call from the local communities. | . ...'. In
                addition to the.regular consultation services, a considerable number of child welfare cases is selected for more intensive activity in
                order to demonstrate to the local community the most accepted and effective measures for treating the problems involved in
                pre-delinquency, delinquency, and neglect. ¦ .... ¦¦-¦' '" : ¦'.'¦': ... ¦• ... \:'"-': '-'"'.' ' ; ; Allotment Of Federal Funds , .
                Although the above-mentioned services: are the responsibility of the State of Nebraska, the State has been greatly aided through
                participation with the Social Security Act, which authorize under Title V, Part 111, Section 21, the appropriation of $1,500,000
                annually for the provision of dhild welfare services in the United States, especially in rural areas and areas of special need, to be
                allotted to the cooperaing State public welfare agencies on the basis of a plan developed jointly by each State agency and : the
                United States Children's Bureau. Each cooperating State receives an allotment of $10,000 plus a percentage of the remainder,
                determined by the percentage of its rural population with relation to the rural popula - tion of the United States. Nebraska, is one
                of the cooperating States arid, through the Board.of Control, received an allotment of $2433757 for the twelve-month period ending
                June 30, 1938.1 This' amount has made it possible to extend and improve the services' of the State in its-work with dependent,
                neglected, and delinquent children. ' Nebraska's child welfare service program operates largely through the work of the District Child
                Welfare Consultants, the County Demonstration Case Workers, the State-County Child Welfare Units, the Foster Home Demonstration
                Project, and through the psychological, psychiatric, and medical staff.2 .¦'¦. '- : ; . .";¦'¦"•¦'•¦ '¦, •.:;'• !The total amount

            <seg id="p154">The work of the Child Welfare Consultants constitutes a large part of. the responsibility of the State, as has been
                delegated by statite, for service to children. The primary objective of the Child Welfare Consultant is the development of local
                administrative units for child welfare- and the establishment of consultation services to these units. During the present period,
                however, the work of the Child Welfare Consultant is in a transi - tional stage. The Consultant is doing, in many instances, work
                assigned by law to the County Assistance Committee, which must be carried by the State Department staff to meet the demands of
                expediency and immediate situations. Specifically, the functions of the Child Welfare Consultant during the past year were: | 1.
                Consultation services to local public officials, including Juvenile Court Judges, County Assistance Directors, and county board
                members on special problems of child care, prevention of delinquency, protection of neglected and ill-treated children. " 2.
                Assistance in organizing child welfare activities and resources in local communities. I - 3. Demonstration of case work methods in
                handling special types of children's problems. I 4. Strengthening of relationships, among agencies concerned with and responsible for
                child care and protection. 5. Rendering of assistance i:i connection with giving psychological examinations and psychiatric services.
                6. Through conferences, institutes, and in other ways, serving a:; agents for education and interpretation. County Demonstration Units
                Three County Child Welfare Units or demonstration centers have been established and functioning during the year. These units, in
                Platte County, Lincoln County, and Cass and Otoe Counties, the two latter counties sharing the services of one worker, are staffed by
                individuals who have had special training and experience in child welfare work and who have met the profes - sional requirements of
                the United States Children's Bureau. The: c local units were selected on the basis of the interest of the local community in the
                development of a program for child welfare, and the request from the County Assistance Committee for such services; the lack of local
                finan - cial resources for employment oi a child welfare worker; the area of special need; the willingness of the local governmental
                unit to participate finan - cially; and the probability of the local community's accepting full res - ponsibility after a period of
                demonstration. These workers are administratively responsible lo the County Assistance Committee, through the County Assistance
                Director, and are considered as members of the County Assistance staff and part of the county p •ogram. Their activities are concerned
                with: 1. The county child welfare problems which are referred t» their attention by agencies and individuals in the community. | . 2.
                The coordination of the Assistance program and existing Services to children. f 3. The development of new community resources as
                deterring in - fluences for juvenile delinquency and neglect. . r 4. The interpretation of the value of services for children to the
                com - munity. ) 142 </seg>
            <seg id="p155">The value of such demonstration Work' has been prtven as evidenced by the great number of requests from other counties to
                'have similar programs. In each of tlie existing units, the workers are carrying responsi - bility on a large number of children's
                cases and are rendering effective treatment: and are affecting preventive measures through their direct case work activities and
                consultive services to local County Assistance staffs and interested community citizens, ¦ . / . .Following the experience of a child
                welfare demonstration unit in Madison County (1936-37) &gt; the county officials requested of ¦ the Child Welfare Division a plan
                whereby needed services for children in. the local community, could be continued. Inasmuch as the County Assistance Com. mittee felt
                they were unable to assume the full financial responsibility for a child welfare worker, a joint cooperating plan was developed in
                which the county of Madison and the Child Welfare Division, through its Federal Child Welfare Service program, each provided one-half
                of a worker's salary and traveling 1 expenses. : ' • . Grants-In-Aid Principle . This plan involves the well-established public
                welfare principle of State grant-in-aid to local sub-divisions, permitting the continuance of needed governmental services where local
                units are financially unable to meet the burden. In addition, the grant-iu-aid plan has provided the necessary safeguards for
                standards of personnel and service so essential to any welfare activity. Effective June 22, 1938, therefore, a child welfare worker
                was added to the County Assistance staff and assigned direct responsibility for all activities of a child welfare nature. This work,
                it was estimated, would „ consume one-half of her time, the other half being devoted to the supervision of the Assistance workers in
                their relief and assistance case loads. ¦ A similar .unit'in Seward County was established where the County Assistance Committee
                requested a trainedj individual to handle their chijd welfare cases and also assume the responsibility for the Aid to Dependent
                Children cases, a number of which contain problems: demanding the attention and skill of a worker to prevent the formation of
                delinquent and dependent patterns. ::—:./;. :., ¦'.¦¦, "¦;..-' ¦'¦• ¦.'-, .-; ..- ; j ..' ¦ Although this County-State plan is but
                a-temporary one, depending as it does upon the continuation of the Federal Child Welfare allotments, it is hoped that it will
                stimulate the counties to assume full responsibility for their statutory duties relating to child welfare. When this is done, it will
                release the State's funds for needed units elsewhere. ; •On February 1, 1938, the Foster Home Demonstration Project for Lancaster
                County and vicinity was established in cooperation with the United States Children's Bureau as one aspect of child welfare; services.
                This program was designed to meet the need of a number of children in the 143 </seg>
            <seg id="p156">j Bute Home for Dependent Children for whom placement in foster homes Under supervision seemed advisable. In addition, the
                Foster Home Project has provided care for a limited number of out-State children who needed close supervision and psychiatric
                "treatment, which services couid best be provided in Lancaster County and nearby vicinity. Two workers have been employed on this
                project under the supervision of the Supervisor of Child Welfare Services. Their functions have been the finding of homes, the placing
                of children, and the supervising of these children. A small amount of boarding money has been! available through the State Homl for De
                - pendent Children for wards of the State placed in these foster ljomes' 'In other instances, County Assistance Committees and private
                agencies and individuals have paid for boarding home care for children in JLancaster County, in order that they might receive the

                : ¦',¦¦' j INSTITUTION SERVICES In August, 1937, the Board of Control delegated to the Director of the Child Welfare Division the
                responsibility for the supervision of the social services for the State children's institutions, and joint planning with the ).
                superintendents of the State children's institutions for all children commit- 1 ted to their care. This action was taken in an effort
                to carry out the intent X of the legislature when it abolished the Child Welfare Bureau and assigned | its work to the Board of
                Control to effect an integration of the, State's ser- &gt; vices for children. Prior to tin's time, each institution and the Child
                Wei- I fare Bureau had a separate field staff. This meant duplication of travel and :' services as well as confusion in the matter of
                policies and interpretation of 'JS rules and regulations. The present plan o£ an integrated child welfare field . J! staff means a
                more effective service at no appreciable increase in the total ¦ '. . f cost, and a continuing policy on all phases of child welfare
                work. -.¦'¦'•¦ % The children's institutions with which the Child Welfare Division is working are the following: Correctional f Boys'
                Industrial School - Kearney '. Girls' Training School - Geneva . ?i Dependent l;! State Home for Dependent Children - Lincoln j
                Physically Handicapped Orthopedic Hospital' - Lincoln Educational School for the Deaf - Omaha ...¦¦!.¦ 4. School for the Blind -
                Nebraska City Mentally Defective r institution ior FeeMf-Minded2 - Beatrice ; Maternity Care ; Nebraska Industrial Home- 1 - Milford j
                Occasionally cases are referred for services from the Men's Reform- ] atory at Lincoln and the Women's Reformatory at York. These
                institu- j tions are not included in the Child Welfare Division plan for institutional . \ work, although there are persons in these
                institutions under twenty-one years ! of age. V 'The "program of this institution has been integrated with Crippled Child- '¦ Ten's
                Services. See Section 111, Crippled Children's Services. 2Thc Child Welfare Division works only with the persons under 21 years of
                age. 3The Child Welfare Division works with both the mother and her child. . ! 148 </seg>
            <seg id="p161">Work With Judges The Child Welfare Division works closely with the county and district judges and is requested by most
                judges to advise on children's cases before commitment action is taken. This service enables the juvenile judges to use the resources
                available through the different institutional programs as well as other child-caring facilities. ; It also makes it possible for the
                same worker who has known the child to participate in plans- for him prior to commitment,; after commitment, and during the period of
                supervision after release or placement from an institution. '•'. &#132;-.,¦• The services "rendered by the Child ;Welfare Division
                staff in connec - tion'with the correctional schools is slightly different from that given in 'connection with its work.at the other
                children's institutions. Court com - mitments to the boys' and girls' training schools must be accepted when executed and the child is
                delivered to the institution. In case of the other institutions, because of overcrowded conditions making it impossible to accept
                every child committed and because of certain criteria for admis - sion, the Child Welfare Division, jointly with the superintendent,.
                is re - sponsible for intake. '•..*¦ . Pre-Commitment Social Studies ' .. ¦ Before any child is admitted to any institution other than
                the cor - rectional schools, a complete social study is made and the admission granted on the basis of the findings in this study. In
                this manner the children most in need of* the services offered by a particular institution may, on a selected basis, receive these
                services. Through this arrangement children committed to the Institution for Feeble-Minded are for the first time having adequate
                psychological, psychiatric, and medical study before decision is made as to whether or not these children should be admitted. Some of
                the children committed to. the Institution for Feeble-Minded in the past were not actually feeble-minded. Under the present intake
                policy this is not possible. As a result of this intake policy, other plans are" frequently made.in cooperation with the judge and
                county officials for children who otherwise would have been admitted. ¦ :.; . ; '.': Children for whom applications have been made to
                the schools for the deaf and blind are, on careful study, sometimes found capable of benefiting from treatment which will modify the
                handicap to the extent that the child may remain at home and attend public school in his own. .community. Another advantage in this
                improved intake procedure is the opportunity it gives for determining paternity for children born out-of-wedlock making possible
                careful study of the child before plans are made. ; , . * Before any child is admitted to other than a correctional institution, the
                Case Committee acts on the. findings in respect to the particular case. The Case committee consists of the director of the Child
                Welfare Division, a member of the Board of Control, and the superintendent of the institution where it is proposed that the child be
                admitted, , '.'" 149 </seg>
            <seg id="p162">150 — For all children admitted tc institutions the pre-commitment social data is gathered as a basis for planning for that
                child after he is admitted. Planning for all children committed to the State by the juvenile courts is done by the Child Welfare
                Division in close cooperation with the juvenile court judge and other county officials. ' The facilities of the Child Welfare Division
                staff are used in planning for the child after he is admitted to the institution. In several of the institutions a worker is assigned
                the particular responsibility for work with the child. The child's placement or parole plans are made solely on the basis of his
                progress and adjustment while in the institution. In the case of the correctional schools, the rehabilitation committee composed of
                depart- ; ment supervisors periodically reviews the child's progress and recommends when he should be considered for parole. In the
                case of the other institu - tions, the child's adjustment is observed by staff members and the decision made by the superintendent
                when recommendation for placement should be made. ; All recommendations for placement on parole are referred to the field staff. Study
                is made of the situation in the child's community and plans for placement are made with the admitting court and other interested agen
                - cies and individuals. If the field report supports the recommendation of the institution staff or superintendent, a recommendation
                is made to the case committee. The case committee then acts and gives formal approval to plans whether they be for placement or
                parole. Adoptions are also given final approval by the case committee. The period during which the child is supervised after his
                conditional discharge from the institution is deter - mined by the child welfare consultant after she is familiar with the child's
                problem. The plan for institutional social service, as well as the plans for the other services in the Child Welfare Division,
                contemplates that the major responsibility for child welfare case work be assumed by the local units. The statutes outline the child
                welfare duties of the County Assistance Committee which include these functions which are also outlined in part as the function of the
                county juvenile probation worker. The present plan of assigning the work in connection with the field services for the children's
                institutions is an expediency measure until the county units are prepared to accept their statutory responsibilities lor this work.
                The Child Welfare Division is responsible for supervising and licensing the child-caring and child-placing institutions and agencies.
                The agencies which have been licensed in the current year have made efforts to meet the minimum standards established in 1936 by the
                Child Welfare Division. These agencies are the following: Social Welfare Society—Lincoln Child Welfare Association—Omaha Nebraska

                Bureau by statutory provision in. 1933, and was assigned by the Board of Control to the Child Welfare Division in May 1937. An
                inspection of the home is required by a local physician and approval of the application must be given by the local board of health
                before granting of license. A visit is also made to the maternity home or hospital by the District Child Welfare Consultant, . and the
                consultant's recommendation is taken into consideration when the ¦ license is issued. The maternity home is responsible for reporting
                1 all admissions and births and an immediate report is required on the admission of all unmarried, pregnant women, or of any married
                mother where there is ' the possibility she will relinquish her child. The Child Welfare Consultant then discusses with the unmarried
                mother, if she wishes, plans for the child's future care. There has been considerable improvement in the co - operation shown by the
                maternity homes in planning with the Child. Wel - fare Division regarding the disposition of the babies born of unmarried . mothers.
                There arc one hundred fifty-five licensed maternity homes and hospitals. .¦.'.. .. ; ; .: ; 151 </seg>

                Bill of Rights. The citizens of Nebraska, in 1905, first recognized the medical needs of the physically handicapped child as a
                resp6nsibility of the state; at that I time the Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital was opened. Up to 1935 about five ! thousand crippled
                patients had been treated at the Orthopedic. Hospital. .¦ j Then, thirty years after the establishment! of the Nebraska. Orthopedic ;j
                Hospital, the state officially recognized the iarger problems of the crippled ,1 child. Immediately following the 1935 appropriation
                of federal funds for | services to crippled children, the Nebraska Legislature m special session . : ¦ I passed the Nebraska
                Assistance Act to match federal funds for the extension il of crippled children's services in the "rural areas and areas of special
                need." ij It was not, however, until May, 1937, that the Social Security activities in J Nebraska for crippled children were
                integrated with the Orthopedic^ Hospital | program. This integration was made possible when the Crippled Children's jj Service
                activities were assigned to the Board of Control. ' '.( , . j[ During the past thirty-three years, probably no other group of children
                jj has occupied the foreground of attention as have the crippled; children. .11 The program was started as one of hospital care and
                education only .' j and has been expanded to include preliminary diagnostic service, out- ' \ patient treatment, convalescent and
                after care services, appliances, voca- |i tional training, and social services. Even yet the Crippled Children's , jj Services program
                is meeting only part of the need of the physically handi- jj capped child. . ! The importance of making plans for the child's social
                adjustment as ;: well as physical rehabilitation is stressed in the present program. Whether jj the social problem is an individual or
                community one, it must be met as ';¦"_ must the need for medical and surgical treatment —a cast or a' brace— if a well-rounded program
                for the child is to be realized.. If the social needs presented are ignored, the results of medical treatment may hot.only ' be
                jeopardized but may actually not be achieved. For example, John has a deformity of the foot and leg because of an attack of. infantile
                paralysis. He is referred to the hospital, has surgical treatment which improves the position of the foot and makes it possible for
                him to walk ; i well if he wears a brace. He is returned to his own home after several ; weeks or months of hospital care. He dislikes
                wearing the brace, com- j plains about it to his parents, and finally takes it off. After the operation j and cast, his leg] does look
                much better, and for a short time he may even ; be able to get around fairly well without the brace. Lacking this support, .¦. \ the
                leg becomes weakened, the foot turns in again, and within a-year. j the results of the treatment may have been partly or entirely
                lost. ¦¦¦"¦¦] 152 </seg>

                ' the facilities the funds permit. The definition used by the department is the one recommended by the General Advisory Committee: "In
                selecting Jj children for hospitalization, professional services, convalescent and other *5 care, preference should be given to
                children under sixteen years of age who ¦•{] arc suffering from orthopedic conditions offering obvious promise of re- !, covery or
                improvement to whom shall be given as complete medical and j social service as possible." Other types of crippling conditions are
                accepted 1 as funds and facilities permit, for example: Children suffering from cleft i| palate, harelip, exstrophy of the bladder,
                and burns. Although the law jj provides for services to other classes of children the funds and facilities jj of the department arc
                not adequate at this time to meet this problem. If .'¦¦ ' ¦¦•'-"". ¦ j! It is not possible lo obtain accurate figures as to the number
                of crippled ji children under twenty-one years of age iri this state. On the basis of 3 |! crippled children per 1,000 population,
                there must be approximately 4,000 j! crippled children in Nebraska. On the basis of the definition in the Laws ! of Nebraska, 1937,
                Chapter 30, this number would be considerably greater. I j Since the operation of the Crippled Children's Services program, begin- j
                ning March, 1936, 2,390 children have been referred for services. Many i of these children were found to be ineligible either because

                referred for Crippled Child - ren's Services during the next fiscal year will be less than those referred last year. This conclusion
                is based on the fact that the number of re - ferrals now being made is less than formerly and that a large number of cases of long
                standing have been given treatment. For the most part, new-icases will consist of young children and infants with congenital
                deformities and' children who become crippled from acute disease and accidents. Children not eligible for service under the crippled
                children's pro - gram and other selected cases are referred to the University of Nebraska Hospital, Omaha.v The Crippled Children's
                Services program has not been ; designed to meet the needs for general medical care. Through the use of local resources the state
                department cooperates closely with the local administrative units in providing, care that is needed for children wlio are not

                physicians. In the appoint - ment of the committee it is kept in mind that one of its purposes is to to accomplish cooperation and

                coordinate work of the Crippled Children's Services with that of the. ' other public and private agencies. The Nebraska Elks' Lodges
                have i 155 </seg>
            <seg id="p168">conducted several out-state diagnostic clinics for the purpose of locating new cases and for the re-examination of old
                patients. The orthopedic nurse with the Crippled Children's Services has worked with the Elk's Lodges on these projects. She goes out
                into the area to be covered by the individual clinic and assists in community preparations for the clinics and clinic organization.
                Three clinics were held during the past year one at Falls City, one at McCook, and one at Chadron. To quote from the Annual report of
                the Benevolence Commission of the Nebraska State Elks Association, 1938: "To the workers of the State Child Welfare Bu - reau, its
                director, Harry }. Becker, the Orthopedic Nurse, Mrs. Catharine Gehrman, lent to us for clinic organization, it has been a genuine
                pleasure to work and be associated with you in this fine and fruitful work, and we trust this fine spirit of cooperation will continue
                indefinitely." . In ad - dition to financing the costs of these out-state clinics, the Nebraska -State Elks' association das sponsored
                the home-bound teaching program for the convalescent homes in Lincoln, and individual lodges have spent as much as $600 in one year
                for transportation, appliances, and special care at home for crippled children in their locality. Through Works Progress
                Administration projects, the Department of Education at the University of Nebraska has supplied the teaching super - visor for the
                convalescent care program, and the Nursery School Division &lt;&gt;f W.PA. has supplied a nursery school teacher three afternoons a
                week at the Orthopedic Hospital. The extension division of the University of Nebraska has offered its cooperation in assisting local
                communities . to plan home-bound work for children in their own homes. Several child - ren have been referred for this service by the
                Crippled Children's Services. The Vocational Rehabilitation Division of Nebraska is of great as - sistance to the crippled children
                ready to undertake trades or professions. All patients over sixteen years of age are referred to this Division by Crippled Children's
                Services. The Visiting Nurse's Association of Omaha has assumed responsibility ior follow-up and after-care of the children in that
                city and has given invaluable service. The American Legion Auxiliary in various local com - munities has done much to aid in the
                improvement of home conditions by supplying special diets, clothing, transportation to and from clinics, etc. on behalf of many of the
                children known to Crippled Children's Services! Many other civic organizations and women's groups have helped in numerous ways to the
                benefit of individual crippled children. Location Of Children In addition to the diagnostic and out-state clinics which have been held
                in the past year, location of crippled children is carried on through cooperation between County Assistance Directors, County
                Superintendents '-¦ of Schools and other community agencies. During the past year the special School Census Enumerator's reports were
                made available to the Crippled 156 </seg>
            <seg id="p169">Children's Service by the Superintendent of. Public Instruction. A'total of 1,687 children was reported. Of this number 551
                were already known to: the Crippled Children's Services. The remaining children have been sought out and plans for treatment made when
                the child was found to'be eligible under the official state plan. At * the present time there are. 1,447 children on the active lists
                of the Crippled Children's Services, receiving either medical treatment or some other form of service. Physicians, social agencies,
                and civic groups have been particularly active in locating' these children and encouraging them to complete plans for treatment. The
                application for services made by the parents •is received by .the County Assistance Director who is responsible for investigation to
                establish 1 economic eligibility for service. Children arc riot referred by the County Assistance Director to the State Department
                until a local physician has recommended that the cliild is crippled under the. ferms of the program and is in need of specialized
                services. ..." The Crippled Children's cases referred to the State Department by the County Departments are carefully reviewed,
                individually, by the State Department before being certified for state services. Parents are expected and requested to pay for that
                part of the service which their income permits them to meet. The District Child Welfare consultants work with the County Assistance

                throughout the program is upon developing and strengthen - ing the local program. Through these efforts many new patients have been
                brought to the:, hospital and others, who by reason of carelessness or neglect had failed to return for completion of their treatment,
                are now being located and placed under treatment. A plan has recently been put into effect where - by children living at a great
                distance from the hospital may report at a designated place closer to their homes for out-patient clinic service. The objectives of
                this plan for clinics near the child's home are as follows: . • ¦. 1. Provide opportunity for the parents, the local physican, and the
                county welfare department to care for the individual child in consultation with the medical specialist and the medical social service
                worker. 2. Reduce transportation costs to the parent, county welfare depart - ments, and local civic groups and avoid the ordeal of
                long trips for the child. 3. Serve as a diagnostic and consultation clinic for new cases. During the year 1935-1936, 136 new patients
                were admitted to the Orthopedic Hospital, 173 were re-admitted. During the year 1936-1937 this number increased to 175 new patients
                and 231 re-admissions. During the past year from July, 1937, to July, 1938, this number has been further increased to 224 new patients
                and 395 re-admissions. .' --¦ '¦ The surgical operations performed during 1935-36 were 225; |1 936-37, 248; 1937-38, 299. Patients
                observed in the hospital clinics during 1935-36 were 828; in 1936-37, 659; and from July, 1937, to July 1, 1938, 1,266. The; number of
                casts applied during 1935-36 was 290; 1936-37, 408; and 1937-38, 387. The number of splints, braces, and apparatus applied in 1935-36
                was 143; for 1936-37, 257; and 1937-38, 318. The number of X-ray examinations during 1935-36 was 512; 1936-37, 612; and 1937-38, 687.
                In addition to those children under Crippled Children's Services, 90 children have been examined who have been referred by
                institutions and private doctors for non-orthopedic conditions. During the past few years so many new patients have come under care:
                that the number of patients being discharged as cured seems small. This number will be increasing rapidly from this time forward as
                many of the patients brought in during the past year are now approaching the end of their hospital and surgical care and the figures
                of those discharged as cured • will be larger as time goes on. 158 </seg>
            <seg id="p171">! ' Medical Consultants : : • | Prior to September 1, 1937, consultations with other specialists for chilt dren under the
                care of Crippled Children's Services were provided on.a fee-, basis when requested by the orthopedic surgeon. Only a-few children re -
                ceived the benefit of these additional' services. To achieve a broader medical service, the Board of Control appointed a pediatrician
                on the staff of the Orthopedic Hospital. At the same time the Board appointed a radio - logist and pathologist, adding these important
                services to the hospital facili - ties. ¦ Two assistant orthopedic surgeons were added later to the'staff atthe Orthopedic Hospital,
                and still other orthopedic surgeons, in Omaha and Lincoln have been employed on a part-time basis for the care of such patients as had
                previously been under their care or who were being cared for without having to be admitted to the Orthopedic Hospital. All of the
                hospital and surgical work-for this class of,patients has been substantially expanded. Figures from the Orthopedic Hospital alone
                indicate how rapid - ly this has been taking place. . ':!¦¦ ' : , On. September 1, 1938, additional appointments were made to provide
                consultants in eye, car, nose and throat, general surgery, gynecology, urology, dermatology, and neurology at the Orthopedic Hospital.
                The appointments to these sbrvicis were made on the basis of certification by their respective American Boards, all of the appointees

                1937, to July 1, 1938, an average of 59 children received convalescent care in special homes provided for that purpose. This plan gave
                the children a period of post-operative care at less expense than could be given in the hospital and avoided many long and expensive
                trips to and from the hospital. From July 1, 1938, to November lj 1938, an average of 82 children received convalescent care for a
                part or all of any one month. / . ;¦:¦'' ¦' ¦ ... . ; '' . . '¦-.".' '¦ • .-¦ ¦ ' ¦ j In November, 1937, a social service department
                was established at the • Orthopedic Hospital as a part of the Crippled Children's Services. Medical social work concerns itself with
                the social factors in any given medical situation which may prevent the patient from realizing the full benefits of medical treatment.
                The function of the hospital social service is to facilitate medical treatment by interpreting to the parents and the child the
                medical 159 </seg>
            <seg id="p172">plan involved. The social service department must'gather pertinent social data directly from the parents and from the local
                agencies who know the family and, with the physician, plan for convalescent and after-care in the light of the medical and social
                situation. : While most of the parents bring their children to the hospital at the time of admission, only a few can afford to return
                to visit them during hospitalization. The social service department has been of help in establish - ing and maintaining mutual
                understanding between hospital authorities, patients, and parents and in follow-up service in the child's own community. The following
                statistics will be of interest in showing the volume of social services given during the six months period from January 1 to July 1,
                1938 * ¦ . .. ¦" -" There were 530 Orthopedic Hospital patients (including those attending clinic) who received 1,931 social services.
                These scrvices^ncluded 473 inter - views with parents and patients; 1,280 letters to parents and agencies con - cerning individual
                patients; and 198 field visits which involved conference with other agencies and home calls in the vicinity of Lincoln. These figures
                do not include clerical service in sending new appointment dates, etc. '.'.¦ Speech clinic service on a very limited basis has been
                brought about through the efforts of the hospital social service department and the depart - ment of psychology at the University of
                Nebraska. The time is given with - out remuneration, and several children were greatly helped in the past year by this special
                training. The social service department has also cooperated with the Lincoln Junior League in a play program for boys from seven to
                twelve years of age. The Junior League supplies two volunteer workers for the play pro - gram on the ward for boys, and two volunteer
                assistants for clerical service. 160 </seg>

                October, 1937, when a number of University psychologists, met and approve all reports before they are'sent to the Child Welfare
                Division to develop a coordinated plan. By this arrangement, the Department of . General Psychologj' and the Department of Educational
                Psychology and Measurements furnish extensive service; The intelligence testing is done by graduate students in psychology, who must
                have completed a minimal amount of technical work, and is under the direct supervision of the de - partment officials in charge of
                psychometric training. The latter check and approve all reports before they are sent to the Child Welfare Divisjon. ' Children are
                referred by the Child Welfare Consultants who arrange i with the child's parents or county officials-to bring the child to Lincoln. A
                large percentage of these referrals have to do with children who arc sup - i posed to be mentally deficient. The relatively large
                number who are so ;•.'••! labelled in the communities and found to be above the" "feeble-minded" ',')• classification, indicates the
                great need for such service. A smaller per - centage are pre-delinquent children for whom an effort, is being made in planning. ; ;

            <seg id="p180">The State Industrial School, Kearney The Girls' Training School, Geneva Individual children are referred by the institution
                superintendents and tested at the Department of Educational Psychology and Measurements, or a field trip is made to the institution
                for the individual or group testing of the children. This service has been particularly helpful in planning for parolees. The State
                Orthopedic Hospital, Lincoln Referrals for psychological testing of handicapped children are made _, to the Department of General
                Psychology through the Medical Social Worker of the Hospital. These are frequently initiated by the members oi the medical staff who
                wish to know something about a child's intellectual potentialities before proceeding with surgery or other treatment In Crippled
                Children's Services cases where feeble-mindedness is a pos - sibility the children are referred for psychological tests. The
                Institution for the Feeble-minded, Beatrice Psychologists from the Department of General Psychology make pcridoic field trips to the
                institution. It has been possible to plan placement of a number of children who were committed although pot feeble-minded. In the
                future the examinations of new admissions^ will t be made by the psychologists, and examinations of the inmates who are obviously
                above the so-called "imbecile" rating will be continued. This work will con - tribute to the plans for much needed grouping of
                inmates. The Nebraska Industrial Home, Milford Examiners from one of the Departments of Psychology make field trips to the
                institution, or arrangements are made for an unmarried mother to be brought to Lincoln. In the decision as to whether or not a joint
                plan should be made for mother and child, it is very important to,know the mothers potentialities in assuming responsibilities. 168 </seg>

                ACTIVITIES ¦¦¦:.¦¦ ; ' -&#132; , / Training. Unit Ana Staff Development : . The Child Welfare Division of the Board of Control
                established a field work training unit in Lancaster county in September, 1937, for two five i , months periods to provide: (1) Further
                training for persons who met pro- I . fessional and academic requirements in order that they might qualify for , .and fill positions
                oh the staff of the state and county organizations (2) To give persons, meeting necessary educational and experience requirements i
                who were employed on the state and county staffs, an opportunity to receive training in order that they might do a better job while
                employed. The emphases during the training period consisted of careful individual supervison of each trainee in handling situations
                relating to children and their families; attendance at regular staff meetings of the Child Welfare ¦•.-.'¦ ; Division;
                weekly'discussion groups for consideration of cases and to fami - . lian&gt;e the students with the policies, procedures, scope and
                purpose of the division in relation, to child welfare services, crippled children's^ services, institutions and foster home care; plus
                selected reading and lecture material ]; in the field of child welfare. Orientation in the Child Welfare program and : field work
                practice with child welfare cases .were coordinated with class &#132;j work for credit in professional courses in the Graduate School
                of Social Work at the University of Nebraska. Of the twelve persons selected from various sections of the state, five re - turned to
                the assistance and child welfare staffs in their respective counties, and seven took other positions, six with the Child Welfare
                Division, and one ; with the Assistance Division. Of the former, three are in demonstration units, one is a district consultant, and
                two are in county child welfare positions. Selectees developed in integration and practice of case work . skills and in the
                understanding of the scope and purpose of the child wel - fare program. ¦" . '. - ':' ''.'.'¦¦' ¦'••"•¦•:¦ !¦"¦¦' .¦" :..-.-. ¦:'¦."
                :v ¦'¦ ¦'¦''¦¦¦/- "'-' ¦¦ ¦' •.¦'' ' ' ":'. ¦ Community Organization Community organization or social welfare planning is one of the
                major methods in social welfare. The Child Welfare Division has considered that the "mass attack" upon the broad problems of child
                welfare is an essential part of its program in the development and strengthening of community resources for handling child welfare
                problems. Community organization implies a unified, integrated, and comprehensive plan of development and promotion of social
                well-being. The term "community organization" implies not only the planning process itself, but also: research as a preliminary to
                planning and the subsequent process o£ carrying into effect the program after.it has been formulated. This concept further implies a
                unified, integrated, and coordinated plan of development for the promotion of services to children. This approach is in contrast to
                the unplanned com- 169 </seg>
            <seg id="p182">munity work which is sporadic and unrelated effort to deal with problems v i contributing to maladjustment which might
                happen to attract the attention of ; .&lt; persons in the community. j . i This means that before a consultant is going to achieve an
                objective of j strong community services for child welfare it is necessary to unify and -I coordinate her work with that of the
                existing agencies in the community. j The important social agencies in the community - large or small - such as 1. the school,
                juvenile court, Red Cross, religious groups, civic groups, Ameri- j can Legion, and fraternal groups as well as the local public
                agency must .¦'(] become a dynamic part of the community child welfare program. Only j' through the cooperative efforts and the
                coordination of the activities of the J. contribution of these groups is an effective work to be done for children in \ the local
                communities. The Child Welfare Division's responsibility to effect \ this setting for working with children is just as much a part of
                its job as working with individual cases. ; The methods used in community organization vary in different com - munities. In some
                instances a community case committee has been formed i with citizens representing various groups serving as members. Specific : .'
                children's cases and community problems arc referred to the committees for . . .'.. ; study. In other communities a community council
                as a planning group is :¦; functioning. Informal advisory groups and the use of citizens interested ¦ in and with knowledge of
                problems of cnild welfare comprises another :¦ ; method of effecting community organization objectives. The simplest mcth- '; od is
                the establishment ot ;i community central index for the registration } and clearing of families and individuals receiving community
                social services. -j Further emphasis on this phase of the Child Welfare Division's work is necessary before further plans can be made
                to develop stronger local units ¦: !.' for administration of the child welfare activities. The development of public understanding of
                social needs, resources, methods, and standards is ;'-. pre-requisite to strengthen community program. 170 </seg>

                making a few comments on pro - is blems which we must plan to meet if Nebraska is going to continue to 5 benefit from a developing
                child welfare -program to meet the needs of its | unfortunate children in an effective and economical manner. The following |
                suggestions are presented as a basis for'further study, discussion, and I action: I 1. The most pressing need in the child welfare
                program in Neb- I raska is an appropriation of State funds for the care of those children who [ - i art not.eligible for aid to
                dependent children grants. Under the Federal ¦•"( Social Security law only. children who are living with certain relatives named in
                the law may receive grants. For the child whose own home is | unsuitable or non-existent there is no provision except county poor
                relief or ;. ! -institutional care. Every institution in the State caring for j dependent children is over-crowded. The number of
                commitments of dependent child - ren to the institutions for delinquents is increasing. ¦¦;¦,! 2. Strengthening of county
                administrative facilities for handling 1 child welfare activities now assigned by statute to the County Assistance : . Committee and
                County Juvenile Probaton Officer. Additional funds for administration are necessary. ' 3. Special treatment and other facilities for
                the child suffering from epilepsy. ; 4/ Recognition of the children suffering from spastic paralysis as ]¦¦-.'.; in need of special
                education and training. ¦••[.;. . S. Establishment of facilities in connection with the Orthopedic ; Hospital for children not in need
                of hospitalization but requiring con - ' valescent care. ..' : . ; ¦'¦¦'!¦ 6. Strengthening of the vocational training program for
                crippled ¦ children at the Orthopedic Hospital to better prepare those children who I are permanetly handicapped for training under
                the program of the Depart - ! ment of Vocational Rehabilitation. .. 171 </seg>

                sultant regarding a "gang" of four boys who were to appear before him on ¦¦ a charge of general delinquency. Two of these boys had
                been before the Judge several times and it was the Judge's request that the consultant make .' a complete study of each of the boys

                condition ! prevented her from giving him adequate parental supervision. Pete was \ not in school but was hooking rides on the freight
                trains and riding to the ':'.•.'•¦ next town where he had been involved with other boys in delinquent acts. - I John's father had been

                three ! boys involved in this case. • • i Jim and Charles, brothers, were slightly younger than their two compan- j ions. For years
                their parents had lived as two separate individuals in the j home. The older boy. Jim, had been expelled from school and Charles could
                ' \ not understand why he should go to school when bis brother was not at- i tending. j Information secured from the hoys, their
                parents, school officials, county ' and city authorities, and other interested persons provided sufficient basis I for the
                consultant's recommendations to the court. In line with these recommendations, the county judge appointed the county assistance
                director - ¦ ' ' ! as probation officer and approved the treatment plans for each child. John . 1 went to the farm home of an uncle
                who could provide, adequate supervision ¦ j and see that John attended school. Employment was secured for Pete . ' on a ranch where he
                could care for stock and learn to be a rancher. Jim - . i went to live with a cousin on a ranch in another county. He will be able I
                to complete a rural school education while living in this home and arrange - ments for high school training are to be made. Charles
                remained in his f own home under the supervision of the probation officer. I An enlightened Judge, a skilled Child Welfare Consultant,
                and a County .'-.! Assistance Director anxious to cooperate, were the means of averting the commitments of four boys to a correctional
                institution. Continued planning V by these three will provide them the means of leading normal lives and of ; growing into useful
                citizens. \ Carefully Selected Foster Home i SaJly ivas committed to the (iirls' Training School when she was 14 ' ' years old, not

                However, Sally's determination and ambition were early noted and she soon came to the notice of a Child Welfare Consultant. A family
                home was found for her where Sally was considered as one of the family, and was encouraged in her desire for higher education. Savings
                from her first summer's wages were used to-.pay .her tuition at the University where she is now an honor student. With the help of a
                carefully chosen foster family, Sally is being able to see to completion her greatest desire. " j ¦¦'.•¦.¦. . Our Ability To Make New

                ranging in age from six to '; fourteen years had been reared in an environment where there had not been an awareness of the need for
                character building and so the sudden and tragic death of their mother left them bewildered and confused and : somewhat fearful, of the
                future. Their father did his best to keep the ; home together but his attempts to be both father .and mother failed miserably. Before
                very long the family was a community problem.. ; • As the months passed Mr. B's discouragement increased and gradually ¦ ';- he
                developed the habit of drowning his cares in Saturday night [sprees. In ; the meantime Billy had become so adept with a sling shot
                that he could .¦".•"[¦ break a window at approximately forty yards. Roy specialized in rock ' throwing and the two boys fairly reveled
                in the resultant attention they . ; received. At this point the community decided that all of the children should be placed in a state
                institution and the Child Welfare Worker was asked to make the necessary plans toward this end. j : After making a thorough study and
                evaluation of the entire situation, . j the Child Welfare Consultant called a meeting of the interested "key" j. people. These
                included the Sheriff, Judge, Minister of the church where the family had attended, the School Principal and a representative of the .'
                i County Assistance staff. Through the latter she secured the services of : an intelligent motherly woman to act as housekeeper, and
                in this way 'again bring about opportunity for the children to have normal physical care. Mr.. B's limited earnings could not be
                stretched to include the services of a housekeeper so the County Assistance Department agreed to assume this responsibility. After
                part of the. overwhelming responsibility was lifted from Mr. B's shoulders he felt less desire to drink, and the fear of losing his
                children, also caused him to: improve his behavior.! i The "key" people with the Child Welfare Consultant discussed all aspects of the
                family situation. If the children were institutionalized it - ¦ ¦: would mean that they would be forced to make an entirely new
                adjustment, ¦ ; and in so doing, would lose the only security in their world, ithat which ' their father and own,home represented; It
                would also mean! that their : father would be left without home ties and last, but by no means least, : it would have meant a sizable
                expenditure of the State's money. Finally it was decided that.an attempt should be made to work out some other ; ..plan and to this
                end it was agreed that the housekeeper should be continued and that each member of the group would accept a certain : amount of :
                responsibility in directing the activities of the children. During the-months : which followed, there were some discouraging moments,
                but gradually .the children developed new interests and their activities were directed into more sociably accepted channels. . : I ¦

            <seg id="p186">One Reason Why Child—Placing Requires Skilled Workers! 1 On a cold, blizzardy day in January, a two day old 'baby was taken
                ; 200 miles across the State of Nebraska,' by the Doctor who attended her at birth, where a hospital admitted her with the
                understanding that she was to be placed for adoption. A relinquishment of the baby girl by the supposedly unwed mother was given the
                hospital by'the doctor. The hospital, contrary to the laws of the State, and with no information regarding the child's background,
                immediately proceeded to place the child , for adoption in a nparby town and after the placement, they requested the approval of the
                Child Welfare Division. Before approval' could be given, however, a detailed study was made of the adoptive home and the child's
                background. • , " . '• ... The adoptive home was a very superior one, the parents were in the : professional class, their mode of
                living and their financial station was \ above the average and their expectations of the child were of the highest. Judging from the
                child's parents, her potentialities and capabilities would : be very limited-Added to this the relinquishment furnished by the doctor
                . ¦: was not legal, as the parents were discovered to be man" and wife. Un- ¦ \ fortunately then, the blue eyes and the flaxen hair of
                the adopted child, so long looked for in a child by the foster parents, were the only redeeming j features of the placement. ' The
                natural parents absolutely refused to even consider taking the baby back since its birth had been kept a secret and they feared the
                gossip which would be created in their small town if the truth were known. The foster parents also refused to keep the child when
                tjhey learned of • : her unfavorable background. I '¦! ¦'•¦-¦.¦ Crippled Children's Services And Vocational Facilities Enable

                paralysis of both legs as a result of an attack of poliomyelitis at an early age. She had been getting around with the. aid of

                through the efforts of the Crippled Children's Services and the Child Welfare' Consultant that her family was persuaded to bring her
                back to the Orthopedic Hospital. At the time of her return to the Orthopedic Hospital last fail, Mary had gained so much weight that
                her braces were riot giving her the maximum support. She not only found getting around difficult but she complained of headaches,

                7 years old, ; was called to the attention of thb child welfare worker by the county commissioner of S County. The orphan girls were
                in the home of a paternal uncle where board was being paid by an older brother, Henry. He was 20 -. and was in a CCC Gamp. ..-, '"\ i
                The complaint, substantiated by the county attorney, sheriff, and others, i was that the girls were overworked and did not receive
                proper care and 175 </seg>
            <seg id="p188">treatment at the hands of their uncle and aunt. A neighbor lady reported the girls were made to eat in the kitchen by
                t/icmsc/ves and were not pro - vided with adequate food. After further investigation and conference with county officials, it was
                arranged to place the two girls in a hoarding home in the neighbor - ing county, B. The officials and assistance offices of both S.
                and B. counties cooperated in making the plan. The brother, Henry, continued to pay two-thirds of the hoard and S. County assumed the
                balance. The hoarding home selected was in a town of 9,0110 population with adequate school, recreational, and cultural facilities.
                The reason a boarding home was selected rather than an adoptive home was that the only brother. Henry, and an older sister. aj&gt;e
                i.i, retained a great interest in the girl." and objected strenuously U&gt; a placement for adoption or in an institution. Their
                interest and linanci.il support continued and the family tie wa.s conserved. When the girls entered the boarding home they were
                undernourished and in poor health. They both needed their tonsils removed and showed signs of physical abuse. The younger girl was a
                chronic bed-wetter. The older was retarded in school due to irregular attendance In their new home they develop into happy,
                attractive, well-mannered, carefree youngsters. displaying better than average intelligence. 176 </seg>
