            <seg id="p003">Soil Management Experiments with Vegetables H. O. WERNER Department of Horticulture When one considers all the farm gardens, the city back - yard and vacant-lot gardens, and the commercial truck or market gardens, it is apparent that vegetable production is a large part of the agriculture of the state. Clean culti - vation has been the accepted cultural practice m gardens for many years. Recent experiments, followed by tests elsewhere with some vegetable crops, have shown that clean cultivation, especially if deep and frequent, commonly results m lowered yields. Work done at this experiment station about 30 years ago showed that straw mulching was frequently a good practice with vegetables. And while it has been known that irrigation increases yields, little information is available on the amount needed jand the effect upon the quality of vegetables. Hence it seemed advisable to determine the value of various cultural methods with and without irrigation. The experiments reported m this bulletin include com - parisons of ordinary cultivation, scraping, and straw I and paper mulching, all with and without overhead irrigation. Vegetables of various types — leafy, fruit, and root parts — were used m nearly all plats each year. The crops were harvested according to good horticultural practice (and notes concerning yield and quality were secured. Soil mois - ture and soil nitrate determinations were made at intervals and soil temperatures were recorded by periodic readings of thermometers or by soil thermographs which kept a I con - tinuous record. For the convenience of the reader the data secured are summarized, and many details have conse - quently been omitted. Throughout the discussion are a number of tables showing yield comparisons based on the actual yields, and other data are reported m Tables I to; VII, m the back of the bulletin. Some of the tests were j con - ducted during each year from 1924 to 1932 but most of them were m the seasons from 1926 to 1930. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS ■ I • Soil. — The soil used was a dark heavy silt loam. It is quite similar m consistency m the surface to the soils avail - ablefor garden purposes throughout the loess-covered and glacial areas of eastern Nebraska. It is not ideal for gardens, for it puddles easily when wet and may become hard and badly cracked when dry. These features inter- </seg>

During the period of the experiment and for some years before, well-rotted manure was applied at the rate of 12 to 20 tons per acre every two or three years. This kept the soil in about as good physical condition as its characteris - tics permitted, while at the same time increasing the fer - tility. Soil Moisture and Soil Nitrates. — Since soil moisture is known to be a limiting factor in vegetable production, soil moisture^ samples were taken in the various plats at inter - vals during the growing season. Average percentages of soil moisture in the top foot of soil during the several seas - ons are reported in Table VI (page 42). The amount of nitrogen in the soil, available in a form that a plant can absorb and utilize, is a fair index of the productive capacity of the soil. Por this reason the amount of nitrates was also determined at intervals. 1 These nitrates result from the breaking down of more complex compounds by bacteria. They are lost from the soil through absorption by bacteria or by growing plants. Large amounts of nitrates are necessary for producing succulent vine growth and for the proper development of fruits and roots. As a general rule the nitrates increased as the soil warmed up, reaching the highest point about mid-June, after which they de - creased until September. Part of this decrease was due to removal by growing crops. Weather Conditions. — The weather during the experi - ments was typical of any period of the same number of years (Table 1). This is partly illustrated by the distribu - tion of_ the drouth periods during the various seasons as shown in Figure 4 and discussed more fully on pages 23 to 25. The weather conditions during the individual years varied greatly and are, briefly stated, as follows: In 1926 there was an early period of hot, rainless weather from May 10 to June 10 and another during late July and early August, when more than half of the total irrigation water was applied. During the remainder of the season rainfall was adequate and well distributed. In 1927 unseasonably cool weather from mid-July to early September was followed by extraordinarily hot weather during the first two weeks of September. Periods of drouth occurred prior to early June and during the early part of July. 1 Nltratedeterminatlons were made under the supervision of Prof. J. C Russel. of tne Department of Agronomy. </seg>

A prolonged and severe drouth during this interval necessitated the use I ■ </seg>

Cultural Practices. — Cultivation was done by means of small hand garden cultivators equipped with shovels working at depths of not more than three or four inches. In scraped plate the weeds were kept down, the cracks were kept closed as well as possible, and the surface soil loose for a depth of about one-half inch or less by occasional shallow cultivation with blades or with a sharp hoe. Straw mulching was done with clean wheat straw from the crop of the previous year applied as a mulch two to four inches deep when settled. This mulch was applied during the latter part of April or early May — when potatoes were about to come through the soil and when cabbage plants were well established but before tomatoes and other warm-season crops had been transplanted. The straw mulch was removed from the land as completely as possible at the end of the season. During three seasons, 1926, 1927, and 1928, straw two years old or older was applied in a supplementary test. This was discontinued because the results were essentially the same as from the other straw plats. Paper mulching -was done with black unperf orated paper impregnated with waterproof preservative material and manufactured especially for mulching purposes. Under the windy conditions prevailing the only satisfactory method of holding the paper in place was by means of lath laid along each edge and occasionally across the strip of paper. These laths were held in place by long wire staples. Burying the edge of the paper often caused the paper to rot and tear or pull loose as it shrank after getting wet. Wire staples through the paper were unsatisfactory because after the inevitable whip - ping in the wind the paper tore along the wires. The paper mulch was applied just prior to the transplant - ing of the several crops. With such crops the plants were set through holes cut in the paper. With hilled crops such as Lima beans and corn the seeds were planted through holes. Where the seed was sown in the field, the paper was placed between the rows at right angles to the slope of the soil so that water running off the one strip of paper would soak into the soil between two adjacent strips. Paper was laid so as to cover all the soil, except in one supplementary test in 1930 when only half of the soil was covered. The same paper could be used only one year. Nitrate of soda was applied in the rows of some plats at the rate of 600 pounds per acre. For the early crops — potatoes, </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Soil Management Experiments with Vegetables cabbage, cauliflower — it was applied in early April; for the other crops, just before they were transplanted in May. Irrigation was by the overhead or sprinkler method and as frequently as appeared necessary to maintain vigorous growth. It was sometimes used during May to hasten keed germination. The heaviest irrigation period was from July 1 to August 15, when high temperatures and the large size of the plants caused maximum water requirements. During the first years of the experiment more water was used than was necessary, much of it having been wasted by too-frequent light irrigations. During the later years from one-half to one inch of water was applied at one time and this was generally adequate for a week or ten days. The amount of water applied is reported in Table 1. Crops and plats. — -The crops and varieties used in different years were: Potatoes: Egrly Ohio and Irish Cobbler Cauliflower : Burpee's Best Early and Early Erfurt Cabbage: Copenhagen Market and Golden Acre Onions: Yellow Danvers and Yellow Bermuda Beans: Saddleback Wax Lima beans: Fordhook Egg plant : Black Beauty Sweet potatoes: Nancy Hall and Yellow Jersey Tomatoes: Earlianna jemd Marglobe Sweet corn: Golden Bantam Muskmelon: Pollock 10-25. Asparagus: Mary Washington Some small-scale one-year tests were made with head lettuce, carrots, beets, and spinach. The first four vegetables listed above were planted or set out early in April, the others in late May or early June. The plantings were made in jplats which varied in size and shape from year to year. The same piece of land was used for each treatment during the) first three years but with the various crops in a different portion of each plat each year. In 1929 and 1930 new pieces of land were used. The number of plants varied according to the vegetable but was always sufficient to give reliable Idata. During the last three years all of the plats were duplicated. All results were calculated and are reported on the basis of either 100 feet of row (as with beans) or 100 plants (as with tomatoes and eggplants). COMPARISON OF VARIOUS CULTURAL METHODS Clean cultivation has long been considered the standard culture for vegetable gardens and is used therefore as a basis for calculating the relative value of other cultural treatments. Table I (page 36) gives the actual yield of the varying! vege- </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 278 tables under the several cultural conditions in pounds per 100 plants or per 100 feet of row. In Tables 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14, yields are calculated with 1.00 as the yield of certain plats, mentioned in the table headings. Data on time of production, quality, etc., are presented in Tables II to IV. Comparison of Scraping with Clean Cultivation. — The commonly accepted reasons for regarding clean cultivation as a standard culture are: weed eradication, moisture conserva - tion, and the promotion of aeration and bacterial activities connected with increasing the availability of plant food. Agronomists in various states have collected considerable in - formation showing that with field crops, especially corn, stirring the soil is not always necessary. These results and some secured with vegetable crops in New York 2 have shown that scraping the soil, so as to eliminate weeds, close up cracks, and leave a very shallow soil mulch (about V2 inch) is about as effective as cultivation in the conservation of mois - ture, the accumulation of nitrates, and the production of total yield of crops. Temperature. — Temperatures of scraped soils were not re - corded during the course of these experiments; however, Thompson found that scraping raised the soil temperature above that of clean-cultivated soil sometimes several degrees, but it lowered the air temperature an inch above the soil as much as 7 to 10 degrees. Soil moisture. — The top foot of soil in the scraped plats had a lower percentage of soil moisture than the cultivated plats in 22 determinations, a higher percentage with 19, and the same with 3. The soil moisture average for three seasons was practically the same with both treatments (Table VI) . SoU nitrates. — The nitrate content of . the top foot of scraped soils was less than in cultivated soils in 30 out of 46 samples. The greatest differences occurred in the irrigated soils and in the early part of the season (Table VII) . Total yields. — In these experiments at Lincoln, plant growth was altered very little but yields from the scraped plats were equal to or greater than those from the cultivated plate in 24 out of 35 teste without irrigation and 18 out of 35 with irri - gation (Table 2). The gains from scraping were also gen - erally much greater without than with irrigation. In un - irrigated plats the root pruning resulting from cultivation ■Thompson, H.

With irrigation, aeration of scraped soil often appeared inadequate. The greatest yield benefits from scraping occurred in order of magnitude with Lima beans, eggplants, sweet potatoes, early cabbage, Earlianna tomatoes, and potatoes. The effects on wax beans, Marglobe tomatoes, onions, and cauliflower were uncertain, while with muskmelons and peppers scraping seemed to be inferior. When scraping and irrigation were combined the greatest benefits were secured from sweet pota - toes, eggplants, and Lima beans. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 278 Early production. — With the Earlianna tomato, production was generally hastened by scraping, as shown by the higher production of prime tomatoes during the various mid-sum - mer half -month periods (Table III). The effect on the Mar - globe variety was less conclusive than on the Earlianna. Early bearing of eggplants, peppers, and Lima beans was also hastened. Quality. — Usually in years when scraping increased the yield it also improved the quality. This improvement was greater in the unirrigated than in the irrigated plats. The higher percentage of sunburned and rotting Earlianna toma - toes in the scraped plate was more than counterbalanced by the lower quantity of small rough fruits. Comparison of Straw Mulching with Clean Cultivation. — Mulches of straw, hay, or other litter are sometimes used in order to eliminate cultivation. Increased yields from straw mulching were secured at Lincoln by Emerson s during three years (one of which was 1902, with the heaviest recorded summer rainfall) in the case of cabbage, tomatoes, beans (snap), cucumbers, potatoes, and sweet potatoes, but no definite gains with transplanted onions, beets, salsify, carrots, parsnips, peas, and melons, and reduced yields with drilled onions, lettuce, and sweet corn. He also reported that very deep mulches decreased yields and that manure mulches acted about as did those of straw. In Missouri * increases by straw mulching amounted, in the case of tomatoes, to 13.5 per cent ; peppers, 10.9 per cent ; eggplants, 50 per cent ; and cucumbers, 301.3 per cent. In Iowa B straw mulching increased potato yields 39 per cent during a three-year yeriod, while in Ohio a distinct gains are reported. In Ohio on a light soil, during an eight-year period when vegetables in one plot were mulched with straw and each year the straw was plowed under, the average yield of sweet-corn was reduced 5.5 per cent, cabbage 17.1 per cent and tomatoes 14.1 per cent. 7 Temperature. — Straw mulching reduced the average soil temperature and decreased the daily range in temperature. Straw-mulched soils were much cooler than cultivated soils in the day time and early evening, but sometimes warmer at night and early in the morning. During several seasons the ■Emerson, R.

Straw mulching, by acting as a blanket, prevents the loss of heat trom the soil at night; consequently the night air temperature at a height of one foot was found to be 2 to 4 degrees lower than above cultivated soil. In the day time this blanket of straw reflects the heat, and the air temperature then is from i to 7 or more degrees higher. As a consequence of these lower night temperatures, frosts occur later in the spring and earlier in the fall and are more severe in straw-mulched than in cultivated plats.

During the four years (1926-1929) the average moisture content of the top foot of soil was 23.7 per cent in the straw mulched and 20.7 per cent in the cultivated plate when not irrigated, compared with 27.4 per cent and 24.1 per cent respectively when irri - gated. Straw-mulched soil not irrigated contained more moisture than the irrigated, cultivated soil in 16 out of 27 tests. The nitrate content of the straw-mulched plate was lower than that under any other treatment, and especially low in the irrigated plate (Table VII). In 1926 there was no appre - ciable difference between the nitrate content of plats where old straw was used in comparison with new. The addition of nitrate of soda to straw-mulched plate generally increased the nitrate content in the early part of the season above that of the comparable cultivated plat. The nitrate content of the straw-mulched plats is probably lower because of the reduced soil temperature 8 and the lack of aeration. 10 Such uniform temperature and moisture con - tent have been found to be less stimulating to activity of nitrate-fixing bacteria than have such fluctuating conditions as occur in clean-cultivated soils. 11 Plant growth. — Straw mulching retarded the early growth of all vegetables, probably because of lower soil temperature and nitrate content. The top growth remained smaller throughout almost the entire season (see cover) . The leaves of straw-mulched vegetables were decidedly lighter in color except in the warmest portion of the year or in such hot seas - ons as 1930. The color differences were greatest in cold or rainy periods, in the irrigated plate, and in the early part of the season. Growth of early cabbage and cauliflower was very definitely retarded. Plants of these vegetables and of early potatoes were seriously damaged in cool periods of weather and were even killed to the ground when plants in cultivated plate only a few feet away suffered no frost damage at all. Application of nitrate of soda improved the color and size of straw-mulched plants and in 1929 materially in - creased their frost resistance. The effect upon root growth is discussed on pages 30 and 32. * Russel, J. C, Jones, E. G., and Bahrt, G. M„ The temperature and moisture fac - tors in nitrate production.

            <seg id="p014">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 278 muskmelons, peppers, wax beans, Marglobe tomatoes, egg - plants, sweet potatoes, and Lima beans. The increase with these crops was probably due to the more adequate supply of soil moisture in straw-mulched plate (Table Vl). However, mulching was a detriment to sweet corn, possibly because of inadequate nitrates. The potato crop is the only one of the cool-season crops that showed a consistent increase. Cabbage and onion yields were apparently affected but little, while that of cauliflower was generally decreased. The straw-mulching was most effective under irrigation with tomatoes, eggplants, sweet potatoes, muskmelons, peppers, and wax beans, questionable with potatoes and onions, and detrimental with Lima beans, cab - bage, and cauliflower. The lower yields from straw-mulching early, short-season crops are probably due to reduced growth as a result of lower temperature and lower nitrate content of the soil at a season when they are limiting factors and when moisture conserva - tion is of less consequence. In 1926, when straw mulching increased yields of cabbage, the weather was hot and dry during most of May and up to June 10. In 1929 and 1930 when straw-mulch yields were low with cabbage and cauli - flower, the May and June rainfall was very high and tem - peratures were relatively low. Early production on straw-mulched plats was commonly less than under cultivation, although by the middle of the production season this handicap had been overcome and the straw-mulched plat yields continued to be higher throughout the remainder of the season. The addition of irrigation de - layed straw-mulch production still more. Quality was improved by straw mulching more than by any other method. It increased the percentage of primes of various vegetables from 4 to 16 per cent during the several years. Straw-mulching increased the percentage of primes most in the irrigated plats and generally more in the early than in the latter part of each season. The improved quality of tomatoes was due to a decrease in the percentage of sm'all, rotting, or rough tomatoes. As a result of the reduced foliage growth with straw-mulching the percentage of sunburned tomatoes increased. Because of this difference in quality the yield ratios of the straw-mulched to cultivated plats was very much greater when based on yield of primes than on the basis of total yields. (See Appendix for data.) The size of the prime Earlianna tomatoes was increased by straw mulching, except sometimes very early in the seas - on.

These differences were due io the development not only of larger but also of thicker roots with straw mulching. In the long, warm season of 1930 this latter difference was especially pronounced in the case of the dry - land straw-mulched sweet potatoes (Fig. 2) . Some very desirable heads of lettuce were produced in straw-mulched blocks in 1931 (very hot, dry season), when cultivated plate produced but few heads and those of inferior grade. Mulching asparagus. — Mulches of straw and also of well - rotted manure were applied to replicated areas in a field of Mary Washington asparagus. This field was planted in the spring of 1927 and all parts received the same cultural treat - ment prior to the application of the mulches. These mulches remained on the ground continuously and were renewed each year as needed. Both mulches caused a decrease in thfe yield of asparagus, when compared with the yield of the culti - vated areas (Table 7) .

The yields of these plats increased, in pro - portion to the cultivated plat, as the season advanced. The final total yield in the manure plat averaged about 180 per cent and that in the straw-mulched plat about 70 per cent of the cultivated-plat mean. Possibly with a still longer cutting season the yields from the mulched plate would have equaled those in the cultivated. However, such prolonged cutting might have reduced the top growth during the sum - mer and fall, thereby possibly reducing the food stored in the roots and, by thus weakening the plants, causing a decrease in the next crop. From these plats, mulching asparagus and possibly other perennial vegetables appears to be undesirable. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 278 The low yields of asparagus in the mulched plats was prob - ably due to the shortage of nitrates. In the manure mulch there was a higher percentage of nitrogen in more available form than in the straw mulch and some of this nitrogen was washed into the soil by rains. This, together with the prob - ably slightly higher temperature (due to the darker color of the manure mulch), which favors nitrification and other growth processes, probably accounts for the slightly better yields of the manure-mulched plats. Comparison of Paper Mulching 'with Clean Cultivation. — Paper mulching as a method of growing vegetables came into prominence a few years ago as a result of the very success - ful use of mulch papers in growing pineapples in Hawaii, where weed control has been a very serious problem. Numer - ous tests have been made but only a few are mentioned here. In tests conducted close to Washington, D. C, significant gains were secured from sweet potatoes, tomatoes, green beans, carrots, beets, cucumbers, sweet corn, and early pota - toes. 12 In Ohio, tomatoes and beans were the only crops benefited in a cold, wet season, whereas in a hot, dry season the yields of all crops tested, except tomatoes, were increas - ed. 13 In New York, hot-weather plants such as tomatoes, peppers, and muskmelons were benefited, but results with cabbage, beets, and beans were inconclusive. At Ottawa, Canada, decidedly increased yields were secured with snap - beans, carrots, celery, sweet corn, cucumbers, tomatoes, and peppers, whereas no significant gains occurred with beets and muskmelons, and decreased yields with cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce. 14 Temperature. — On several bright, sunny days in 1932, at 7 A. M. the air temperature over a straw mulch was higher than over a paper mulch, but at 2 P. M. the air over the paper mulch was the warmer. In each case the air oyer the culti - vated soil registered an intermediate temperature. 7 During 16 days in June and July, 1930, the temperature of the unshaded soil under a paper mulch averaged 2 degrees F. higher than cultivated and 10 degrees higher than soil under a straw mulch, without irrigation. With irrigation the paper - mulched soil was 1.8 and 8.3 degrees warmer than the culti - vated and straw-mulched soils respectively. The average daily range of temperature during a period in June, 1930, was 3.21 degrees for the paper* mulched, 1.40 degrees for the straw-mulched, and 3.57 degrees for the cultivated soils.

These results were verified by some additional determinations in 1930. The moisture content of the paper-mulched soil was consistently lower than of the straw-mulched soil, averaging 2.2 per cent lower both with and without irrigation. Soil nitrqtes were consistently higher in paper-mulched plats in 1929 than in the straw-mulched plats, but in most cases, especially in midsummer, they were lower than in the cultivated plate. n^ssa^a^^^^^^^^^^^^^—^^— Plant growth. — VmU^AssZAZi-Af^'A::^^ 7' -?:\_L JfeS'-J P a P er mulching has- A^^^^lAAAtZZ'A^^^' -.

Early production was decidedly stimulated by paper mulch - ing. Production was frequently less from the paper plats during the middle of the season but sometimes again slightly higher during the last few weeks of the season, for example, with tomatoes. This was especially the case with eggplants, peppers, sweet corn, Lima beans, and muskmelons. Quality. — Paper mulching increased the percentage of primes with sweet potatoes and onions and sometimes with tomatoes. With sweet potatoes the greatest quality improve - ment occurred in the unirrigated plate. With tomatoes, paper mulching increased the percentage of primes hv the irri - gated plate by decreasing the production of small and rotten </seg>
            <seg id="p021">Soil Management Experiments with Vegetables i fruits. Paper mulching, however, decreased the percentage of primes in 3 out of 5 unirrigated tests. These unfavorable results with paper were due principally to an increase in the percentage of rough and rotten fruits with the Earlianna and to small fruits with the Marglobe tomatoes. The size of the tomateea was generally increased by paper mulching, especially early in the season. With the Marglobe variety grown with irrigation, paper mulching generally decreased the size of the fruit.

            <seg id="p023">Son, Management Experiments with Vegetables all of these vegetables (except eggplant when not irrigated) the bi-weekly production was soon very much greater from the straw-mulched plats. Vegetables of better quality were always produced by straw mulching except in the case of unirrigated sweet potatoes when those grown with paper mulching produced the highest percentage of primes. More tomatoes rotted in the paper - mulched than in the straw-mulched plats. Sun-scald I was more serious in the straw-mulched than in the paper-mulched plats of the Earlianna variety, while with the Marglobe this order was reversed. Throughout all of every season the per - centage of prime tomatoes was almost invariably greater (from the straw than from the paper plats. Paper-mulched tomato fruits generally were smaller than those from straw-mulched plats. Head-lettuce plants grown in 1931 in the paper - mulched plate were very large, but no heads of any value! 1 were produced, whereas in the straw-mulched plats a number of very desirable heads were developed on relatively small plants. Unless the vegetables are worth a great deal or production is hastened, most gains reported would not pay the high additional cost of the paper and the labor of laying it. With straw mulching most of the advantages from the use of paper mulching, except extreme earliness, can be secured and gen - erally at much less or even no actual cost. Comparison of Irrigation with No Irrigation. — Practically all vegetables contain a high- percentage of water, I most of them over 85 per cent and some more than 90 per cent. High yields and also high quality are dependent upon a supply of soil moisture adequate for proper development at the opti - mum rate. Even though many vegetables can survive I fairly prolonged drouth periods, they are liable to do so at the ex - pense of quality or yield, or both. The total recorded rainfall is not a reliable index of the moisture available for growth. The distribution of the rain - fall and the amount at any one time are vital factors. Light rains of less than a half inch are of value in reducing the temperature and increasing humidity, thus reducing evapora - tion and transpiration losses, but seldom do -they add moisture sufficiently for absorption by the roots. "Effective rajinfall" is thus most important. In this bulletin an "effective rain - fall" for vegetables is assumed to be not less than ohe-half inch falling in one day or two consecutive days. Throughout the five years of these tests a rainfall or irri - gation of 0.5 to 0.7 inch was found sufficient to maintain vigorous growth and prevent wilting in vegetables for seven days when the temperature was around 70 to 80° F. </seg>

            <seg id="p025">Soil Management Experiments with Vegetables when an average drop of 14 degrees was recorded. As many vegetables, especially long season ones, are at their maximum size and also fruiting during July and August, they require more water than at other times and the supply of moisture available or, conversely, the occurrence of drouth periods is important. "Drouth periods," considered as periods of more than 10 consecutive days during which the "effective rainfall" | was less than half an inch, have occurred 171 times for a total of 2,202 days during the 43 years of the weather records at Lincoln (Fig. 4). In other words, one-third of the total days between May 1 and September 30 were drouth days for vege - table production. These periods averaged 12.9 days and varied from 1 to 63 days as shown in Table 11. Each year of the 43 had at least two or more of these drouth periods. In five seasons only two occurred, while in ten seasons there were three, in twelve four, in thirteen five, and in three six drouth periods. The number of drouth days in a season gen - erally decreased as the "effective rainfall" increased.

The more frequent occurrence of these drouth periods, higher temperature and greater size of plant growth suggest that irrigation may become extremely valuable in July and August. These weather data indicate . that irrigation facilities are almost always needed during July and August and sometimes can be used advantageously earlier in the season. In some seasons many of the crops will be complete failures without irrigation.

            <seg id="p028">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 278 Quality. — The market quality of vegetables was decidedly better from the irrigated plate. The gain from irrigation in percentage of primes was greater with straw mulch than with any of the other cultural treatments. Consequently the high - est percentages of primes of all vegetables were produced in the irrigated straw-mulched plate. With tomatoes, the increase in the percentage of primes in the irrigated plats wasjjrought about principally by the in - crease in the size of the fruits, for frequently the percentage of rote (especially in the cultivated plats) was increased by irrigation and in years when early blight was severe, as in 1927, sun-scald was most severe in the irrigated plats (Table IV). With each cultural treatment the average weight of the fruit was increased by irrigation throughout the entire harvesting season. As each fruiting season advanced the per - centage of primes declined but held up better in the irrigated than in the unirrigated plate. With sweet potatoes irrigation increased the size and gen - erally also the thickness of the roots. With Irish potatoes the percentage of primes was increased. Comparison of Irrigation and Clean Cultivation with Straw or Paper Mulching and No Irrigation. — The ques - tion now arises, since mulches increase yields, how do they compare as cultural treatments with irrigation and clean cultivation? With these mulches, and no irrigation, yields were about as high as with irrigation and cultivation in the case of onions, cauliflower, eggplants, and Marglobe tomatoes (Tables 13 and 14).

They appeared considerably less satisfactory with beans. In the case of nine vegetables used for two years the mulches without irrigation appeared on| the average to be at least 80 per cent as effective as irrigation without mulching. Thus if irrigation facilities are not avail - able, comparable gains may be secured by either paper or straw mulching, the latter being preferable because of the cost of the paper and the small difference in yield. APPLICATION OF NITRATE OF SODA Since straw mulching reduces the amount of nitrates in the soil, it was thought that adding nitrate of soda to straw - mulched plate might improve production still further. The nitrate content was of course rather high because of the large amount of manure frequently applied to these soils. Nitrate of soda at the rate of 600 pounds per acre increased the amount of nitrates in the soil during the spring appre - ciably, but during midsummer and later there was little in - crease. The yields were increased in exactly half of the fifty teste of the straw-mulched plate. Approximately the same i-atio was secured when nitrate of soda was used with the other cultural methods. The yield differences were generally small. The only crops that responded consistently to nitrate applica - tions were eggplants, Lima beans, cabbage, and cauliflower. Where soil fertility is maintained by frequent manuring,] sup - plementary nitrate applications do not seem warranted. Data on these experiments will be published later. </seg>

            <seg id="p031">Soil Management Experiments with Vegetables effect of cultural methods on root growth The type of root growth was very materially affected by the cultural methods. In 1930 root studies of tomatoes, egg - plants, and sweet potatoes grown in rows six feet apartfin irrigated plats with straw mulching, paper mulching, and cultivation were made. The purpose was to determine the general habit of growth, the location of the feeding roots, and the general extent of the root system. Trenches wlere dug during early September. The roots were excavated to a depth of 4 inches into the trench wall and their growth hahit in two directions was sketched. Most of the feeding roots of these vegetables were in the top two feet with very few poorly developed roots below the third foot. In the cultivated plat, the root systems of egg plants and tomatoes were rather poorly developed, having few main roots, few feeding roots, and rather limited development (Fig. 5). The roots had a decidedly downward growth habit. In the straw-mulohed blocks the main roots of dgg - plants were heavier and more numerous, and most of them were found in the top foot of soil with a decidedly lateral growth habit. Feeding roots were profusely developed, especially in the top six inches, many of them coming up to the soil surface. In the paper-mulched blocks the root system was more extensive in all directions than in either of the others. Some roots had a decidedly downward growth habit while others grew in a lateral direction in the top foot of soil, being attracted toward the surface to a slight extent just beyond the edge of the paper. The development of branch roots was intermediate in extent between that of the cultivated and straw-mulched plants. The roots of ■■ the tomato plants were less numerous and somewhat morei ex - tensive, but otherwise of about the same growth habits as those of eggplants shown in these sketches. In the case of sweet potatoes the root habit in the culti - vated plats was decidedly downward (Fig. 6), lateral inj the straw-mulched plats, and in the paper-mulched plats again most extensive and in both directions. Adventitious roots from the prostrate stems were most abundant in the cultivated plats and least in the paper-mulched plate, none occurring until the edge of the paper was reached. Feeding roots were again abundant in the straw-mulched plat. The yields from plants grown under these several cultural treatments were evidently more definitely in proportion to the size and general development of the root systems than to the leaf and stem development of the same plants. </seg>

            <seg id="p033">Soil Management Experiments with Vegetables practical conclusions In Nebraska most vegetable crops can be increased and improved by irrigation. Straw or paper mulches are also useful. Irrigation will be found desirable at some time jin practically every season and quite frequently in many seasons. Except for hastening seed germination in a dry spring, irri - gation is seldom needed before July and not after August. [It has been found to be very profitable with all vegetables but especially with those that are growing during these two months. Needless or excessive irrigation early in the life of the plant might cause the development of a shallow root system. However, vegetables should be kept growing steadily. Knobby, growth-cracked, hollow, rough-shaped, double, and otherwise undesirable vegetables are produced when growth is uneven, especially when a period of abundant moisture follows one of prolonged drouth. When vegetables are approaching edible maturity the quality, especially firmness, flavor, sugar content, and keeping quality, will be improved by irrigation water used sparingly. One inch of water, in one rain or from irrigation, should maintain vigorous growth of most vegetables for five to seven days during very hot weather and ten days to two weeks in cooler weather. With smaller applications much more fre - quent irrigations and a greater total amount of water iare necessary to maintain the same growth, and the final results are very likely to be less satisfactory. Heavy applications of two inches or more are also less desirable, because the soil will be poorly aerated for a time and the loss from rotting, blight, etc., will be increased. When applied during the night by the overhead or sprinkler system with pressure of about 35 pounds, one inch of water can be supplied to the soil for 25 to 30 feet on both sides of the irrigation line in about six hours. On a hot, windy day when evaporation is very great, eight hours might be | re - quired. Where water under pressure is available |the sprinkler system is best because it distributes the water evenly, does not pack the soil, can be used on sloping land without washing, and requires the least labor. With jone line of pipe the gardener can irrigate from six to ten times as much land as the line will irrigate in one position. [The line can be carried from place to place and then supported on posts or temporary supports, wherever it is to be used.j With furrow or ditch irrigation, if the soil is very sandy, a large head of water will need to be run in shallow, wide </seg>

            <seg id="p035">Soil Management Experiments with Vegetables "run off." Deep, cultivation destroys many roots, reduces the yield of most vegetables, and is unnecessary. Shallow sur - face cultivation is recommended for all vegetables, especially in unirrigated soils or in dry seasons. Mulching gardens with straw or other litter such as hay or manure is a practical way to increase yields and produce vegetables of the best quality. The benefits are greatest with long-season crops and in dry years. While the yields of nearly all vegetables have been increased by straw mulching, its use is not recommended with the early short-season crops such as radishes, leaf lettuce, peas, spinach, seeded onions, cauliflower, and early cabbage. Likewise its use with the root crops such as carrots, beets, and parsnips does not appear ad - vantageous and its use with transplanted onions is of doubtful value. The difficulties of applying the straw more than [off - set the advantage which most of these crops might gain. Straw mulching has been found desirable with all the long - season crops except sweet corn. As a means of increasing yields and quality, straw mulching is frequently almost as good as irrigation. Because of the lowering of the tempera - ture and the increased frost hazard, straw should not; be applied until the plants are well established. A mulch of two to four inches deep is adequate; a deeper mulch is unnecessary and undesirable. Between 10 an4 15 tons of straw are needed for mulching an acre of land^ or about one half ton for the average back-yard garden of 40 k 50 feet. The labor of applying the straw is largely balanced by the reduced labor in weed control. At the end of the season straw mulches should be removed or burned because of the unfavorable effect upon the soil when such a large amount of organic matter is plowed under. This is most serious With the unirrigated or sandy soils. Because of lower tempera - tures, straw mulching is not recommended for general use in western Nebraska. With potatoes the straw mulch should be applied just before the plants come through the soil. With other crops, such as tomatoes, eggplants, and other transplanted vegetables,! the mulch may be applied either before transplanting or after the plants are well established, preferably at the latter time. Paper mulching stimulates early development of most vegetables and generally increases yields appreciably when compared with cultivation, but less so when compared With straw mulching. As the quality was also inferior to that produced by straw mulching, the somewhat heavier early production is its principal advantage over straw. This 1 ad - vantage is hardly sufficient to warrant its use in a rejgion </seg>

The expense and labor of lay - ing paper are a decided disadvantage, especially when the garden is located in an exposed, windy area. The use of the same paper for more than one year was entirely out of the question, even when the heavier grades were used. Applications of nitrate of soda might be practical in stimu - lating growth of early spring crops and in improving the set of a few vegetables such as eggplants and peppers, but tbe gams from these experiments were too small to justify its recommendation on heavily manured, silty soils. Although it did increase the nitrate content of straw-mulched soils, yields were rarely increased. On lighter soils or when manure is not used frequently, applications of nitrogen might prove beneficial. </seg>
