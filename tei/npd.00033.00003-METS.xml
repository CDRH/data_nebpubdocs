The State Rail - way Commission has power to raise the rate if, after trial and hear - ing, it is found to be non-compensatory. Immediately upon the approval of this Act the Western Union 'elegraph Company applied for an injunction in the federal court gainst the enforcement of the reduced rate. The court refused to assume jurisdiction and referred the case to the State Railway Com - mission tor consideration as per the conditions of the law. The ompany then applied to the Commission for authority to increase ts telegraphic rates over and above the statutory provisions. The Commission is now making an exhaustive study of the effect upon he revenues of the company of the twenty-five cent rate, said rate laving gone into effect October 1, 1913, for a trial period of severa months. It will be determined later as to whethe* or not the rate will be permanent. (See Application No. 1792, Part II. Also see order of United States circuit court, denying temporary injunction Part IV.)

Enforcement of the Act is committed to the State Railway Commission. May 5th the Commission assigned to Mr. E. W. Reed, right f-way appraiser and statistician of its engineering department, th dded duties in connection with the administration of its "Blu Sky" department. His report in detail will be found in Part VII of this volume. (Also see Attorney General's opinions Nos. 48, 50 1, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, Part IV.)

Hurd resigned his position as chief of the department, ctive at the close of business November 30, and Mr. C. H. Gerber, merly first assistant, has been appointed to fill the vacancy, the initial work in connection with the appraisement of common riers has been, in the main, accomplished, the Commission has nd it expedient to materially reduce the force in its valution and ;ineering department, retaining only such help as is needed to p the work already performed strictly up-to-date and also to lertake such new tasks as pending cases may develop. CLASS RATE ADJUSTMENT I Early in the year the United States supreme court handed down opinion in the so-called Minnesota rate case. This opinion had effect of reversing the decision rendered by Judge Sanborn, uary 8, 1912. One of the main questions presented to the court in the Min - nesota case was the right of the state to make reasonable rates for the transportation of commodities moving wholly within state boundaries. This point was clearly settled in the court's opinion, and there can now be no question as to the right of the state to make reasonable rates for the transportation of intrastate shipments. I The Nebraska intrastate class rate investigation, which the mmission instituted on its own motion in 1909, has been pending ore this body, awaiting the supreme court opinion referred to &gt;ve. As soon as that opinion was rendered the Commission set vn dates for hearings. The Commission has at the present time hteen or twenty extra clerks working on the statistical data that i been accumulated by it for the purpose of determining what inges shall be made in the present Nebraska class rate adjustment, soon as the studies are completed that are now in progress of ■paration, the Commission will name a date for a final hearing, i thereafter render its findings and order at the earliest date CASES BEFORE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION tThe following is a list of cases which were filed with the Inter- Commerce Commission during the past year: A petition was filed, requesting the suspension of Trans-Con - tinental Freight Bureau Supplement No. 50 to Westbound Tariff </seg>

Later on a hearing was held in San Francisco in nis case, at which time the Nebraska Commission did not appear 'he Interstate Commerce Commission set the case down for argu ment before the whole Commission at Washington for December £ &gt;ut by reason of the illness of the attorney for the railroad com anies the hearing of oral argument was continued, and at the presen ime a definite date has not been fixed. It is the intention of th Nebraska Commission to appear before the Interstate Commerc Commission at Washington and present reasons why the advanc n the flour rates should not be made. A petition was filed, requesting the suspension of Rule No 805-B of Supplement No. 8 to Circular No. 1-J of Western Trunk iines (I. C. C. No. A-396), advancing the minimum weight on car oad shipments of flour from Nebraska points to other points in Western Trunk Line territory, including Illinois, Iowa and Wiscon in, from 30,000 pounds to 40,000 pounds. Through the efforts o ie Nebraska Commission, the carriers withdrew their tariffs whicl ndertook to increase the minimum weight on carload shipments o our from Nebraska and other western points to stations in Illinois owa and Wisconsin. By reason of this fact no hearing was had on bis protest. A petition was filed, requesting the suspension of Item No. 35 upplement No. 10 to Tropical Fruit Tariff No. 2, I. C. C.

This matter came on for hearing a Cansas City on October 20, 1913. The Nebraska Commission wu epresented and the witnesses of the carriers cross-examined. As a esult of the Kansas City hearing and the motion of the represen atives of the Nebraska Commission, the Interstate Commerce Com mission ordered a further hearing in regard to the terminal expenses which the carriers undertook to show were a part of the expense o andling the banana traffic from Galveston and New Orleans to Kansas and Nebraska points, the same being set for December 11 913. The Nebraska Commission will prepare a brief in support o s protest against the rate advances. </seg>

W Railroad Company Railway Company Hall, Commissionei: The formal complaint herein was filed on March 26, 1912, in which it is alleged that the depot facilities of the said respondents at the town of Plainview are inadequate to take care of the passenger and fieight traffic at that point, and the Commission is asked to issue an order directing said companies to erect and maintain a union station at the junction of their tracks. On May 21, 1912, a healing was held at Plainview, at which all parties were represented. ( Plainview is a village of over one thousand population, situated the junction point of the two roads named herein, in the north- Bt corner of Pierce County. The greater portion of the business cks are substantial buildings, built of brick and cement and ed with modem improvements, such as watei, electric lights and ler conveniences. The town has cement sidewalks and cement ssings, laid out in the most approved manner. It owns i*s own ter works, its own electric lighting plant, and has just completed a new high school building costing over $22,000.00, which is lighted, heated and fitted with modern conveniences, such as cloakrooms, sanitary closets and drinking fountains on each floor. The town in one that is thoroughly abreast with modem developments and is one of the most piogressive and up-to-date towns in the state. The North Western depot is inadequate to take care of the business that is handled therein. This is conceded by the company itself, which proposes to enlarge the same and remodel and re-fit it with certain modern improvements. The said depot is located about one block south of the real business center of the town at the foot of Main Street. The town is solidly built up fiom the depot to the center, with cement walks extending the entire distance to the right-of-way. It developed at the hearing, and from records on file with the Commission, that the receipts for all business, both in and out of the Chicago &amp; Noith Western, are about $80,000.00 per annum, which amount is about 75', of all the business trans - acted by both loads. The present location is much better than any other point on the tracks of the said company, but owing to the fact of its close proximity to the business center of the town, the building should be of a permanent stiucture and of such material that will reduce the fire hazard. The Commission is of the opinion that when a depot is located close into the business section, it should be as nearly as possible in keeping with the general improvements of the town. The town of Plainview is a transfer point between the roads </seg>

After seveial conferences the complainant herein filed a stipula ion asking that the application for a union station be withdrawn &gt;rovided that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company woulc mild a Drick depot upon its present 'ocation and furnish the same with all modern conveniences, such as watei, light, heat and sanitar; losets. The said Chicpgo &amp; North Western Railway Company lefendant herein, immediately filed full plans and specifications for he enlargement and remodeling of its depot at its present location which so far as size is concerned is ample to take caie of the pass nger and freight tiaffic. Said plans and specifications, however, do not provide for all modern conveniences that are prayed for by th complainant herein, ard while the Commission will not require th company to build an entire new structure, yet it is of the opinion hat in the remodeling and enlargement of its piesent depot i hou'd be put in a fiist-c'ass condition, and be provided with al uch conveniences above referred to. The floors cf the wai'ing loom and office shculd be ot hard wood; the building should be fumishe&lt; with watei, piped to it from the water mains of the city; sanitary closets should be put in, electric lights and a heating plant, eithe lot air, steam or hot water, installed. The Commission is furthe of the opinion that the building should be veneered with a Srst class quality of pressed or paving brick, and that a brick or cemen sidewalk should be laid, connected with the city's sidewalk am extending to the depot, and that the depot platform should be con structed of brick or cement.

C. Connely, et al., Complainants, vs. Union Pacific Railroad Company, De fendant ORDER Taylor, Commissioner Complaint in this case was filed April 12, 1912, piaying for an order requiring defendant, Union Pacific Railroad Company, to construct and maintain a depot and sidetrack on its Callaway Stapleton line at a point called Hoagland, located on the Northeast quaiter of the Northeast quarter cf Section 25, in Township 18 Range 27, and the Northwest quarter of the Northwest quarter o Section 30, Township 18, Range 26, in Logan County, Nebraska. Issues were duly joined and a hearing was held by the Commis - sion at the town of Gandy, in Logan County, on July 21, 1912 By stipu'ation of the parties hereto depositions were subsequently submitted and made a part of the evidence in this case. On January 21, 1913, a second hearing was held in the office of the Commission and further testimony received. The enteiing of an order was delayed pending the introduction of additional depositions, and i was not until March 28, 1913, that the case was finally submittec on stipulation of the parties. ■ Complainants set forth that the old town of Logan, which was ormcrly located at the point above described and which is now mown as Hoagland, is about midway between the town of Arnold, n Custer county, and the western terminus of the line in question, he latter point subsequently having been named Stapleton. The istance between Arnold and Stapleton is about sixteen miles. The vidence shows that previous tc the filing of this complaint, plain - iffs conducted extended negotiations with defendants in an effort o secure the location of a station at Hoagland and that the railroad ompany for a time seriously considered the selection of the Hoag- </seg>
            <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 103 Psite. Later, however, they decided lo locate a station on ion 34, Township 18, Range 26, which is about four and cne-hslf 3 east of Hoagland, and since have constructed a depot, sidings stockyards at that point. The evidence shows that Hoagland is situated at the forks o the South Loup river and thai it is the junction of the two main wagon loads leading to the sections north and south of the railroad The country south of the raihoad is rough and cut by a number o cany&lt; ns sc that it is necessary for those desiring to leach the rail road to make use of the south road just leierred to, which follow a canyon opening upon the valley at this point. Piactically all o the tenitory north of said line of railroad in the east part of Logan county is a grazing district and the ranches are so lccatrd tha Hoagland is the most accessible and convenient point for the loading and unloading of stock. James D. Haskell, general manager of the Milldale Livestock &amp; Improvement Company, testified that durin the months of August, September and October, 1912, that compan; shipped seventeen carloads of cattle to South Omaha from its rancl adjoining the townsite of Hoaglard; that during the same periot the ranch company sold ten carloads of cattle to other dealers making a total of twenty-seven carloads of cattle, that had to be driven from the ranch through Hoagland to Logan for loading into th cats of the railroad company. The testimony of Charles Philpot of the Philpot Ranch Company, which owns land both at Hoaglam and in the district north of that point, was also to the effect that i is necessary to drive the cattle of th?t company thiough the town of Hoagland in order to reach Logan. The company handles abou 1,200 head of cattle on the ranch fourteen miles north of Hoaglan and since the advent of the railroad Mr. Philpot has put chased 7,000 acre ranch adjoining the townsite of Hoagland, which he i converting into a feeding station and upon which he has alread constructed extensive improvements. According to the evidenc considerable hay will be marketed from the section, and because o its bulk it will be very inconvenient and difficult to transport i the longer distance to Logan. Walter V. Hoagland, attorney for complainants, states in a eposition that on May 6, 1912, subsequent to the location of th own of Logan, he had a conference with Edson Rich, attorney fo efendant, at which conference it was agreed that complainant would waive the construction of a depot at Hcagland, provide* efendant would construct a siding and switch facilities; that relyini pon the strength of this agreement affiant employed an enginee o survey the townsite of Hoagland and the same was surveyed hat as agent for the south half of the northwest quarter and the outhwest quarter of Section 30, Township 19, Range 26, in Logan ounty, Mr. Hoagland represented to Mr. Philpot that switch facil ties were to be established at Hoagland, and on the strength o bat lepresentation negotiated the sale of that land to Mr. Philpot </seg>
            <seg id="p104">104 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Mr. Rich, in a deposition, admits that such an agreement was en - tered into but asserts that the construction of the sidetrack was to be deferred until it could be shown that the volume of business at Hoagland would justify the facilities. While there appears to have been a misunderstanding as to the import of the agreement, the fact remains that a substantial business transaction was consummate! aa a result of it and many residents of that community adjusted their affairs in anticipation of its fulfillment, indicating that injustice will be done innocent paities if it is not carried out. The chief objection raised by defendant to the location of a station at Hoagland, aside fiom the claim that the establishment of station at Logan makes it unnecessary, is that the topography o lie country at the former place makes it an inconvenient and un - esirable location for a station from a railroad point of view, there eing a six 01 seven foot embankment and a curve at that point 'he evidence shows, however, that depots and yards at other points n the same road are located under very similar conditions, the tation at Arnold being located on ground equally unsatisfactory .t the latter place, too, the site was deliberately selected by the ompany, indicating that such obstacles at Hoagland are not neces - arily serious. In view of the above facts, the Commission is of the opinion nat the prayer of the complainants, in so far as it relates to a idetrack and loading facilities at Hoagland, should be granted 'he location and maintenance of a depot at Logan and the agree - ment of the complainants to waive the construction of a depot at [oagland prompts the Commission to dismiss that part of the com laint. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Rail way Commission that the Union Pacific Railroad Company be, and the same is, hereby notified and directed to construct and maintain suitable and adequate sidetrack and stockyards, loading and unload ing facilities at Hoagland, Nebraska, same to be completed not late than July 1, 1913, and that on or before that date it stop its train at Hoagland on flag for passengers. tIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that that portion of the com - aint relating to the construction and maintenance of a depot at oagland be, and the sam? is, hereby dismissed.

ORDER Taylor, Commissioner Gering is a town of about 800 population, situated in Scotts - bluff county, of which it is the county seat. At the time of the filing of this complaint it was the terminus of the new line of the Union Pacific from North Platte, Nebraska, to Medicine Bow, Wyoming, the construction having been completed to that point! </seg>
            <seg id="p108">108 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT » iering was established in 1887 and two years later was incorporatec as a village. At the time of its location it was platted into blocks, lots treets and alleys, there being sixteen blocks in the platted poition o le town. At the present time the main stieet of the town runs orth and south and is known as Lincoln Avenue, this street con ecting st the north line of the city limits with a public highway iat extends acioss the North Platte river to the town of Scotls luff, I ree miles distant. The same street also extends southward rom the corporation limits about one-half mile. The section line etween Sections 1 and 2 forms- the eastern limits of the plattec section of the village, or did at the time the village was established ince the coming of the railroad an addition has been platted eas f this section lire. The Union Pacific completed its line into Gering during the ear 1911. The depot was located at a point just beyond the ortheast corner of the original townsite, 229 feet east of the section ine above referred to and about 1,600 feet east of Lincoln avenue 'he switch yards extend eastward from the section line and the bee ump is located about one-fourth of a mile east of the depot. The •resent complaint is based on the contention that the railroac ompany did not give proper consideration to the needs and require ments of the town of Gering in the location of the depot and tha le station should have been placed farther westward at a poin ther on Lincoln avenue or 450 feet east of Lincoln avenue, which is contended, would have brought it closer to the business section r the town and made it more accessible to the majority of the atrons of the railroad. Subsequent to the filing of the complaint a petition of inter ention was filed by Henry M. Thornton, Commodore C. Hampton William Ingles, Rooney C. Campbell, Fred D. Wolt, and Gering -umber &amp; Grain Company, all citizens or property owners in the own of Gering, alleging that the depot and station facilities aie roperly located with reference to the needs of the community and urther alleging that its removal to the point named by complainants would cause intervenors great and irreparable loss and damage fo lie reason that, relying on the fact that the location of the depot was permanent, they had erected buildings and made other extensive mprovements near and adjacent to the depot. Intervenors further liege that complainants made no objection to the location of the epot after same was erected, and took no steps to secure its re - moval until the filing of the complaint. Hearings on the complaint were held in the district court room at Gering on May 2 and 3, 1913, at which time all parties were present and a large amount of evidence was received. It early developed that the controversy was largely between the complainants and the intervenors, the railroad company assuming a more or less neutral attitude. In other words, the case has assumed the aspect of a town row, which, in view of all the circumstances, </seg>
            <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 109 Jromises to be even more disastrous than such internal strifes usuall are. The construction of this line of railroad was a consummatio anxiously awaited and earnestly solicited by the citizens of Geiin and community for a period of over twenty-five years. The urgen need of it was the bond that united the citizens into a harmonious community in which all were loyally committed to the general we are. Its actual completion was the "apple of discord" that has ilunged the town into bitter contention and made it the playthin of warring factions, a situation all the more unfortunate because o he existence of a rival town, Scottsbluff, only three miles to th north. While Gering was awaiting the coming of the Union Pacifi he Burlington constructed a line on the north side of the rive rom Bridgeport, Nebraska, to Guernsey, Wyoming, the completio of this line contributing materially to the prosperity of Scottsblu: and rendering it all the more necessary for Gering to maintain united front in order to sustain her position as a commercial cente and to retain the county seat. With her great ambition as a town achieved, Gering has been robbed of the fullest realization of its &gt;enefits by the discord engendered by this controversy, and th development to which the town was entitled has been practicall; uspended pending the final determination of the issue. Regardless f where the depot is finally located, the town will suffer permanen njury from the factional strife. While selfish interests on the part of citizens of the town have &gt;een too great a factor in the location, the Union Pacific Railroac Company is to be condemned for underestimating the general demanc or another location and for pursuing a policy that was certain to ead to a continuance of the strife and dissension. More considera ion for the wishes of the people and less for the interests of one o wo individuals at the time the matter was up for settlement woulc &gt;robably have averted the present difficulties and resulted in a larmonious adjustment. Had the management exercised the proper iscretion at the right time it is doubtful whether the point woul&lt; ver have been reached when it was necessary for President Mohler o say: "I think the Commission should settle this depot question nd assume the responsibility incurred thereby." In view, therefore f the serious complications arising from this case, the Commission prompted to establish the rule that, where a railroad company ocates a depot and has full knowledge that said location is objec - onable to a large portion of the residents of the community or has ood reason to believe that said location will be fruitful of con - nued controversy, the Commission, if called upon to act, wil iroceed as though no such location existed and determine the loca - on as it would had no action been taken by the company. The question of the location of the depot at Gering was a sub - ject for discussion even before the road was constructed. Rumors that it was to be located east of the section line above referred to and outside of the platted townsite were confirmed when tentative </seg>
            <seg id="p110">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Ins prepared by the company were forwarded to Mr. Gardner, i of the complainants, in 1910. These plans located the depot a point 300 feet east of the section line. Previous to this time ither and far more important matter had been settled by the road company to the satisfaction of the people of Gering. During course of years three surveys had been made for the proposed &gt;. When it was finally determined to build the road it was decided secure as direct a line as possible from North Platte to Medicine w and with that object in view a line was surveyed running &gt;ut 1,500 feet north of the present route at Gering, thus avoiding curve which would have been necessary to bring the road up to he town. This would have thrown the railroad considerably closer o Scottsbluff and made necessary the removal of Gering to a point arther north. Upon the urgent solicitation of Messrs. Thornton nd Gardner and other citizens of Gering the plans of the company ere modified and the route deflected so that the road might serve ering at its present location, the route finally selected following ne of the lines that had been previously surveyed. Messrs. Thorn - on and Gardner owned the land north of Gering over which the oad was located and as a partial inducement for the change of oute they gave to the company the land necessary for the right - -way, Mr. Thornton conveying about twenty-four acres to the company for this purpose and Mr. Gardner twenty-seven acres. 'he land owned by Mr. Thornton lies east of the section line and lat of Mr. Gardner to the west. Both have substantial tracts at lis point, in addition to that given to the railroad. In July or August of 1911 President Mohler and Chief Engineer untley, of the Union Pacific, visited Gering for the purpose o aking a personal inspection of the proposed yards and conferring ith the people regarding the differences over the location of the epot. A consultation was held in the rooms of the First Nationa ank at which twelve or fifteen interested citizens were present 'he testimony with reference to what took place at this meetini aries in minor details but agrees with respect to the more importan oints. President Mohler, laboring at first under the impression tha le controversy was over the location of the line at Gering, explainec tat the company had already conceded all it could towards bringini te road up to the town, having been to an additional expenditure ' $35,000 by the change of plans, and that it would be impossible o bring the road any closer to Geiing. When assured by N. J uffman, one of the parties present, that it was not a matter o •ringing the line any closer to town but a matter of bringing the epot from the point tentatively selected to a point farther west [r. Mohler said: "Well, if that is it, that is another question," am nstructed Chief Engineer Huntley to get his maps, adding, "I wil &gt;ring that depot just as far west towards Lincoln Avenue as I can ntil I strike some engineering difficulties." Upon secuiing the maps Mr. Huntley informed Mr. Mohler that the tentative location </seg>
            <seg id="p111">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 111 f the depot was about 300 feet east of the section line and that it ould be moved to a point 300 feet west of the section line without ncountering engineering difficulties on account of the curve, although he location would not be as good from 9 railroad standpoint. Whereupon Mr. Mdhler turned to the crowd and asked: "Isn't hat a compromise; can't you get together on that?" Upon being ssured by various members of the party that if that was the best the ompany could do it would be more satisfactory to a large majority f the people than the tentative site, he adjourned the conference. The record shows that the people of Gering accepted the results f this conference as a fairly satisfactory adjustment of the con - roversy and that no further action was taken until the following 'ctober when a representative of the land department of the Union 'acific named Griffith visited Gering foi the purpose of selecting the xact site for the depot. He telegraphed to Thornton in advance o: us arrival and the latter met him at the station at Scottsbluff, the rain arriving late in the afternoon. He was taken across to Gerinf mmediately and went at once to the proposed railroad yards 'hornton and Gardner disagree as to whether the latter was notifiec f Griffith's coming, Thornton contending that he showed Griffith's elegram to Gardner and the latter claiming that the first intimation le had of further action on the part of the company at that time eing a telephone message from a friend in Scottsbluff, apprising him f Griffith's arrival. At any rate, the only persons present durini he conference with Griffith were Thornton, Gardner, Boyer am ohnson, the latter the resident engineer of the company. Griffith nformed them that he was there to locate the depot, the statements f witnesses Thornton, Gardner and Boyer agreeing that he said Gentlemen, I am here to locate this depot and it is up to you wo gentlemen (Thornton and Gardner) to say where you want it.' According to Gardner, Griffith remarked when the suggestion wm made that the people of the town be asked to come down to assia n the selection of the location, that he hadn't come out to see th &gt;eople, he had come to see Messrs. Thornton and Gardner. Thorn on confirmed this statement, testifying (p. 193' of the Record) as ollows: " Mr. Griffith said that he had come here to settle this depot proposition, to finally locate that depot. He said that it was an impossibility to please the people because it was an impossibility to place that depot on the curve and it was simply a matter of settling it satisfactorily between Gardner's interests and my interests, and the railroad's interests. • • • • Then the thing was right up between Gardner and me. I wanted it on my side of the section line and he wanted it on his side." From this point on the witnesses disagree as to what took place Thornton testifying that Griffith finally selected a site about 300 fe«t east of the section line and that Gardner agreed to the location. The testimony at this point is as follows, Mr. Gardner being the witness, (P. 143-144): </seg>

I said, 'I wouldn't say that I would be mad. believe the railroad company is trying to do the right thing am wants to do the right thing and perhaps Mr. Thornton and could agree on it, but' I says, 'I have got my people up tow to reckon with yet, and they would not be satisfied.' And the we walked down over the section line. I do not remember tha he said anything more than that he would go back to Omah and make his report. I never heard any further report from him. Mr. Thornton took him in his car and took him ove to Scottsbluff again where he got him. He never came u town that time at all. "Q. — Did you consent or agree that the depot station should be located down east there? "A. — No, sir, only the words that I have told here. It is what I said at the time. I wasn't agreeing, nor couldn't agree for the people up town." While at one time early in the history of the case it is possibl that Mr. Gardner may have considered the possibility of moving th business section of the town down to the railroad, provided it couh be done on a basis of protection to existing business interests, i ia apparent from the record that eventually he cast his lot unre eervedly with those who desired the depot moved westward, am for that reason credence is given to his denial that he ever consentec to the location of the depot east of the section line. Further suppor of this assumption is afforded by a letter he addressed to Presiden Mohler on January 1, 1912, which was about the time actual con struction of the depot began, in which he appealed for a reconsidera tion of the question, and offered to execute a deed of trust to th company for his land adjacent to the right-of-way as a guarantee that the expense of the change would be borne by the citizens o the town and as a further guarantee that he would not attempt to </seg>

President Mohler refused o reconsider the matter and in his answer threatened to change le line back to the more direct route 1,500 feet north if the wran - ing was not stopped. Gardner's denial and his offer is important n that it shows that he, as one of the leaders of the "old town" action, never acquiesced in the location of the depot at its present te and never abandoned his efforts to have the location changed n connection with the visit of Griffith it is important to note that o reference was made by him to the tentative agreement arrivec t .at the Mohler conference, nor is any explanation presented by the ompany for disregarding this compromise of the controversy. The easons given by the company for choosing the site east of the section line were that it met local requirements and afforded an rrangement of yards and facilities that allowed of economics peration, at the same time avoiding the inconvenience and danger f having the section line road crossing the middle of the yards 'here was also objection to placing the depot on the curve. It was dmitted by Chief Engineer Huntley, however, that the location ear Lincoln Avenue would involve no serious engineering difficulties or would the location at this point seriously affect the station acilities. It is clear, therefore, that the location was determined, not so much by the engineering necessities or its accessibility to the town as by an attempted adjustment of the demands of the two individ uals. The Commission is driven to the conclusion that more though was given to the claims of two men who had given land to the com &gt;any than to the needs of the general public. The record is con vincing on the point that there was an overwhelming majority o he people opposed to the location selected. It seems equally clea hat this sentiment was either ignored by the officials of the roa&lt; or was underestimated and that action was taken in spite of it The distance involved between the location chosen and the one asked or by the people of the old town is not great but it is sufficient t determine the difference between the right site and the wrong one The location close to Lincoln Avenue had enough advantages, a east, to have warranted the company in giving it very careful con sideration. Lincoln Avenue is the main artery of travel between Gerin and Scottsbluff, this being the only river crossing for a number o miles either east or west. Consequently the flow of public traff would be past the location asked for. Being the main street of th town, a location on or very near it would be more accessible to th business section than any other point that could be selected. Th record shows that the point 450 feet east of Lincoln Avenue approximately 900 feet closer to the center of the business sectio than is the present depot, although a portion of this saving in di </seg>
            <seg id="p114">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Eice » effected by the offer of O. W. Gardner to open a diagonal set through his land from the northwest corner of Block 10 in idner's Addition, to the proposed site. Turning square corners, i distance saved would be about 600 or 700 feet. A location directly on Lincoln Avenue where the railroad crosses the public highway would be slightly farther away from the business portion of town and such a location is objected to by defendant on the ground that it is not conducive to safety nor to facility of operation. Trains standing at the depot would block the crossing and cause much inconvenience. While the farmers are not directly interested in the location of le depot they are concerned with the location of the beet dump, hich is now about a quarter of a mile east of the depot. Accoid - ng to the record, most of the sugar beets delivered at the Gering ump are hauled over the section line heretofore referred to. The •resent location of the dump necessitates an extra haul of one-half mile for the round trip over what it would be were the dump moved o a point about where the depot is now situated. If the depot ere moved towards Lincoln Avenue the dump could be moved est to the section line. Distance is an important factor in the ransportation of beets from the farms, as they are heavy and from our to six tons are hauled at a load. In the opinion of the Commission, the considerations just cited ere of sufficient importance to have determined the choice of the Lincoln Avenue site, but equal to them and perhaps paramount in mportance was the general welfare of the town. It appears inconsist - nt for the company to expend $35,000 in diverting its route so as make it unnecessary for Gering to move and then locate its depot o far away that it became almost certain that the town, or a por - on of it, would move. It was manifest on the one hand that Mr. 'hornton proposed to start a business section near the new depot nd on the other hand that his efforts in this direction would be tterly resisted by a majority of the business men and residents. 'his afforded the basis for a controveisy that was certain to injure le town, and it was a factor that the railroad company should have eriously weighed before acting. To leave the depot at its present ocation is but to continue the dissension. I It is urged on behalf of intervenors that they have made an vestment of over $25,000 near the present depot and that if the ation is move'd this investment will be rendered worthless. We il to find anything in the record, however, to justify their con - ntion that the complainants are estopped because they made no tjection to the location and took no steps to secure the removal the depot until after it was erected. On the contrary there is nple evidence to show that complainants resisted from the very ■st the selection of the present site. This opposition was known to tervenors and they must have taken it into consideration when iey erected their buildings and established themselves in business </seg>
            <seg id="p115">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 115 at that point. It is indeed unfortunate that this investment must &gt;e jeopardized by a decision lemoving the depot, but as was stated n the rule laid down above, the Commission must proceed as hough no location had been made and determine the question in the light of the greatest good to the whole community. Intervenors made Uaeir investment at their own risk. It is not for the Com - mission to say whether they exercised prudence and good business udgment. If they did not they can hardly claim protection at the expense of the general public. Subsequent to the hearing, defendant filed with the Commission wo estimates covering the expense of removal of the depot. One pplies to the location about 300 feet west of the present site am he other to the location more specifically asked for by complainants which is 450 feet east of Lincoln Avenue. The expense of remova o the first location is estimated at $3,772.00, while the expense in he other case is estimated at $5,552.00. The removal to the site 00 feet west of the present location could be accomplished witl &gt;ractically no rearrangement of the tracks and switchyards, but the emoval to the other point will require a complete rearrangement o hese facilities and the construction of a small section of new track t is clear to the Commission, however, that a removal to a poin ust west of the section line would not meet the requirements of the ituation nor would it remedy the disadvantages of the presen ocation. The advantages of the Lincoln Avenue site have been previously discussed and peed no further comment. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the defendant herein be and the same hereby is, notified and directed to remove its depo at Gering, Nebraska, now located on its right-of-way at a poin approximately 300 feet east of the line between Sections 1 and 2 Township 21, North, Range 55, West, to a point on said right-of way 450 feet east of the center of the public highway extendin between Gering and Scottsbluff, the said highway being a continua tion of Lincoln Avenue, as defined in the plat of the city of Gering and it is further ordered that it shall make such rearrangement am reconstruction of its tracks, switches, spurs and other facilities a shall conform with the requirements of such new location.

Eaton, Complainant, vs. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co., et al., Defendants Hall, Commissioner: The Commission sat in its office at 11 o'clock a. m., on January 20, 1913, pursuant to notices having duly been given to all the defendants, and they being present at said hearing for the purpose of hearing said complaint. The complainant is a manufacturer of galvanized iron and stee tanks, watering and feed troughs, and other sheet metal products It is located in Omaha, Nebraska, and is doing business under the name of the Nebraska &amp; Iowa Steel Tank Company. The defendants herein include all railroads in Nebraska. The complainant complains of the defendants in that they harge, collect, receive and retain for transportation of said tanks fth class rates and a minimum carload weight of 30,000 pounds nd if any galvanized troughs are included in the car said defendant xact a rate of one and one-half times first class, based on actua weight of said troughs, in addition to fifth class rates and 30,00 &gt;ound minimum weight charged, as aforesaid, on tanks; that sai&lt; ate of fifth class, and said minimum weight of 30,000 pounds pplying on tank carloads, and said rate of one and one-half times rst class applying on troughs on mixed carload shipments of tank as described above, are unjust, unreasonable, excessive, and unjustly iscriminatory, and in violation of the laws of the state of Nebraska It is further complained of the defendants that they permit the mixing of tanks with agricultural implements, windmill.", windmil ttachments, pumps, angle iron and timber prepared for windmil owers, and iron supports for water tanks, at the same class am ommodity rates and minimum weights as apply on agricultura mplements, and that by reason of said mixtures and minimum eights tanks may be shipped at a much lower rate than when lipped in straight carloads of tanks. SAt the hearing it developed that it is practically impossible load 30,000 pounds of galvanized iron tanks in a 50-foot car, fiich was conceded by several witnesses for the defendants, but at 24,000 pounds can be conveniently loaded. The complainant ks that the minimum weight be lowered to 20,000 pounds, but d not substantiate its claim by any material testimony. The Commission is of the opinion that it is not good policy to establish minimum weights on carload shipments greater than can be conveniently loaded, because the practical effect of such weights is to raise the rate; on the other hand, in justice to the carriers the minimum weight should be as large as can be conveniently loaded. </seg>
            <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 117 • The galvanized iron feed and watering troughs are made of the ame material, shipped to the same consumers, and- are used for he same general purposes. They are long and narrow, and can be oaded in the unoccupied spaces in the corners of the cars. The mixing of the troughs with the tanks would better utilize car space, and would enable the shipper to more easily load to the minimum weight. The Interstate Commerce Commission, in its decision concern - ing Western Classification No. 51 (25 I. C. C. Rep. 442), said: "Generally speaking, carload rates should be established wher - ever carload quantities are offered for shipment, and popular interests require it. b Liberal provisions should be made for mixtures. Artificial trictions upon mixtures are restrictions upon the freedom of trade d commerce. Mixtures result in a better utilization of car space; they lessen the demands upon terminal properties, they decrease the expense of operations and facilitate the movement of freight." The Commission is of the opinion that the above policy as recommended by the Interstate Commerce Commission, is sound and should be applied and followed in this state when found to be practical in the particular case under consideration. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission that the minimum weight on galvanized iron tanks, watering and feed troughs, be reduced from 30,000-pound minimum to 24,000-pound minimum, in straight or mixed carloads.

Similar differences will be noted in the above cases cited. The above illustrations of the present rate adjustments as appliec o the village of College View, Bethany Heights and University 'lace, together with all the evidence introduced at the hearing, ant careful study of the entire question, has led the Commission to elieve that there is a discrimination against said village, and, that the iscrimination may be discontinued, the Commission is of the opinion hat College View should be included in the Lincoln switchini istrict and fiat rates per car should be made for switching charges aid rates to be absorbed according to the rules of absorption as pply to the other two towns. The Commission has considered the reater distance that College View is from the transfer switches nd also the fact that the Lincoln Traction Company is put to a omewhat greater expense in transferring cars from the Chicago Lock Island &amp; Pacific transfer to the Sanitarium switch, by reason f its lack of facilities, and is undertaking to make switching charges hat will approximately compensate for the difference in expense The Lincoln Traction Company introduced a contract that ta predecessor, the Citizens Interurban Railway Company, made with "Central Union Conference Association of the Seventh Day Adventists and the Nebraska Sanitarium and Benevolent Association and B. M. Emerson and D. R. Callahan, party of the first part and the Citizens Interurban Railway Company, party of the secom part." Said contract among other things provided that the parties of the first part shall pay to the Citizens Interurban Railway Com pany $7.00 per car for all cars transferred from the Chicago, Rock stand &amp; Pacific transfer switch to the Sanitarium switch. The constitutional amendment by which the Railway Commis ion was created provides that the "duties of such Commission sha nclude the regulation of rate*, service and general control o ommon carriers, as the legislature shall provide by law. But i he absence of specific legislation, the Commission shall exercis he powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision. The rate fixed by the contract above referred to is subject to th power of the state to substitute a rate, fixed by the Commission or the rate agreed upon in the contract, because the power of th tate to make rates cannot be abrogated or limited by any contrac ntered into by the carriers on the one hand and private or mun ipal corporations on the other, save and except when specificall uthorized by law.

Hall &amp; Bishop for Morris Transportation Co. Hall, Commissioner. On June 23, 1913, the Commission made and entered its order n the above entitled cause, which provides for certain switching harges to be made by the defendants herein; and on June 26, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company filed a motion or a rehearing, and on July 7 the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company also filed a motion for a rehearing. The motion of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company for a rehearing is based entirely on its objection to the amount of the switching charges to be absorbed, claiming that a just and reasonable amount to be absorbed per car should not exceed $5.00. On July 26, 1913, the Commission entered its order overruling the said motions for a rehearing, which order the Commission now believes should be set aside, for the purpose of obtaining juris - diction, as the plaintiffs, by their attorney, William Morning, have filed stipulation by which they consent to a modification of the Commission's order of June 23, to the extent that none of the defendants shall be required to absorb a greater amount of the •witching charges than $5.00 per cat. The Commission, being now of the opinion that $7.00 per car is an excessive amount to be absorbed, will modify its original order, and reduce the said amount of $7.00 to $5.00 per car. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the said order of the Commission overruling the motion for a rehearing be set aside; that the original order of the Commission, dated June 26, Item 4, be modified to read as follows: "Item 4. All of the above switching charges shall be sub- ject to the present legal absorption rules now on file with the Commission and effective on Nebraska intrastate carload traffic on the several lines of railroad of the carriers named in this order," provided, however, that no carrier shall be required to absorb a greater amount of the said switching charges than $5.00 per car.

            <seg id="p126">126 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Liberty Independent Telephone Company is required to furnish long distance service to its subscribers over the long distance lines of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company. Appearances: Wesley M. Fulton and George Sutter for Complainants H. E. Sackett for Respondent Clarke, Commissioner: The complainants herein, subscribers and stockholders of the &lt;iberty Independent Telephone Company of Liberty, Nebraska omplain in that the said telephone company fails and refuses to urnish long distance service to its subscribers, notwithstanding the willingness of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company to onnect its long distance lines with their switchboard on the usua erms, under standard contract, similar to that prevailing in long istance and local exchange throughout the state. Upon the filing of the complaint, the Commission issued its rder upon the Liberty Independent Telephone Company to satisfy le complaint or appear at the office of the Commission and show ause. On March 4, 1913, a hearing was held in the office of the ommission, at which the complainants and respondent appeared n person and were represented by counsel. From the evidence it ppears that respondent company has 293 subscribers, 182 of which re stockholders, and that a petition signed by ninety-five of the tockholders was presented to one of the officers of the company, etitioning for long distance service. A remonstrance was also filed with the Commission, signed by seventeen of the stockholders. There is at present some long distance service furnished by thi ompany, through the Blue Springs exchange, with which this com iany has a free interchange of service, such long distance servic oing through Burchard and Pawnee and east. The subscribers lowever, of the respondent company are unable, except upon rar ecasions, to reach Beatrice, Wymore, Omaha or points beyond t was stipulated at the hearing that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - graph Company, who was not a party to the proceedings nor ap eared thereat, had offered 'and was still willing to connect its Ion istance lines with respondent company's switchboard, and prepar or long distance service on the basis of 15% commission on out oing and 10% on incoming calls, from and to the responden ompany, with a maximum of fifteen cents commission on any on all, and that no commission should be paid to the respondent part n messages passing over lines of foreign companies, except on sue ortion of such charge as would accrue to the Lincoln Telephone i "elegraph Company. The respondent company is a semi-mutual company, furnishing service on a grounded circuit system. Its subscribers are permitted to furnish their own telephones, and while the standard of the </seg>
            <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 127 telephone instruments is entirely within the control of the board of directors, telephone instruments of different capacity are used. It developed at the hearing that a difference of opinion existed among the stockholders with reference to the desirability, both from a service standpoint and the standpoint of return ,to respondent company, on the proposed long distance connections. Those opposed o the connection in question contended as follows: First, they imagine that the connection of long distance wires with their switchboard, thereby furnishing long distance service to their subscribers, would eventually result in the prevention of their entering into arrangements or agreements with other local exchanges for the free interchange of service between such exchanges. This contention is without justification, as the Commission has held uniformly that where two companies operating exchanges in neighboring towns or localities desire to enter into an arrangement for free interchange of business without additional charge between the two exchanges, they will be permitted so to do without inter - ference by the Commission, where there is no unjust or unreasonable discrimination. Second, it was contended that the physical connection at their switchboard for long distance lines would necessitate the recon - struction of their plant, and the converting of the same from a grounded circuit system into a metallic circuit system, and that subscribers on their party line, availing themselves of the long distance service, would seek to use telephone instruments of a higher power and grade than other parties on the same line, and to tha extent cause the company additional expense and depreciate the character of the service. This contention is likewise without justification. A connection of the long distance lines with respondent company will not neces itate the converting of its grounded circuit system into a metallic circuit system. As previously stated, the character of instruments used by respondent's subscribers is entirely within the control o ts board of directors. It further appeared, as testified to by the president of the company, who had served on the board of directors or as president, for the past ten years, since the organization o he company, that satisfactory long distance service had been furr shed with the existing equipment and plant of the»company. Third, it was contended that the percentage or commission sub mitted to respondent company for its remuneration in handling the ong distance business originating or destinating en its exchange was insufficient and inadequate. This contention was based largely n the fact that these commissions were being paid to a local repre entative of the long distance company, in whose store the long istance booth had been placed, and that the telephone compan; ot only performed the same service to the party in question, bu urnished its entire system. It is unnecessary for the Commission to comment at length </seg>
            <seg id="p128">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT 128 on this contention. The benefits accruing by reason of the con - nection, so far as the putting up of long distance calls, is reciprocal, in that it saves the necessity of subscribers of the respondent com - pany from coming into town to the telephone booth to put in or answer long distance calls. The reasonableness of the rate has itself been determined by the legislature of 1911, which has fixed the commission to be allowed at 15% on originating calls and 10% on destinating ca'ls. (Section 3, Chapter 79, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1913.) Fourth, it was contended that the handling of local service would be slowed up by the time of the operator being taken up &gt;andling the long distance calls. The respondent company is at resent having two operators to handle its business on a sixty drop &gt;oard. From the experience and knowledge of the Commission hac n these matters, it is clear that unless the toll business at this xchange is considerably greater than that usually handled at sucl xchanges, an operator at a board of this size could handle the service promptly without detriment to the local service. In fact le president of the company testified that, in the opinion of one f the operators at least, the handling of the traffic of the company ould be facilitated by the installation of a long distance connection nasmuch as it would relieve certain already overloaded lines between espondent's exchange and that of Blue Springs. Irrespective of what the Commission's conclusions might be n the merits of the case, the respondent company would be com pelled, under the terms of Section 1, Chapter 79, of the Session itwB of Nebraska for the year 1913, to make the connection ar&lt; urnish the service herein petitioned for by complainant, said section &gt;eing as follows: "Any telephone company, corporation, association, person or persons doing a public telephone business in the state o Nebraska shall take the calls or messages corning from an other telephone company, corporation, association, person o persons, and so switch and connect its wires that such telephon message from any point in Nebraska may be delivered to an; subscriber served by its telephone exchange or switched through so that any message may be passed on to another exchang over such trunk or toll lines as may be available and designatec by the exchange or switching station where the call originated regardless of the ownership of such lines. And such telephon company, corporation, person or persons shall also take call from its subscribers and public pay stations and pass such call through its exchange toward destination and over the lines ane the route designated by the person making such telephone ca if there be competing lines existing between such points. Pro - vided, that in case the person making such telephone call, does not designate a route for such message, or that no competin lines exist between points of origination and destination, the the company may by its operator at originating point mak such designation of route, but calls or messages must be switchec through to destination if the point be reached by any connect ing wires." </seg>
            <seg id="p129">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 129 The Commission therefore finds that the respondent company should be required to make a physical connection with the long distance lines of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company at its switchboard, the expense of such connection to be borne by the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company. In the event of failure of the parties to agree on the terms of the contract for the handling of this service, to be entered into by between the parties, the Commission wi'l approve the contract submitted at the hearing, marked Exhibit 6, with the exception of Section 5, which, in the opinion of the Commission, should be eliminated.

They ask for an order amending item No. 13 and that rtion of item No. 14 of The Nebraska Classification No. 1, page i which reads as follows: "Unless the foregoing requirements are complied with, the shipment will be charged one class higher (greater)." Complainants ask that said rule be made to read thus: "Unless the foregoing requirements are complied with, th« shipment will not be accepted for transportation." tThe requirements referred to prescribe the manner in which ; cases shall be constructed and how they shall be packed for pment. Evidence received at the hearing in the offices of the Commis - sion on April 29, 1913, developed the following state of facts: Under present competitive conditions in the egg business freight charges on less than carload shipments are borne by the wholesale dealers. This relieves the local dealer or consignor of any liability as to loss through improper packing, his responsibility for the ship - ment terminating with the delivery of the eggs at the local station of the railroad company. The carriers, likewise, are more or less indifferent as to the condition of the shipment when received, as the application of the higher rate on improperly packed or defective cases is a fairly adequate protection against any loss that may ensue. Moreover, in order to establish a claim for damage the consignee must make inspection of the eggs before they leave the destinating station of the carrier. As many of the shipments are small this is an im - practical and expensive method of protection. In the practical applica - tion of the rule as it now stands, therefore, the wholesale dealers are compelled to bear the greater pa't of the loss that results from impropei and indifferent packing. At the same time they are without remedy to correct the present condition for the reason that, under competition, a wholesaler who refuses to accept shipments improperly packed soon discovers that the retailer, rather than go to the expense and trouble of providing proper cases, will transfer his eggs to other dealers less exacting. The rule in its present form also leads to discrimination in favor of dealers in smaller towns, who concentrate eggs for shipment to larger points in car lots. At points like Omaha the carriers maintain inspectors whose duty it is to examine egg shipments as they arrive to see if they are properly packed. This </seg>
            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 131 results in the frequent assessment of the higher rate. In the small towns there are no such inspectors, this work being done by local agents, who, it was satisfactorily shown, are careless and indiffeient in inspecting and billing, the i-esu't being that the concentrating dealer in the small town secures an advantage over the dealer located at inspection points to the extent of several dollais per car. That the loss, through improper packing, is large was well ndicated by the evidence. For example, in an exhibit presented by [. S. Hartman, traffic manager of the Fairmont Creamery Co., was shown that out of a total of 1,887 cases of eggs received and andled at their plants in Omaha, Grand Island and Crete there ere 467 dozen smashed, 3,436 dozen cracked and 138 dozen smeared. 'he net loss, due to damage in transportation, after a proper allow - nee for salvage was $246.90. Of this amount only $7.20 was subject o recovery through claims, as the eggs had not been inspected at le depots. Mr. Hartman estimated the loss under present condi - ons at from $40 to $50 per car. Other witnesses testified that the oss runs 10%. The Fairmont Creamery Company recently estab - ished the practice of purchasing eggs from their own agents only, le latter being given specific instructions with regard to packing. y this method, according to Mr. Hartman, their losses have been educed to a minimum. According to other witnesses, the losses ould be reduced by means of proper packing from 10% to 2%. It appears clear to the Commission, therefore, that the modi ication of the rule in the manner prayed for would result in sub tantial benefit to the egg industry in Nebraska, and at the sam me work no hardship on the carriers. Some evidence was sub - mitted to show that it would be difficult for local agents to deter mine whether a shipment was properly packed, but the Commissio s convinced that this could be accomplished without much difficulty 'he rejection of a few shipments at each station would undoubtedl &gt;e sufficient to secure a correction of present conditions. The tes - mony showed that the Burlington voluntarily adopted the new ule several weeks ago, while the Union Pacific and St. Joseph &lt; Grand Island recently cancelled that portion of it which requires mproperly packed shipments to take the higher rate. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Rail way Commission that that portion of Item No. 14, page 55, o The Nebraska Classification No. 1, which reads as fol'ows: "Unless the foregoing requirements are complied with the shipment will be charged one class higher (greater)," shall be amended to read thus "Unless the foregoing requirements are complied with, the shipmen will not be accepted for transportation," this order to take effec not later than thirty days from date. </seg>

Allen, Secretary. [Seal] FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 193 Leopold Moller, Complainant, vs. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant. Taylor, Commissioner: On the theory that the narrowing of the channel of the Platt liver and the consequent deepening of the water through erosion f the sand would provide a current sufficiently deep to carry off he ice in the spring without the destructive gorges that made th &gt;ridging of the stream precarious and expensive, the defendant rail oad company reduced the length of its bridge at Fremont from ,500 to 1,200 feet. The complainant contends that the shortening of the bridge at this point resulted in an obstruction of the current of the stream, and that this obstruction caused the river to overflow its north bank during the flood of March, 1912, thereby flooding his land and damaging his property. He asks for an order requiring defendant to lengthen the bridge and thus remove the obstruction. A hearing was held by the Commission at .Fremont on April 8, 9, and 10, 1913, at which time, also, the members made a personal inspection of the bridge and of the territory adjacent thereto. The Platte River is subject to floods in the spring of the year, nd the evidence shows that freshets more or less destructive have isited Fremont nearly every year in the community's history. The ood of March 29 and 30, 1912, was larger than any of the preceding reshets, practically the whole Platte valley at this point being nundated, and the stream being two and three miles wide in places. 'he 1912 flood conditions were complicated by reason of the fact lat the ice had not yet melted in the river, and in many places as frozen to the sand. The great chunks of ice, torn loose by the ligh water, were hurled down stream and every few miles formed orges or jams that impeded the flow of the water and caused it o spread out over the valley. The ice also was thrown out upon le fields and contributed to the damage done to crops, trees, fences nd buildings. A peculiarity of the 1912 flood was that it carried mmense quantities of sand that was carried out over the adjacent ands and there deposited, thousands of acres of valuable land being ius practically rendered worthless. </seg>
            <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 133 The Burlington at Fremont comes in from the north and west ollowing a southeasterly direction through the town. Shortly after eaving the station it turns sharply to the south and crosses the Matte River about two miles from town. The curve mentioned am he embankment running south to the river describes the north astern and eastern boundaries of a basin or low area which is eparated from the river bed by a low sand ridge. The lowest oint in this basin is from four to five feet below the bed of the iver at right angles thereto, and much of the area is lower than he river bed. In support of his contention that the bridge of the defendant was not long enough to provide an escape for the waters during the flood of 1912, and that as a result the overflow was backed up over his property, the complainant relied largely on two facts: First that during the hours when the flood was approaching its highest point the water that flooded his land and the premises of his neigh bors came from the south and east, rather than from the west an&lt; southwest; second, that the water was higher by from three to five feet on the west side of the railroad embankment than it wu on the east. There is an abundance of evidence to show that there was a urrent of water running north and west towards Mr. Moller' lace, a number of witnesses testifying to that effect. The genera ourse of the river in this territory is southeasterly and the main urrent of the stream followed that course. Complainant assumes lerefore, that the fact that there was a backward movement of th ater above the Burlington bridge and grade is conclusive proo lat the bridge was too short, and that it was an obstruction to th ree passage of the main body cf the flood water. There were othe onditions at the time of the flood, however, that had a direc &gt;earing on the course of the stream and this one fact, standing alone not sufficient to prove that the bridge was an obstruction. I he first place, the whole valley at this point was covered with water nd there were currents in every direction. The river was runnin ild over the country and wherever there was a depression or low rea there was a current in that direction. Numerous photographs ntroduced and made a part of the record, indicate this state of affairs ery vividly. With the possible exception of the flood of 1907 le flood of this year was the largest and most destructive that hac isited the valley in thirty years. As heretofore stated, the area orth of the river and in the vicinity of tKe premises of Mr. Molle s low and the water, in spreading over the valley, naturally flowec n a northerly and westerly direction to reach this depression. I rossed the elevation known as Inglewood Ridge, which parallels le north bank of the river, because the river was higher than the dge. This is shown by elevations determined by defendant's ngineer. The general elevation of the ridge is 1,225.5. At a poin n the south bank of the river, and at right angles to the channe </seg>
            <seg id="p134">134 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT |&gt;posite the eastern end of the ridge, the high water mark was und at 1,225.3, showing that the water in the main channel oi e river reached a height that was on a level with the top of the nd ridge. If the water at these points was being dammed by the •idge it would necessarily be on a level with the water at the •idge, but the gauging at the bridge shows that the high water ark there was 1,223.18, or a difference of two feet, which is the :tual fall of the river between the two points, the first mark being 000 feet above the bridge. In other words, the water was high lough at the crest of the flood to cross the bridge, and, once over e ridge, it fell naturally to the north and west, seeking the lower ound. A large island, some two miles in length, known as Big Island separates the river into two channels, the lower point of this islanc being about three-quarters of a mile west of the railroad bridge During normal conditions the main stream of the river follows the south channel. About four miles west of the west point of the island is the North Western bridge across the Platte. During the early hours of the 1912 flood an ice gorge formed west of this bridge. Between the hours of six and seven o'clock on the morning of March 29tl this gorge broke and a portion at each end of the bridge was torn out. The mass of ice and water, thus suddenly released, rushed down the stream until it reached the western point of Big Island. As stated above, the natural course of the main current from this poin would have been down the sou^h channel, but owing to the grea thickness of the ice in this channel and the fact that the high bluffs on the south protected it from the sun's rays so that it had not thawed, this water course was choked and the flood had to find an outlet elsewhere. It turned across the island and into the nortl channel, tearing out a dike that had been built across the upstream end of the north channel by the Farmland, Fremont &amp; Railroac Drainage District. Had it not been for a levee along the nortl bank of this channel, also constructed by the drainage district, th water and ice would have gone directly east into the south part o the city of Fremont. As it was, it was held in the channel by th levee, which at that time extended down the river a distance of on and one-third miles. The general course of the levee is southeas but at the lower end it turns quite sharply to the east. The top of the levee is from six to eight feet above the level of the ground north of the channel. The water coming down this channel cam to within a few inches of the top of the levee so that there was wall of water five or six feet high to be released as it reached th lower end of the levee. This water naturally fell away to the nort and west, seeking the lower levels, and thus contributed liberal! to the current that was coming over the ridge from the south. k There was still another factor that caused the flood to run rth and west. This was the gorge at the county bridge, this ucture being situated about 1,200 feet east of the lower end of </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 Big Island. According to the testimony of complainant's witness, A. W. Murphy, one of the county supervisors of Dodge County, between 1,200 and 1,400 feet of this bridge was taken out. The bridge was 2,650 feet in length. Ice gorged above it, forming a dam, «nd the tendency was for the water to turn to the north to clear it. One hundred feet of the county road grade north of the bridge was washed out, indicating that the current was strong in that direction. It is apparent from a consideration of these facts that the Jurlington bridge and embankment was not the cause of the current hat flowed north and west. Further corroboration of this fact ould be shown by an analysis and study of elevations of the flood t different points, but this is unnecessary for the purpose of show - ng that the bridge offered no obstruction to the stream. Had there been no railroad bridge or embankment, it is alto - ether likely that the property belonging to the complainant woulc lave been flooded, for an immense volume of water came upon lim from a direction different from any of those above mentioned At the time the floods from the west washed out the dikes at the mouth of the north channel of the river the water also went further orth and broke through a low dike or embankment that joine&lt; he Union Pacific grade. This current followed the Union Pacific nd North Western tracks eastward and then turned south into the ow area in which Mr. Moller's land is situated. According to Mr Roller's own testimony the center of this current was only sixty ods north of his house. The testimony of other witnesses and the &gt;hotos introduced as evidence show clearly this condition, and prove onclusively that there was a tremendous quantity of water comin rom the west. This water was in no way affected by the Burling on bridge, as it was outside of the banks of the river and running wild over the country. Undoubtedly this water alone would hav nundated the land belonging to the complainant. At least it was big factor in contributing to the mass of water that overwhelme&lt; lim and his neighbors at this time. The second main point urged by the complainant was that th ligher elevation of the water on the west or up-stream side of the Turlington embankment over that on the east side was conclusive &gt;roof that the embankment impeded the waters and dammed them up. While the testimony as to the difference between the wate evels on the west and east side differs, the estimates varying from wo to five feet, there is no dispute that the water on the east side of the embankment was considerably lower than it was on the we« ide. It is a very natural conclusion that this condition indicate* he damming up of the water by the embankment, but, as in the case of the direction of the current referred to, it is susceptible o ational explanation. As stated in the beginning, the Burlington ailroad runs directly south for about a mile after it swings away rom the yards at Fremont. About a quarter of a mile north of the </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT ver, however, it turns slightly to the west in order to cross the ver more nearly at right angles. Most of the observations as to ie depth of the water on either side of the grade were made at a &gt;oint where the "Packing House road" crosses the railroad. For unately, the employees of the defendant marked the elevation of the ater at the highest stage of the flood by driving a nail in a wing ence located at this place and identifying it as a high water mark 'he elevation at this mark was 1,226.50. It is a fact, well estab shed by engineers and capable of accurate demonstration, that the evel or elevation of water in a stream is always the same at righ ngles to the main current. To reach a point on the south banl ' the river directly at right angles to the main current and opposite o the high water mark just mentioned, it would be necessary to go ,000 feet upstream from the railroad bridge. If the principle jus eferred to is correct the elevation at this point should be the same aa at the "Packing House" crossing, or 1,226.50. Unfortunately o mark was made at this point, but the employes of the company id establish a mark just 1,000 feet farther down, or 2,000 fee Jove the bridge. The fall of the river here is 1 foot in 1,000, o .2 feet per mile, consequently the elevation at the latter marl lould be one foot lower than the mark at right angles to the curren nd opposite to the road crossing. The elevation of the water was ound to be 1,225.30, a variation of only 0.2 of a foot from the firs gure. At the south end of the bridge the elevation of the wate as 1,223.18, or 3.32 feet lower than it was at the point 3,000 fee pstream, opposite the grade crossing. In other words, the railroac &gt;ridge was 3,000 feet farther down the stream than was the "Pack g House" crossing and the water at the bridge should have been iree feet lower than at the crossing, which the figures show it to tave been. The water at the crossing, as shown by these figures as on a natural level with the great body of water moving in the iddle of the stream, and it would have reached the same heigh t this point had there been no embankment in existence. This con usion is borne out by the fact that at the highest stage of the ood, or within two or three hours thereafter, employes of the defend nt blew out a substantial section of the embankment without ma erially affecting the height of the water. About ten o'clock on the morning of March 29 bridges No. 28.71 and No. 28.40, both located n the curve just after the road turns to the south, were blown out ogether with about 150 feet of the embankment. It was believec tat this would provide an outlet for the water and relieve the upposed congestion in the basin. The evidence shows, however lat immediately following the opening of these outlets in the grade ie water fell only a few inches. Clarence Martin, testifying fo omplainant, stated that the water subsided at his place only two nches. (Rec. p. 36.) In answer to a question as to whether he oticed the water subsiding about 9 or 10 o'clock on the morning March 29, Andrew Andreason, another of complainant's witnesses </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 137 aid: "I don't remember the time, there was one little time tha t seemed to go down a very little, about half an inch, and then remember it rose up again. ' (Rec. p. 10.) Mr. Moller, himself estified as follows; speaking of the condition of the water on th first day of the flood: "Why, it ran, I guess, all that day, with very little variation in depth I think it was just abou tationary then. " (Between 1 and 3 o'clock of the first day.) (Rec &gt;. 49-50.) Andrew Martin Andreason was more definite in lis testimony, touching this point, and gave his information in th ollowing statement: "There was a gas pipe in one of my pump hree or four inches high, and there was where I kept a mark on he water, and when I heard the blasts I was out in front of th louse. I was wading around, and when I came in, it was not very ong, but I don't know what space of time it was when I came back &gt;ut I told my wife it would not be but a few hours before it woul&lt; o down. I didn't know what made it go down so fast, but i Topped from the top stone until it got below the platform three r four inches in the space of fifteen or twenty minutes, as near a can remember." (Rec. p. 83.) It is clear from this evidence tha he opening of the embankment had but little to do with the sub idence of the flood. And if openings aggregating 150 feet in lengt elieved the conditions only to the extent of lowering the wate wo or three inches, it does not seem probable that a further openin f 500 feet, as demanded by complainant, would provide the solutio or this overflow problem. It might be well to add here that th wo bridges just referred to were lengthened so that the two open ngs aggregate 150 feet. The water was lower on the east side of the grade for two easons. First, there was a high point of ground or ridge on th north bank of the river which started at the railroad bridge am extended some distance east. This prevented the water from turnin north as soon as it passed under the bridge. Second, the bridge teing three-fifths of a mile east of the grade crossing, it was neces - sary for the water to back up for that distance before it coul&lt; occupy the territory east of the embankment. Moreover, there wu a tremendous current under the bridge that carried the water fa to the east before it began to spread. In addition to the conclusions to be drawn from the physica aspects of the flood, we have, fortunately, the benefits of actua experience to guide us in determining whether or not the bridge and embankment were obstructions to the stream. The longe bridge has been tried. In 1907, when the flood conditions were practically as serious as they were in this instance, the Burlington bridge was 4,500 feet long, almost four times the length of the presen structure. If complainant's theory is correct, that bridge shouh have carried the flood with an ample margin to spare. But the facts are, that not only was a portion of the bridge taken out, but ove 1,000 feet of the embankment went with it, making a channel fo </seg>
            <seg id="p138">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT the stream of over 5,500 feet. With a channel over a mile wide, practically the same territory was inundated as in the flood of 1912, &gt;roving beyond any question that the wide channel at this point ■ not a protection against overflow. The record also shows that in the flood of 1881, when there was no Burlington railroad at Fremont, the water covered even a wider expanse than in 1912, it being possible to run boats in a number of the streets of the city. It is profitable, also, to compare the effects of the flood of 191 upon the shorter Burlington bridge with the longer ones belongin to the North Western and Union Pacific and the Dodge county wago bridge. The North Western bridge was 2,846 feet long at this time An ice gorge formed at this bridge which had much to do wit complicating the flood situation. L. D. Richards, an old residen of Fremont and actively identified with the projects for protectin the community against floods, testified as follows on this point: "I jusf want to say one word to the Commission about our trouble this spring. I think our trouble came largely from the North Western bridge. Ice piled up there until it reached the top of the bridge and took it out and then it came down in waves and covered this whole country. If it had continued its course we would have had as much water but not all at the same time, and I am sure that without this big levee there would not have been a house in Fremont on its foundation." A large section of the North Western bridge was washed ou Reference has already been made to the ice gorge at the count wagon bridge. This structure was 2,650 feet long and 1,400 feet o t was taken out. In addition to this 100 feet of the grade leadin o the bridge was destroyed. The board of supervisors plan to cu he new bridge to 1,637 feet, Supervisor Murphy testifying that i will be reduced "to get rid of the expense of keeping up a Ion bridge that we don't think we need." The Union Pacific bridg at Valley, according to the record, was about 3,000 feet in length An ice gorge formed at this bridge and the channel of the rive waa driven to the south, washing out upwards of one-half mile o he track and embankment. Contrast, now, the effects of the ic and water upon the Burlington bridge. Subjected substantially t he same forces that were so destructive of the other bridges, thi tructure emerged from the flood intact. At no time during th ligh water was its condition such that trains could not pass ove t. The testimony shows that it was thrown slightly out of align ment by the impact of the masses of ice against the piers, but th bridge structure itself was not injured. In short, the bridge justifie he theory that it takes a narrow channel in the Platte to carry ice In this connection, it is interesting to consider the erosion that resulted from the narrowing of the channel at this point. J. R. Hickox, assistant chief engineer of the Burlington railroad, submitted soundings that had been taken at the bridge during practically every flood since 1908. At the time of the flood of 1912 a channel was cleared under the north side of the bridge for a distance of about </seg>
            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 139 i) feet that had an average depth of thirty-one feet. The depth the water for the remainder of the space under the bridge was m eight to twenty feet. At the deepest point, which was at the rd pier from the north side, the depth was thirty-eight feet. ie soundings for the other floods showed much the same condition th respect to the location of the deep channel, although during ne of them was the channel as deep as in this case. It is obvious, &gt;m a study of these soundings, that the concentration of the water the shortening of the bridge compelled the river to deepen its annel and provide a canal for the passage of the great body of !. The preponderance of the evidence was to the effect that there is a terrific current under the bridge on the north side and that e "draw" or suction of the stream at this point attracted the ice &gt;m a wide field. Three-quarters of a mile east of the bridge, where e water again spread and became shallow, a large ice gorge formed, id the main current of the flood was again deflected across the ien country. It will be noted, and it is a significant manifestation the peculiar actions of this stream, that with a waterway of 1,280 et available for its use, the main current occupied only about hall the space covered by the bridge. ! Practically all of the Burlington bridges crossing the Platte iver have been shortened, and according to the testimony of E ignell, superintendent of the Lincoln division of that road for th ist twenty-two years, the narrowing of the channel has in every stance been the means of preventing ice gorges. This is particular!; ue of the bridges east of Columbus where the Loup empties int ie Platte. Testifying with regard to this, Mr. Bignell says: "The Loup is the stream that causes the trouble. We have very little trouble with ice gorges under our bridges, and have had none after they have been shortened. It (the Loup) breaks up usually very suddenly, and the current is so rapid and so much water that it floats the ice before the Platte River ice breaks loose, and there is very little breaking up of the Platte River below the Loup until the Loup breaks up." (Rec. p. 250.) Testifying further concerning this he states : "The Platte River breaks up in this way: There is not enough water in the Platte River in the spring to carry a flood Cf ice such as comes to it from the Loup, consequently the ice &gt;dges on the sand bars and forms gorges. The ice would never go down in the river if it was not for forming gorges, so it naturally forms these ice gorges across the stream, some smaller and some larger, large enough to cut underneath and go on. I never saw the water going over any gorges in the river because the ice goes on top of the water, and we have had our bridges covered with ice 12 or 15 feet above the water, so of course the water would not go up through that." (Rec. p. 259.) Answering a question as to whether that ever happened at any of the shortened bridges, he said: "No, sir, I don't know of any ice gorges since we have shortened our bridges." (Rec. p. 259.) </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Mr. Bignell testified at length relative to the history of other bridges across the Platte at different points, but it is not necessary to review this, further than to call attention to the striking illustra - tion of the efficacy of the narrow channel offered by the wagon bridge at Ashland. This structure, only 1,000 feet long, carried the flood of 1912, the Platte at this point being swollen to still larger proportions by the flood waters of the Elkhorn. It is clearly the opinion of the Commission, based on the fore - oing, that the Burlington bridge and embankment at Fremont di( ot constitute an obstruction to the Platte River at the time of the ood of 1912. The water of which plaintiff complains came upon iim from at least three different directions, by far the larger part I it from the southwest and west, sources unaffected by the bridge 'hat which came from the south and east was apparently not affectec n its course by the bridge, the mere direction of the current no eing sufficient basis for the assumption that it was impeded anc effected by the bridge. The higher elevation of the water on the est side than on the east side of the embankment is likewise lack ng in supporting evidence to make it conclusive proof that the ater was dammed up by the grade, particularly when there is mp'e grounds for believing that it was no higher on the west side tan the general level cf the main stream, and no higher than i ould have been had there been no embankment in existence. The ecord stands undisputed that the shorter bridge over the Platte the more efficient, both for passing water and ice in times of flood nd for the protection of adjacent lands. The shorter bridge am he narrow channel is overwhelmingly justified by lay and pro essional authority, practical experiments and actual experience. These facts of themselves make it plain to the Commission tha would be unwise to disturb present conditions, but there is sti nother factor that has a vital bearing on the case to which we hav made only incidental reference. This is the comprehensive schem or the protection of Fremont and vicinity projected by the Farm and, Fremont &amp; Railroad Drainage District. Secretary Hanson f the drainage district, submitted the detailed plans for the contro f the river, and gave a lengthy history of the various efforts tha lave been made to secure relief from the recurrent floods at Fremont 'he main feature of the present plan is a levee starting at a poin n the Union Pacific tracks north of the center of Big Island, an&lt; ollowing the north bank of the river eastward for a distance o wo and two-thirds miles where it joins the Burlington grade at th Packing House" road crossing. This levee is to be ten feet hig bove low water, with a width of sixteen feet at the top. It ha een extended for a distance of about two miles at the time of th tearing on this complaint and, according to the testimony of Sec etary Hanson, will be completed by not later than the fall of 1914 he necessary funds having been provided by a tax levy. One o he vital features of this project is that portion of the levee whic </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 141 oins the Union Pacific grade on the west. It was at this point lat the water broke over in the flood of 1912 and found its way to the south part of Fremont. Extensive work has been planned t this place, the drainage district having secured the co-operation the Union Pacific Railroad Co., and the engineers connected with te project and the men identified with the drainage district con - dently predict that when it is done there will be no danger of an verflow at that point. Upon the consummation of the plans of the rainage district the waters of the Platte River at Fremont will be onfined to the territory outlined by this levee, and it will be im - &gt;ossible for flood water to reach the property of the complainant onsequently the length of the Burlington bridge can be of no con em to him hereafter, unless it should prove to be such an obstruc on that it would hold the water until it was forced over the top the levee, a contingency there is no reasonable basis for believing ill ever occur. On the contrary, the shortening of the bridge is a art of the general drainage plan and conforms to the wishes of the members of the drainage board. In fact, the board contemplate&lt; le narrowing of the channel of the Platte at this point in 1895 &gt;efore the railroad was built. This plan was subsequently abandoned Hit, upon the final organization of a drainage district, which was ubsequent to the building of the railroad, it was revived and the &gt;oard made formal demand upon the company for the shortenini f its bridge. It is manifest, therefore, that the shortening of the Burlington &gt;ridge at this point is the outcome, not only of the experience o ie officials of the road, but of the experience and investigation of the itizens of Fremont and vicinity, who were driven to protective measures through successive years of flood devastation. It is the ogical result of many years of study, and to interfere with it now would be to disturb a vital feature of a project that gives sub :antial promise of solving the flood and overflow problem, thereby Meeting a saving of thousands of dollars to the property owners f this section of the Platte valley. The drainage district will expenc bout $50,000 before the work is completed, while the Burlington las already expended $65,000 in the shortening of its bridge. To nterfere with these plans, thus jeopardizing their- ultimate success nd rendering useless the expenditure of such large sums of money would, in the opinion of the Commission, be unwise and bad public olicy, unless there were substantial reasons for such interference 'he record in inis case does not show that any such substantia eason exists.

            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 145 The stations of Monroe, Genoa, Kent, Merchiston and Fullerton are located on the Union Pacific line from Columbus to Spalding. The stations of David City, Rising City, Shelby, Osceola, Stroms - burg, Polk and Hordville are located on the Union Pacific line from Lincoln to Central City, Marquette and Phillips are Burlington stations south and west of Central City. This table of rates at once discloses the fact that the grain rate n the main line of the Union Pacific, and particularly at the point amed in the complaint, are considerably higher than on the branc ines north and south. At Duncan on the main line the rate on wheat is 11.05, while at Shelby on the south it is 10.2. At Monro n the north it is 11.05. It will be noticed, however, that Duncan s closer to Omaha by 13.2 miles than Shelby, and six miles close han Monroe. At Silver Creek the difference is still more markec he rate on wheat being 11.9 while at Osceola it is 10.62, and a Genoa 11.47, the distance from Omaha being largely in Silver Creek' avor. The corn rate at these points is the same. Completing th omparison we find that the rate on wheat is from 0.42 of a cen o 1.28 cents higher at the main line points than at competitiv points on the line south, notwithstanding that the distance in eac nstance is consideiably greater from the branch line station. Wit he exceptions of Genoa and Fullerton the wheat rates on the nort ine are the same as on the main line, the advantage in distance lowever, still being with the main line towns. Marquette, locatec on the Burlington eight miles south of Central City, has a whea ate of 12.75 as against Central City's rate of 13.6 and a corn rat of 11.05 as against 11.9 at Central City. Here again the distanc s in favor of the main line town by 6.8 miles. It is manifest, there ore, that these rates do constitute a discrimination against the sta ions named in the complaint, and that unless there is some sul tantial basis for such a schedule the discrimination should b removed by a re-adjustment of the rates. No attempt was made by either complainant or defendant o establish the reasonableness of the rates in question. Defendant ontend that they are the natural outgrowth of competitive cond ions, and that as they have stood uncontested and uncomplainei f for many years it is fair to assume that they are just and equit ble. They also assert that to lower these rates would disarrang he whole grain rate fabric in that territory. The rates on th jincoln-Central City branch of the Union Pacific, they assert, ar ontrolled by the competition of the Burlington, North Western, an other roads farther south and east in the state, and are the resul of a careful gradation commencing at Lincoln and extending north westward. In the opinion of the Commission, such reasons, eve f founded on the facts, ate not sufficient for the maintenance of ituation so discriminatory and inequitable as this one is shown to be It being admitted that the rates are largely the result of com - petitive conditions, it necessarily follows that they have not been </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT uilt up on any scientific or comprehensive basis. The fact tha hey have stood for many years without complaint is not fina roof that they are just. There is complaint now, and the complain nts are able to show that they are suffering under the situation as t exists. Furthermore, the facts do not bear out the assertion tha fie gradation of the rates is uniform from Lincoln northwestward 'he wheat rate at Lincoln is 7.65. At Malcolm, a few miles north •est, it is 8.07, and at Germantown 8.5, a spread of 0.42 and 0.4i f a cent respectively. At Staplehurst, however, the rate is 9.77 jump of 1.27 cents with the mileage practically the same. A resham the rate is 10.2, a step of 0.43, and at Osceola 10.62, a ep of 0.42. This brings us to the territory affected by this com aint. At Silver Creek the rate is 11.9, making the spread 1.2 &gt;etween that town and Osceola, which is three times what it i etween Gresham and Osceola, although the distance is abou le same. AM of the other branch line points on the south ar .85 of a cent lower than the competitive stations on the main line ith the exception of Polk, which is 0.42 below Clarks. It is plain be seen from a study of these figures that the rates up to the southern boundary of this territory are controlled by competitive orces, but that the competitive influence ceases at the main line nd the Union Pacific has taken advantage of its position here to aintain a higher schedule. This fact being established, it stand o reason that a re-adjustment of these rates on a basis that wil &gt;e equitable to all points in the territory will not interfere witl te general grain rate system in that section of the state. The tes at these six towns are out of proportion to the rates prevailing n parallel lines, and to bring them down to their proper level shoult ot disturb rates elsewhere. That the discrimination puts the main line stations to a distinc isadvantage is manifest from the evidence. P. H. Bell, cashier o ie Silver Creek State bank, testifying for complainant, stated that te made an investigation during the season of 1912, and found that ; least 40,000 bushels of wheat grown in the territory tributary o Silver Creek, was marketed in Osceola, drawn to the latter point &gt;y the higher price paid by dealers who had the advantage of the ower freight rate. He further testified that the price of wheat n Osceola is uniformly about one cent per bushel higher than in lver Creek. These assertions are borne out by a statement sub - mitted by the Union Pacific, which shows the number of carload ' wheat shipped from the various points involved during the yea 912. From Osceola 175 carloads were shipped, while from Silve reek there were only 104. From Duncan there were twenty-nine ars and at Shelby 145, Clarks 130 and Polk 154. The lower rate t Fullerton on the line north also had its effect, the shipment from lat point being 166 cars, while at Central City it was only 125 t was not shown that there were any other conditions in this terri ory that would influence the movement of wheat to these markets </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 147 hence it is fair to assume that the lower freight rate and the con- sequent higher price for the grain was responsible. Complainant offers a schedule of rates for wheat and corn for the six towns which it contends would be fair and equitable. These rates are not brought down to the level in each instance of the lower rates at the other points, but are established midway between the rates prevailing on the lines north and south. In view of the fore - going conclusions, and after a careful check of the suggested schedule, the Commission is of the opinion that it would be just and reason- able, and that the tariffs should be amended accordingly.

Inasmuch as the Commission under the existing laws coul&lt; ot predicate an order changing the carload rates, except upon the pplication of the carriers, or complaint, the complainant herein n July 14, 1913, Aled his petition on his own behalf and that o ther fruit growers in this state in which he alleged in substance 'hat the southeastern portion of the state was largely engaged in he growing of apples and other fruit; that large quantities thereo poil each year in the orchards of the growers; that in a considerable ortion of the state apples and fruit are not grown in sufficient quan lty to supply the local demands, that the freight rates from points f production to points of consumption within the state, over the arious lines of railroad are unreasonable and excessive; that join irough rates for such shipments are not generally maintained by le carriers with storage in transit privileges, and petitioned the ommission to determine and fix a reasonable schedule of rates for pples and fresh fruits for single line and joint hauls; likewise reason </seg>

Due notice having been given to all the railroads operating &gt;etween stations in the state, a hearing was had at the office o he Commission on August 25 and 26. Besides the complainant officers of the Eastern Nebraska Fruit Growers Association, which ontrols some 2,000 acres of orchard and having an output of some 500,000 bushels of apples, appeared and submitted evidence in suppor of the complaint. From the evidence it appeared, that the southeastern portion f Nebraska is well adapted to the growing of apples, pears, ant eaches and that the same are being grown in large and increasing uantities; that there is a large demand for same in the centra nd western non-fruit producing portions of the state; that where &gt;roper horticultural methods and packing are followed its product ompete successfully in the large central markets like Chicago and linneapolis with similar products grown in other territories; tha nly perfect fruit, properly packed is marketable in the centra markets; that there is a considerable quantity of fruit of inferio uality (undersized, bruised or scabby), which is suitable and desir ble for domestic use, but unsuitab'e for packing or storage purposes hat this fruit of inferior quality is worth from thirty to fifty cent er bushel F. O. B. cars point of origin; that failing a demand fo omestic consumption it is permitted to rot on the ground, or wher ider presses are available is sold for cider and vinegar purposes a en to twelve and one-half cents per bushel. It further appeared that there is only a limited demand for he higher grade fruits in the central and western parts of the state on account of the price; that the consumers in those portions o he state are unable or unwilling as a general rule to purchase other than the inferior grades; that when the cost of transportation under the existing freight rates, is added to the cost F. O. B. cars &gt;oint of origin plus the cost of marketing, the price of the consume s still so high as to limit the demand. tThis is well illustrated by the testimony of one of the directors the Fruit Growers Association, who had had considerable experi - ce in shipping into the northwestern part of the state, to-wit: It is a fact that these people in the northwestern part of the state when they can buy apples a little bit cheaper, will, when they can &gt;uy at seventy-five cents or a dollar, they will use twice as many t seventy cents, as they will at a dollar, and when apples get to dollar and a half very few supply the demand; but at seventy - ve cents they use a great many of them, and so it would not be very much lower rate to double the quantity used." Professor Raymond, Dean of the College of Applied Sciences of the University of Iowa, defines a reasonable rate on any article, the possible supply of which is very large, as "what the traffic will bear." He uses this phrase as meaning that rate which will move </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT ri economic maximum of any given commodity, and illustrates thus: "If the rate on California oranges is sufficiently high, a few only will be used by well to do families. If the rate is lowered appreciably more oranges will be used and the ship - ments will be larger. If the rates are sufficiently reduced oranges will become a common food and the shipments will be very large. As the rate is lowered from one that will move a few oranges, toward the one that will move all that can be pro - duced, a point is reached at which the net return to the trans - portation company will be a maximum. The rate producing this result is what 'the traffic will bear' and the volume of traffic moved the economic maximum." If the demands in the central and western portion of the state or the apples and fruit produced in the southeastern part of the ate will be increased by the lowering of the prices to the consumers esulting from a reduction of the cost of transportation, to the extent ndicated by the testimony of complainant's witnesses, it is evident hat if the present rates produce a revenue in excess of the actua ost of transportation they do not produce the economic maximum nd are therefore unreasonable. I The producing territory involved in this case is served with the ception of a few stations en the C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company, tirely by the Missouri Pacific and the Burlington systems. The average revenue per ton per mile from thirty-two cars of apples shipped in October, 1908, from Shubert to various points in the state was 18.45 mills and from nineteen cars shipped from Falls City 18.25 mills. average length of haul on these shipments were 196 miles m Falls City and 189 miles from Shubert. An analysis of the Burlington rates from Falls City to points on its lines shows an average rate per ton per mile of 18.5 mills clearly demonstrating that the above shipments from Shubert and Falls City are representative. average revenue per ton per mile of all roads operating thin the state on all freight, both C. L. and L. C.

Potatoes in this state move almost entirely under a commodity ate, while apples, pears and peaches move under class rates. A omparison of the rates under which the two commodities move iscloses as great a spread as that indicated by comparing the fore oing average rates per ton per mile on the two commodities, an&lt; n the long hauls the spread is much greater. While there was insufficient data submitted to determine accur tely the extent and trend of the empty car movement, the Commis ion is clearly of the opinion that during the period of the yea uring which fruit would move from southeastern Nebraska, the mpty car movement would be from the east to the west particu arly in eastern and central Nebraska. Under such conditions a owering of rates on any given commodity which would increase he westbound loading is admittedly good practice even if the rates n and of themselves were not compensatory. tThe record also presents comparisons of rates obtaining in other ates, which we do not deem necessary here to set out, but which gether with the reasons above set forth convince us that the isting rates in this state are unreasonable and should be lowered. !The application of a horizontal reduction would not afford a itisfactory solution to the present situation. On the Burlington oints Brownville and north take the Omaha rate basis, and point femaha and south and west take the St. Joseph basis, resulting in discrimination as high as five cents per hundredweight in the pro ucing territory. Any percentage reduction applied to existing tariffs would leave the same discrimination in effect. kin the opinion of the Commission, a mileage distance commodity riff affords the most satisfactory solution of the question and will adopted.

            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 153 of the fact that in the order promulgated on these findings shipment of peaches may be mixed with apples and pears, and inasmuch as the rate on peaches has been materially reduced, we are of th opinion that the raising of the minimum from 20,000 pounds to 24,000 pounds is a reasonable provision. We are, therefore, of th opinion and so find, that the minimum weight on shipments o straight or mixed carloads of apples, peaches or pears, should be 24,000 pounds. It was conceded by the producers and shippers of apples that the better grades which are packed in boxes or barrels should take a higher rate than the inferior and cheaper grades which are shipped in bulk. Pears packed in boxes, barrels or crates are accorded the same ting by the carriers as apples. t Peaches, packed in baskets, with solid or slatted tops, boxes crates, are generally both by the carriers and the commissions ted from one to two classes higher than apples or pears. We accordingly find: That the rates to be applied on straight or mixed carload shipments of apples and pears, packed in barrels boxes or crates on single line hauls should be 110'c of the foregoing &gt;ulk apple rate; that the rates to be applied on straight carloads of peaches packed in baskets, with solid or slatted tops, boxes or crates, should be 1301, of the bulk apple rate; that in mixed car oads containing peaches in packages, the 130',' rate shall apply on he. entire carload, and that when apples or pears in packages are mixed with shipments of bulk apples, the 110' t rate shall apply on the entire carload. A large portion of the fruit producing territory in southeastern Nebraska is served exclusively by the Missouri Pacific. Its northern erminus is Omaha and its western termini on two different branches jincoln and Crete. Joint hauls and joint rates are therefore essentia o handle traffic destined to points beyond. At present, with som xceptions, the practice is to charge the sum of the locals or singl ine hauls. kThe result of such practice is to place the producers and shippers im exclusive Missouri Pacific points at a distinct disadvantage th the producers and shippers from Burlington- points. tit is a generally accepted principle of rate-making that on joint uls a lower basis than the sum of the local or single line rates proper. kWe are of the opinion and so find that the charges on mixed straight carload shipments of apples, peaches or pears, passing er two or more lines of railroad within this state, shall not exceed </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT 80% of the sum of the local charges, above set forth, by the short line track connection junction point, for the distance each railroac hauls the car; provided, however, that when the application of the 80% rule would make the rate less than the continuous mileage rat&lt;? then the continuous mileage rate shall be the joint rate. The transfer charges on all such shipments shall be absorbed by the carriers interested in the haul, except at junction points where there is no direct track connections and it is necessary to deliver cars through an intermediate .carrier. In such cases, the actual cost o the intermediate switching service may be added to the througl charge. Complainants clearly demonstrated in their evidence that the conomie conditions attending the handling and disposition of their roduct required the right to stop cars in transit with the privilege f loading or unloading. The carriers themselves have recognize&lt; le principle and granted this privilege either for the purpose o oading or unloading under various conditions to the following com modities, to-wit: Agricultural implements, binding twine, cattle and sheep dip, melons, silos, stone ware, junk, bones, dressed poultry &gt;utter and eggs. We recognize that this privilege should be the exception, and should only be allowed in such cases as the economic conditions clearly require it. The shipment of apples, pears and peaches in carloads -come within this class and are entitled to this privilege. We are of the opinion and so find, that carload shipments o' pples, pears, or peaches, moving under the rates herein provided' may be stopped once in transit to finish loading and once in transit o partly unload at a charge of $5.00 per car for each stop. The tations where the car is stopped to finish loading or to partly nload must be directly intermediate between the original point of rigin, and the final destination of the shipment. ' It is contended by the carriers that the allowance of this pri vilege, will result in shippers holding cars, particularly for the pur poses of unloading, a considerable length of time, beyond the free time allowance of forty-eight hours, thereby contributing to a greate or less degree to car shortage, during periods of heavy traffic move ment, and that a greater rental or demurrage charge should be assessed when the stoppage in transit privilege is used, than the present demurrage charge of $1.00 per day. If additional rental charges or demurrages were applied by carriers to the other classes of traffic accorded the "stoppage in transit" privilege we would unhesitatingly apply the same to the traffic under consideration. Further, our refusal to fix an additional charge at this time shall </seg>

The privilege of storing in transit is not clearly provided in the existing tariffs for the commodities in question. It is conceded by the carriers that such privilege should be granted without extra charge. We are of the opinion and so find that storage in transit privi - leges on the commodities under consideration, for the period, and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth in its order, are just and reasonable and should be allowed. tWe further find that the provisions relating to transportation r caretaker, etc., with carload shipments as hereinafter set forth its order are just and reasonable.

Hall, Commissioner: Walter Johnson, of University Place, Nebraska, on January 11 912, filed an informal complaint against the Chicago, Burlington : Quincy Railroad Company, alleging that said defendant had made n overcharge on a shipment of one steam engine from Omaha to ,incoln, the waybill of the same being Burlington No. 12868, ant was dated December 27, 1911; that the said defendant had imposec a charge on said shipment of one and one-half times first class, while as claimed by the plaintiff herein the shipment should have moved at the first class rate. The Commission having been fully advised of the plaintiff' ontention, and that the defendant had declined, as shown by cor espondence, to make refund of the alleged overcharge, ordered th aid defendant to appear before it on Friday, March 8, 1912, a 0 o'clock a. in., to show cause why an order should not be issuec ommanding the said defendant to make refund to the plaintiff of th </seg>

On Friday, March 8, 1912, a hearing was held by the Com mission, at its offices in Lincoln, by Commissioners Winnett and Hall all parties being represented. At said hearing it developed that th ngine was mounted on skids, but was not crated, and most of the ireakable parts were removed and boxed, but two brass oil cups an&lt; our brass valves, which were detachable, were left on the engine unprotected. The Nebraska Classification No. 1 provides Gas and gasoline, not otherwise specified, including port able gasoline engines, boxed, or crated, or with light and easily breakable and detachable parts removed and boxed, or if attached protected by crating, shall be shipped as first class." kThe defendant cou'd not have received the shipment under the ove rule, as all of the breakable and detachable parts were not noved, nor were they boxed or crated. tRule 14 of the same classification provides that articles not &gt;xed or crated and fully protected are to be rated as not boxed 1 crated, and to bear the rate to be applied to the next higher assification. The defendant should not have received the shipment unti it was properly boxed or crated, or the breakable and detachable parts removed, but as the shipment was received, it would have to be classified under Rule 14 of the classification referred to, which would make the rate one and one-half times first class. The Commission therefore finds that the rate of one and one - half times first class was the rate that the defendant should have charged, and that the complaint should be dismissed.

            <seg id="p164">164 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Taylor, Commissioner: This is a matter covering the adequacy of the freight and passenger service over the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island railroad between Grand Island and Hastings. The original complaint was filed February 24, 1913. On July 8, 1913, Elmer E. Brown filed informal complaint No. 2926, alleging insufficiency of passenger service, and the two complaints have been joined. Frequent hear- ings and conferences have been held, and at the last conference held, November 10, 1913, the defendant company submitted a schedule designed to meet all the demands expressed* in the complaints and at the hearings referred to, this schedule being as follows: Lv.

            <seg id="p165">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 165 INFORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 2816 L. M. McCoy et al, Petitioners, vs. Chicago, Burlington A. Quincy Railroad Company, Respondent. ORDER Appearances: L. M. McCoy, for Petitioners. Byron Clark, for Respondent. Clarke, Chairman: The petition herein alleges that the petitioners are often delayec at the crossing of Main Street and respondent's tracks in Belmont Nebraska, and asks that respondent be required to construct a viaduct across its tracks at that point, and further that it be requirec o construct and maintain a side track on the east side of its main rack for the loading and unloading of cars. After due notice, a hearing was held at Belmont, at which al parties were present. Since the filing of the petition respondent has ontracted for and entered upon the construction of a side tracl or the loading and unloading of cars on the west side of its main racks. It was stipulated by petitioners that the construction o his track would satisfy their demands for a side track east of the main track, and that this portion of their petition might be dis - missed. Belmont is an unincorporated village of fifty inhabitants, situate n the respondent's line in Dawes County. At this point the rail oad runs through a deep ravine or canyon, the bottom of whicl las been filled in, and the natural level raised considerably to afford room and approaches for respondent's tracks and station acilities. If such work had not been done by the respondent, o public authority, the ravine would have been impassible for the ordinary vehicle. The approaches from the east and west to the station grounds are both heavy grades. There are no established public highways across respondent's tracks for several miles on either side of this point. The townsite of Belmont, including lands on the east and west f defendant's right-of-way, was platted subsequent to the building of the railroad. No streets were ever platted across defendant's ight-of-way, nor has any portion of the same been condemned for use as a public highway. The line of travel across the right-of-way t Belmont follows a course similar to the letter "U", with the base o the south. This crossing, however, has been used for over ten years, and possibly a public right has been acquired by prescription Petitioners do not propose to vacate or abandon the present ssing. Their purpose in demanding the viaduct in question is </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT to provide an easier, more convenient and safer crossing for the traffic, which is considerable, and which passes from the east to the west of defendant's right-of-way, and vice vcsa. No proof of any accidents was made, nor were any dangers other than those usually incident to a railroad grade crossing shown. Trains approach - ing from the north or south can be seen a reasonable distance from either the east or west approaches to the crossing. tThe main argument for the construction of the viaduct was the iat inconvenience placed upon the public by the more or less quent illegal overtime blocking of the crossing by defendant's trains. Prior to the hearing petitioners had never complained to the ailroad officials of these occurrences. It was admitted that train - men operating the trains were uniformly courteous in clearing the rossing when requested so to do, but that by reason of the length f the trains, and the danger in leaving a nervous team unattended ; was often inconvenient, and frequently impossible, to notify a rain crew to clear the crossing. It further appeared that frequently where the crew of a given train had cleared the crossing upon such equest, and before the traveler could get across the crossing woulc &gt;e blocked by another incoming train. The flagrant and frequent overtime blocking of this crossing to the great inconvenience of the public, was so clearly establishe( that the Commission would not hesitate to compel the construction of a viaduct, which in this instance would cost from $5,000.00 to $6,000.00, if it had the power so to do. The statutes fail to disclose any express power vested in the Commission to direct the construe tion of viaducts. tThe following portions only of the act, creating and defining powers of the Commission, appear relevant and material on the tion of the Commission's powers in such cases: (B) "Said Commission shall have the power to regulate the rates and services of, and to exercise the general control over, all railroads — ." (C) "Said Commission shall investigate any and all cases of alleged neglect or violation of the laws of the state by any railway company — or by the officers, agents or employes thereof, and take such action with reference thereto as may be provided herein, or under the laws of this state, providing for the regulation of railway companies — . (I) "Said Commission shall have power to examine into and inspect from time to time the condition of each railway or common carrier, its equipment and the manner of its conduct and management with regard to the public safety and con venience in the state; and if any part thereof is found in an unsafe and dangerous condition said Commission shall immed iately notify the railway company— whose duty it is to put the same in repair, which should be done by it within a reasonable time after receiving such notice, and if any railway or common carrier subject to the provisions of this act fails to perform this duty said Commission may enjoin and prevent it from running trains over the same while in such unsafe or dangerous con- dition." </seg>
            <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 167 Under Section 10 of the Act, the right to file a petition before he Commission, is to present one "complaining of anything done or omitted to be done by any railway company or common carrier, ubject to the provisions of the Act, or any of the laws of this state, elative to the control and regulation of railway companies or com - mon carriers under which said Commission has authority to act. In the absence of express statutory authority, the power of he Commission, if such exists, is by virtue of the words "to exercise a general control," as provided in subdivision (B) as above set orth. This general power, however, is limited by subdivision (C , n the following manner — "and take such action with reference hereto as may be provided herein, or under the laws of this state, providing for the regulation of railway companies." • * * * To the authorities of the large cities only has been expressly elegated the power to order the construction of viaducts, and they an only require the construction of a viaduct on a "public high - way" and "on or along such street under or over such tract." State ex rel. City of Lincoln v. C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co., 140 N. W. 147, 93 Nebr. As stated above, there is no public way across defendant's ight-of-way at this point, except the "U" shaped crossing above eferred to. It is apparent that even if the Commission was veste&lt; with the general power to order a viaduct constructed, the lega tatus and route of the crossing at this point is such that the Com mission could not predicate an order thereon under the principles aid down in the case of City of Lincoln v. C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co Supra. Section 110 of Chapter 78, of Compiled Statutes of 1911, pro - vides that— "Any railroad corporation, canal company, mill owner, or any person or persons who now own, or may hereafter own or operate, any railroad, canal, or ditch that crosses any public or private road shall make and keep in good repair good and sufficient crossings on all such roads, including all the grading, bridges, ditches, and culverts that may be necessary, within their right-of-way. (1887, Chap. 73.)" The supreme court of this state has held, in passing upon the requirements of this statute, that "it is the duty of a railroad com )any to make and keep in repair suitable crossings with approaches notwithstanding the highway was laid out after the road was built The public authorities are required to build that part of the high way within the right-of-way which they would have been requirec to make had the railroad not been constructed."

UThe conclusion necessarily follows, in view of the foregoing ate of facts, and the existing law, that the Commission is without jurisdiction in the premises, and that the complaint should be dismissed. The Commission, however, does not feel that it has done its full duty in merely passing upon its jurisdiction in the premises. The people of this community have been put to great inconvenience by more or less frequent illegal blocking of the crossing in question. They have been more than patient, and we are satisfied that if they would resort to the statutory remedy of having a fine of $10.00 to $100.00 imposed upon the respondent or its agents, upon every occasion where the crossing is blocked by the defendant for over ten minutes (Section 69 (c) and 69 (d), Compiled Statutes of 1911), the respondent would soon cease to obstruct the crossing, and in all probability would voluntarily construct the viaduct in question. The defendant company should not compel the complainants herein to resort to such procedure to secure the needed improvement. Its construction would not only obviate the liability of more or less frequent fines for illegal blocking of the crossing, but would minimize, if not foreclose, the possibility of damages arising out of the injuries to persons or property in the use of the present crossing. We unhesi - tatingly recommend to and urge the defendant company that it construct the viaduct in question at an early date.

            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 169 ri, Dawes County, Nebraska, and immediately upon the right - way of said railway company." I A public hearing was held by the Commission at the county urt house in Chadron on October 1, 1913, at which all parties terested were represented. Chadron is a division point on the C. &amp; N. W. Ry., where many rains are "broken up" and "made up." The yards are constructec n two main divisions. The east division, with about seven tracks begins just east of the said Main Avenue and extends to the east along and north of the depot eating house and other office build - ngs of the said defendant. The west division is constructed o many tracks, which begins just west of the said street and extends o .the west. The two divisions of the yards are connected by two main tracks, parallel and adjacent to each other, which cross sai&lt; treet over which all trains pass, and over which the greater par of the switching traffic moves in "breaking up" and "making up' rains, between the two divisions of the yards. The result is tha he traffic over the two tracks at this point is very heavy, am hereby dangerous to all traffic moving along said street and across aid tracks. It developed at the hearing that an industry track of the said defendant company crosses said street 180 feet north of the other two tracks just referred to, but that said track is used for industry purposes only, and not for the general traffic of the road. LThe legislature enactment made and provided in such cases as follows: "Chapter 224, Laws of Nebraska, 1913, (House Roll No. 172). An Act to protect the general public at Railroad Cross- ings. Be it enacted by the people of the State of Nebraska: Section 1. (Railroads: Gates at Road Crossings)." "That all railroad companies operating their several lines of tracks in the State of Nebraska passing through any city, town or village of under 5,000 inhabitants at any street or public crossing where three or more railroad tracks, either main lines, side tracks or spurs, pass over such street or public crossing, shall, whenever the Railway Commission shall so order, main - tain gates in good repair, and keep a man to operate them from 7 o'clock a. m. to 8 p. m. of each day." One set of gates, including all three tracks above referred to would be impractical because of the distance between the industr rack and the other two, in that traffic would be delayed to a ver reat extent if a gate were dropped north of the industry trac while cars were passing over the street on either of the south tracks ilso it would be possible for teams from the north to cross th ndustry track, and before they would have time to reach and cross he two south tracks, find that the gates had been dropped and tha hey were enclosed between the industry track and the two mai racks. The Commission is of the opinion that this would be danger ous and impractical. </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT !The Commission is of the opinion that the three tracks above ferred to do not constitute "three" tracks within a reasonable terpretation of the above statute, because the only practical way operate gates would be to construct the gates north and south id adjacent to the two main tracks. This, however, would inclose ily two tracks, and the statute specifically says "three or more." SThe Commission is of the opinion, however, that the crossing a dangerous one, and that some provision should be made to rther protect those crossing the track, at this point. The Commis - in is also of the opinion that the most practical way of protecting e public at said crossing is to station a flagman there, that the iblic may be warned as to approaching danger. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission that the said Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company locate a flagman at the intersection of its main line ol road with Main Avenue, in the city of Chadron, Dawes County, Nebraska, not later than thirty days from the date of this order Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 18th day of October, 1913.

Taylor, Commissioner: The applicant herein, operating a telephone exchange at Lexing- En, Nebraska, asks for authority to file a new schedule of rates, ntingent upon the reconstruction of its plant at that place and e installation of a metallic circuit system. The rates now in force, based on grounded circuit service, are as follows: Individual line, business $2.00 per month Individual line, residence 1.25 per month Farm line 1.50 per month Extension sets, business 1.00 per month Extension sets, residence 50 per month Extra charge for unlimited service to farm lines business 50 per month Extra charge for unlimited service to farm lines, residence 25Jper month </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 171 The only change proposed in the new schedule is the addition of rates for metallic circuit service, these rates being as follows: Business, one-party metallic circuit $2.50 per month Business, two-party metallic circuit 2.00 per month Residence, one-party metallic circuit 1.50 per month Residence, two-party metallic circuit 1.25 per month Above rates are to cover unlimited service to farm lines. While the plant has been completely reconstructed, it is pro- ted to continue the grounded circuit service to those who do not ire to avail themselves of the metallic circuit service, the ratea to remain the same as at present. This application has been pending for over a year, having been filed on June 13, 1912. A hearing was held by the Commission at Lexington on July 24, 1912, at which time representatives of the city of Lexington raised the question of the jurisdiction of the Commis - sion on the ground of an existing franchise that fixes the rates to be charged by the company. This matter was taken under advisement by the Commission, and on October 28, 1912, an order was entered overruling "the objection. A second hearing was held at Lexington on May 27, 1913. The final order has been suspended pending the completion of the new plant and the submission of data connected with such construction. An analysis of the new schedule shows that there will be no substantial change in the rates, even for metallic circuit service. At present all business telephones must pay a flat charge of fifty tnts per month for unlimited service with farm lines, and residence bscribers must pay a flat charge of twenty-five cents per month. for the same service, or, in lieu thereof, both classes of subscribers Eust pay a toll charge of fifteen cents per message for this service, f the 367 business and residence subscribers on the exchange at the me of the filing of this application, twenty-five business men and thirty-two residence subscribers paid the flat rate, while the re- mainder paid the toll charge of fifteen cents whenever they desired to communicate with the farm subscribers. Under the rates for metallic service, connection with the farm lines is included and there will be no extra charge for that service. To those who have been paying the flat rate, therefore, there will be no increase, and the remainder will be relieved of the toll charge of fifteen cents. The metallic circuit service will, without doubt, be a great improvement over the service given at the present time. It will be noted, more - over, that under the present schedule there is no provision for party ine telephones. Under the new schedule a business man who does not care to pay the increased rate has the alternative of taking a two-party service at the same rate he is now paying. This applies also to the subscriber now on an individual residence line. It is altogether probable that many will avail themselves of the two-party service. While the comparison of the new schedule with the old shows </seg>
            <seg id="p172">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT 172 that there will be no material increase, it is worth while at this time to determine whether the rates are reasonable per »e. This question involves three main factors, viz., the value of the plant devoted to public use, the expense connected with the operation ol the plant, and the rate of return to be allowed on the capital act - ually invested. In the course of its regular duties the engineering department of the Commission made a valuation of the applicant's plant at Lexington. This valuation was supp'emented by a later and more thorough investigation, subsequent to the filing of this application, personal inspection of the property being made by Mr. E. J Ates, who was accompanied and assisted on the final trip by Mayor . J. Nisley, of the city of Lexington. The reproduction new value f the plant as of July 1, 1912, was $66,688.10, and the present o epreciated value, $50,406.87. It was subsequent to this date tha le company began the work of converting its plant from a grounde&lt; rcuit system into a metallic circuit system, and the final figure ' the department, which include all of the new construction, ar as follows: Reproduction new value, $75,861.53; depreciated or resent value, $60,241.46. These figures include none of the tol troperty used in connection with the Lexington exchange, and from iem has been deducted all of the property of the old plant tha ill not be in actual use or necessary to the natural development o ie plant. In addition to the studies made by the engineering departmen ie Commission's accountants, Messrs. Powell and Wettling, made n exhaustive examination of the books of the company.

L tuart for $36,500 in June, 1909, the accountants traced all the dditions and betterments made to the same until April 30, 1913 t the same time deducting all plant displaced during this proces reconstruction. The net value of plant in service on the latte ate was found to be $57,803.14. The work of converting the plan to a metallic system is being done under an estimate known as o. 3623. While the work under this estimate has been practically ompleted, the amount has not yet been spread upon the books am ie actual expenditures were therefore not available. Experience hows, however, that actual cost of work performed und*er estimate ill, as a rule, exceed the estimates by amounts varying from 5 to )%. Moreover, estimate 3623 includes none of the general "over lead" expenses. It is safe to assume, therefore, that the figures n this estimate can be accepted as conservative. Adding the amoun f this estimate, $22,781.67, to the value of the plant on April 30 913, shows a total book value of $69,612.57. From this should be educted, however, the value of the toll property, which is founc o be $2,971.06, thus leaving a net book value as of the present date $66,641.51. After including the overhead charges alluded to am lowing for the overrun on the estimate, it is fair to assume that </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 173 the total book value of the plant will be between $70,000 and $75,000. For the purpose of this case, however, we shall accept the figure of $66,641.51 as the basis for determining the reasonable - ness of the rates proposed. The applicant submitted exhibits showing in detail its receipts nd expenditures. These have not only been thoroughly analyzed &gt;y the accounting department, but further studies of the records oi le Company have been made to determine their accuracy. From lese it is found that the total direct operating expense, including ommercial, traffic, general, taxes and rights and privileges for the ear ending June 1, 1913, was $6,557.70, on a basis of 680 sub cribers' stations in service. From this should be deducted the xpense of operating the toll plant, which is in this case found to &gt;e $1,441.00, leaving the direct operating expenses of the exchange lant proper at $5,116.70, or $7.52 per subscriber's station pe nnum. In this connection, it might be added that since the sub mission of these figures the county board of Dawson county, in hich the city of Lexington is located, has increased the valuation I applicants property to $67,000, this being the reproduction new alue as submitted by the Commission's engineer at the time of the tearing on May 27, 1913. This practically doubles the assessed alue of applicant's property, and will increase his personal taxes n the same proportion. The amount of personal taxes paid in 912 and accounted for in the foregoing figures was $357.43. This will be increased to at least $700.00 hereafter, and will necessarily &gt;ecome a part of the operating expenses. The above figures include nothing for maintenance or deprecia ion. Studies made by the accountants show that in 1911 there was xpended for maintenance $2,613.43, and that repairs and replace ments charged to depreciation amounted to $5,473.24. In 1912 the mount expended for maintenance was $2,136.62, and for deprecia ion $5,473.24. On a valuation of $66,658 the expenditure for main enance would average 3.56% (or the two years and the depreciation .21% for the same period, or a total of ll.TT% for both. These igures are regarded by the Commission as abnormal, for the reason hat during a period of reconstruction it is practically impossibl o differentiate between the expenditures for maintenance, new con truction, repairs and replacements. For the purposes of this cue lowever, it is unnecessary to fix upon a definite allowance for eacl purpose, but assuming that d% for both maintenance and deprecia ion would be reasonable, we find that on a basis of $66,641.51 th necessary allowance for this purpose would be $5,997.73, or $8.82 per station per annum. While the Commission has never definitely determined what the rate of return on the investment should be for telephone companies it found in the rate case of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. Application No. 1637, that 7% was not unreasonable. Its con elusions with regard to this matter are fully set forth in the opinion </seg>
            <seg id="p174">174 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT accompanying the order in that case, and need not be repeated here. A rate of 7% is not unreasonable, however, and will be applied in this case, the charge against the revenues on that basis being $4,664.90, or $6.86 per station. Summarizing the above we have the following: Direct operating expense $6,557.70 T__ i.n . _j.T i a t i r\r\ Less toll operating expense 1,441.00 Per Sub. Sta. $5,116.70 $7.52 Maintenance and depreciation 5,997.73 8.82 Return on investment 4,664.90 6.86 Total charges against revenue $15,779.33 $23.20 The total revenue on the present rates for the year 1912, exclus- sive of toll, was $10,664.50, or an average of $15.68 per subscriber's station. As above shown, the total charges against revenue were r 5,779. 33. The deficit in 1912, therefore, was $5,114.83. It is impossible, of course, to forecast exactly what the results of a rate readjustment will be in any case because of the changing of subscribers from one class of service to another.. For that reason it is difficult to tell definitely just what the revenue at Lexington will be under the proposed rates, although it is possible to make forecast that will approximate the result. The applicant submits an estimate of the revenue which is based on experience covering wide range of conditions, and the Commission is convinced that it is as nearly accurate as any that could be worked out. It is submitted herewith: Stations Rate Annual Revenue Individual business 75 $30.00 $2,250.00 Individual business 2 30.00 60.00 Two-party business 25 24.00 600.00 Extension business 9 12.00 108.00 Extension residence 3 6.00 18.00 Individual residence 100 18.00 1,800.00 Two-party residence 177 15.00 2,655.00 Individual residence (employees) .... 4 12.00 48.00 inuiviuuai icoiucutc iiijjuj y ceo/ .... *% x^.v\i tu*vv Farm line 255 18.00 4,590.00 Directory advertising, added mileage, etc 250.00 Total 650 $12,379.00 It will be seen that on this basis the proposed rates will add but $1,714.50 to the annual revenue, the increase being still insuffi- cient to bring the income up to the amount needed for operating expenses, maintenance and depreciation and return on the invest- ment. The deficit will amount to $3,400.33, or $5.00 per subscriber's station. If the exchange develops, as the company expects, this deficit should eventually be overcome. The development at Lex- ington at present is low, and there is room for considerable growth. The town has a population, according to the last census, of 2,059, and yet has less than 700 telephones. Other towns of the same size have exhanges of from 800 to 1,000 subscribers. The reconstruction </seg>
            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 175 of the plant and its conversion into a metallic circuit exchange should result in a greatly improved service. The rates proposed are not only reasonable as viewed from the standpoint of the subscriber, as has been shown in the foregoing analysis, but they are on a par with the rates of other exchanges in the state where the same claas of service is provided. They are such rates as should permit of the development of the business to a normal condition. With the improved service and a schedule of rates as reasonable as these are shown to be, the prediction of the company that the list of sub- scribers will reach 900 in 1916 appears to be conservative. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Nebraska Telephone Company, of Lexington, Nebraska, be, and the same hereby is, authorized to amend its present schedule of rates so as to read as follows: Individual line business, metallic circuit $30.00 per yeir Two-party line business, metallic circuit 24.00 per yew Individual line residence, metallic circuit 18.00 per year Two-party line residence, metallic circuit 15.00 per year Individual line business, grounded circuit 24.00 per yeir Individual line residence, grounded circuit 15.00 per year Farm line 18.00 per year Additional charge outside inner radius where there is an existing pole line, for each quarter mile, f 5.00 1 pty. metallic circuit \ 3.00 2 pty.

The cancellation of the said rule would mean a material increase in freight rates on articles heretofore returned under the rule, am before such increase in rates should be permitted, the applicant should show, to the satisfaction of the Commission, that the presen rates are not remunerative. This, however, was not shown in any particular by the carriers. For this reason, the application should b denied, but the testimony introduced by the carriers tends to show that the rule has led to many abuses, and the Commission, being fully advised in the premises, is of the opinion that the said rule should be modified to read as follows: Shipment* Returned "Shipments, whole or in part (except live stock and excep as otherwise specifically provided in individual tariffs), whic have paid full tariff rates, may be returned for repairs, or on account of being damaged, defective or spoiled, to the shippe at original point of origin from the original point of destina tion, return movement to be via the route and line upon whici the out shipment moved, at one-half of the tariff rates applyin in the direction of the first movement; provided, that sai( </seg>

Hall, Commissioner: This case came on for hearing upon the petition of said com- pany on January 10, 1913, for authority to increase its business phone rates fifty cents per month, and to make an additional charge of twenty-five cents per month for all desk phones. In connection with these proceedings a valuation of the tele- phone property of the said company was made by the engineers of this Commission, and a study in detail was made by U. G.

It appears that the owner and manager has been very careful to keep the cash account correctly, the plan being to charge the cash account with all money received from any source whatsoever, and to credit the cash account with all money paid out. For the purpose of showing the earnings and expenses of the said company, Mr. Powell has taken the period from January 1, 1911, to January 1, 1912, and has prepared the following table Earnings: Rental, toll and switching as per cash received $4,202.90 Rental and toll accounts receivable as per ledger 537.75 Total earnings $4,740.65 Deductions from Earnings Tolls paid Neb.

For the purpose of arriving at the amount of depreciable prop- erty, and the amount of property on which rates may be based, the plant value has been reduced by reason of depreciation from $18,818.79 to $13,624.78, present depreciated value. Allowing 8% for current maintenance and deferred depreciation. the normal amount per year is $1,328.00. The amount paid out for these items for the year was $1,159.81, which leaves $168.19 to be deducted from the net income of $982.74, said amount to be placed in the depreciation reserve fund, which leaves a net balance for dividends of $814.65, or 6% on the present value of $13,624.78. The application contemplates an advance of fifty cents per month, or $6.00 per annum, on all business phones only, which was at the end of the calendar year 1911, thirty-eight. This would increase the earnings $228.00 per year. This amount, added to the </seg>

The Commission further finds that a part of the subscribers are furnishing their own phones. The company should pay the subscriber for such phones. The Commission also finds that the company is not keeping a, proper system of books, and that the rates applied for are not unreasonable, and the advance as prayec for should be granted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the said company shal open up a set of double entry books, as prescribed by the Com mission, on the first day of April, 1913, and that the amount enterec on said books as a basis on which the books shall be kept, shal be $13,624.78. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the said company shall buy all phones that are owned by the subscribers, at a price to be agreed upon by both parties, and should the parties not agree, then and in that case the matter shall be referred to this Commission.

"Summarizing, a monthly statement of the operation of said properties is as follows: "Your petitioner further shows the Commission that the proposed consolidation of its exchanges in said district, wi result in the discontinuance on the part of its patrons, of large number of duplicate telephones now in service, and tha a large number of such telephones have already been discon tinued, anticipating the consolidations, and that the resul thereof is a loss of revenue to the Company in the sum of fiv thousand forty dollars ($5,040.00) per month, which woulc decrease, by that amount, the already large deficit in the reve - nues of the Company. "Your petitioner further shows the Commission that th consolidation of said exchanges, and the discontinuance of saic duplicate telephones, will effect large savings to the users thereo and that by the consolidation of said exchanges, the genera efficiency of the service, and the extent thereof, will be greatl increased: that all subscribers will receive universal toll servic to all points reached by telephone: that automatic subscribers in Lincoln will have the extent of their service increased mor than fifty per cent and that former manual, or so-called Be Operating expenses per month $21,148.75 Monthly reserve for depreciation figured at 6 ' ", per annum 12,156.00 Eight per cent interest on investment 16,484.34 Total $49,789.09 Present monthly revenue $29,564.00 Present actual monthly deficit $20,225.09 </seg>

Attached to said schedule is a statement of revenue yielded by the present rates, and the amount which would be yielded by increase in the rates at the different prices indicated on the schedule. "Your petitioner further shows the Commission that the citizens of Lincoln and its patrons are demanding the immediate consolidation of its exchanges, and that it is necessary to pro - ceed immediately with the consolidation thereof, and therefore prays for an order permitting the consolidation of said exchanges, and a further order establishing temporary or trial rates to be charged for service to the consolidated exchanges, and that an order be made fixing the time for which said trial rates shall remain in effect and, after the expiration of said time, ordering a further hearing for the purpose of determining a just and adequate rate to be charged for the different classes of service furnished by the Company." LA hearing on the application was set for January 3, 1913, t the office of the Commission. Applications and petitions were filed by the city of Lincoln tie city of Havelock, The United Lancaster County Farmers' Club Citizens of University Place and patrons of the company, request be Commission to continue the time for hearing on the application f the Company, so far as it related to any increase in rates, fo period of ninety days, and in support of same submitted many rguments, of which the following are alone worthy of consideration o-wit: (1) That any increase in rates would be unjust until a hysical valuation of applicant's property devoted to the service in uestion had been determined; (2) that the patron; of the company ndividually or through their proper municipal authorities, have no lad sufficient time and opportunity to investigate the truth of the negations and statements set forth in the application, or the cor ectness of the figures as to the income derived under present rates nd the cost of service; (3) that they have «ot had sufficient time o investigate the correctness of the reports made by the Com mission's engineers on the valuation of applicant's property herein nvolved, and the report made by the Commission's accountants n revenues and expenses of the applicant, etc., or to secure evidence o show wherein the same are incorrect, if errors exist; (4) that the ity of Lincoln desires and intends to have a physical valuation made &gt;y its own experts of the physical property of applicant involve* n this application; that it proposes to offer the testimony of its xperts, and that it cannot safely proceed to a trial of this cause ntil it has obtained said testimony and valuation. </seg>

I The report of the Commission's engineers as to the complete uation of the properties involved in this case is now in the pos - don of the Commission. I The Commission's accountants have, since the organization of Commission, been analyzing and investigating the reports of all •phone companies in this state and have during the past year, ■suant to the directions of the Commission, which saw impending problems which are now presented, almost continuously and oily devoted their entire time to a most exhaustive and painstak - investigation of the cost of property, revenues, and expenses, disclosed by all the books, accounts, vouchers, etc., of the Ne - iska Telephone Company, covering a period of operation of thir - n years, and a like investigation covering the operations of the slicant since its organization, and the result of their labors and ■ data thereby obtained is now at the disposal of the Commission i the public. While the Commission does not attribute to its engineers and xperts any degree of infallibility uncommon to other experts in teir professions, yet we do hold that the fact that their opinions nd studies worked into concrete form are eagerly sought by com - issions and experts engaged in like labors in neighboring and distant ates; that the fact that the loan of their time and services has been quested of this Commission by not less than' four other state ommissions, demonstrates that they are men whose reports and pinions on matters relating to their respective callings are entitled o full credence, at least at the hands of this Commission. This Commission was created by the people of this state for the express purpose of safeguarding the public interests, in matters relating to the regulation of rates and service of common carriers. It has at all times and is now thoroughly imbued with the accepted doctrine that, where conflicting interests arise between the common </seg>

It may seem uncalled for on the part of the Commission to ccord the time and space to the statements just preceding, but the motions and petitions filed herein, and statements made in the public ress, disclose such a misconception, on the part of those appearing n this matter, of the Commission's attitude and its means of dealing dvisedly with the problems herein presented, that the Commission eems it not only proper but necessary, to the end that the great ody politic of this state, who created this Commission and are incerely anxious that it succeed in its task of regulation, may know he truth. The relief prayed for by the telephone company at this time is ot a final determination by the Commission of a schedule of rates ufficient to pay operating expenses, and provide for an adequate epreciation charge, and reasonable return on the value of the prop - rty, but is, in substance only, such an increase in rates appor - loned among its various classes of subscribers on the exchange when onsolidated as is sufficient to equalize the revenue received from uplicate telephones prior to consolidation, which will be lost upon he completed consolidation, aggregating (as alleged by applicant he sum of $5,040.00 per month, and that such rates shall remain n effect until such time only as the Commission shall deem neces ary and sufficient for the Commission to finally determine a jus nd adequate schedule of rates to be charged by the company. The applicant insists that the effecting of the consolidation, and the resulting loss in revenue as above alleged, together with an increased operating cost of approximately $1,000.00 per month caused by an increased wage scale, effective January 1, 1913), will result in an injury to its business, and constitutes an emergency ufficient to require the exercise of the Commission's powers under Section (6) of the Commission Act, which is as follows: "EMERGENCY RATES. Nothing in the foregoing section shall be construed to prevent said Commission from having the power, when deemed by it necessary, to prevent interstate rate wars and injury to the business of the citizens of the state, railway companies or common carriers, or in case of any other emergency to be judged by said Commission, and it shall be the duty of said Commission, to temporarily order, amend o suspend any existing freight rates, tariffs, schedules, orders am circulars of any railway company or common carrier, or par thereof, in this state, and to fix freight rates where none exist which said emergency rate or rates shall apply to any one o more or all railway companies or common carriers in this state and shall take effect at such time and remain in force sue length of time as may be prescribed by said Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p188">188 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT provided, that said emergency rates, tariffs, schedules, orders and circulars shall be subject to review upon a hearing before said Commission and courts of competent jurisdiction in this state, as herein provided for other schedules of rates fixed by said Commission." If it is true, as alleged in applicant's petition, that its presen evenues are insufficient to pay its operating expenses and provide or a proper depreciation charge, exclusive of a fair return on the value of the property, that these revenues will be further diminishec as a result of the consolidation to the extent of $5,040.00 per montl and that its expenses will be increased in the amount of $1,000.00 per month by reason of the increased wage scale, no fair-minde&lt; man can reasonably deny that to compel the company to continue ts operations under the present schedule of rates will result in an njury to its business and constitute an emergency, entitling the applicant to some measure of relief at the hands of the Commission pending its final determination. iThe truth or falsity of the allegations contained in applicant's itition should clearly appear from the investigation made by the ommission's experts. If no such investigation had been made id the Commission were not in a position to verify or disprove, any id all proof to be submitted by applicant in support of its allega - sn, there could be no question that a continuance should be granted. But having made such investigation, and being convinced tha is fully prepared to determine the truth or falsity of, and giv roper weight to, any evidence the applicant may offer fh suppor I its petition, is it just or right that an immediate hearing b enied the applicant, because forsooth, the public, before it is advisee r the results of the investigation made by its own experts (for th ommission's experts are as much the experts of the public as thoug ley had been appointed directly by the municipal authorities o le cities affected, or by the people themselves), and before thes xperts have had ample and complete opportunity to fully disclos le nature and extent of their investigation, the facts and dat hich they have collected and upon which they base their con usions, is distrustful that perchance its experts have erred more o ess in their investigation, and it therefore desires to test and chec te correctness of their investigation by means of an additiona nvestigation conducted by experts employed solely for that purpose The Commission is unanimously of the opinion that the pendin motion for a continuance at this time is premature and should no &gt;e granted. To do so would deprive the applicant of a measur of relief to which it may prove itself to be justly entitled, and amoun o an absolutely false admission on the part of the Commission tha t is not safeguarding the interests of the public, and that the publi must protect themselves; and to discredit, before they have had an opportunity to be heard, its own experts, whose ability ' andfeffi iency, as already set forth, has been recognized and admitted by </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 189 tublic authorities and experts elsewhere engaged in the regulation f common carriers. If, upon the conclusion of the taking of the testimony, there shall be made to appear any reasonable ground for doubt as to the sufficiency or correctness of any evidence material to the proper and just determination of the application, the Commission will, of its own motion, continue the hearing until such time as will give ample opportunity to secure and produce any material evidence. For reasons unnecessary to elucidate, we deem it fitting to direct attention of all parties interested in this matter to the following portion of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin: "Patience on the part of the public and on the part of the carriers, and time, will be necessary. The notion that Commis sions of this kind should be closely restricted by the courts is not conducive to the best results. Justice dwells with u as with the fathers. It is not exclusively the attribute of any office or class. It responds more readily to confidence than to criticism, and there is no reason why the Railroad Commission of this state should not develop and establish a system of rule and precedents as wise and beneficent within their sphere o action as those established by the early common law judges.'

ORDER This matter comes on to be heard on the petition of the appli - cant herein for an increase of rates for telephone service within the Lincoln zone, and the motions filed herein by the cities of Lincoln, Havelock and University Place that the application be denied and dismissed. A large amount of evidence has been submitted by the applicant, pplemented by careful and exhaustive investigations made by the </seg>
            <seg id="p190">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Commission's accountants and engineers, the results of which were introduced in evidence, and are before the Commission. tThe Commission, upon consideration of the evidence and the ments of counsel, is of the opinion that under the facts as dis - id by the evidence, the applicant is clearly entitled to some meas - of relief. The Commission is further of the opinion that no increase should be allowed until upon the actual cutover and consolidation of the two plants into one (which it is advised will be effected February 22, 1913), it is demonstrated that the service, which at present ii more or less unsatisfactory, will be efficient and satis - factory. Commission, in order that it may more accurately and tly determine the measure of relief to which the applicant may entitled, desires to make further investigation and analysis of value of the consolidated plant devoted to the public use, and the operating expenses and revenues accruing upon consolidation. The Commission therefore finds that the foregoing motions should be overruled, and that further hearing on the application should be continued until Tuesday, March 18, at 9:00 o'clock a. m., at which time the Commission will receive and hear any material and competent evidence offered by remonstrators herein. Such hearing will, upon good and sufficient cause therefor being shown, be continued for such period as the Commission deems just and proper. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motions filed herein by the cities of Lincoln, Havelock and University Place be, and the same are, hereby overruled, and that this application be set for further hearing at the office of the Commission on Tuesday, March 18, at 9:00 o'clock a. m. and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 11th day of ruary, 1913.

The Citizens and Telephone Users of Lincoln W. M. Morning, W. H. England, George A. Adams, Petrus Peterson and W. F. Kelley. Syllabus: Upon the application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - graph Company for an increase in rates, following a consolida tion of automatic and manual plants in the so-called Lincoln zone, the Commission found the reproduction value of the prop - erty devoted to the use of the exchange proper within the zone after eliminating all duplications and toll property jointly used at $1,785,907.74, and its depreciated present value, $1,331,418.73 After continued hearings and upon a careful analysis of the direct operating cost of the company, and allowing 9 % on the reproduction value to cover current repairs, realized and deferrec depreciation, and a 7% return on the depreciated present value of the property, a deficit of $71,851.14 is found to exist and a schedule of increased rates authorized. Reproduction Value: As a basis for rate regulation, where the books do not clearly and fully show costs, eliminating plant abandoned, in the past, and where the present condition enables the company to render efficient service, the reproduction new value will be adopted, with such modifications as may seem just and proper in each individual case for basing rates. Such value when found will become the basis or starting point for future regulation, by adding thereto the additions and better - ments and deducting plant abandoned or replaced thereafter. </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Present Value: As a basis for reasonable rate of return on property devoted to the public use, the present depreciated value, modi - fied as circumstances in each instance may demand, will be used and such value will be adopted for that purpose under con - ditions named, which necessitate the use of the reproduction value of property. Overhead Charge*: Where, as in this case, the units which for the basis of the valuation represent the bare cost of materi and direct labor charges only, without supervision, engineerin or contractor's profits, an amount for engineering, organizatio interest during construction and contingencies, equaling 17.2 of the gross reproduction value found, is held to be reasonab and well within the averages allowed by other commission and regulating bodies. It is below the percentage calculate by many eminent engineers on this class of utility. Inasmuc as the percentage allowed herein is the result of the calculatio of different percentages on the component parts of the plan this cannot be concluded to be the definite or fixed percental that will be allowed in all cases, but each case will need separa investigation and the per cent, will necessarily differ with th varying ratio of the component parts of the whole plant. Th percentage includes no allowance whatever for cost of financin contractor's profit or discount on sale of securities. Franchise or Good, Will: This Commission holds that these values have no place in the consideration of cases of this nature, or that the public should be expected to pay returns on values for such considerations where actual costs are not shown. Working Capital: The Commission holds that in this class of utility, considering the size of the plant and other circumstances, an allowance, amounting to practically 6% of the reproduction new value, would be reasonable, although in this case the Com - mission's allowance for this is only to the extent of the stores and supplies on hand and no consideration is given to the neces - sary amount which should be allowed for bills receivable, bank balances, etc. Going Concern Value: The Commission does not in this case allow going concern value, but does not mean to be understood as refusing to recognize such values, particularly when they can be definitely shown to exist. Advance Construction: Construction in excess of immediate present needs of a telephone property, where it may be reasonably required to meet future growth and development, is recognized as proper and economical by regulating authorities throughout the country. The advance construction in the property under consideration found to be not excessive nor unreasonable. Depreciation and Maintenance: The Commission recognizes that in most of the cases that have come to its notice, 6% has been allowed for depreciation above current maintenance, and that under certain conditions this percentage is reasonable; however, it does not definitely adopt this per cent., but feeling that depreciation and maintenance are interdependent, holds that 9%, to cover both, will be a fair allowance in this case. Operating Expenses: The calculations used for basing the operating costs of the future exclude all abnormal conditions which it is claimed existed in the past, and also exclude liberal allowance for cost of toll operation, so that the Commission feels, that the figures adopted express the minimum allowance for direct operat - ing charge. </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 193 Rate of Return :Under the circumstances and conditions in this case, the Commission holds that an allowance of 7% for rate of return, calculated on the depreciated present value, is reason- able. Monthly Reports: The Commission, for the purpose of keeping fully advised of the operation of the plant under the order herein, requires the company to submit monthly reports, dis - closing in full detail the revenue by classification, the cost of operation, maintenance and depreciation, as well as the condition of the service. On December 16, 1912, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company filed with the Nebraska State Railway Commisson its application for permission to consolidate the exchanges in the Lincoln district, and requested an order establishing certain increased tem - porary rates. The engineering department had previously in the course of its uties made a complete and careful investigation, as of July 1, 1912, f the various exchanges proposed to be consolidated, and upon the ling of the application proceeded at once to gather the further ata necessary to bring the valuations to date. The accounting epartment began at once an investigation of the books and accounts f the company, beginning with its inception, and also those of its )redecessors, the Lincoln Telephone Company and the Western "elephone Company, as well as to bring down to date the examina - on of the books of the Nebraska Telephone Company, which during he year 1912 had been made up to December 31, 1911, this latter xtension of the examination being particularly as to the Lincoln xchange. The examination of the engineering and accounting departments »oth were further continued and extended during the hearings which were begun on January 3d and continued from time to time to April 25, resulting in a full and complete exposition of the affairs f the plants, both as to values, operating revenues and expenses ost of maintenance and depreciation, as well as the service. Exten ive and minute details regarding all these matters were brough ut in the reports and exhibits of the Commission's engineering an&lt; ccounting departments, as well as the exhibits of the petitioner nd fully explained in the testimony, which was voluminous, and in he taking of which every party at interest, as well as the genera mblic, was given full opportunity to cross-examine witnesses am produce such evidence as they might consider material to the case n order that the Commission and the public might be assured tha he investigation covered all essential elements necessary to a correc olution on the proper bases and well considered premises, the Com mission called in outside talent, of high standing and unquesttonec ability, to check and verify the valuations and theories of ou ngineering department. This same valuation was subsequently subjected to further and more searching investigation by the engineers employed by the city 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT I Lincoln, who made to a great extent the valuation both as to production new and depreciated present value, independently o e other two valuations referred to. During the course of the hear ga and since, a far-reaching investigation has been made with jard to the service, covering a large volume of tests sufficient to tisfy the Commission that the result thereof gave a proper basis r determining general averages and percentages. At various times during the hearing the controversy became uite acrimonious, and the Commission cannot help but fee) that be enmities apparently engendered were largely begotten of the mutual mistrusts and misunderstandings, on the part of the public much of which it was developed was by reason of the suspicion on he part of some that much of the company's capitalization was ctitious, and that the corporation was demanding of the public eturns on watered stock, and to meet such demand was asking ates that were unconscionable. It can be no longer seriously doubted that with regulation th widest and most efficient telephone service, as well as the lowes ates, are possible only when one operating company has the entir business of a community or territory. It is a waste of capital and a disadvantage to the public to have two such corporations compet ng with each other for the telephone business, encumbering th treets with two sets of poles and wire, forcing a large proportion of the population to pay for both services and the rest to be satisfie&lt; with restricted service in that they can only reach the one set o subscribers. For a long time prior to the taking over of the Nebraska Tele - phone Company's plants in the Lincoln zone by the Lincoln Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph Company, the public were dissatisfied by th inconveniences caused by the dual system, as well as the consequen restriction" of the service, and all who were forced to subscribe am pay for two telephones were complaining of the extra cost imposec by the necessity therefor. On August 22, 1912, the city of Lincoln, by its attorney o &gt;ehalf of the citizens, made formal complaint and prayed the Com mission for an order commanding the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegrap Company to immediately make physical connection of the two sys - ems, to the end that every subscriber should have the full am unrestricted use of both systems, and further prayed that unless uch order, if given, were complied with promptly, the company b prohibited from making any charge or collecting any rental from ubscribers to the manual system.

Value. Under the law, the engineering department of this Commission made a full, painstaking and complete valuation of all the physica properties of the telephone companies and their various exchanges omprising the plant as consolidated and under consideration in this tearing as of July 1, 1912, and since have, by making further investi ation, inventoried all the additions and betterments from July 1 912, down to date. The values for each of the component parts f the Lincoln zone prior to the consolidation were made up sepa ately and then assembled, eliminating whatever of plant or appa atus became useless by reason of the consolidation, except only uch part of the conduits, cables and transmission lines and other pparatus which would form a reasonable building in advance o mmediate needs. From a careful study of the various parts of the ilant, and an actual estimation by examination and determination f the age, the department also ascertained the present depreciatec value of the whole. In the result of these values the Commission has the utmos confidence, and this confidence was not shaken, but rather strength ned, by the reports brought in on behalf of the city, who cause&lt; valuation to be made by an eminent engineering firm, whose ndings confirmed the values submitted by the Commission's en ineers, although arrived at by different methods. The presen epreciated value found by the city's engineers was somewhat lowe ban that determined to be the proper value by our own depart ment, but this was by reason of the fact, as disclosed by the test mony, that the city's engineer applies to the various componen arts of the plant a ratio of depreciation based on general averages met in investigations in some of the large cities of the country mong which was the city of Chicago, and the percentage applie ncluded as one of the strong considerations the depreciation resultin rom obsolescence, inadequacy and public regulation, which it is we ecognized is much greater in large cities than in smaller cities, an&lt; art of which items do not enter into consideration at all in ver mall exchanges, or in the suburban distribution system. The Commission has adopted the depreciated value determined by its engineers, for the reasons that they have admittedly made closer and more extended inspection of the property, a more thor- </seg>
            <seg id="p196">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT 196 ough study of actual ages of the component parts, and had a better knowledge of the physical condition of the property. In order to further assure itself of the reasonableness and accur - acy of the result obtained by its engineering department, the Com - mission called in the chief telephone engineer of the Wisconsin Com - mission, one of the oldest and strongest public service regulating bodies in the central states, whose opinions are recognized and quoted, and have the respect of the entire country. This engineer made a careful and painstaking examination of the entire valuation made by our own engineers, checking in detail all of the items in the various component parts thereof, checking the unit prices, and in fact the whole fabric which produced the result, and except in that he suggested a slight revision upwards in one item and down - wards in another, which variations practically counterbalanced each other, he had no criticisms to make of the valuation, but assured the Commission, both in consultation and on the witness stand dur - ing the hearings, that the results obtained by our engineering depart - ment met with his full approval, and that they were as nearly correct as it was possible to determine. It afterwards developed that there was a mistake of considerable moment in the quantities submitted by the company in the first schedules brought in by the Commission's engineers, resulting in calculations being applied on underground conduit to the duct instead of the trench feet, which, of course, the engineer referred to could not discover without taking personally a measurement, but this was discovered when the city's engineer went over the inven - tory, made the measurements and compared same with those of our own department. The error was corrected, and there can be no suspicion of other errors of like nature, because of jthe thorough check which finally resulted through the comparisons made. The taking of testimony developed considerable controversy with regard to the question of general expense items entering into the values, and this controversy was apparently founded on the suspicion that the amounts allowed for general expense, or so-called overhead items, was excessive. The Commission is convinced that the amount of 17.2% for general expenditures allowed by our en - gineers is conservative, particularly in view of the manner in which they have built up their unit cost. It is generally in line with the accepted percentages and theories of commissions and regulating bodies of other jurisdictions, many of which allow over 20% for these items. In the case of the taking over of the telephones of the Kingdom by the Crown, the Commissioners in Great Britain allowed for this item 26' Various Commissions, as well as many of the prominent en - gineers of the country, apply the general expenses in this way; others include or conceal such expenditures in the units «f costs, thereby producing apparently smaller percentages for overhead ex - penses, and when so treated in a valuation there will be apparently </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 197 no general charges whatever. In other cases part of the genera expenses are applied to the unit price and another part is set up as general expense, which thus makes it appear as though a lowe ratio of general expense had been applied in the valuation. Thus n the case of Wisconsin, which during the hearing was quoted as allowing only 12%, it is found that that Commission does in fac allow as much as 15 ' i for the so-called overhead items, and tha as much as 10', in addition is first applied to the units, thus bringing the range of allowances, depending upon the particular utility unde consideration, from 19 to 25';. We quote from an address deliverec n Chicago, March 24, 1913, by Commissioner Halford Erickson Overhead Charges "As to overhead expenses, that is also a matter, I think that is not quite understood. The Wisconsin Commission in the case of small utilities allows 12%. In the case of large utilities where they have a great deal of difficult city worl to do, crossing rivers and work of that kind which often in volves considerable risk, we allow 11%. That, however, is the figure which is apparent, which is visible in determining the uni price upon which to compute the cost of the various elements We nearly always allow 10'; for contractors profit. That is an element which entered into the cost as a whole and is not given separately. However, if that were taken out of the uni prices where it appears, and added to the 12', that figure wouli be considerably increased. It might not add 10'; to that figure but it probably would add S c ' c or 7&lt;c, sometimes 9'' c , so tha the overhead expense used by us is considerably higher than 12%. We have explained that on several occasions, but i appears perhaps that our practice is not quite understood." Book Value The Commission is of the opinion that the book values fo everal reasons need not be at this time considered. Whether the are below or above the values found in the inventory taken and th valuation made by the engineers is not essential for the purpos of determining the reasonableness of the rates cr expenses, nor is i tossible to reach a reliable result from the examination of the book which might be applied to the case in hand, for various reasons )ne of the principal reasons, as was developed in the testimony, i he fact that the capitalization which would apply to the Lincoln one, as distinguished from the entire plant, is net shown on th looks, and it is impossible to segregate it, except by some r.rbitrary &gt;ercentage based upon arbitrary considerations. Such modes o &gt;rocedure cannot ever be definite, certain or satisfactory. In th second place, as was developed in the testimony, the plant is mad up of various plants, some built, some acquired by the purchase o tock, and others acquired by the purchase of plant, and in these purchases the consideration being at various percentages under th ctual values or capitalization of such acquired plants. </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Under the conditions obtaining in this case, the Commission is convinced that the only definite basis for reasonable value to be used herein is to be found through the methods followed. This principle conforms also with the general opinion of most rate making bodies who have the power to make physical valuations, except only when such valuations are not made or are not available. Inasmuel Ethe book values, for the reasons heretofore set forth do not form e basis of the findings herein, it will be unnecessary to review e testimony brought out regarding it. Going Concern Value The company contends that it is entitled to earn a return upo ie reproduction new value of its property, plus "going concer alue," defining it as that value which is produced through the cos establishing the business. Many of our regulating bodies ar cognizing and giving consideration to such values. This Com ission, while recognizing that this element may have a proper plac n the basis of values for rate making under certain conditions hieh would necessa i\y vary with the history of every eorporatio oming before it, is not yet prepared to accept it. The increase i evenue praye for by the petitioner does not require that thi eed, at the present time, be taken into consideration, and th ommission will withhold its views on the subject until it sha iave more fully analyzed the fundamental principles and variou leories on which such values should be based. Franchise or Good Will Contrary to the suspicion entertained by some of the public oming before the Commission at this hearing, the petitioner in this ase makes no claim for returns or earnings on any value whatsoever hat might be interpreted as franchise or good will value. This, Commission is of the opinion that good will or franchise values have o place in the valuation of a public service corporation subject to egulation, and would entertain no such claim if it were made, except nly as to legitimate costs thereof, when such can be shown. If a ublic utility should demand a return on valuation of that nature or which there has been no actual investment, before this Com mission, it would appear too much like asking the public to pay in »erpetuity for the privilege of making free gifts to the corporation 'he subject needs no other comment on our part than to say that ; has no consideration in this hearing, or in the valuation use&lt; or basing rates or rate of return to the company. Working Capital bNo telephone business can be properly conducted without a tain amount of working capital, in the form of cash in banks and ounts receivable. These latter items will necessarily fluctuate </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 199 with the size of the plant, with the diligence observed in makin collections, and somewhat with the ability of the people to pt promptly, as well as the habits of communities in paying their bill In the meantime the corporation must pay the wages of its employes promptly, must also pay promptly for stores and supplies, or, if does not, must pay interest thereon, and funds so employed or so withheld from the use of the corporation for its legitimate need must necessarily pay rate of return, as well as funds employed i the actual physical plant placed at the disposal of the public. From studies made, the Commission feels that an allowance of about $109,000.00 for working capital together with stores and supplies, for a company of this size, would seem reasonably neces - sary; such allowance would be the equivalent of 6'' c on the repro - duction value. The value used by the Commission includes only $69,846.72 for stores and supplies, so that the total allowance for working capital is approximately $39,000.00 short of the reasonable allowance above indicated. Advance Construction Investigation of the affairs of many of the telephone companies in cities above 20,000 population, demonstrates clearly that every prudently projected plant has more or less idle plant intended for future development, and it is necessary, in order to be able to efficiently serve the public and meet promptly increases in the demands, that this should be so. There are, of course, limits within which such advance construction will be reasonable, and when it is reasonable there can be no question but that the corporation is entitled to consider it as part of the plant upon which it shall be entitled to make earnings. A section of the community which decides to take the service of the company, say to the extent of eighty subscribers, would be very foolish to insist that the company should only lay a cable of sufficient capacity to serve that eighty, and then within a few months, when ten or twenty additional subscribers appear, that the company should be required to practically do the same work over in laying the further extensions for another twenty subscribers. To add a cable of the exact capacity would be foolishly taxing themselves for extra costs which, when projecting plant beyond the actual present needs within reason, will result in much lower costs on the average, and tax the users during the interim for only a slight additional amount of temporarily idle plant. The testimony develops that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - graph Company and the Nebraska Telephone Company, looking for - ward to the ultimate consolidation of the two plants, by the purchase of the one by the other, were very reluctant in the last two years prior to the consolidation, in the matter of making extensions, and where such were made they were made for the minimum amount of service, with the result that just prior to the consolidation of the </seg>
            <seg id="p200">200 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT two plants this so-called idle plant was at a very low point. After the consolidation the cutting out of a large number of duplicate telephones necessarily increased this amount of idle plant, as to dis - tribution and central office equipment, but a careful investigation and comparison of these items leads the Commission to the conclu sion, which is -concurred in by all the engineers, participating in the valuation, that in the final result this advance construction is not in excess of reasonable expectation for immediate growth, excep only as to certain duplications of pole lines, which would not be reasonable or economic to keep in service, and these are deductec from the values found. . Special attention is called to the fact that all values for oh Nebraska Telephone Company's building, real estate, central office equipment and apparatus is completely eliminated in the valuation as submitted by the engineers, and the value finally adopted by the Commission includes only plant in actual service, and allows nothing for franchise and going concern values, or the cost of financing This latter item might properly be included and upon a most con servative basis could not be estimated at less than 6 In view of all these considerations, the Commission takes as &gt;asis of its findings the valuations as found by its engineering epartment, as disclosed by the exhibits, of $1,893,586.31 reproduc on new, and as the present depreciated value, $1,410,411.60. From tese values, however, the Commission concludes that it is prope rst to make two deductions, the one being for a proportion of th alues of Iine3 jointly used for exchange and toll purposes, the prope iroportion having baen determined by the engineers, and resultin a deduction of $58,253.93 from reproduction value new, am 13,014.19 from depreciated Jpresent value. Aside from this abov ointly used property, no toll property is included in the valuation bove given. A further deduction comes by reason of the eviden ole line duplication above referred to in the question of idle plant hich was also the subject of a full and comprehensive study on ie part of the engineers, and this, taken at the gross value place&lt; hereon, entails a further deduction from reproduction new valu f 149,424.59, and from present depreciated value of $35,978.73 eaving as a basis for the findings in this hearing a net reproductio ew value of $1,785,907.74 and a present depreciated value of $1,331 18.73. kThe value claimed by the company, after making readjustments d deiuctions on cinsolidation expenses for abandoned and dupli - ted property or apparatus, was $2,175,956.67. Comparisons between company values and those adopted by the Commission are as follows: Value Total Plant ] lompany claims $2,175,956.67 'ommission adopted leproduction new value $1,785,907.74 'resent depreciated value $1,331,418.73 Per Subs.

            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 201 Much confusion exists in the minds of a large part of the publi with regard to the purposes and the reasons for making physica valuations and applying the results in a more or less modified degre n rate-making cases. One of the principal objections frequently put forward is that any physical valuation does not necessarily dis - lose the actual cost to the investor of the plant under consideration 'hisH,of^course,\it be'i conceded .'may be, true\ in_ some 1 cases Another objection frequently made is that such physical valuation lmost invariably sho*vs greater value than actual costs, because i ncludes labor costs at the present-day rate, which are concededly omewhat higher than they were eight to twelve years ago. Thi must also be conceded, although it is not so positive a matter a he preceding, but it is noticed that in most of the arguments pu orward only the one side of the problem is, as a rule, considered and it will be found that these advances are frequently overcome or at least met in part, by reason of the fact that while highe ates for labor may be applied, concurrently, there are also applie&lt; ower unit costs in many of the component parts of the plant by eason of the fact that much of the material is now cheaper tha t was in the same corresponding period referred to in the labo tern. This is especially true as regards cable and copper wire, whic orms a large per cent, of the total value of the plant under con ideration. The physical valuation made in this state was made in stric accord with the law, and this is so generally with physical valuation made in other jurisdictions. This manner of arriving at the presen value of properties as one of the principal factors has also th anction of our federal government, as instanced by the law recentl passed. Contrary to the suspicion entertained by a large portio of the public, this is not for the purpose of placing upon publi utilities, excessive values or justifying high financing, sometimes practiced in the past, and watered stock which may have been here ofore issued. On the contrary, it is for the express purpose, as we interpret the laws, of eliminating so far as possible any sue onsiderations. It is the interpretation of this Commission that the reason fo dopting this plan of arriving at present values is because in a very arge percentage of the public utilities, applying especially to the olde ompanies, it is impossible to reach the actual cost from an exam nation of the books, for various reasons. One of the principa easons arises because of the varying policies pursued by the differen orporations in the matter of charging additions and betterments nd in the matter of treating replacement and construction accounts n all of which that have heretofore been examined it has develop* hat because of the lack of uniform accounting systems each cor loration has set up its own po'icies and theories, which seldom onform to the present accepted theories of setting up these accounts A further reason is because prior to regulation many of the corpora </seg>
            <seg id="p202">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT 202 fns paid little attention to the actual values in the issues of stocks d bonds, and in such cases it would be absolutely impossible trace out all the intermediate steps and manipulations and reach correct result. The suspicion held on the part of some that physical valuations will be newly made at each controversy or hearing that may come p in regard to any particular plant, is also unfounded under the nterpretation placed upon the law by this Commission. Practically oncurrent with the enactment of the laws regarding the making o &gt;hysical valuations in this and other jurisdictions, as well as by the ederal government, there were promulgated accounting systems which will make impossible any manipulations that may have been racticed in the past, and will set out definitely by sharp lines o emarcation the difference between construction, betterments,main - enance, depreciation and operating expenses. The physical valua on is in fact made for the purpose of reaching a definite startin) oint which will be equitable as between companies and the public nd in case any controversies arise in the future which shall make t necessary to know at the time the value of the plant, the physica aluation first taken under the authority of these laws will be usec as the foundation, and never deviated from, it being merely necessary o add the definitely set up additions and betterments, after deduct ng plant abandoned, or no longer used for the service of the public o find the then actual value of the plant. The outstanding stocks and bonds of a corporation which were ssued prior to regulation, whether the same express the actua value of the plant, or whether they are in excess, or are for a less amount than the real value, have only collaterally any effect, and are not necessarily taken into consideration in the matter of making ates for the future, and when so treated it will be readily seen tha any question of over-capitalization in the past is absolutely elimi nated and need not enter into the problem. Stocks and bonds are in fact not certificates which will deter mine or designate the rate that a corporation shall charge, or tha will necessarily determine the rate of return which the corporation hall be permitted to earn, but are in fact merely certificates desig - nating the ratio of ownership in the plant and reciting the ratio n which the profits above actual operating expenses may be divide&lt; among the holders. The bond itself as to principal is merely a mortgage in most cases and proclaims that at a certain definitely fixed date the cor - poration will pay back to the holder thereof a certain amount, or n case of dissolution that the holder shall first be reimbursed in the &gt;rincipal sum before any distribution is made between holders o other securities. As to the interest, such a bond promises first to the holder a definite sum at specified dates and that such interest shall be paid before any dividend is declared to the stockholders whose claims are always secondary. </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 203 The certificate of preferred stock, when issued, comes as a rule next to the bonds, and guarantees to its holders that if any earnings are made above interest paid out on the bonds or prior liens, that hen such holder shall receive a definite sum in the form of dividends at certain intervals prior to the declaration of any dividends to the ommon stockholder. Sometimes this preferred stock recites that he holders thereof shall have a preferred claim above common tockholders in case of dissolution. The common stockholder then comes in with his shares, and if after paying all prior fixed charges, any net earnings remain, these may be divided among the holders of common stock in the ratio of the number of shares held by them, as disclosed by the certi - icates issued, and in case of dissolution they are entitled to a divi - ion of the balance of the property left after paying off bonds ometimes preferred stock, and all other legitimate claims, whether he amount be equal to the par value of the stock or whether it &gt;e more or less. As a net result, the only value that the certificate of stock really has, regardless of the amount written in, whether it &gt;e $1.00 or $100.00 face value, is nothing other than a determination of the ratio of ownership and the ratio in which the holder shal lave a right to net profits, if there be any. Depreciation In this, as in practically all of the notable rate hearings, the question of depreciation has been one regarding which much testi - mony was adduced,^aud is always the subject of much controversy not so much as regards the question of whether or not there is depreciation or whether it should or should not be allowed, but s td the rate necessary to protect the company against the loss o ts plant. The depreciation of a plant, though it may not be so apparent, is just as real and substantial a charge against revenues as the wages paid to operators or any other employee of the com - pany. For the public to refuse to pay, through addition to the rates a sufficient allowance to guarantee the company against seeing the plant, which it places at the disposal of the public, gradually fritte away and become lost, is unconscionable and inequitable. No just or fair-minded person any longer expects this. In the various hearings had before commissions in other juris - ictions, engineers generally agree as to the average life of the com &gt;onent parts of the plant, and the amounts necessary to set aside o cover the depreciation. It is found that the rates of depreciation set out will range in different localities, dependent somewhat upon he class of plant, from h c ' c to 7 %, and in some few cases even more &gt;ut the generally accepted ratio in the larger plants is 6 %, and thi s an allowance many of the Commissions have agreed and are usini n reaching their conclusions in telephone rate cases. In this cas be variation between the findings of the various engineers and the </seg>
            <seg id="p204">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT estimated requirement, as set forth by the company, ranges from 6.01 'i to 6.54 '" c on reproduction value. LThis charge against the revenues is intended to cover the gradual asting away of the plant by wear and tear, which is not susceptible of being cared for through current maintenance and to cover loss ty reason of obsolescence, inadequacy or public regulation. These ist three items are necessarily always more or less a matter of conjecture, but the experience of the past has shown that they are none the less real, and proper allowance therefor is absolutely neces - sary if justice shall be done to the corporation serving the public. The original Lincoln Telephone Company never paid a cen of dividends on its common stock and only $2,951.60 during i whole existence on preferred stock. The Western Telephone Com pany never paid a dividend on its common stock. It is true tha the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company up to the year 191 failed to make true and proper provision for depreciation, but th was because of the fact that at no time during the period of i existence did the company receive sufficient revenues to enable to do so and still continue to invite the necessary capital needec for extensions and betterments, and for that reason it chose to pa dividends on the stock rather than to set aside such a depreciatio fund, as a prudently managed compary with sufficient revenu should always do. It is the opinion of this Commission that the only safe polic for the company to pursue is to set aside such funds for depreciatio reserve and charge them against the current revenues as is reason ably demonstrated to be necessary to keep the plant up to fu operating efficiency and provide for replacements, for extraordinar or unforseen damage, for obsolescence, inadequacy and public regu lation. To do this it would appear that for the piesent, in view o the experience of the past and the plans pursued in past operation 6% will not produce an excessive amount for such account. It will also be the policy of the Commission to expect of th corporation that it shall, so far as possible, use the depreciatio reserve funds, not needed for replacements in the immediate futur in making extensions and betterments of the plant. Such part o the plant as is represented by the investment from depreciatio reserve shall be permitted to earn the same ratio of return as th stockholder's investment, but neither such reserve fund nor th earnings therefrom shall be available as dividends to stockholder or for any other purposes than those set out. When funds ar needed, properly chargeable to the depreciation reserve, for replace ments, which had theretofore been invested in extensions or plan then such extensions must at that time be capitalized and the pro - ceeds of the capitalization made available for the legitimate purpose of the depreciation reserve fund. The use of the depreciation reserve fund in the manner above indicated will in time, when the depreciation reserve fund may have </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 205 reached a fair proportion, possibly permit a reduction in the prin - cipal sum or percentage to be set aside annually for depreciation reserve, and will thus work towards the reduction of charge against operating revenues, eventually benefiting the public by permitting corresponding reduction in rates. Notwithstanding the above remarks regarding depreciation which ■PPly generally, the Commission is not satisfied in this particular case to apply specifically the percentage indicated, for the reason that the Commission is not convinced that the amounts claimed as necessary for current maintenance are in fact correct. Maintenance The testimony developed that, from 1909 to 1911 inclusive, the maintenance charges, for both the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company and the Nebraska Telephone Company, and for the year overing the consolidated plant, ran from over 5 to over 1% on the ook value of the plant. This the Commission feels Is excessive, nd is probably so by reason of the fact that the line of demarca - ion drawn between charges against maintenance and what should n fact have been depreciation or replacements was not clearly nough defined to determine definitely the proper charges against his account. I Many of our Commissions and engineers recognize the theory hich was announced by this Commission several years ago in the incoln Traction case, that, except under certain conditions, main - nance and depreciation are practically inseparable and always inter - spendent. In a plant where current repairs are promptly and care - illy made, depreciation will be less than in a plant where main - nance charges are low and current repairs more or less neglected, id also if the line of demarcation is not sharply drawn, many ems properly chargeable to depreciation will, in the handling o irrent repairs, naturally creep into the maintenance accounts. I The Commission therefore is inclined to think that with the ioption of the new system of accounting promulgated by this ommission and the Interstate Commerce Commission, it will develop lat there is no necessity for quite so large a charge against main ■nance account as has been made in the past, part of the items itering therein being hereafter chargeable to the depreciation account ending the actual demonstration by experience, the Commission ill allow for depreciation and maintenance combined a charge o % per annum on the reproduction new value as found herein. It will, of course, be understood that a proper and ratable pro portion of this amount will be charged monthly to the operating expenses, and credited to the depreciation reserve account, and tha there shall be charged against the amount so set aside and charge&lt; against operating expenses, all maintenance charges and replace - ments, the remainder representing the depreciation reserve. If the </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT expectation of the Commission is realized and the maintenance charges are brought down below the experience of the immediate past, the reasonable demands of the company for full depreciation allowance will be met. Operation A most thorough and exhaustive study of the operating costs o he Lincoln Telephone Company, beginning with 1904, of th jncoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, beginning with its organi ation from 1909 down to 1911, and also of the operation in th Jncoln district of the Nebraska Telephone Company, beginning wit 899, was made by the accountants of the Commission. These laminations were further supplemented by a careful and extende analysis of the operation of the two plants in 1912 for the Lincol one, and a very large part of the testimony adduced at the hearin was in relation to the operating expenses of the company. Paradoxical as it may seem to the general public, who have no iven the matter some study, the cost of operation per unit in the elephone business increases with the extension of the plant. Thi s thoroughly demonstrated by careful examinations made in a large number of instances, and has for many years been accepted as true &gt;y all regulating bodies in the country. It is a source of considerable rritation to one who has not given the matter study, to be tol&lt; his is so, when his general knowledge of business affairs leads him o the conclusion that with the increased bulk of business the cos &gt;er unit recedes, but the people generally do not know of the adde&lt; complications which arise, and the extra labor which is needed to give service in a telephone plant serving 15,000 subscribers as against say 3,000. A telephone plant of 1,000 subscribers is a comparatively simple business to operate, but when this increases to an exchange o 5,000 subscribers, complications will have arisen, which will adc much to the unit cost of operation, and it must not be forgotten that the increase in service is not in the direct ratio of the number of subscribers added to the first exchange, but rather more in the line of geometric progression, that is to say that in a telephone plan of 5,000 subscribers the probable conversation going over the lines is not merely five times as much as in a plant of 1,000 subscribers but is very much greater than the mere ratio of number of phones In a number of consolidations that have been made between ompeting plants in various cities of the country in the past few ears where careful tests have been made of the added load on the peration, by reason of such consolidation, it has been found that here prior to the consolidation the conversation per telephone in ach of the plants averaged about seven or eight, that immediately ter the consolidation, when it became possible for the subscribers each separate plant then to reach all the subscribers of both ants, the conversations per telephone installed in fact increased </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 207 to about eleven or twelve, or 30 to 50% added load on the service and no one will contend that such an added service can be per ormed without added costs. The tests made in Lincoln demon strate that the average calling rate increased 32.2 r ' c . While recog nizing these conditions this Commission does not think that they are entitled to the great weight or stress generally given them by the telephone companies, but rather that the principal reason for addet costs in the larger exchange, lies in the fact that as the exchange is extended the average investment becomes much greater. Con sequent upon this the requirements for depreciation, maintenance and returns on investment are increased. tThe amount necessary to cover these costs is in excess of 71 le gross revenue, leaving less than 25 ( " c for direct operating expenses his demonstrates clearly that where the increase is needed it is not so uch by reason of added operating costs but 75 or 80 ' ' c of the crease is because of added burden for investment, maintenance tpreciation and taxes. Taking the Nebraska Telephone Company's experience in Lin oln, we find that for the seven years, beginning with 1905 and end ng with 1911, the average cost per subscriber's station, eliminatin) he toll expense estimated at the full credit given to the exchange f 25% of the gross, plus an added 20 'j estimated excess cost o oil operation over credit, the direct operating expenses averagec 12.16 per station per annum. This included general expenses am axes. In addition thereto the maintenance expense averaged $9.19 per subscriber's station per annum, making a total average cost pe ubscriber's station per annum of $21.35. As against this the average evenue was $20.88, leaving a net loss during this entire period from he operation of the plant. This, it will be readily understood, was rought about by reason of competition, as is clearly shown in making comparisons of rates prior to the establishment of the Lincoln Telephone Company and after. In the year 1904, just before the Lincoln Telephone Company &gt;egan business, and for some time prior thereto, the average exchange evenue per subscriber's station with the Nebraska Telephone Com - any was $30.00 per annum, and this on a small exchange, it having eached, at the end of 1904, only 2977 subscribers, growing from that umber to 5681 at the end of 1911, so that instead of increasing the ates with the increase of the size of the plant, as is the generally ccepted theory that it ought to do, they in fact cut the gross reve - ues by one-third, and the losses incurred were to the extent of the ull amount of dividends that the plant should have earned during &gt;at period, plus depreciation reserve, which should have been set p during all the time, except only for realized depreciation which as charged in the maintenance account in the first four years oi le period under consideration. was found that the Lincoln Telephone Company, during its tence and up to the period when it was taken over by the Lin- </seg>
            <seg id="p208">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT 208 oln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, expended for operation o: le plant, as is shown by the exhibits of the accountants, $11.61 er subscriber's station. Beginning with about 3,000 phones in 1904 t had installed at the end of 1908, 5,870 phones, and the operating xpenses would appear to be very low for the period, considerini le number of phones installed, but it developed at the hearing that ome of the charges which should have been in fact charged to perating expenses and maintenance, were charged in additions am letterments, so that it did not show the true operating costs, am t was conceded that if it were possible to make a readjustment o II the charges, the operating expenses would show much in exces f this amount. After the taking over of the plants by the Lincoln Telephone : Telegraph Company a more modern and definite system of account ng was adopted by them, and the operating expenses shown by the ooks for 1909, 1910 and 1911 more nearly show the actual am ormal expense of operation, which, as a result of the investigation bow $14.84 per subscriber's station per annum. It was developec t the hearing that the charges for removals and changes were no ncluded in these operating expenses, averaging $2.20 per subscriber's tation per annum, so that taking into consideration this omission t would show expense of $17.04 per annum. During that same period of three years, the operating expenses of the Nebraska Tele hone Company were $20.85 per annum. In both of these las alculations there is included the operating expenses, but not the maintenance cost of the toll plant, which, if considered, woulc reduce the operating expenses of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegrapl Company for the three years named to $15.42 per subscriber's tation, and the Nebraska Telephone Company to $18.79 per sub criber's station. It must be conceded, of course, that comparison as between trictly manual plant and another that is strictly automatic, is o ittle avail in the case under consideration, and that there is littl bout the operation of the two plants which is comparable, and w must take conditions as they now are, rather than prognosticate pon a combination of the two in the past. The Nebraska Tele - hone Company's plant was taken over by the Lincoln Telephone &lt; Telegraph Company in February, 1912, and the company bega mmediately to make its arrangements for bringing about a physica onnection of the two plants, in the meantime running the two plants separately, and in the latter part of the year beginning the actua onsolidation, which was not finally completed until about Februar f this year. The expenses were analyzed in detail, and were the subject of searching and close examinations in the hearing, and while there may seem to be some opportunity for slight reductions in part of he operating expenses of the company when all the confusion of working the two plants together, of consolidation and troubles </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 209 attendant upon them, shall have been eliminated, yet the expenses examined since the date of the actual physical consolidation do not indicate that there is opportunity for any immediate reduction. In fact the company, through their witnesses for each operating department, strenuously contended that the operating expenses would rather increase than decrease. As heretofore stated, the Commission is not satisfied with regarc o the maintenance expense, and anticipates that some considerable aving might be effected therein, but as to the general expenses he taxes and direct operation costs, the Commission, after a carefu tudy and analysis of the exhibits, is inclined to think that estimat - ng the operating expenses for the future on the basis of 1912, which s borne out by the costs for the first four months of 1913, $10.44 will be a reasonable amount to start with as a basis cf operating expenses including toll operation, and therefore adopts that figure Considerable testimony was brought out by some of the repre - sentatives of the public, with regard to the supposed increase in general expenses, particularly because of the advance in the salary of the president from $3,600.00 to $10,000.00 per annum, and ncreases of from $500.00 to $2,000.00 per annum in the salaries of some of the principal heads of departments. There is *o founda ion for the criticism, and the unit cost, in fact, as is clearly demon trated, is decreased and not increased. This is easily explaine&lt; when consideration is given to the fact that in 1911, prior to the onsolidation, the president's salary of $3,600.00 was borne by ,941 subscribers, which made practically a charge of forty cents pe ubscriber's station per annum. In 1912 there were taken over by purchase over 34,000 subscribers, so that the salary of $10,000.00 was then distributed over this larger number, and the unit cos &gt;ecame practically twenty-three cents per subscriber's station pe annum, making a saving in this item of seventeen cents per sub criber's station per annum, instead of an increase. The same argu ment will apply to the other advances in salaries which were criti ised at the hearing. There was no evidence adduced which would, in any way ndicate that it would be possible to further reduce the operating xpenses, but, on the contrary, a more careful analysis of the exhibits and the testimony convinces the Commission that, for the present at least, the costs above named for direct operation, taxes, and gen - ral expenses, must stand as a reasonable estimate of the cost. Rate of Return SNo element of rate regulation has caused more discussion or ntroversy than that of rate of return, and the opinions of the past xy from the statement that any earnings above mere operating penses up to 10% constitute a fair rate of return on fair value, le controversy is endless, and the Commission will not endeavor give here its full views with regard to proper rate of return. The </seg>
            <seg id="p210">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT 210 Commission is not satisfied to agree with some decisions that hav come to its notice, to the effect that any earning is not confiscation An investor has a right to expect not merely that his investmen shall remain intact and not be gradually eaten away by losses o depreciation, but he has also a right, which we think cannot b disputed, to an earning which is a reasonable interest on the invest ment. We are not prepared to determine upon the rate which sha irrevocably bind the Commission as a fixed percentum that sha in all cases be demanded as of right, because of such decision, bu will leave it open to determine in each particular case as to wha may be the reasonable earnings to which the corporation is entitlec It must always be borne in mind that different classes of utilities must earn different rates of return, in order to be able to financ ieir needs and meet the reasonable demands of the public for exten ons and enlargements of plant. This can never be done excep t a sacrifice, if the returns allowed by the regulating body are to ow to satisfy the investing public. But the rates need not alway e the same. That is, for some classes of securities, which are firs ens on property, and practically a guarantee that the principal as *ell as the interest will be faithfully and promptly paid, 5% ma e ample. In others, where there is some slight risk, 6% woul&lt; tardly be adequate, and for the stockholder who gives a first lie n his property through bonds and takes all the chances of the var us vicissitudes through which a new corporation is often obligee o pass before reaching a steady dividend-paying period, this Com mission is of the opinion that 6% ought to be the minimum at whic ate a corporation can hope to invite subscribers to buy stock wit fair expectation of having its hopes realized and being able to inance its needs. Nor do we mean to be understood in this as say ng that 6% is all that will be allowed in such cases. There ar easons why, even in the same class of corporations, there will b uctuations and differences dependent largely upon the conditions le location, the class of people served, efficiency of management nd other considerations too numerous to mention, all of which hav more or less bearing on the net earnings of any public utility. In at least five of the notable telephone cases brought before astern Commissions in the past two years, 8% has been designatec as a reasonable rate of return on the value found by the Com missions, and these decisions are entitled to the respect of the entire ountry; so that if corporations of this kind in the east are allowec o earn 8%, where money as a rule brings less interest than it does ut west, and where capital is more easily secured at lower rates lan in this section of the country, this Commission can hardly emand that the investing public shall be held to lower rates, o xpected to serve the public with less compensation. In New Jersey few York, Maryland, and other states, Commissions have agreec n cases of this kind that the earning of 8 % on the value of the &gt;roperty used in serving the public is not excessive. The Commis </seg>
            <seg id="p211">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 211 sion of Canada lately, in an important case, determined that rates would not be disturbed or lowered, notwithstanding that the company was earning 8.28%. But, as was well said by the New York Public Service Commis- rn for the Second District, in a very recent decision: "The truth is, no one can tell what return a given rate will produce either in the aggregate or as a percentage upo some other sum. The returns can only be ascertained by exper ience. All that can be determined, in such a case as this, i that the rate is not eonfiscatory; that is to say, it will retur at least 6% upon the ascertained fair value of the propert used in the public service. There is no such thing as keepin the return, however, at 6%. The conditions will vary from yet to year. Operating expenses will vary; gross earnings wi vary; and in a town which is not thoroughly developed, as Buffalo is not, a rate should be so fixed as to increase th return to the company by increasing its revenues above the limit fixed without a proportional increase in expenses." In like manner this Commission does not care at this time to bind itself to either 6 or 7 or 8%, and promulgate any of them as a fixed rate of return, which will be fair in all cases. Nor for the purposes of this case is it necessary to reach a final decision that 8% is necessary or right. It does, however, feel that to calculate the rate of return at 7 % on the present depreciated value of the plant, will not be unfair to the public. Having in mind the opinions expressed above, the calculation made on the basis of the present rate would show the following situation: Value* Present Reproduction Depreciated New Value Value In accordance with report of the Com- mission's engineering department ... $1,893,586.31 $1,410,411.60 Less toll proportion of jointly used prop- erty 58,253.98 43,014.19 Less pole-line duplication in plant 49,424.59 35,978.73 58,253.98 43,014.19 Net values $1,785,907.74 $1,331,418.73 Present Exchange Revenue Applying present rates to subscriber's .; ; ;__ a — oa stations in service April 30 $286,389.00 Charges Against Revenue Operating and general expense including taxes, but exclud - ing cost of toll operation $104,309.12 Maintenance and depreciation 9% on reproduction value. 160,731.70 Returns on property 7% on present depreciated value.. . 93,199.32 Total $358,240.14 Estimated deficit $71,851.14 Feeling sure of our premises, in the opinions expressed above. it is evident that this situation needs correction, and that to demand of the company that they shall continue to serve the public at the </seg>

There can be no doubt but that relief is needed, nor can there be much question as to the amount. The only question which remains is the manner in which this deficiency shall be met, and how it should be distributed among the various classes of patrons. Rates From a careful study of the telephone situation, both here an&lt; elsewhere, that has been extensively gone into, this Commission i convinced that the present generally accepted basis of rates am classifications contains many inequalities, inconsistencies and dis - criminations, but the problem is a serious one and the companies and regulating bodies are not yet prepared, excepting in a few of th very largest places in the country, to establish rates that will mor equitably distribute between the different classes of users of th telephone the necessary revenue to cover operating expenses am produce a reasonable return on the investment. This Commission is inclined to agree with a number of othe commissions who have lately determined that the only truly equi able basis for making rates would be the measure of the servic hat is to say, that each subscriber should pay first a fixed or reac ness-to-serve charge, which would cover the cost of maintenanc depreciation and taxes as well as a return to the investor on th amount of plant placed at the subscriber's disposal, and in additio hereto a measured rate which will cover the direct operating expense ncurred in rendering the service needed. Such a scheme of rat could at this time, however, hardly be applied in a city of this siz nor does the petitioner make a request therefor. In the small cities where it has been tried, it has not proven entirely satisfactor jecause it is clearly shown that the adoption of such a rate schedu las restricted the service, complicated and increased the cost o accounting, and served to cause many irritations which are, as rule, absent in cities where the flat rate obtains, differentiating on jetween classes. This Commission is not persuaded that the classification obtain ng in this territory sufficiently distinguishes between various users n accordance with even the average amount of service of the classe named, but to re-classify the subscribers will require a long am tedious study, extensive readjustment of plant apparatus and th use of meter3 not yet perfected. Under all the circumstances th Commission feels that it will best serve the purposes and creat the least irritation to permit the present classifications to stand. In the consideration of rates this Commission has made a study covering a wide field, in order to make comparisons of service, development and saturation, all of which have their sepaiate and distinct influence on the question. The comparisons were netessarily </seg>
            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 213 difficult because the unusual situation arising from the consolidation of a manual with an automatic exchange and continuing after con - solidation the operation of a dual system. No other city in the coun - try has this exact situation, and as a consequence in some measure it was necessary to blaze a new trail with regard to some of the factors. This the Commission has done, having in mind at all times the general good of the public. Complaint was made in the course of the hearing that in adopt - ng the automatic system in preference to the manual, the Lincoln 'elephone &amp; Telegraph Company placed an added and unnecessary urden on the public in the consolidation of the Lincoln exchanges n that the change from manual to automatic entailed a larger ddition to plant investment than would have been the case if the hange had been made to all manual instruments. An investigation of the situation, however, proves the contrary — - t must be remembered that the main central office equipment o an automatic telephone system has nothing in common with the manual and all would have been lost; the instruments to the number of about 9,000 would a'so have become useless and much of the other apparatus would have to be changed and readjusted. The plant, which under such conditions would have been aban oned, is inventoried at a value of $611,000.00; in addition to this here must be considered a large amount of labor necessary to dis mantle the plant, and the entire loss of the then existing manua witchboards, which would have been inadequate and would have ecessitated the purchase of complete new central office equipment with but proportionately small salvage from abandoned plant. It is conservatively estimated that to have changed to the manual system would have cost fully $400,000.00 more than the expenses and additional costs which were developed in the consolida tion as completed; on the whole the Commission is convinced tha he change as made was prudent and wise, was economically execute&lt; and that the company displayed good judgment in arriving at its decision in the matter. One of the elements not generally recognized by the patrons o elephone companies is the fact that in ratio to the investment the gross earnings are very small. In this instance, allowing the increase hat the company claims it needs, will produce barely 20 c ' c gross evenue per annum on the reproduction value of the plant. A compared to this, in the case of our railroads, their gross income will show about 46% of the value, and few business men are preparec to invest capital in a business which does not produce gross revenue unning from 100% to 500 c l of the investment per annum. As a consequence the necessary earnings to cover maintenance, deprecia tion and reasonable returns on the investment become a very larg proportion of the rates needed to keep intact the business of elephone company, but the very nature of the business makes i mpossible to modify this condition and we see no prospect of any change of conditions in this respect. </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT One of the chief causes of complaint and irritation on the part of the public because of the petitioner's demand for higher rates undoubtedly lies in the fact that since 1904 the citizens of Lincoln and the surrounding zone have been accustomed to rates that were nadequate, brought about by competition, and because of this the rates throughout the time since 1904 have been held down to below the general average, far below the normal, and have remained sta - tionary, notwithstanding the very marked growth in each of the plants, which combined, form the present Lincoln zone plant. In 1904, with less than 3,000 telephones in service, the people were paying an average of $30.00 per telephone per annum for the exchange service rendered, and since that date, notwithstanding the increase which would ordinarily, and as is generally recognized justify higher rates than were paid to the smaller exchange, the average gross revenue per telephone has been only slightly above $20.00. In the year 1912 the average revenue for the combine&lt; plants was $22.43, which was far below the average when comparec to other places of practically the same size and receiving approxi- mately the same service. That the cost as well as the value of the telephone service ncreases with the size of the exchange, is too generally and too ell recognized to need any further discussion. It is clearly shown lat it was recognized in Lincoln as early as 1904 by a reference to le ordinance introduced and passed, giving a franchise to the -incoln Telephone Company wherein permission was given to the ompany to raise its rates at the rate of twenty-five cents per month, or $3.00 per annum, per subscriber, with the growth of the ant for each one thousand additional subscribers beyond the first tree thousand. Competition made it impossible for the company o take advantage of this provision in its franchise, but if the com petition had not existed, or if they had been able to drive out the ompetition, as it was generally expected they would, then and in tat case advantage would have been taken of the provisions am le telephone users of the city would in fact be paying much highe ates now than are requested by the petitioner, if in the meantime ublic service regulation had not been established through the Nebraska State Railway Commission. The petition of the company requests the establishment of the following schedule of rates: ndividual line business $5.5 fwo-party line business 4.&amp; Business extensions l.Oi bounty exchange 2.5&lt; ncoming trunks 4.0i ndividual line residence 2.5&lt; Hwo-party line residence 2.0i Residence extensions 51 •"arm 2.0i 'BX trunks 6.O1 »BX or IBX stations 25c to l.Oi </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 215 The company estimates that this will produce a net increase&lt; monthly gross earning of $6,674.00. They request that this schedule of rates shall be uniformly applied to the entire zone, but the Com mission is of the opinion that it is not fair to demand of the sub - cribers in the outlying districts that they shall pay for the entire zone service when only local service is desired. To give to all sub - cribers in the zone indiscriminately the incoming service, cannot be avoided in this plant because of mechanical difficulties due to the operation of automatic switches. In establishing rates and rear anging the schedule the Commission has borne this in mind, an&lt; eels that to the rates which it proposes to apply, instead of the above schedule requested by the company, consideration should be iven by the public to the fact that each telephone, even in the mailer exchanges, where the subscriber chooses to take the loca xchange service and feels that he does not need the entire zone ervice, he cannot be cut off from the zone service "incoming." It would be best, of course, in the opinion of this Commission f each exchange could be kept entirely separate, and rates made commensurate with the service rendered within the exchange itself placing any intercommunication between the exchanges on the basis of toll service; but the arrangement, as heretofore stated, is such hat this can not be done, nor would it efficiently serve the public equirements, and we feel that the most equitable arrangement o ates under the circumstances will be the one herein adopted. The testimony developed that the company in the past has been orced to expend large sums to meet the demands of the public for emovals and changes of subscriber's equipment, many of whicl langes were no doubt unnecessary and some made for frivolous easons. In any event it appears that the extent of such removals nd changes was far in excess of a reasonable number. This puts n unnecessary burden upon the company, which must be paid by le public, and when no provision is made for the payment of sucl osts, the expense naturally falls as an average on all the patrons I the company. It seems unfair to the Commission that patrons ho are permanent and who do not demand frequent removals am langes should be called upon to assist in paying for the expense ! making removals and changes for others, and therefore a schedule f rates is made to cover, in part at least, the expenses incurred in lis manner. The Commission assumes, that by reason of the custom f making contracts to cover one year, the cost of installation is nferentially included therein, and therefore does not set up an stallation charge except only where installations are made for a lorter period than one year. The Commission is convinced, from a careful study of the situa - tion and comparisons with other cities, that taking into consideration the service required by the patrons of this company, the rates in the proposed schedule of the petitioner as between business and resi - dence are not equitably adjusted; in other words, that because of </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT the much greater use, the larger advance should be made in the case of the business phones, and the residence patrons should not be raised in the proportion demanded. There is, however, no question in the minds of the Commission that some advance should apply rail and the burden is therefore differently distributed. In the case of the farm service, it clearly developed at *he hear- ing that the farm rates were far short of paying the fixed charges and cost of service, by reason of the much greater investment per subscriber's station on the farm lines, because of apparatus and dis- tribution lines used in the service; but, in considering common usage over the country generally, it is concluded that to raise the rates to the figure which would make them adequate and fully pay their just share of the cost of operation, would bring about a burden that would seem to the farmer unbearable and would be inclined to take much of this useful service away from him. In this case, therefore, the Commission is inclined to the view of many authorities, to the effect that it is the good policy to distribute this burden a little more to the business man and a little less to the farmer, on the theory that as the number of subscribers increases the business man is more generally benefited than the farmer, and can well afford to help him share the added burden. That the extra burden placed upon the company for service by its patrons here is substantial, will be readily seen from the following table of comparisons, by which it is clearly shown that the average calls per telephone per day in Lincoln is far in excess of the normal.

The succeeding schedule attempts to make an estimate of what the gross revenues and final net returns will be to the company under the schedule of rates determined upon by the Commission fair and equitable between classes, and as producing in gross revenue almost the amount needed to cover operating expenses. depreciation, and a reasonable return on the investment. The Com- mission cannot, of course, predict that this schedule will be borne out precisely by experience, nor that the rates will produce the exact results predicted. This it is impossible to do, because of the many conditions that may arise which cannot be foretold. It is impossible, of course, to predict what irritation will be produced by the readjustment of the rates, what changes will be made in classifications because of same, or how many subscriber's stations will be removed because of the protest that on the part of some may be made to the rates. The changes from the one to the other classes of service, notably from single line to party line service, may have an effect far in excess of what is anticipated or predicted.

Some objection is no doubt to be expected as to the charges set up for removals and changes, but these charges will barely cover actual costs and the Commission is persuaded that these are fair to the general public, who should not be called upon to help bear the burden for making frequent removals and changes for part of the subscribers, which entail a large expense to the company. Many of these removals and changes are frivolous and not really necessary. We have no doubt that with the schedule of charges proposed many of the removals and changes not really needed will be avoided, and that if this is the case the revenue from that source will fall below the estimate, but this need not disturb the general </seg>
            <seg id="p222">222 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Emit, because if the revenue does not come it will be because the anges are not made, and there will be a corresponding savings the operating expenses. In the making of comparisons of these rates with those in fore teretofore, the public is admonished not to forget that whereas utomatic subscribers prior to the consolidation had a service cover ng 8819 telephones, and the subscribers on the manual exchang lad a service covering 5819 telephones, the service which the sub cribers now enjoy covers over 13,000, and this in itself is a palpabl ncrease in the value of the service, nor must the subscriber, who as heretofore forced to subscribe and pay for two telephones because ' the dual service, forget to make comparisons with the cost o wo as against the cost of one telephone. It is evident that of the &gt;ractica)ly 1,500 telephones taken out, and the service not restored lere is a saving somewhere, which is an appreciable amount, ant 1U8 as to these 1,500 subscribers who heretofore had two telephones nd now have only one, the cost is $6.00 as against $8.00, being n reality a reduction rather than an advance. This also applies roportionately to the two-party line business telephones, and to the ew individual line residence telephones, who had the duplicate service. For the benefit of those business houses, or others who fine lat one telephone is not adequate to carry the service but whose ncoming and outgoing calls are not we'l balanced, the privilege i ven of using a one-way telephone at the rate of $4.00, so that even n this event, where the business man still finds it necessary to retain wo telephones, the gross rate will be $10.00, and not double the new ate for the individual telephone. The Commission is not persuaded that the private branch exchange and individual branch exchange stations are properly adjusted as to rates. The price set up for trunks for this service seems fair, and is on the same basis as the individual business tele - phone, but the stations attached vary from twenty-five cents to $1.00, and this will be the subject of further investigation anc study, and if such study should develop that there is unfairness or discrimination in the inequalities which seem apparent, a further adjustment will be made. This, however, does not necessarily affect the other rates, nor disturb the relation between classes under the present schedule and estimated returns. Service It was inevitable that in the large amount of labor required o bring about the physical consolidation of the two plants formerly listing, and the changes in apparatus necessary to make such con - solidation and the replacement of a large number of manual with utomatic telephones, there should arise some confusion, which would, in greater or less degree, affect the quality of the service, t was also inevitable that this condition would be more aggravated n a few -instances than on the general average, and that some small </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 223 per cent, of the service would be difficult and slow of adjustment; that this condition existed was evidenced by the bitter complaints made on the part of a few of the patrons, as shown by the testimony and cross-examination, which occasionally became acrimonious in the extreme. It is unfortunate that the average patron who may be justly aggrieved immediately becomes convinced that, since his own service s unsatisfactory, all others must necessarily be as bad or worse. There were unquestionably instances where just cause existed for complaint and irritation, but there was assuredly no excuse for the very narrow view taken by these patrons, who should rather have ooked at the situation from the broader viewpoint and taken into consideration the general average conditions instead of immediately determining that their own unsatisfactory service was a fair example of all. Few of the telephone users realize how delicate is the mechanism in the dials, and how even a slight touch inadvertently given such dial while returning it to its stop position, will disturb the switches and result in giving a number other than the one called for, am from experience the Commission also knows that a very slight care - lessness displayed in the manipulation of the dial, that is to say in the failure to bring the dial completely to the stopping place a wrong number will necessarily be obtained. A special study mad along this line has convinced the Commission that to these two causes much of the trouble is due. I As was evidenced during the hearings and by articles appearing i the newspapers from time to time, many of the patrons were orked up to a high pitch of indignation, and no doubt felt tha ley had just cause for and were entirely sincere in their com taints. The city, through its attorney, advertised in the newspapers uring one recess in the hearings, inviting the public generally to take complaint. These advertisements appeared in the three prin pal newspapers several times and as a result only twenty-six answers ere received, being only two complaints out of each thousand tele - hones in use or one-fifth of 1%. Because of the apparent dissatis iction, the Commission made special investigation of the service &gt; satisfy itself of the actual conditions existing. With this end in view, tests were made during a period of clea weather, from April 14 to 18, both inclusive, by special employes of the Commission, covering five days, during which time 6,389 telephones were tested by 10,597 calls. Of these calls 65°^ were completed at the first attempt. It was inevitable that many of the phones in such a large number of calls would be found busy, and in all those cases a second call was made, with the result that more than 77% of all the calls resulted in immediately satisfactory con versation, and taking into consideration the "busy" and "no answer' calls, which in most cases it was developed was because of the absence of the party called, the final result convinced the Com mis- </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT sion that during that period the service might properly be deter - mined as 94% efficient. The actual trouble developed was only 2.7%, leaving 3.1% of questionable cases, which might or might not have really meant trouble in the apparatus or distribution system. The patrons present at the hearing when this situation wa rought out in the testimony, seeming still dissatisfied, the Com mission made a further test from May 19 to 27, inclusive, unde sadvantageous conditions to the company, because of the eigh ays included in this latter test there were six days of wet weather hen it is to be expected that more trouble will develop in the dis ibution system, especially because of cable leak trouble and the rounding through the dropping on the open lines of tree branches leavily laden with water. This test was made by a special corp eleven employes of the Commission, who during this period testec 0,000 telephones with 15,049 calls. During this test 60.2% of the alls were completed at the first attempt and produced a clear am ninterrupted connection. As a final result of this test, it was shown onclusively that the service during this period was 92.33% efficient hat 2.88% of the trouble was not actual trouble, but the failure esulted from the fault of either the caller or the called, and the ctual developed troubles were 4.79',. In order that the Commission might have some comparison relative to the question of service, a representative was sent to investigate the question of service rendered in automatic exchanges located at South Bend, Indiana, and Grand Rapids, Michigan The South Bend, Indiana, exchange is hardly comparable with the Lincoln exchange, for the reason that the type of central office equipment and subscribers' station apparatus is of a more modern type than that used in the Lincoln exchange. The average number of developed troubles in the South Bend exchange was 1.92 troubles per station per annum. The Grand Rapids, Michigan, automatic exchange has a tota umber of subscribers' stations in service of 12,300. • The average umber of troubles developed for the calendar year 1912 was 4.7 'he year 1912 in Grand Rapids was an unusual year for telephone istribution systems, in that there was a great deal of rain during large portion of the year which caused an abnormal amount o rouble to develop in all kinds of telephone distribution equipment l study of the developed trouble in the Lincoln zone, using the month of May, 1913, as a basis shows that the average number o roubles per subscriber's station per annum is 3.89. From the above igures it will be readily seen that the Lincoln exchange compare avorably with the Grand Rapids, Michigan, automatic exchange n order that some comparison, might be presented as between utomatic and manual exchanges, the Commission made a study o our months of the Nebraska Telephone Company's trouble reports or the Omaha district. The period used in this study was the firs </seg>
            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 225 t&gt;ur months of 1913. Using these four months as a basis, the average umber of troubles per subscriber's station per annum was 2.6&amp; The question of service has been given very serious cornidera - ion by the Commission, and it is their purpose to further pursue hese investigations after the order herein promulgated has become ffective, to the end that the patrons of the Lincoln Telephone A. 'elegraph Company in the Lincoln zone shall receive a service that s fully up to the general standard, rendered to like communities n other parts of the country. To this end the people of this zone re asked to use care in operating the automatic apparatus, being areful to see that they have the right number in mind before perating the dial, and then to allow the dial to return to the stop &gt;efore calling the next number. It should be remembered that a umber of switches in the central office have to act between the ime that the dial stops and the time that the finger presses it for he next number. Late improvements in the automatic apparatus re being perfected, to which the Commission is giving special atten - ion, and will ask the management to make needed changes as fast as improvements in the present system can be made. The ability of a patron to disconnect his instrument after a onversation as it has been perfected on the automatic apparatus s many times more speedy than the old manual system, by reason f the fact that the moment the receiver hook touches its norma resting place all switches are returned to their positions and a new onnection may be set up immediately. If the patrons will remember bis and bear with some of the slight difficulties under which the )lant must be operated at the present time, a more satisfactor; service will be secured. The company has made special effort hrough the newspapers and otherwise, to call the patrons' attention 0 the fact that the person called must not be expected to answe lie telephone in an unreasonably short time. Despite this fact rom investigations made by the representatives of the Commission 1 appears that fully 50',' of the reported troubles can be chargec o the impatience of the calling patron. Approximately 85', of the roubles that have been reported to the trouble department durini he past three months have been found to lack foundation on test ty this we mean that the trouble operator found the switches ant istribution lines working perfectly. To wait a minute for a bell to be answered is not unreasonable nd yet it is not always time enough to allow a housewife to go rom the upper floor to the lower and answer her phone. A little more patience in this regard on the part of the subscriber will improve he service. It was found a great many people complain that th service is unsatisfactory because when they go to answer thei elephone no one is there to talk, and in a great many of these ases the calling subscriber has hung up his telephone before givin he called patron time to answer the phone. The average numb* of reported troubles is gradually decreasing and the Commissio 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p226">226 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT las every reason to believe that the number of reported troubles will be reduced to the minimum in a very short time. During one wenty-four hours of last week the number of reported troubles was lower than it had been at any time since the consolidation o he plant, and the general trend for the month of June is downward &gt;eing 15 to 18% less than for the month of April. It was asserted during the hearings, that to advance rates in &lt;incoln would place a burden on the telephone users far in excess f the average in other communities, but this is not borne out by he facts. The Commission made extended investigation in this espect and satisfied itself that with the advance proposed Lincoln would still enjoy telephone rates below the average.

And it seems to me not improper to state to start wit! ut it is very far from pleasant for me to disagree with the majority : the Commission, and it is only after long and earnest though lat I so disagree. Likewise I may say that it is hard to vote gainst one's own friends and acquaintances of years standing in enying the request of a company among whose officers and stock lolders are many of my personal friends, but as I view the matte lere was, under the facts as I gleaned them, and the law as nderstood it, no other our;e left open tj me.

But I shall try o set out clearly why, under the law and facts a? developed in thi tearing, I voted against the requested rise. History of the Commission The constitutional amendment adopted at the general election of 1906 provided for the creation of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, and contained the following provision: tt The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the Legislature shall provide by law. But in absence of specific legis - lation, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 231 kThe Legislature of 1907 (Chap. 90, Sec. 4, H. R. 305), defined e term "common carriers," and stated specifically what public ilities are included, as follows: "The term common carriers as used herein shall be taken to include all corporations, companies, individuals and associa - tion of individuals, their lessees, or receivers (appointed by any court whatsoever) that may now or hereafter own, operate, manage or control any railroad, interurban or street railway line, operated either by steam or electricity or any other motive power, or part thereof, or any express company, car company, sleeping car company, freight and freight line company, tele- graph and telephone companies and any other carrier engaged in the transportation of messages or transportation of pas- sengers or freight for hire." Thus the newly created Commission was clothed with vas owers in all matters pertaining to rates, service and genera ontrol of common carriers, limited only by specific acts of th legislature. Evidently the people felt themselves helpless by th methods theretofore at hand to adjust their relations to the carriers n matters of rates or service, and felt also that competition woul not adjust and regulate such matters. The enumeration as abov tated was full and complete, but had the constitution stated th &gt;owers simply thus; "The powers and duties of the Commissio hall include the 'regulation of rates'," surely by all the ordinar ules of implication it would of necessity have followed that th Commission must consider also service, for there can be no reall ntelligent consideration of rates without at the same time a con ideration of service. The two are inseparable. But with the fu numeration set out above there can be no question that the Com mission has had since 1907 full powers to determine matters of rate and service, and to make such rules and regulations* as should be necessary to that end. Doubtless it would be necessary to establis a system of accounting and to require full, frank and complet nformation from the companies as to the property they had, it cost, use, depreciation, etc., all moneys received and paid out ant or what, in fact a complete showing of the condition of the compan whose rates and service are up for consideration and thereafter th Commission should verify all such matters by its own check. Thus the Commission was organized in March, 1907, with almos unlimited powers and with a monumental task to perfcrm. P r ob ably those who then composed the Commission realized neither how great were the powers of the Commission, or how great the task and it is no discredit to them that they did not, for it was an ebso utely new thing in the state of Nebraska, they were all entirely new to the work, and such also was the case of their assistants Naturally, one of the first things, however, that would be suggested o the regulating body was rates, and with that at once arose the question of service. </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Theory of Rates Without doubt it is thoroughly understood by the people of Nebraska that the rates paid for service rendered to the public &gt;y a public utility must be adequate under proper and ordinarily areful management to pay all operating expenses, current main - tenance, depreciation, taxes, insurance, etc., and that above the mount thus acquired and an additional amount in order that thus surplus may be created out of which dividends or interest may be paid to those who have invested their money, property or skill for public use. By any proper system of accounts the gross amount necessary or all operating expenses, including current maintenance, deprecia - on, taxes, insurance, etc., is easily determined. And such an amount lould be sufficiently large to keep the property intact and, at the ame time, pay good wages and liberal salaries, to the end that the tility may employ the services of the most efficient men within ie scope of their employment, and to raise this amount rates may &gt;€ made without any reference to the value of the plant, or the mount that has been invested therein, or to the amounts that nvestors are entitled to dividends upon. Thus, operating expenses must be secured regardless of service rendered, for otherwise the roperty would depreciate to an extent that service could not be iven or proper employes secured. But when we come to consider hat portion of the amount paid for service which goes to create a urplus from which dividends and interest are paid, we must consider ie service delivered to the public and we must know the amount r money that the investors are entitled to receive returns upon, nd it seems but reasonable that the rate of return to the investors lould vary somewhat with the quality of service that is rendered History of Telephone Company In March, 1907, the Lincoln Telephone Company and the West rn Telephone Company were operating plants in Lancaster County nd elsewhere in the state. Doubtless at that time an examination f the books of the companies would have revealed the fact that i would be impossible to tell from them the amount of money the nvestors were entitled to receive dividends upon. These companies were the predecessors of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com any, and it seems to me that rightly the last named company mus nswer for the deeds of the first two mentioned and must be respon - ible for them to the public and to the Commission. At that time he Commission would have been practically compelled to resor o appraisals and estimates to determine the value and amounts f money on which the investors were entitled to receive dividends tut such is not the case with the properties constructed since tha ime, for since that time it has been possible to get the facts. The Commission at any time since its organization has had the power to </seg>
            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 233 demand full disclosures of all facts in relation thereto, to demand plans and specifications of what has been built, the cost, what has &gt;een received and how expended and all related facts thereto, ant t is no stretch of legal presumption to say that the telephone com pany at all times from March, 1907, knew this, and knew that at any ime it could be called upon to make full disclosures, including a sub mission of their books, accounts, vouchers, and an itemized statement o all moneys received and paid out and for what. When the facts can be known there is no occasion for estimates. The following is a case in point: In re bond issue of New Yor &amp; North Shore T. Company, N. Y. Pub. Ser. Com. Reports, Vo 3, page 80. In this case the New York Commission was asked t follow as precedents certain rate cases where the Commission ha based its determination to a considerable degree upon the estimate* cost of reproduction new, deducting depreciation. The Commissio would not so do, as shown by its own words given below: "1. In the rate cases to which reference was made, the actual cost of the existing property was not known to the Commission. Hence, in order to get some idea of its value, the cost — to — reproduce — new — less — depreciation was used as one factor, but not the only factor "2. The estimates made for overhead charge* in these cases were invariably liberal, because, lacking definite informa- tion, the Commission did not wish to do injustice." "3. There was no intention or holding in any case that estimates should be substituted for actual facts when ascer- tainable. The percentages somewhat arbitrarily fixed must be justified by facts and experience. If they do not agree with actualities, they must be changed. Actualities are not to be pruned or inflated to agree with estimates." "4. To follow the suggestions would be to brush facts aside and enter the realm of speculation. In the rate cases mentioned above, to which the Commission's attention was directed, the properties under consideration were con tructed long before the New York Public Service Commission was created, therefore, the Commission was compelled to resort to esti mates as one of the factors in arriving at its conclusion as to the value of the properties upon which securities were to be issued, or ates made for the purpose of returning dividends to those who lad invested their money in such securities. It reasonably follows hat when the value upon which securities are to be issued is known hat said value should be the basis of rate-making. In the case at bar, it is true that a portion of the properties n question were constructed or purchased before the Nebraska Commission was created, but since its creation a very large part of the present properties have been constructed and securities have &gt;een issued thereupon by authority of this Commission. And clearly when securities were issued bearing the o. k. of the state of Ne - braska by the Railway Commission, the Commission would be im - posing no undue hardship upon the telephone company to require it to make full and complete showing and a detailed statement of </seg>

Building and Structures; 2, Exchange Equipment; 3, Tele &gt;hone Appliances; 4, Distributing System; 5, Power Plant Equip merit; 6, Shops and Power and Equipment; 7, Connections to Customers; 8, Office Furniture and Fixtures; 9, Tools and Imple - ments; 10, Horses, Wagons, Automobiles, etc.; 11, Stores am upplies, and 12, Land. Clearly the Commission had the right to ask for such showing and I think it was the duty of the Commission o so ask. And the telephone company, officered by exceptionally ceen, efficient, well-trained and far-sighted men, knew that at al imes they should have their books so kept as to be able to mak ull and complete showing of the company's property, equipment ant ondition, and .if they failed in their duty to the Commission and o their own company, the company cannot in good conscienc omplain if it is not given the rise in rates it desires, when it canno rom its own records show conclusively that it is entitled to saic rise, and when asking the Commission to depend solely upon mer estimates, which from their very nature tend to shoot far above th mark. Ever since I came upon the Commission, I have maintainec hat such detailed showings should be made by all companies desir ng to issue securities, but I have been unable to convince my olleagues of the necessity of such showings; and I have maintained also that advance estimates and plans and specifications should be hecked by the Commission as the work progressed, and that prope •ouchers should be furnished so that the Commission should have ome reasonable assurance that the proposed work was done as promised and the money expended for the purposes for which i was secured. If the Commission had made such requirements at the various times when the telephone company or its predecessor ssued securities under the authority of the Commission, it woul( not now find itself without a knowledge of the facts and dependen upon mere estimates. When such showings are required the Com mission will be laying a foundation of information sufficient to enable t to authorize the issuance of securities in certain amounts, and a he same time will also know the amount of money upon whicl nvestors are entitled to receive dividends. Telephone Securities In this connection it seems to me pertinent to this discussion to state briefly the history of various issues of securities by the telephone company since the Nebraska Railway Commission has been in existence, issued under the authority of the Commission. y'he Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company was incorporated ry 2, 1909, the same year that the Legislature passed what i illy known as the "Stock and Bonds Act," which act required blic utilities to get the consent of the Commission before they stocks, bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness run </seg>
            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 235 ning for more than one year, and between the date of its incorpora - tion and June 30, 1909, the day before said stock and bonds act became effective, the said telephone company took over the Lincoln Telephone Company and the Western Telephone Company, both of Lincoln, and the New Home Telephone Company of Beatrice, and had taken large stock holdings in the Johnson County Home Telephone Company and the Crete Telephone Company. Rapre- senting the above properties there were permanent securities, notes and short time paper as follows: Short time paper 77,000.00 Accrued interest and dividends 1,280.42 Accrued taxes 297.99 Audited vouchers 21,222.71 Sundries 976.77 Surplus, six months ending June 30, 1907 15,553.71 Total $1,436,656.60 These properties and the outstanding securities were all taken over on or before June 30, 1909, and before the going into effec of the above mentioned law, and although the Commission hac omplete jurisdiction and control over such matters, no showing was made to the Commission nor a request made for the privilege o onsolidating and taking over said properties, and the Commission was without knowledge as to said transactions. But many of these transactions took place after the passag f the stock and bonds act, and it was self-evident to any thinkin &gt;erson, and I believe the Commission may reasonably be held to hav cnown and surely the telephone company, officered as suggestec bove by trained, educated and experienced men, who had larg xperience in the matters of public utilities and the relations of th ompany to the public, knew that all of these transactions were losely connected with and must enter into any fair and reasonabl adjustment of rates. If the Commission, which we all recognize tood as a judge and arbiter between the public on the one ham and the company on the other, in all matters of rates and in a adjustment between them, was to say to the public, "You shall pa ates sufficient to take care of all operating expenses, maintenance and depreciation, and as well to create a surplus sufficient to pa easonable dividends upon such amounts of money as rightfull nter into the development of the telephone properties," the he company in all fairness must at all times stand read o make full, fair, frank and complete disclosures, even t tetails, as to all its business relations with the public, as to a moneys received and how expended, and it should be prepared t ' apital stock tincoln Telephone Company bonds ■incoln Telephone Company preferred stock . . .

            <seg id="p236">236 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT reasonably prove that the business was handled, moneys received and paid out as stated. Upon June 30, 1909, the company contented itself with filing with the Commission a mere statement that it had property to the amount of $1,436,656.60, and the Commission did not require a further showing. The stock and bonds act above referred to pointed out speci cally that it was the duty of the Commission to protect the pur lasers of stocks and bonds issued by public utilities. Under the onstitutional provision which gave the Commission jurisdiction o ates, service and general control of common carriers, the Commis on already had jurisdiction of the stocks and bonds issued by com mon carriers, and the stock and bonds act simply extended the juris iction to the stocks and bonds issues of all public utilities, includ ng those not usually designated as "common carriers." Prior to le passage of this act, perhaps, there was reasonable ground fo ome difference of opinion as to the duty of the Commission in rela on to such matters, but by the act the duty of the Commission s set out in no uncertain terms. Thereafter, it became the duty o le Commission to know the amount of money invested in buildini ew plants, in improvements and betterments, and for which the ommission is asked to approve the issuance of securities, and to see that money was actually used for the purposes stated, and thi ot only for the protection of the purchasers of the securities o ublic utilities, but also for the purpose of rate-making. If such was ot the meaning of the law, I can conceive of no purpose of the aw, indeed otherwise the law is not only useless but an instrumen '. positive harm, because under it the stocks and bonds of public tilities go out to the purchasers bearing the stamp and approva f the state and he who has no adequate means of investigating justified in believing that careful, painstaking and efficient investi ation has been made by the Commission through its several depart ments of the affairs of the utilities, and that the Commission knows lat the proposed expenditure of money is a reasonably wise one nd that the money is actually used for the purpose stated, and use&lt; lonestly and rightly. If the purchaser believes that such investiga on is made, while in fact little, or even inefficient, investigation is made, he is thereby lulled to sleep in fancied security, thinking he being protected by the state and does not take the care that therwise he would take to protect himself and may thereby be seriously injured. This law places an onerous duty upon the Com mission but it should be done rightly or not at all. Under the new law the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company made its first application on July 9, 1909, to the Commission for authority to issue $100,000 of stock. Omitting the preliminary statement the application contains a brief statement as follows: " That for the extension and betterment of its service, on and prior to the first day of July, 1909, the company had contracted </seg>

[Affidavit and Seal] Thereupon without further requirement, without plans and specifications, or other showing, without referring the application to either the accounting or engineering departments for check, but simply upon the above statement of the company, the Commission ministerially and perfunctorily issued its order granting authority r prayed. (See application No. 79, Special Order No. 555.) On March 14, 1910, the telephone company filed application No. 755, for authority to issue and sell its stock in the amount of $355,800, for the following purposes: "To cover amount of construction work done since July 9, '09 in excess of new stock issue . . $53,800.00 To take up short time paper outstanding July, 1909 77,000.00 To construct additional long distance circuits on existing pole lines 50,000.00 For additional pole lines and long distance cir - cuits in South Platte section of Nebraska 50,000.00 For new, long distance switchboard, local long distance and farm lines in Gage Co 20,000.00 For additional telephones and central exchange equipment in Lincoln 50,000.00 For additional cable, subway and aerial construc - tion in Lincoln and Lancaster County 55,000.00 Total $355,800.00" </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT The above statement is sworn to by Mr. L. E. Hurtz, general manager, and is dated March 12, 1910, and on the 14th day of March, 1910, the very day that said application was received by the Commission, the Commission issued its order authorizing an issue in the above amount. The order contains a re-statement of the above figures and then the finding was made, which is as follows: "And it appearing to the Commission that said Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company was duly incorporated under the laws of Nebraska, January 2, 1909, with an authorized capital of two million, five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000.- 00), which is divided into twenty-five thousand shares (25,000) at the par value of one hundred dollars ($100.00) each, of which amount six hundred forty-six thousand, four hundred seventy- five dollars ($646,475.00) has been issued and is now outstand- ing; that the financial condition of the applicant as of date January 31, 1910, is as follows: Actual cost of plant $1,401,755.64 Buildings and real estate 52,649.64 Furniture and fixtures 3,122.84 Bills receivable 13,539.90 Accounts receivable 26,212.50 Stock of other corporations owned 55,893.96 Material and supplies on hand 45,706.10 Cash on hand and in banks 5,457.94 5,457.94 Other assets 6,357.27 Total assets $1,610,695.79 Common stock issued and outstanding $646,475.00 Preferred stock issued and outstanding (Lincoln Tel.

(Following the above finding the order follows). (See order in application No. 755.) Again, as in the former order granting the authority to issue" and sell stock, no plans and specifications of the properties to be built were required of the company by the Commission nor was the engineering department called in to check up the properties or to make estimates of the probable cost of the properties to be built. </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 239 Again on February 21, 1911, the company filed its application No. 1057 for authority to issue and sell its stock in the amount of $488,745.00, "For the following purposes to-wit: And again, just as in orders Nos. 55 and 755, above referred to, the authority was granted by the Commission. t Again on January 8, 1912, the Commission issued its order thorizing the issuance by the said applicant herein of $2,205,730.00 preferred stock "for the purchase of properties of the Nebraska lephone Company in applicant's territory." "For its extension, consolidation, betterment, new construction and payment of indebtedness, $794, 270. 00" and further for authority to issue and sell its common stock in the amount of $350,000.00, the funds derived from said issue to be used for investments in associated companies." (A step in the right direction was here taken in that detailed .•entories of all the properties taken over from the Nebraska Tele one Company were filed with the Commission, but while I, as s new member of the Commission, voted for the granting of said thority, I am frank to say that it was wrong for several reasons: The inventory property should have been thoroughly checked, tich was not done. 2. As I now understand it, the Lincoln Tele - one &amp; Telegraph Company paid the Nebraska Telephone Ccmpany i% for going value or a premium, or call it by any name, the ce paid was 17}% above the values of the physical properties. Now it seems to me that if the Lincoln exchange of the ebraska Telephone Company was in a failing condition by reason the rates being too low, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corn - any knew that and they would not pay 17} l " 0 premium for the roperties unless they at that time expected to go before the ('om - ission and ask for a rise in rates sufficient not only to take care of he physical properties of that portion of their combined property, ut sufficient also to take care of the 17} 'i premium that was paid or the purchased properties. That being true, the amount of prem - m paid was the direct business of the people. The Lincoln Tele - hone &amp; Telegraph Co. had just as well paid 25'; or 50', premium it was to be taken . care of by a rise in rates so far as the com - any is concerned. Here it was the duty of the Commission to see that the price paid was not more than the people should pay rates pon. Likewise complete inventories and full plans and specifications the extensions and the amounts to be allowed for consolidation, betterments, new construction, etc., should have been furnished and complete investigation as to what created the indebtedness should Sxtensions to exchange $200,000.00 Extension to long distance plant 88,745.00 nvestment in associated companies 200,000.00 Total $488,745.00 488,745.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p240">240 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT iave been made for which the $794,270 was to be allowed. It is very doubtful to my mind whether a charge to permanent capita hould be made for money spent in consolidating two old plants— of course, it takes money to make such consolidations, but there is a vast difference between setting such expenditures up into wha s known as an "amortization account" and gradually charging the arae off out of the operating income and charging it to permanent capital, the former being the proper method. The issuance of $350,000.00 common stock for purchasing stoc n associated companies was entirely wrong — and all the authori es are against it, unless a careful and concise investigation is mad n each particular case as to the value of said stock. It is apparen n the face of it that such stock purchase may prove profitable t le purchasing company on the one hand or on the other hand, i may become a great burden, and it is the business of the patron f the purchasing company and the public in general as to whethe tie utility burdens itself with stock of other companies. I was assured by my associates and the president of the Lincoln Telephon ; Telegraph Company that the issue would have nothing to d with rates, but now I find that there has been an abnormal rise in ates, and that the new rates are sufficient to take care of fixe&lt; barges on all of the outstanding preferred stock and bonds and 7 ' n the common stock. I have gone into the history of the relationship of the company nd the Commission, in order that, taking the whole, a fair deter mination could be reached, and in spite of the space such statemen las taken it is at best but a very brief one; and also to show tha rom the time the Commission was created down to the presen pplication for rise of telephone rates, the Lincoln Telephone i 'elegraph Company, or its predecessors, have never filed with th 'ommission detailed inventories or plans and specifications of th &gt;roperties they proposed to build, nor have they ever submitted t lie Commission a detailed financial statement of the amounts o money spent in the construction of the various properties, to th nd that the accounting and engineering departments of the Com mission could make an intelligent check of the same and determin enerally whether the money supposed to have gone into sue &gt;roperties had gone into them. In fact, the applications of the com •any have never been referred to the said departments, and th Commission has acquired no real knowledge of the affairs of th ompany upon which it could intelligently permit securities to b ssued and sold to the public, or upon which it could make rate or telephone service, which would be equitable alike to the company n the one hand and to telephone users on the other. During the entire period from the organization of the Commis - sion down to the time of the purchase of the Nebraska Telephone Company by the applicant herein, there was never any complaint made by the company to the Commission that rates were inadequate. </seg>
            <seg id="p241">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 241 n fact the company represented to the Commission that it was &gt;rosperous; and certainly the Commission never would have per mitted the company to sell to the public over $4,000,000.00 o ecurities, referred to above, had it known that the rates chargec meant the confiscation of the money that the public was paying or such securities. In the meantime the company advertised its ecurities for sale and represented to the public that the company was prosperous and able to pay good dividends, and upon saic epresentations sold such securities. And following the sale of sucl ecurities the company did pay all of its fixed charges, interest on &gt;onds and outstanding preferred stock, and 8', upon the common tock. It is claimed, however, that nothing has been set aside fo depreciation reserve fund, but it seems to be certain that there would have been a fund for that purpose if all the surplus abov perating expenses had not been paid out on an over capitalization Jnder these circumstances, it seems that but one of two conclusion an be reached: 1. Either that the company has made a sutficien mount to pay the fixed charges and dividends referred to, or second hat the company has sold stock to the public and in return has &gt;aid dividends upon the stock out of the very money the' publi las paid for the stock. If the former conclusion be true, it is dimcul or me to believe it necessary now, that the last competitor is ou f the way, that such a marked and abnormal rise is necessary f the second conclusion is correct, the company has placed itsel n a very embarrassing position and one in which it is not entitle&lt; o the trust and confidence of either the public or the Commission and all its acts and representations in the relation to the need o a rise in rates should receive the strictest of scrutiny by the Com mission. Thus far I have dealt mainly with the history of the company n relation to the Commission, and I have done this for the reason already set out. Now, I come directly to application No. 1637 wherein the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company applied fo the rise in rates in the Lincoln zone. Upon this application the Commission held an extensive hearing and granted the company every possible chance to make showing why it was entitled to the rise applied for, and the company appeared by its officers, its attor neys, local and otherwise, and its experts, brought its bocks am endeavored in every possible way to make a showing why it wa entitled to the rise requested. And after the Commission hac istened patiently for days, it found itself absolutely at sea as to the real facts in the matter, and without the information it needed am could have had if it had started in time and laid the foundation as suggested above, and, as the majority opinion suggests, helpless o get the information from the books of the company. Indeed he company was unable to show how much money had gone into ts plant and the various portions thereof, and how it had expendec he funds received; thus, helpless after the hearing, the Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT &gt;y its majority, fell back upon the estimates of its engineers as to he value of the property and accepted such estimates bodily. In he unhappy position in which it found itself, the Commission mus of necessity have depended much on the estimates of its engineers tut in my opinion such estimates should hare been checked with al cnown facts, and since the telephone company was the applicant n all fairness the burden was upon it to prove the necessity for the ise, and where possible it was up to it to show real conditions, am where there was doubt as to the facts it seems to me that ordi narily such doubt should be resolved in favor of the public. Fo he Commission, in speaking of itself, has, on page 5 of its order lenying a continuance in this case, said: "It has been at all times, and is now, thoroughly imbued with the accepted doctrine that where conflicting interests arise between the common carriers on the one hand and the public on the other, that the Commission acts as the special representa- tive of the public in safeguarding the interests of the public, and that where a reasonable doubt exists as to the proper action to be taken by the Commission determining such conflicting interests, it should be resolved in favor of the public." But, notwithstanding this statement of record, when the apply - ng phone company, with its superior opportunity for knowledge ould not make a clear and complete showing for the rise asked ie Commission permitted it to say, " We do not know," and then ad the engineers of the Commission make an estimate, the accep - ance of which by the Commission, in my opinion, amounts to resolv - ng the doubt in favor of the company, for such estimates are Imost universally liberal so as to be sufficient and not to do injury Now, do not misunderstand me; I do not wish in any wise o cast any shadow of doubt on the integrity of our engineerini epartment. I believe that the department acted in good faith, am hat whatever of fault I have to find with its estimates is with the methods employed and conclusions reached, rather than with the ngineers. And, as suggested above, I believe such estimates shoulc &gt;e only one method of determination, and should be thoroughly hecked by all known facts, and in not doing so it seems to me the 'ommission was derelict. Now I wish to take up as briefly as possible the estimates as urnished the Commission, and to point out some of the matters n which I think them wrong. The Commission's engineers made an ppraisal of the property of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, and of the Nebraska Telephone Company's properties n what is known as the Lincoln zone, which includes exchanges at .incoln, University Place, Bethany, College View, Havelock, Waverly )avey, Malcolm and Raymond, as of the date of June 30, 1912 nd thereafter added to it the extensions and betterments that were made from that time to the time of the hearing, revising their report o as to consolidate into one report their estimates of the consolidatec roperties after the purchase of the Nebraska Telephone Company ly the applicant herein. </seg>
            <seg id="p243">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 243 The applicant made a complete inventory of all its properties in the said zone and filed it with the Commission as a basis upon which the rise in rates was asked. The said inventory is divided (to eight main divisions, which are as follows: 1. Right-of-way and real estate. 2. Buildings and fixtures. 3. Central office equipment. 4. Sub-station equipment. 5. Distribution, line construction. 6. Tools, vehicles and utensils. 7. Stores and supplies. 8. Transportation of men. To these properties the engineers applied certain unit prices. which included an estimated cost of all materials, labor and con- struction and for what is commonly termed the boss on the job. The sum total of the value of all physical properties of the plant was found to be, reproduction new, as follows: Lincoln exchange $1,330,932.54 University "Place and Bethany exchange... 67,333.70 College View exchange 19,886.66 HaveTock exchange 27,136.79 19,886.66 Waverly exchange 4,677.01 Davey exchange 15,534.79 Malcolm exchange 12,114.15 Raymond exchange 2,298.96 Total reproduction new value $1,479,914.60 The engineers likewise found that the total present value of all its tangible properties was $1,098,859.23. Overhead Charges To these values the engineers added arbitrarily certain allow- ances for what are termed overhead charges. These fall under No. 9 and include the following: Item 1. Organization, administration and legal expenses. Item 2. Incorporation fees. Item 3. Occupation fees. Item 4. Stationery and printing. Item 5. Insurance on properties before income period. Item 6. Taxes on property before income period. Item 7. Interest on money invested before income period. Item 8. Engineers and superintendence. Item 9. Contingencies. The total of these nine items, und2r main division No. 9, over- head charges, amounts to reproduction new value, $305,988.27, and present value, $232,559.50. These amounts were added to the repro- duction new value and to the present values respectively, which brought the total value up to: Physical properties, reproduction new $1,479,914.60 Reproduction new overhead charges 305,988.27 Total $1,785,902.87 Present value of physical properties $1,098,859.23 Present value of overhead charges 232,559.50 Total. 232,559.50 Total $1,331,418.73 </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT The Commission says, on page 6 of the opinion as printed am &gt;ublished by the telephone company, that: "The taking of testi mony developed considerable controversy with regard to the ques ion of general expense items entering into the values, and this ontroversy was apparently founded on the suspicion that the amounts allowed for general expense, or so-called overhead items was excessive. The Commission is convinced that the amount o 7.2'; for general expenditures allowed by our engineers is con servative . . . ." And then refers to other commissions and, o ourse, we will take for granted that the Commission means to make this calculation upon the same basis that the commissions do hat are being quoted — a careful analysis of the facts reveals the act that it is not 17.2'; that has been allowed, but a much higher &gt;ercentage. Mr. Sloan and all the experts certainly could not have made a very careful check independently of each other because they all agreed at the time of the hearing that 17.2 'J was the per cent allowed, and that it was the proper per cent, to allow in this case 'he Commission found that the reproduction new of all the physica properties of the plant, less working capital, was $1,410,067.88, am hat the reproduction new value of the overhead charges was $305, 88.27. An application of the ordinary rules of percentage reveals the fact that the percentage allowed on the reproduction new basis is 21.7 'c plus. The Commission has also found that the present value of al he physical properties, less working capital, was $1,029,012.51 nd that the present value of the overhead charges allowed was 232,559.50, and again I find that the percentage allowed on the basis of the present value is 22.6',. In other words, the actua mounts allowed for overhead charge^ on the basis of reproduction new is $63,453.01 more than the 17.2';, and the actual amount allowed on the basis of the present value is $55,566.64 more than he 17.2%. The maximum amount that would be allowed by the Wisconsin Commission in such cases is 12',, which in this case, on the basis of the reproduction new, would amount to $169,208.04. We have allowed $305,988.27, or $136,780.23 more than the 12 r c allowed by the Wisconsin Commission. On the basis of the present value the 12'; allowed by the Wisconsin Commission would amount to $123,481.44. The amount allowed is $232,559.50, or $109,078.06 more than the 12 '^ allowed by the Wisconsin Commission. It seems to me that this is entirely too great an allowance It is true that there are wide differences among the authorities a to such charges, and while some allow part of such items, othe authorities exclude them. But I believe that I am supported by the great weight of authority that 21.7'; upon a reproduction new value </seg>
            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 245 and 22.6% upon present value is too great an allowance and that rrt of the items should not be allowed, or should be greatly pruned. In the case of Cumberland Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company v. City of Louisville, Circuit Court U. S. Western District of Ken- tucky (April 25, 1911), 187 Federal 637 (647 " 'Overhead charges' consist of expenses much of which were incurred long ago. Probably these expenses may have aided very materially in increasing the present value of the plant The present value we must ascertain, but it does not follow that 'overhead charges' as a separate item should be includec as such. It seems to us that they are too intangible to be avail - able for that purpose " Foster, in his work on "Engineering Valuations of Public Utili- ties and Factories," page 20, in discussing overhead charges, says: It is a question in the writer's mind if engineers are not carrying overhead charges to extremes, for in many cases of actual charges to properties constructed, when strict account has been kept, the total of items that may have been considered chargeable to this account is very much less than the percentage frequently used." "A study of the cost of street railways as shown in the reports of the Massachusetts Railroad Commission will aid ver; much in determining the true percentage to charge. These items are all examined by the Commissioners before being allowed as overhead charges, and in a great majority of case: are charges against roadway division of accounts, no charges of any similar nature appearing against any other division The sum of all the items that could be counted as overheac charges in the twenty-five million dollars spent for the equip ment of the New York sub-way amounted to less than This included interest during construction, insurance, engineer ing, taxes and all contingencies. It is time for engineers to bring forward actual figures for these items, actual expenditure for overhead charges, for at present they seem to be far too high, even those offered by the most expert engineers." Let me remind you again that the Nebraska engineers hav allowed more than 21 ' c for overhead charges. The same authority, page 21, quoting from the H. P. Gillette's report on the original cost of the Washington railroads: "One result of the persistence of H. P. Gillette in collecting original costs of the Washington railroads is that the overhead charges are revealed in their true value, as will be seen from the following table: "Overhead charges as determined from the books and accounts of the original cost of the railroads in the state of Washington by H. P. Gillette. "Items including engineering, general expenses, legal ex - penses, insurance, interest during construction, bond expense, taxes and undistributed accounts.

            <seg id="p246">246 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT tHere it will be noted that in one instance the overhead charge tlM% but the average is but 10.045%! whereas our engineers ve allowed in the case under consideration 21.7% upon the repro - ction new value and 22.6% upon the present value. The majority of the Commission, in claiming that 17.2% for verhead charges is conservative, has quoted to a considerable xtent from an address by Mr. Ericson, of the Wisconsin Commis - on, but in this connection, let me call attention to the recent case ' City of Milwaukee v. Milwaukee Railway &amp; Light Company 1 Wis. Com. Rep., wherein the Wisconsin Commission specifically ates that it has never made allowance for overhead charges o ver 12%. In the case of the Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric Light ompany v. City of Lincoln, 182 Fed. 926, (928) (April 6, 1909) ie court allowed but 7.7 9c for overhead charges. In the case at &gt;ar, the Nebraska Commission is allowing on the basis of reproduc on new for overhead charges, 11.7% and on the basis of the present alue, 22.6%. In the case of Hill v. Antigo Water Company Wisconsin Railway Commission's Reports, page 623, decided on ugust 3, 1909, the Commission has allowed 10% for overheat harges. Permit me to call attention to the fact that in this case he Wisconsin Commission has specifically set out the figures and the per cent for overhead charges which is calculated upon the value ' the physical properties of the plant as allowed by the Commis on, after deducting working capital. See also State Journa 'rinting Company et al. v. Madison Gas &amp; Electric Light ompany, 4 Wis. Railway Commission's Report, p. 501-(540) n Re Fon du Lac Water Company, 5 Wisconsin Railway ommission Report, page 500. Now, I am not for a minute con ending that no allowance should be made for overhead charges &gt;ut I do insist that where the greater portion of the propertie ere built, and are now owned and controlled, by the parties now asking for an abnormal rise in rates, that they should be compellec o make a conclusive showing as to such expenditures, that before mere estimates are accepted by the Commission each item shoulc e subjected to the most careful analysis. As to the item under No. 9, space will not permit and I wil not undertake to discuss, in relation to each separate exchange the methods used or all the items allowed for overhead charges but will discuss some of the items as they apply to the Lincoln exchange, the reasoning being the same as to all exchanges. Various Items of No. 9 Item 1 is for organization, administration and legal expenses and the Commission's engineers arbitrarily assume for the purpose of their appraisal that it took two years to construct the Lincoln exchange before a dollar of revenue c?me in from phone users They further assume that an official organization, administrative </seg>
            <seg id="p247">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 247 orces and lawyers would be required during the entire two-year period. They therefore apply for this item an arbitrary of 2 '{ on a) he physical properties, which for the Lincoln exchange alone on the eproduction new amounts to $26,618.64, and upon the entire prop - rty in the Lincoln zone to $29,598.28. (In giving these figures it will be noted that they are not technically the proper ones to use &gt;ecause after such figures were given a certain amount of deductions were made on account of toll duplications, and these figures woulc &gt;e reduced proportionately but my final total figures are the totals of all these figures after said deductions have been made.) The Commission has no evidence before it as to the time required, but feel certain that it was less than two years, and it should not be lifficult of determination, and the applying company now has under ts control all the books and records of this company and its pre ecessors and makes no showing justifying such an allowance Simple good faith on the part of the company would demand a howing to entitle it to the allowance of such sums. Items 2 and 3 are for incorporation and oecupation fees paic and the estimate allows $856.00 for the Lincoln exchange. If such a sum were paid it should justly be charged to capital, but the fact should be easy of determination and the burden is upon the company to show it. Item 4 is for stationery and printing, and here the engineers adopt an arbitrary of one-half of one per cent on all tangible prop - erties of the company within the zone, amounting in the Lincoln exchange to $6,654.66, and in the zone to $7,399.57. Again, the company makes no showing of any such expenditures. Item 5 is for insurance prior to the income period, and here again it is assumed that it would take two years to construct the exchange, and that an insurance charge to capital should be made for that time, and an allowance on the property in the Lincoln exchange is made at $2,096.17. As suggested above, I believe the ime too long and easily determinable and no showing is made by he company justifying it. kltem 6 is for taxes and again arbitrarily the time is fixed at o years, without a showing by the company, and an allowance of ,311.51 is charged to capital. Item 7 is for interest on money invested during construction and before the income period. Here again the two-year period is assumed, and it is assumed that all the money invested lies idle rom the time of the investment until the end of the two-year period Of course, interest should be allowed on the money paid out during he period of construction and equitably should be computed at he full annual rate for one-half of the period of construction. Doubt ess it was necessary for the engineers to adopt some set period as a construction period and apply interest accordingly, and perhaps with right they may be permitted to say that it is no business o theirs to go into the history of an individual plant to learn how long </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT it took to construct, but if that should be admitted for the sak of argument, even under those circumstances, if the duty does no fall upon the engineers, then the accounting department of the Com mission should make the computation and if the company show that a certain portion of its plant was built in a certain period o time then the full annual interest should be computed on the amoun spent for one-half of the period. Of course, as a matter of fac neither the properties of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com pany, nor of any other company, were constructed at one time They were rather constructed by piecemeal. That is, the initia plant is constructed and immediately upon its completion the "ope ating income period" begins, then another section of the extensio to the plant is completed and the income period on it begins, an so on. Under such conditions it is equitable to compute interes and charge it to capital in some such way as follows: Comput interest on the money that went into the initial plant at the fu rate for one-half the time of its construction, and so on with th various extensions. This would call for exact information, whic the company should without question be able to give. Usuall in such plants the longest period cf construction is of the initia plant, because real estate has to be purchased, central office buildin and central office equipment constructed, and during this time certai lines are constructed and put into service as soon as a central completed. Now, once more I am not contending that no interes should be allowed for the period of construction, for I believe a allowance should be made, but only upon such amounts and fo such items for which a reasonable showing is forthcoming. Belo are some cases where such interest has been entirely disallowec Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric Light Co. v. City of Lincoln, supra; People ex rel., New York, O. &amp; W. Railway Co. v. Shaw, 143 App. Div. (N. Y.) 811; 128 N. Y. Sup. Ct., 177. This last case was decided in March, 1911, and in it the court, speaking by Judge Kellogg, said: "We may say in passing that the item of interest was properly rejected by the court as speculative in amount and unsupported by the evidence There is no substantial basis upon which the item of interest may be computed. In the case of Mayhew v. Kings County Lighting Company, 2 N. Y. P. S. C, First District, p. 659 (687) (October 20, 1911), the following is the rule laid down: "As to interest and taxes, a close estimate can be made. Not more than eighteen months would be required to construct so much of the plant as might be necessary for the beginning of operation, according to the testimony of the engineers of the company. This does not mean that the whole undertaking, with all its lines, from the very beginning to the end, would be built in that period, but that the equated period would not exceed that time. The period of construction of the initial unit practically determines the limit. As soon as an operating unit and a few lines are completed, operation of that portion </seg>
            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 249 may begin, and when operation may begin the construction period for that portion ends and when the construction period ends, interest and taxes may no longer be charged to construc - tion cost. They then become charges against income and should be paid out of operating income. As other lines are built and additions made, it is proper to charge interest upon them to capital but only until the property is ready for use, provided good management has been had throughout. Thus, the equated period becomes not the time from the initiation of the idea to the completion of the last remote branch (that may be many years or decades), but the whole weighted average time for the completion of each operating unit, due allowance being made for the cost of such unit. A pure average is not correct, for the amount of interest to be paid has relation, not merely to the period but, to the cost of the work. In the case of the applicant herein, an exchange of 2,800 phones was begun in April and completed in October of the same year am laced in service. Thus, applying the interest rate to this period nterest should be computed on the sum so invested at the full rate or one-half the period, or in this case to about three months or bout one-fourth of the estimated allowance of our engineers, which llowance the Commission accepted. I do not have at hand the ata as to the construction of the various extensions of the plant &gt;ut in all probability they did not exceed the initial period, excep or the construction of the new central building, which I am credibly nformed has taken about one year. So, even if the amount allowet &gt;y the engineers as interest on money invested during the perioc f construction were reduced one-half, I believe that even then the llowance would be entirely in favor of the company, and it seem o me the same line of reasoning will apply equally as well to taxes nd insurance. I would also reduce the item allowed for printing 0%. We now come to item 8 of No. 9, which is an allowance fo ngineering and superintendence. The Commission's engineers take an arbitrary of 10 ' f on the value of all material and labor of the ubstation equipment, including party branch switchboards and sub cribers' stations, distribution exchange lines, etc. I believe the allowance both too high and too extended. For instance, I canno onceive of an occasion for an allowance of 10', for engineering am uperintendence, for the purchase of materials, such as a carloat of poles or of a carload of wire, and many other such examples might be given if time and space permitted. Under this item, eight a reproduction new value of $972,835.38 for the Lincoln exchange t 10%, an allowance to overhead charges is thus made of $97,283.54 nd in the same way is added to the present value an allowance o 73,935.49. About 40 '" c of the value of all telephone properties onstruction is made up of the labor element, and upon that I deem t perfectly proper to add an allowance of 10 9c for engineering ant uperintendence for all such construction work. In the case at bar his would reduce item 8 on reproduction new to $40,686.17, and on present value to $30,922.03. </seg>
            <seg id="p250">250 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Item 9 of No. 9 is an arbitrary allowance of 5% on all the hysical properties set out in Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, above for con - ingencies and omissions. As to such an allowance there is much ifference of opinion among the authorities, some not allowing it t all while others make allowances for the same. The Wisconsin Commission, in leading cases decided, has allowed 3%, while the Oklahoma Commission has excluded it entirely. As shown above he Nebraska Commission allows the applicant 5%. When the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company filed its application for a rise in rates, the Commission required a complete inventory of all its physical properties, and as suggested above, this inventory was for a basis for rates. Under these circumstances I think it bu natural that the company would have been careful to leave ou nothing and to run the showing up just as large as possible, am urely the company was in little danger of leaving out anythini with its skilled engineers, statisticians and accountants, or of no etting the value of its property high enough. But after sue] nventory has been filed the Commission's engineers practically say to the company: "You really must have more property than you think you have and we will allow you 5% more so that nothing s missed. " To my mind this is reducing it to an absurdity, upon which further comment is unnecessary, and I would accordingly ntirely exclude item 9 of No. 9. In fact, the inventory and return f the company should be subjected to most careful scrutiny in rder that the Commission may know that there is not only the mount of property claimed, but that it is of the quality and age epresented. We would thus have the items under No. 9, as foune &gt;y the engineers, reduced to the following amounts for the entir Lincoln zone: The totals, as allowed by the Commission for these items are: Reproduction New Present Value $305,988.27 $232,559.50 The company and our own departments agree that it is impos- Eble from the books of the company to tell the amount of money lat has actually gone into the new plant and how much has gone to replacement of old parts; but at the same time our engineers fofess to be able to tell from those very same books, or from some her source, the ages of the different component parts of the plant, confess that I am unable to see how they did it, because if it terns Reproduction New 1 $14,799.15 2 896.00 3 240.90 4 3,699.22 5 1,078.45 6 2,656.78 7 42,427.50 8 40,686.17 Present Value $12,895.31 886.00 178.48 2,743.05 813.28 1,988.97 31,453.99 30,922.03 Total $106,484.17 $81,881.11 Total. 106,484.17 </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 251 were possible to know the age of each particular part of the plant, hen you would also know when that particular part of the plant was constructed and it would be known whether it was a construe tion which was an extension and betterment to the plant or whether t was a replacement. It seems to me that if one could be told, the other could be as easily ascertained, but lack of space prohibits urther discussion of the matter. Unit Prices Now, to this complete inventory of the physical properties in he Lincoln zone of the applicant, as mentioned above, the Com - mission's engineers applied what are known as unit prices to all the material and labor shown in said inventory, and thereby found the alue of all said physical properties reproduction new to be $1,479, 14.60 and the present value, $1,098,859.23, as repeatedly set out bove. Now, it must appear at once that it is extremely important what these unit prices are, for they are the constant multiple applie&lt; o the various kinds of items, and as thus adopted have been appliec o the phone systems of the state, and it seems to me should be ested out most critically to see if they are the right ones. I cannot ake up the unit prices separately, but they have seemed to me to be oo high and to overbalance in favor of the companies. The Com mission has on file the complete inventories and sworn statements f a large number of telephone companies throughout the state, in which inventories the said companies are required to make complete howings as to their properties and to make statements as to the eproduction new value and the present value of their properties nd these statements are under oath. One would naturally thinl hat under the circumstances the companies would make such state ments as favorable to themselves as is consistent with the truth When these inventories are received the Commission's engineers pply their unit prices to the various items and make returns to the 'ommission as to the reproduction new value of the propertie nd to the present value of the same. Now, it would seem that a tudy of the returns of the companies as compared with the finding f the engineers would throw some light on the matter of uni &gt;rices. Of course, I cannot give any great number, but those tha lave been taken have been chosen at random, and I believe are airly representative of the entire state. In the comparison below he reproduction new value is above and the present value below Company iurchard Telephone Co R. P $12,460.07 P 9,398.14 lagnet Independent Tel. Co.. R.

            <seg id="p252">252 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Thus, the total reproduction new value of the above properties found by the engineers, is compared with those of the companies t will be noted that a part of the companies have not given their eproduction new value, or at least have given but one value, am such cases I have not counted that value on either side of the olumn. The engineers' reproduction new value of the above prop - rties amounts to $375,021 plus. The companies' valuation is 290,830. The engineers' value exceeds that of the companies by 84,191.00, which makes the engineer's reproduction new value omething over 28 c / c more than the companies' sworn value. We so find the engineers' present value of these properties to be $392, 24.00; and the companies' present value to be $306,612.00; en neers' valuation exceeding by $86,112.00. Here again we find that le engineers' valuation exceeds the companies' sworn value by some hing over 2h Now, I am not contending that the above mentioned sworn eturns of these companies situated throughout the state are the rue valuations of their properties, and if said companies were pplying for authority to issue stocks and bonds or for the purpose f fixing rates, I would think it the duty of the Commission to have he properties carefully checked and the showing analyzed, but ] io feel certain that said showings are favorable to the several com - panies and that if said showings were accepted by the Commission he companies would not be injured, and when, as found here, the Commission's engineers make findings more than 28 ' ( higher than he claims of the companies as to both reproduction new and presen •alues, it seems to me that it should cause any reasonable man to top and think and that the Commission should take judicial notice of the fact, and that a searching investigation should be made o find the difficulty. For, if the Commission continues to apply he present "unit price" to the phone systems over the state i will thereby be laying a grievous burden upon the people of the tate and in my opinion be subjected to very severe criticism.

            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 253 gineers are at least 28 'j too high. In dividing the reproduction new value as found by the engineers by 1.28 we have $1,785,907.74; 1.28 equals $1,395,240.00 as the reproduction new value and divid - ing the present value as found by the engineers by 1.28 we have $1,331,418.73 ♦ 1.28 equals $1,040,170.00 plus, as the depreciated or present value of the property. Now, going to the question of operating expenses. I am of the pinion that this cannot be correctly ascertained at the present lme on account of the chaotic condition of the business during the rocess of combining the two plants and that the correct amount can nly be determined after the plant is running under normal condi - ions. The Commission has allowed 9', on the reproduction new alue of the plant for current maintenance and depreciation, anc lere I wish to say that there is a vast difference as to whether the ' j is figured on the reproduction new value or upon the present alue of the plant. In some of the leading cases the present value s used for making the estimates for maintenance and depreciation fter deducting real estate and stores and supplies. However, it makes no difference whether a certain per cent is calculated upon the &gt;resent value after deducting real estate and stores and supplies o raise a definite sum of money to take care of such items, or a mailer per cent is calculated upon the larger value, but I have &gt;een unable to find a precedent in telephone cases where 9', has &gt;een allowed upon the reproduction new value, including real estate working capital and stores and supplies. From the authorities tha have examined I am convinced that the allowance is above th normal and it is much above the amounts that the applicant has pent in the past for such purposes. However, I think it is gen rally admitted that there are abnormal conditions that will hav o be taken care of. For instance, the three-wire system will hav o be converted into the two before adequate service can be given and of course this will take a large amount of money, which wi lave to come from somewhere. Other abnormal expenses will hav o be met that have not as yet been taken care of by reason o he consolidation of the two plants and I have no doubt but tha he 9'; will be allowed on account of such extra expenses. Bu under normal conditions 8%, when calculated upon the reproduc tion new value including real estate, working capital and stores anc supplies, is certainly sufficient. Real estate does not depreciate the new central building not more than t%; the underground con duits not more than 2 or 3't, and so an allowance of 9' ( for curren maintenance and depreciation leaves a very large amount to tak care of the more depreciable property, such as poles, cross-arms wire, instruments on the walls, etc. Eight per cent will reproduc any plant in its entirety in a period of twelve and a half years. tOne case quite comparable to the one at bar in the matter operating expenses including taxes, insurance, current main - nance and depreciation is that of the Cumberland Telephone </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT &amp; Telegraph Company v. City of Louisville, supra. The value of the property involved in that case is much greater than the property of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company in the Lincoln zone, exclusive of toll lines, and in that case after a careful study of all operating expenses, includirg taxes, insurance and current maintenance and depreciation, the court allowed $235,664.27 per year, while the Nebraska Commission in the case at bar allowed for the same items $265,040.82 on a much smaller property. The Commission has allowed the applicant 1 ' ', interest as a et return to the stockholders, and with this I would have no crit cism to make if the company were delivering first-class commercia service to its patrons, but if service is to be considered then I thinl lie company should be content with 6'; net return after all operat ng expenses, taxes, insurance, losses, current maintenance am epreciation have been paid for out of the operating income, and hink the Commission would hesitate to make such an abnorma ise in rates that the stockholder may receive T" c net unless there was no doubt that the company was capable of delivering first-class service to its patrons. As has already been pointed out, the Commission has said as matter of record, "It has been at all times and is now thoroughly mbued with the accepted doctrine that where conflicting interests arise between the common earner on the one hand and the public on the other that the Commission acts as the special representative of the public in safe-guarding the interests of the public, and tha where a reasonable doubt exists as to the proper action to be taken &gt;y the Commission determining such conflicting interests, it shoulc b« resolved in favor of the public." In the light of this very praise worthy sentiment, let us take a brief review of what the Commission has done in the present case. It surely did not act as the special representative of the public n perfunctorily and ministerially allowing the applicant to issue more than 4,000,000 of securities; and surely it did not resolve the doubt in favor of the public when it allowed $305,988.77 to be added o the physical property value or overhead charges, which amount o approximately 22% on the physical properties, while leadini authorities place such allowance at 12' ( or less. Most certainly the Commission did not resolve the doubt in favor of the public when i accepted in toto the value of the applicant's property as determinec &gt;y the estimate of the Commission's engineering department when sligh nvestigation of the records of the Commission would show that sait engineers were placing the telephone properties of the state at an amount about 28 'o greater than the property owners' own sworn statement placed them. Once more the Commission did not resolv he doubt in favor of the public when it allowed 9% of the repro luction new value, including real estate, working capital and stores and supplies for current maintenance and depreciation when it i much above the normal. Once more the Commission did not resolv </seg>

In brief, these are some of the reasons why ould not consent to the request of the applicant herein. Neithe me nor space permit me to develop the matters referred to as ley should be set out for a proper understanding and I fear tha n some places, owing to the brevity of statement, I may be mis nderstood, but I trust that in the main I have made myself clear "hroughout the opinion there have been underlined portions in the uotations given; very largely they are my own and do not appea n the originals. I most profoundly hope that there is nothing in whac I have aid that will do any injury to any, for I have undertaken to discuss his matter in a spirit of candor, and wishing to do equity to the company on the one hand and the public on the other, but this is a matter in which the public is vitally interested, and it has a right to know why its representatives take the position they do so I feel that I am simply doing my duty in discussing the matter as I see it.

ORDER SYLLABUS: While the Commission, under the constitutional amendment creating it, might, in the absence of specific legislative enactment restricting it, and in the exercise of its authority in the approving of stock and bond issues, withhold its approval of such issues of. a proposed competing public utility, on the ground that </seg>
            <seg id="p256">256 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT the public convenience did not require the construction of such utility; Held, That the exercise of such authority involves such grave responsibility and is so far-reaching in its effects that the Commis - sion will not exercise it unless specifically directed so to do by the legislature; Held Further, That were the Commission to assume such authority, the facts developed in this case, upon the petition of inter - vention of the receiver and bondholders of a partially competing utility, would not justify the Commission in withholding its approval of applicant's petition on such ground. Upon petition for authority to issue bonds and stock, to provide funds for the construction of an interurban railway; Held, That the questions for the Commission to determine are, whether the purposes for which it is desired to expend the proceeds of such securities, will promote the public weal, are within the terms of the statute, to- wit, "for the acquisition of property, the con - struction, completion, extension or improvement of facilities, or for the improvement or maintenance of its service, or for the discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations," and are "reasonably required for the said purposes"; . Held Further, That the construction of the line in question is for the public good, and the securities applied for such be approved subject to the conditions specified in the order. The rule of caveat emptor applies to purchasers of securities authorized by this Commission. Such purchasers are not exempt from the business risks involved in the possibility of the corporation issuing the securities being over-capitalized. The approval by the Commission of the issuance of securities does not constitute a guaranty in any way that rates may be charged by such corporation to enable it to pay dividends at any given rate upon its entire capitalization. Whenever the Commission is called upon to exercise its rate - making power, its action will be controlled by the amount of money shown to have actually been invested and the fair value of the property devoted to public uses, regardless of the amount of securi - ties outstanding. Appearances: Harvey Musser, for Applicant. Brown, Baxter &amp; Van Dusen and Brome &amp; Brome for Intervenors, Receiver, Bondholders and Creditors of the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company. Clarke, Chairman: On January 3, 1913, the applicant herein filed its petition requesting an order of the Commission authorizing it to issue its 5% bonds in the amount of two million two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($2,250,000.00) and its capital stock in the amount of eight hundred fifty thousand dollars ($850,000.00), for the purpose of constructing and equipping its projected line of railway between Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska. Public notice of said application was given and a hearing had at the office of the Commission on January 15, 1913. Many peti - tions were filed with the Commission by citizens and various organ- </seg>
            <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 257 izations in the cities and towns on or near the proposed line, urging its construction and that favorable action be taken by the Com - mission in authorizing it to issue such securities as it might deem just and proper. On January 21, 1913, following the hearing upon the application attorney for the bondholders' committee of the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company and for the receiver and creditors of said com pany, filed a motion protesting against the approval of said securities the grounds for such protest being substantially as follows: 1. That the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company already has an electric railroad running from Omaha to Papillion, which to all intents and purposes parallels the route of the proposed Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice line. 2. That this railway as now constructed ant equipped, furnishes adequate facilities for the accommodation o the public in carrying passengers and express between the village of Papillion and the cities of South Omaha and Omaha. 3. That the business between these points is now divided between the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company and the Union Pacific Railway Com - pany, and to allow the construction of another line will operate to so materially reduce the revenues of the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company as to compel it to operate at a loss, or abandon its prop - erty. 4. That at small expense it would be possible to make changes in grade and slight changes in route of the line of the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company, so as to meet and fulfill the plans and purposes of the Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway Company for a high grade through line from Papillion to South Omaha, anc at a cost much less than that necessary for the construction of an entirely new line. For these and other reasons the intervenors ask the Commission to withhold approval of the stocks and bonds o the Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway Company, save and except that such approval be conditioned upon the purchase by the Omaha Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway Company of the existing property o: the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company, at a fair and reasonable price to be determined after a full hearing before the Commission A hearing on this motion was had before the Commission on January 22 and 23, 1913, at which testimony was received from the civil engineer who had charge of the survey and the establishment of grades of the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company, the receiver of the company, and numerous residents of Ralston, Papillion, Homestead and Omaha. The motion of the intervenors is an assumption that the Com - mission has authority to prohibit the building of a competing public tility if it shall appear that the construction of such utility is not matter of public necessity and convenience. Such authority is xercised by the Commissions of a number of states, notably Wis - onsin and New York, having been conferred upon them by statutory rovisions, and it is possible that under the act of the constitution reating this body this Commission would be justified in claiminf 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p258">258 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Eat jurisdiction, but the authority involves such grave responsi - ity and is so far-reaching in its effects that we do not care to sume it unless specifically directed so to do by the legislature. After considering the evidence adduced at the hearing, the Com mission is clearly of the opinion that the motion of the intervenor tiould not be granted. The Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway Company has already purchased right-of-way, made surveys, con tructed a grade, and made other substantial investments involvin n expenditure of upwards of sixty thousand dollars ($60,000.00 n the line starting at South Omaha and extending westward toward 'apillion and the Platte River, a considerable portion or all of whic would have to be sacrificed and abandoned should the route b hanged to the lines suggested by the intervenors. This work was one and this expenditure incurred in the year 1906, five years revious to the building of the line of the Nebraska Traction &lt; 'ower Company. In the matter of priority, therefore, the advantag s clearly with the O. L. &amp; B. Moreover, the original articles o ncorporation of the O. L. &amp; B. plainly indicate that it was th urpose of that company to build a through line between Lincol nd Omaha, while it is apparent, if the character of its presen ine is any criterion, that the ob.ect of the incorporators of th Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company was not to construct a hig rade, through line connecting these points, the route, as indicatec n their articles of incorporation, extending only from Omaha t lalston and thence in a southerly direction through Sarpy county no terminal point being named. The road, as a matter of fac was first built to Ralston and later extended to Papillion. It is matter for serious doubt on the part of the Commission whethe he route now followed by the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Compan s feasible for a modern, high-speed, interurban, such as is contem plated by the O. L. &amp; B. The intervenors concede that it coul&lt; not be made so without extensive alterations in grade, involving onsiderable expenditure of time and money, and it is also admitte hat over two miles of the line would have to be abandoned i rder to secure a satisfactory entrance into the city of Omaha 'o require the applicant to sacrifice sixty thousand dollars J60.000.00) worth of its own property and acquire a line, a portio f which it could not use and most of which is unsuited to its pur oses, would obviously be inequitable and unjust. So objectionabl s the route of the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company from a ngineering standpoint that Mr. Musser, arguing for the applicants asserted that his company would prefer to re-establish its 'ine so as to avoid Papillion, rather than attempt to adapt it to the class f road proposed by him. Nor is it by any means certain that th onstruction of the defendant's line would seriously impair the reve - ues of the Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company, for the reaso tiat after leaving Papillion it would not touch Ralston or Home tead, and would therefore be a competitor of the intervenors a </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 259 Papillion only. A portion of the Papillion traffic would undoubtedly be diverted to the new line, but it does not seem probable that this decrease in revenue would be sufficient to imperil the existence of the road already in operation, particularly since the new line cannot be placed in operation inside of two years, during which "time the traffic at Ralston and the other points would probably be increased to a point where the anticipated loss would be largely overcome. This corporation was organized in March, 1903, with an author - iced capital stock of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00). Its articles of incorporation made no limitation on the amount of its indebtedness. On May 12, 1904, the applicant, pursuant to the unanimous pproval and direction of all the subscribers to its capital stock, nd directors filed with the Secretary of State of Nebraska amended articles, increasing the capital stock of the company to two million wo hundred-fifty thousand dollars ($2,250,000.00). Public notice of uch action was published for sixty days, as required by law. The location and termini of the road, as set forth in the articles f incorporation, "shall be Omaha, Douglas county, Nebraska, am point at the southwest corner of Gage county, Nebraska, said line o run through the city of Lincoln, with authority to construct sucl &gt;ranch lines in said state of Nebraska as may hereafter be deter mined; said main line to run through the counties of Douglas arpy, Cass, Saunders, Lancaster and Gage, and, if the actual survey tiall render such location necessary, through Johnson, Pawnee aline or Jefferson county." The applicant started the construction of its line, purchasing nd contracting for right-of-way and now has equipped and operatin pproximately five and one-half miles of road between the city o -incoln and the cities of Bethany and University Place. It als las a considerable amount of right-of-way and road-bed alread onstructed near South Omaha. The moneys spent and investet on the eastern end of its line, which is not now in use but which wi &gt;e utilized upon the completion thereof, aggregate as heretofor eferred to, approximately sixty thousand dollars ($60,000.00). kThe general balance sheet filed by the applicant with the Com - ission, November 25, 1912, through its president and secretary, r the year ending June 30, 1912, is as follows: Assets Cost of railway: Roadbed and tracks $112,419.45 Electric line construction, including poles, wiring, feeder lines, etc 23,723.82 Engineering and other expenses incident to construction 22,002.25 Total Cost of Railway Owned $158,145.52 </seg>

The engineering department of the Commission has made a detailed valuation of the property now in actual operation, to-wit, between Lincoln and Bethany, and reports its value, as of July 1, 1911, as follows: Reproduction new, $204,492.14; present or depre- ciated value, $178,101.04. This portion of the line has been operated since about August, 1906. The completion of the line was discontinued at that time by reason of the death of Henry Robinson, who was financing the </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 261 company. Until this time his estate and associates have been unable to secure the capital needed to complete the line. On December 30, 1912, the Northern Construction Company of Detroit, Michigan, offered in writing to complete the construction of said line from Lincoln to Omaha, and completely equip the same ready for operation, in consideration of the delivery to the saic Construction Company of eight hundred fifty thousand dollars $850,000.00) par value of the common stock and two million two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($2,250,000.00) par value of the thirty-year five per cent (5',) gold bonds of said company. While the time set within which the applicant should accept aid offer has passed, the Commission is advised by the applican hat it remains open, and if the necessary authority is granted the roa&lt; will be constructed and ready for operation on or before January 1, 191-5. The applicant filed with the Commission its preliminary engineer ng plans, drawings, specifications and maps, which the Commis sion's engineers state are as complete in form and detail as those usually required of railroad engineers by their finance committees or executive officers for approval prior to entering upon the actua work of construction. The cost of the completed property, as disclosed by these estimates, is: Tangible property, including labor $2,379,445.00 Engineering, superintendence, legal and administration expenses, 10 So of $2,124,445.00 212,444.00 Contingencies, "5% 106,222.00 Interest on money during construction, 6 r &lt;, two years. . 160,000.00 Discounts and commissions 404,790.00 Total $3,238,300.00 tMr. Hurd, chief engineer for the Commission, when questioned nder oath as to whether he had examined and checked the data nd estimates submitted by the applicant, stated: "A. — I have. I was the engineer who was originally em ployed by Mr. Robinson to place the property, and am very familiar with all the estimates that ever have been made on it and I had several made very carefully myself at different times We had a very complete amount of engineering information surveys, etc., to base it on, and this present estimate of these construction companies' engineers is built up largely on the quantities that we found to be proper, modified to the exten of a little wider embankments and a little more expensive construction on almost every item. That is, the embankmen is wider, the weight of the rail is heavier, and of course the cost of all the material and labor from the time my last estimate to this estimate would somewhat change, and I think there has been an allowance for that, and there is more in equipmen and considerably more power provided for at the central station than was provided for in any former estimate which I made so using that as a basis, which I consider as accurate as coul&lt; be made by a preliminary investigation, prior to the actua </seg>
            <seg id="p262">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT placement of the property as to cost, I could not suggest a very great deal of change about it one way or the other. Of course any preliminary estimate is subject to modification in its parts or in its entirety, after the property is actually placed, but from the best engineering advice we can bring to bear on it, I cannot say that I can criticise it severely in any way. "Q. — Exclusive of the general overhead items, such as superintendence, organization, legal expenses, engineering, con - tingencies, interest during construction, and discounts and com - missions for financing, can you state what you would think a reasonable estimate for the cost of this property would be as outlined in their plans and specifications? "A. — I consider that their figures there are not very far off. " Q. — You think the actual cost of the property, exclusive of the items I have mentioned, with the possible exception of donations of real estate or right-of-way, will approximate $2,379,- 445.00? "A. — I deem that estimate fairly proper." The percentages for engineering, superintendence, legal anc administration expenses, contingencies, interest during construction discounts and commissions are those usually applied to the estimates of cost of the physical property in order to determine the approxi mate final costs. The final cost may be more and it may be less Prior to entering upon the work of construction, it is proposec hat said bonds, in the sum of two million two hundred fifty thou and dollars ($2,250,000.00), bearing interest at the rate of five pe cent (5%), payable semi-annually, secured by trust deed, runnini o the Equitable Trust Company, of New York, or to such othe rust company as may be substituted therefor, equally responsible nd said stock in the amount of eight hundred fifty thousand dollars $850,000.00), par value, be delivered to the construction company hat the construction company shall not sell any portion of sait onds or stock so acquired to the public in general until the line o oad herein contemplated shall have been completed, but that saic onstruction company shall have the right to pledge said bond nd stock as* collateral security for the purpose of securing money or the carrying on of the construction, equipping and completion o he said line. Such proposition does not appeal to the Commission as properly afeguarding the applicant or the public. We are of the opinion hat the securities in question should only be delivered to the con truction company in such amounts from time to time as it is made to appear to the Commission, upon the certificate of the prope officer of the applicant and the Commission's engineer, showing tha an amount of money equal to or greater than the amount of securi ties so required has been expended in the construction and equipping of said line. If it is desired by the applicant to place the said securities in the hands of the Equitable Trust Company of New York, or some other trust company of like standing, same to be delivered to the construction company in such amounts and at such times as the </seg>
            <seg id="p263">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 263 Commission may by special order authorize, it will be approved by the Commission. It may develop, upon entering upon the actual construction of said line, that the applicant may deem it necessary, in the exercise of good business judgment, to modify its present plans, thereby decreasing or increasing the actual cost of the property. The Commission is of the opinion that the applicant or trustee hould be authorized to deliver to the construction compsry, at periods of not less than thirty days each, the securities of the appli - cant in the proportion of seventy-eight per cent (78'j) of bonds anc wenty-two per cent (tt%) of stock, equal to 90 '&lt; of the amount f money shown by the certificate of the applicant and Commis - ion's engineer to have been actually expended on the property ncluding interest during construction and an allowance of twelve and one-half per cent (12J'&lt;) for financing, which is submitted in he estimates under the head of " Discounts and Commissions." For example, if the said certificate shows the actual moneys xpended and previously unreported aggregate one hundred thousanc ollars ($100,000.00), the amount of securities to be delivered to the onstruction company, including twelve and one-half per cent (12 or cost of financing, will in round figures approximate eighty thou - and one hundred fifteen dollars ($80,115.00) of bonds and twenty wo thousand seven hundred thirty-five dollars ($22,735.00) of stock kit is not proposed to issue any securities on account of the cost the property already constructed, which is included in the estimate, til such time as the entire line is completed and in operation. Upon the filing with the Commission of the proper certificate &gt;y the applicant and the Commission's engineer, showing the com )Ietion and equipping of the line ready for operation, the Commis - sion will authorize the issuance and delivery to the construction company, in the proportions above set forth, the said securities sufficient in amount as to cover: First, all moneys expended by i during construction for which it has not received consideration second, the cost of the existing property for which no securities have &gt;een issued; third, the fair and reasonable value of any services performed in the organization and construction of said line, no &gt;reviously accounted for. The Commission, by reason of the magnitude and importance of the proposition herein involved, deems it proper and necessary to require the* construction company to keep within the state o Nebraska, subject to the inspection of the Commission, its books papers and vouchers showing in detail all the items of cost of con truction of said line. In the allowance of twelve and one-half per cent (12J';&gt; fo financing a proposition such as the one under consideration, the Commission is not to be understood as taking the ground that such an allowance is proper in every case. Each case must stand on its own merits. If a person, or group of persons, or a corporation </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT were to build this line from the funds at their disposal, withou &gt;eing compelled to resort to banks, trust companies or brokerage louses, to place their securities in order to raise the money necessary o finance the project, we would have an ideal situation, which woulc obviate the necessity of considering or making allowance for financ ng coming under the head of discounts and commissions. Such is not the case at hand. The applicant, after years o ffort in attempting to finance its proposition, has at last succeedec n finding a construction company, which will undertake he construction and equipping of the line on the basis of the estimate heretofore set forth. This construction company in turn will not only have to use its own credit and resources, but will be ompelled to place the securities received from applicant with banks r trust companies as collateral to secure the moneys necessary to omplete the undertaking as the work progresses. When we conside he character of this undertaking, the element of risk, the fact tha he bonds run for thirty years on the one hand, and on the othe land that the farmer in this state is required to pay from one to wo and a half per cent (1 to t|%) commission for obtaining a five year farm mortgage loan, on 40 c ' c of the value of his land, we hole he allowance just and reasonably necessary. It may be contended that the Commission, in the exercise o ts discretion, should not authorize the issuance of any amount o londs on a property, and particularly in the amount herein author ed, unless it is clearly satisfied that the operating revenues of the pplicant will be sufficient to provide a reasonable net income over nd above its expenses, taxes and the fixed charges on its bonds 'his would be undoubtedly true if the authority granted by the ommission to issue such securities carried with it any guarantee n the part of the state that the earnings of the company would be ufficient to pay any given return on the money invested in the &gt;roperty. The statute under which we are operating authorizes the ommission only to determine whether or not the issuance of the securities applied for is reasonably necessary for the acquisition o •roperty, the construction, completion, extension or improvement o acilities, or the improvement or maintenance of its service, or fo le discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations, and the fact lat a part of the stock of a corporation outstanding at any time las been issued with the approval of the Commission, cannot be hel&lt; o constitute a guaranty in any way that rates may be charged by uch corporation to enable it to pay a dividend -at any given rate pon its entire capitalization. If we were satisfied that this project could be financed on a more favorable basis, both as to the proportion of bonds to the tota capitalization and the discounts and commission for securing the needed money, we would unhesitatingly insist on the more favorable basis, but in the absence of such we cannot refuse the applicant the necessary authority, under the facts disclosed in this case. </seg>
            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 265 tThe New Hampshire Commission, in passing upon the petition the Milford Light &amp; Power Company to issue certain securities, ided December 30, 1911, had occasion to pass upon a statute ilar to our own. In the course of its opinion it held: "The purpose of placing issues of stock and bonds by public utilities and railroad corporations under the supervision of the Commission is not indicated in the statute except by the pro - vision that "'Upon petition the Commission shall, after public notice and hearing, determine the amount of stocks or bonds which in its opinion is reasonably requisite for the purposes for which the issue is to be made.' "The inclusion of this provision in the statute was doubtless caused by the belief that in the past public service corporations have sometimes issued capital stock greatly in excess of the value of their properties devoted to public uses, and have then sought to collect from the public rates sufficient to enable them to pay dividends upon all of such stock. To prevent issues of stock or bonds in the future for speculative purposes or to afford opportunities for promoters' profits beyond the fair value of services in promotion, we take it to be clearly the purpose of the statute. Beyond that we do not take it that we can go on consistently with the best interests of the public. "The fact that a utility has outstanding stocks and bonds to a greater amount than the value of its plant and works does not enable that utility to make additions and improvements without cost. If it does not have money in its treasury with which to make such improvements the only practicable way in which it can secure the same is to issue securities. If additions and improvements are reasonably necessary to enable it to meet the demands of the public for service, the public good demands tha sueh securities shall be issued wholly irrespective of the amoun of securities already outstanding. "When an application is made to this Commission fo authority to issue securities, we take it that the questions fo the Commission to determine are whether the purposes for whic it is desired to expend the proceeds of such stock or bonds are such purposes as will promote the public good, and whethe the amount of securities proposed to be issued is reasonabl requisite for those purposes. The kind of securities and th form in which they are to be issued may also be subject t the supervision of the Commission. " Inasmuch as the approval of a proposed issue of securities for any purpose does not involve a determination that the property of the corporation making such issue devoted to public uses is fairly worth the total amount of its securities outstand - ing, it follows that such approval cannot at any time be urged as a reason for allowing the corporation to charge rates sufficient to enable it to pay dividends at any given rate on such securi - ties. " Whenever the Commission is called upon to exercise its rate-making powers it must be governed by the fair value o the property devoted to public uses in the performance of th service for which a rate is to be fixed. In determining such fai value the amount of stock and bonds outstanding, if entitle&lt; to consideration at all, is entitled to very slight consideration and the question whether the issuance of such stock and bone or any part of the same has been with the approval of an regulatory Commission, cannot be entitled to any weight a </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT all, because it will not be relevant to the question of the fair value of the property involved." In other words, the rulfe of caviat emptor applies to an investor purchasing the securities, the issuance of which is regulative by a commission. So far as we are advised, this rule is applied by all commissions administering similar laws. By reason of the public interest in the question at hand, we deem it pertinent to quote the following quotation from the report made November 1, 1911, to the president of the United States by the Railroad Securities Com mission: " Many, if not most, of the abuses connected with railroac securities arise out of an almost universal failure to recogniz the distinctions which exist and should exist between bonds ant stocks. A bond is an obligation to pay a fixed sum of none at a stated time. A stock certificate is merely the evidence o ownership of a share in the property, profits, and risks of corporation. Most of the evils of which investors and the publi complain have grown out of the attempt to give to stock a fac value in terms of money. Even if the state laws prohibitin the issue of stocks for less than par value were literally enforced a that the recitals on the face of a fully paid share of stock as to its par or money value would signify is that at the time o the issuance of the share there had been paid into the corporatio an amount of money (or other valuable consideration) equa to the par value of the share. They do not even purport t indicate that at any time after the original issue of the stoc the corporation was possessed either of the money or the money' worth. The real value of the stock certificate depends upo the manner in which the money has been invested. The Com mission is, therefore, of the opinion that it is far mor important to ascertain just what are the facts connectec with the issue of securities and what is actually don with whatever money has in fact been realized from th stock which is issued, than merely to make sure tha the par value of the stock was paid in at the time o issue. "If we were compelled to assume that rates are to be materially influenced either in their making by the railroads or in their regulation by the Government by the amount and face value of the stocks and bonds outstanding, it seems to your Commission impossible to escape the conclusion that these securities should be issued only under governmental regulation Your Commission, however, believes that the amount and face value of outstanding securities has only an indirect effect upon the actual making of rates, and that it should have little i any weight in their regulation. "In so far as the value of the property is an element in rate regulation, the outstanding securities are of so little eviden tiary weight that it would probably be of distinct advantage if courts and commissions would disregard them entirely, excep as a part of the financial history of the property, and woulc insist upon direct evidence of the actual money invested am of the present value of the properties." t While, as above stated, the jurisdiction vesting in the Com - ssion the power to regulate the issuance of securities does not nstitute a guarantee of any given return on such investments, it </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 267 goes without' saying that it may and should require a reasonable showing that the earnings of any given project, in such cases treason - able allowance being made for sufficient time to develop its business i, will be sufficient to pay its operating expenses, taxes, depreciation charges and interest on bonds. This showing was made to the Commission, and is included in this report as a matter of public interest, and a possible guide to investors. The Falkenau Electrical Construction Company o Chicago, in its report on the proposed project, dated June 6, 1907 which was two years prior to the taking effect of our Stock anc Bonds Act, presents four distinct and independent methods of pre - determining the probable earnings of the project at that time These methods were: Predetermination No. 1 "It is well known that while the gross earnings per car mile fluctuate greatly and give no criteria for comparison, the operating expense per car mile of interurban electric systems throughout the United States are remarkably uniform and do not vary greatly from about thirteen cents per car mile. "The probable number of car miles that will be operated per annum, aggregate 1,153,000. "If we apply this figure of thirteen cents per car mile as the cost of operation to 1,153,000 car miles, allowing 55% for the operating percentage, we obtain as the gross annual revenue from passengers $272,536.00 "To this figure there may be safely added a sum equivalent to about $500.00 per mile over a distance of fifty miles as representing gross revenue derived from freight, express, baggage, and mail service^ or . . 25,000.00 Total from all sources $297,536.00 Predetermination No. 2 "Reference to the population table given on page 30 will show the population served per mile of road-bed both including and excluding terminals. "In view of the fact that a considerable proportion of this population is represented by terminal cities, it has been deemed fair to assume as a basis for determining the revenues per capita to grant each important terminal city a certain percentage of population as being directly tributary to the line. "It will be noted that this percentage has been taken very conservatively and has resulted in an equivalent population per mile of road-bed of 851 which figure does not include the intermediate farming population. "A careful comparison of the characteristics of this line made with lines similarly located, with regard to population, terminals, and with due allowance for character of country traversed, indicates clearly that a gross annual income of $6. SO per inhabitant served, including only a small percentage of the total terminal population, may confidently be expected. "This will aggregate less than $1.50 per capita for the entire population served. </seg>

AMENDED ORDER In its original and supplemental order heretofore entered herein the Commission, among other things, required that the securities applied for by petitioner should not be issued or turned over to the 'construction company in payment for the acquiring, construction and equipping of said line of railway except in such amounts as the Commission shall, by special order, authorize upon the presenta tion of a certificate signed by the president or engineer of the railway company, and by the Commission's engineer, showing the amount of money expended in the construction of peimanent improvements or in additions to the property including equipment*' Applicant in support of its petition for a modified order alleged it to be a fact, and showed that it had for a number of years en - deavored to finance the completion of its line without success; that finally it had secured from the Northern Construction Company of Detroit an offer to complete the acquisition and construction and equipping of the line in consideration of the issuance and delivery of $2,250,000 of 5% bonds and $850,000 of commcn stock, said </seg>
            <seg id="p273">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 273 issuance of securities to cover not only the new construction, etc., but the property already in operation. kThis existing property, as set forth in the original order,repre - nts, according to the president of the applicant company, an actual vestment of $273,860.74. Two separate and distinct valuations or estimates of the cost of the completed line have been made by different members of the Commission's Engineering Department. These estimates, exclusive of cost of financing, are: a) $2,833,300— With power house b) 2,634,756 — With power house c) 2,562,932 — Without power house, but substations and transmission lines substituted. These estimates are built on averages and the actual cost may vary from 5 to 10 '&lt; above or below the estimate, depending on whether the conditions attending the construction of the line are adverse or favorable. In its original order the Commission approved of an allowance of 12 1 % of the cost of financing. It is very doubtful whether an undertaking of this character, considering the element of risk in volved and the probability that two to four years must elapse afte tutting the line in operation, in developing the business and earnings of the property to a point where dividends on the stock might bp expected, could sell its securities at better than 85. If this is a reasonable cost of financing this proposition, and it will not be disputed by those acquainted with the history of such enterprises, and such allowance is made, the total cost as submitted by the engineers' estimates, including cost of financing, will be: (a)- $3,263,295 (b) 3,099,713 (c) 3,015,216 !It may be argued that the parties backing the enterprise migh stain the securities until such time as the property become eveloped or seasoned, and demonstrates that it has an earning ower amply sufficient to meet all operating expenses, fixed charge nd pay dividends on its stock, and that when this desired condition i attained the securities will sell at higher figures. Admitting such to be the case, we are dealing with an un developed and unseasoned property, and if the above desired operat ing conditions are attained nobody will gainsay that the origins investor is entitled to some reasonable measure of profit in propor tion to the risk he has taken. tlf it should develop from the subsequent history of the construe - on of this property that the actual costs under-run the engineers' itimates, the public will not suffe- either as an investor nor as a First, because the order prohibits the ssle of any portion of the securities to the general public until the line of road shall have </seg>
            <seg id="p274">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT tm completed, at which time its actua 1 cost will be known and blished by the Commission. Second, because the capitalization of the company will not be a controlling factor when the question of rates arises. The "fair value" of the property devoted to the use of the public will be the determining factor, and the actual cost in constructing and equipping the line which the Commission will have in its records when com - pleted, will have its proper consideration and full weight in deter - mining what the "fair value" is. !We here reiterate what we have heretofore said, to-wit, that The fact that a part of the stock of a corporation outstanding at ay time has been issued with the approval of tha Commission, innot be held to constitute a guaranty in any way that rates may e charged by such corporation to enable it to pay dividends at iy given rate upon its entire capitalization." tin concluding to approve the issuance of the full amount of urities prayed for, the Commission deems it proper to make two uirements not enjoined in its original order. First, that upon the completion of the construction and equip - ping of the line, the applicant shall show that it has a working capital of at least $75,000, consisting of stores and supplies and cash on hand, the latter item to amount to at least $50,000. This requirement we deem proper under the circumstances of the case. It will require at least this amount to inject life into the physical property when completed, and provide a working capital during the early stages of the operation. The only other recourse would be for the applicant upon the completion of the line to make short time loans, or apply to the Commission for leave to sell addi - tional securities. Either of these contingencies we desire to avoid if possible Second, while the applicants allege that it is their sole purpose nd intention to build a line which will be first class in every respect, &gt;oth as to construction and equipment, and in fact admit that only line of such a character will prove a success, we deem it proper, nasmuch as the Commission's engineers have made their estimate nder general specifications of a high standard, that in approving le issuance of these securities, the applicant would be required to onstruct and equip its line in accordance with such general speci - ications, which will be made a part of the order. WE THEREFORE FIND that the issuance of $2,250,000 of 6% bonds and $850,000 of common stock, as prayed for in the petition herein, are reasonably required for the purposes set forth in the statute and should be allowed at such time and subject to the conditions as are set forth in the order.

            <seg id="p290">290 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT APPLICATION NO. 1786 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com - pany for Authority to Raise Rates and Consolidate Exchanges at Strang, Ne - braska. Taylor, Commissioner: The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company recently acquired by purchase the plant of the Fillmore County Independent Telephone Company at Strang. Subsequently it purchased the property, but not the stock, of the Strang Telephone Company, which owned a small exchange at the same place. It now makes application for approval of the consolidation of the two plants and asks authority to put into effect a new schedule of rates. At a hearing on the application, which was held in the offices of the Commission on June 24, 1913, no appearance was made on behalf of the patrons of the two exchanges and no protest was entered to either the consolidation or the increase in rates, although the usual notice of the hearing had been given. It is manifest from the testimony submitted by the applicant that the consolidation is not only agreeable to the people of Strang but that it has been demanded by the business men of the town, who were burdened with the expense and inconvenience of the double system. For that reason and because the merging of the two exchanges is un - doubtedly in the public interest, the Commission will approve the same and enter an order accordingly. On the consolidated Strang exchange there are fifty-eight sub- Eribers and one pay station. In addition to these there are fifty rm subscribers who are switched by the company, making a tota 1 109 telephone stations in service. There were seventeen duplicate telephones, distributed as follows: Seven individual business, five individual residence and five farm. The revenue from these duplicate rlephones amounted to $24.00 per month or $288.00 per year The rates now in effect are as follows: Individual business, per month $2.00 Individual residence, per month 1.00 Farm line, per month 1.25 The applicant asks authority to establish the following rates: Individual business, per month $2.50 Individual residence, per month 1.25 Farm line, per month 1.25 1.25 The applicant submits a valuation of the consolidated property Ehich is devoted to the present use of the exchange, this valuation &gt;ing $6,402.04. While not so stated, it is assumed that this is the production, new, value. The Commission's engineering department made a thorough valuation of the applicant's plant, the inventory being somewhat more complicated than that of the ordinary plant </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 291 for reasons explained later. The reproduction va'ue .was found to be $6,346.55 and the present, or depreciated, value, $3,950.27. This does not include the property used for toll purposes. The book value of the Strang exchange of the Fillmore County Independ- ent Telephone Company was $11,759.32. The book value of the plant of the Strang Telephone Company is not available. It will be seen that the book value of the Fillmore County exchange alone is almost double that fixed for the consolidated plant. This apparent discrepancy arises from the fact that the Fillmore County Independ- ent Company constructed a large number of farm lines that sub- sequently had to be abandoned on account of competition. Prac - tically none of these farm lines are at the present time ope-ated by the Strang exchange, the property standing idle and partially dis - mantled, consequently its value is not included in the figures used as a basis in this case. Only such property as is actually devoted Ethe use of the patrons of the exchange at the present time is eluded in the figures compiled by the engineering department, tie Commission's engineer made a careful study of the property rd it appears that his conclusions are correct and reasonable. In submitting figures as to the operating costs of the Strang exchange the applicant presents only a study of the earnings and expenses of the Fillmore County Independent Telephone Company's plant, figures for the other exchange not being available. An esti - mate, based on past experience in this exchange and a number of other exchanges of like size, and on present and future needs, is submitted, covering the operation of the consolidated exchange. This estimate follows: Maintenance, material and labor on 59 telephones 45.00 Total expense $80.00 Desiring to compare the estimate with the actual cost of operat- ing the plant, the Commission requested a detailed statement of expenses for the months of June and July. The figures for July had not been spread upon the books but those for June were sub- mitted and are as follows: 304 Uncollectible accounts $0.62 Rental revenue, 109 telephones $102.50 Twenty-five per cent toll revenue 5.80 Total monthly exchange revenue $108.30 Estimated operating expense $35.00 305 Taxes 45 331 Rent expense 20 602-03 Aerial wire repairs 8.56 604-17 C.

As no construction work was in progress during this period the above statement should reflect a normal condition and be reasonably indicative of an average. One operator at a salary of |35.00 per month attends to the operation of the exchange and to part of the collecting of accounts. The repair and maintenance work is attended to by employes from Geneva, a larger exchange in the same county. A substantial portion of the expense for June was incurred by reason of maintenance, items Nos. 602-03, 604-17, 605-18, 607-03 and 607-28, being exclu- sively maintenance expense. These items aggregate $29.82. It is the practice of the Commission to combine the allowance for main- tenance and depreciation and to provide for them by allowing 9 f , on the reproduction value. For that reason the maintenance expense in the above statement should be deducted in order to arrive at the direct operating expense. Deducting this amount we have $59.18 as the monthly charge against revenue for the actual operating cost of the plant. On the basis of these figures we have the following calculation relative to the revenues and expenses of the exchange. the new rates being used in ascertaining the income: Revenue from Proposed Rates 14 Individual business at $2.50 $35.00 22 Individual residence at. ... 1.26 27.50 22 Farm at 1.25 27.50 50 Switching subscribers at . .25 12.50 1 Pay station $102.50 25% of toll revenue 5.80 Total monthly revenue $108.30 Total annual revenue $1,299.60 Total annual revenue Allowance for maintenance and depreciation 9% on $6,346.55 $573.19 Allowance for dividends, 7 % on $3,950.27 276.51 $573.19 Direct operating expenses 710.16 Total all charges against revenue $1,559.86 Annual deficit $260.26 It is interesting to note in this connection that the probable annual deficit is within a few dollars of the amount lost to the company through the discontinuance of the duplicate telephones. </seg>

At any rate, the proposed rates o not seem to be unreasonably high and will be approved.

(Seal] APPLICATION NO. 1787 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com - pany for Authority to Raise Rates and Consolidate Exchanges at Grafton, Ne - braska. Taylor, Commissioner: On June 4, 1913, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company riled an application for leave to place a new schedule of rates i effect at its exchange at Grafton, Nebraska, at the same time request ing approval of the consolidation of the two exchanges of the Lin coin Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company and the Fillmore Count Telephone Company. Hearing was had on the application in th office of the Commission on June 24, 1913. Previous to that tim the engineering department of the Commission had made a physics valuation of the properties involved, which was subsequently re - checked for the purpose of ascertaining the value of the consolidatec plant, exclusive of duplications. </seg>
            <seg id="p294">294 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT i No question has been raised as to the propriety of the Com- mission granting the necessary approval for the consolidation of the two plants as prayed for. On the contrary, the evidence shows that the patrons of both companies have demanded the consolidation, even going so far as to refuse to pay for the duplicate phones, com- mencing May 1, 1913. In view of these facts the consolidation of re two plants will be approved and an order issued accordingly The rates now in effect at Graf ton are as follows: Individual business, per month $2.00 Individual residence, per month 1.00 Farm line, per month 1.50 The city limits constitute the inner radius Ad'ditional charge outside of inner radius where there is an existing pole line, for each quarter mile or k fraction thereof $5.00 per year xtra service (two parties using same phone) 1.00 per mo. 1.00 per mo. Extension sets 1.00 per mo. Extension bells 25 per mo. The new rates for which approval is asked cover only business and residence service, the farm lines and other service remaining' as r present. The changes proposed are as follows: Individual business, per month $2.50 Individual residence, per month 1.25 At the time of the hearing the applicant submitted figures Bhowing the replacement value of the consolidated plant, the amount being $12,209.00. The present, or depreciated, value was not given. The Commission's engineering department found the replacement value to be $11,468.37 and the present, or depreciated, value to be $7,315.87. Al 1 of these figures include the property used for toll purposes, but are based on the value of the consolidated plant after proper deduction has been made for duplicate property. The figures of the Commission's engineers appear to be accurate and reasonable and will be accepted as the basis of value in this case. Detailed figures, showing the cost of operation of both plants, are submitted by applicant, together with an estimate of the expense of the consolidated plant. For the seven months period from July 1, 1912, to January 31, 1913, the cost of operation of the Fillmore County Telephone Company was $920.81, or a monthly average of $131.54. For the four months of January, February, March and April, 1913, the cost of operation of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele- graph Company's plant was $305.22, or a monthly average of $76.30. During the seven months period referred to above the revenue from the Fillmore County exchange, including toll, was $1,097.46, or an average of $156.78 per month. The revenue for the corresponding period selected for the other company was $201.44, or a monthly average of $50.36. It will be seen, therefore, that the combined operating expense of the two companies averaged $207.84 per month. These figures, however, hardly reflect the direct operating cost of the plants, for the reason that they include a considerable amount for maintenance. An analysis, based on previous investigations of </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 other plants, indicates that a deduction of at least $45.00 per month should be made on this account, leaving the actual direct operating expense of the two plants, $162.84. The income from both plants averaged $207.14 per month up to May 1, 1913, showing a balance over operating expenses of $44.30, which is the amount remaining to be used for maintenance, depreciation and dividends. After May 1st the total revenue was reduced by the removal of the duplicate telephones, of which there were thirteen, eleven business one residence and one farm, the reduction in revenue amounting to $24.25 per month, leaving a net balance over direct operatini expenses of $20.05. Summarizing these figures, we find the effect of the present rates to be as follows, using the valuation of the con- It will be observed that we have used in this calculation the valuation of the consolidated plant, from which has been deducted the duplicated property. The addition of this property, which would be proper under the operation of the plants separately, would in - crease the al'owances for maintenance, depreciation and interest. consequently increasing the deficit to that extent. The company submits an estimate as to the cost of operating he consolidated plant, which is based on a study of the average xpense of the two exchanges, covering a considerable period, with an Uowance for the economies that can be effected by the combination of the plants. It is found that one office can be discontinued, am hat the consolidated exchange can be operated with possibly one ess operator. Other minor savings bring the operating cost to E72.84. As explained above, this figure includes considerable lintenance, so that the direct operating cost should be approxi - itely $127.84. The revenue under the proposed rates would amount to $215.64 per month, divided as follows: Rentals and switching $203.00; toll, $12.64. From these figures, therefore, we arrive at the following con elusions with regard to the effect of the proposed rates, on a basis of 134 owned telephone stations and sixty-two switched stations: Total net revenue, consolidated plant Total net operating expense, exclusive of maintenance $215.64 127.84 Balance for interest, depreciation and maintenance $87.80 solidated plant: Total net revenue, both plants $182.89 Total net operating expense, both plants 162.84 Balance for interest, depreciation and maintenance .... $20.05 Necessary allowance for interest or dividends, 7% on $7,315.87 512.11 Necessary allowance for depreciation and maintenance, 9% on $11,468.37 1,032.15 k Total $1,544.26 nnual deficit $1,304.66 </seg>

It is manifest that rigid economy and a careful development of the field will be necessary before the applicant can provide for the depreciation of the property and at the same time secure a reasonable return on the mDney invested to the public use. Under such cir- cumstances the rates arc found to be reasonable and will be approved.

Since the latter date it has operated both exchanges in Beatrice, and pursuant to a public demand, verified by the city officials and a committee representing the commercial club of that city, prepared to consolidate the two exchanges into one. The two exchanges have been operated under two schedules of rates, to-wit: New Home Exch.

Individual line, business, metallic circuit, for sub - scriber's incoming calls only (no signals pro- vided at central office end of line) $30.00 A comparison of the foregoing schedule discloses an increase in rates to all the present subscribers of the New Home exchange and no increase in the net rates, over those now effective on the original Nebraska exchange if the city subscriber pays his bills on o before the tenth of the month and three months in advance in the case of farm subscribers, except the increase of the four party resi dence rate from $1.00 per month to $1.25 per month, and incoming hsiness trunks from $2.00 per month to $2.50 per month. While the city of Beatrice, through the mayor and city attorney, tised no question as to the jurisdiction of the Commission to fix d determine a reasonable schedule of rates in the premises, the monstrators by their attorney introduced in evidence the ordinance approved July 11, 1902, granting a twenty-year franchise to the predecessor of the New Home Telephone Company and under which the latter exchange was operated, which provided inter alia, that the rates to be charged under said franchise should not exceed the sums of $30.00 per year for business telephones and $18.00 per year for residence telephones, and that the grantee of said franchise, its tccessors and assigns, should not sell or transfer its rights and inchises granted therein to the Nebraska (Bell) Telephone Company or to its successors or assigns. Counsel insisted that the acceptance of the franchise fixing the rates by the predecessor of the New Home Company constituted a contract, which could not be changed during its life. This would be true if the city of Beatrice under its charter was specifically authorized to make such a contract.

Regarding that portion of the franchise prohibiting the sale o the rights or franchises to the Nebraska (Bell) Telephone Company its successors or assigns, it is sufficient to note that the applicant purchased the New Home Company in 1909 and did not acquire the Bell exchange until 1912, and that in neither of the franchises under which these exchanges are operated is there any provision prohibiting such action. I The value of the two exchanges, prior to the work of consolida on, was determined by the Commission's engineers to be, reproduc on new, $249,574.00, and present or depreciated value, $193,041:00 hile the value of the consolidated exchange when completed wi e reproduction new $234,099.61, and present o&gt;- depreciated valu 182,848.14, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant has expendet large amount of money in substituting underground conduits &gt;r overhead distribution lines in the business district, in buildin permanent, expensive exchange building, and installing moder entral office equipment of the highest type. This is due to the fact that the engineer, in arriving at h onsolidated values, included only the property which would be evoted to the public use after consolidation and excluded at the eproduction new value, (a) all duplicating or unnecessary po ines, both farm and exchange, (b) all pole lines displaced by unde ground construction, (c) aH that portion of jointly used lines properl hargeable to toll. Going concern or franchise values, cost of financ ng, and working capital are not included in the engineer's valuation which is accepted by the Commission for the purposes of this case hough applicant submitted data to the effect that the sum o 7,716.06 was required in addition to stores and supplies, and tha he cost of financing was I Counsel for objectors offered the return for taxation made b applicant's officers to the assessor of Gage County for 1912, am argued that such return should be binding on the company as &gt;asis of valuation for determining reasonable rates.

            <seg id="p300">300 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT le reasonableness of rates in arriving at its decision based its con - usions on a valuation of $300,000 to $350,000, notwithstanding the act that the company, as appears in the decision, had appealec rom a decision of the taxing authorities fixing any valuation higher lan $108,000. Counsel for the objectors further insists that no llowance should be made for general expenses, (organization, admin - tration, and legal expenses, interest during construction, engineering nd supervision, contingencies and incidentals), as set forth in Item [o. 9 of the valuation made by the Commission's engineers, which mounts to an average of 15.35 'o of the entire reproduction value When it is considered that the valuation is based only on the undamental labor and material costs, no allowance having been made for contractors' profits, engineering or supervision, other than he foreman in direct charge of the labor gangs, cost of financini and cost of developing the business, to accept counsel's contention would deprive the applicant of considerable values, which are admit edly in its plant. The general expense item herein allowed is conservative when ompared with allowances made by other authorities on valuation imilarly made, and we are convinced that it is just and reasonable t may be noted here that the Commission for the Crown, in determ ning the values of the telephone properties of Great Britain, whicl were purchased by the government at a cost of approximately 60,700,000, included in its valuation an amount aggregating 31.4' of the fundamental costs. This allowance included items for cos of financing and cost of obtaining subscribers' agreements. Exclud ng the last two items which this Commission has not considere&lt; or the purposes of the case, the allowance made by the Epglisl Commission for general expense was 27.38 'c of the fundamental costs Counsel for objectors insists further that the allowance made by the Commission's engineers of $5,000.00 for stores and supplies, on the ground that it is arbitrary and that it did not appear that such an amount of stores and supplies were actually on hand. The Commission's etigineer testified that he had not made a nventory of the stores and supplies on hand for the reason of th bnormal condition existing on account of the construction, then i process, necessary for consolidation. He showed, however, that a f June 1, 1912, and long prior to the actual beginning of the wor f consolidation, the applicant herein reported as actually on han tores and supplies in the New Home plant in the amount o 3,780.85, and the Bell plant $5,317.34, and gave as his opinion tha when the plant was once consolidated, a conservative estimate o he stores and supplies necessary for the reasonable upkeep an&lt; xtension of the plant would be $5,000.00. If there could be any doubt as to the justice of this allowance, it must be dispelled when it is remembered that no allowance is made for cash working capital, alleged by the applicant to be re - quired in the amount of $7,716.06. </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 We are, therefore, of the opinion that the reproduction value of $234,099.61 and present value of $182,848.14 submitted by the engineer are just and should be accepted for the purpose of deter- mining this case. Earnings and Expenses In considering this matter the Commission in its valuation has excluded all items of valuation properly chargeable to toll property. and has likewise excluded in its statements of earnings and expenses rms which should properly be credited or chargeable to toll. The accountants of the Commission have made a careful check and report of the applicant's operation of the two exchanges for the first five months of 1913. Their report shows that based on the average revenue from 2,666 telephones for the five months, the gross exchange earnings of the company for a year would be $42,777.74. This amount. however, includes the earnings of some 300 duplicate telephones now yielding a revenue which would aggregate $6,030.00 a year, which duplications will be removed and revenue lost after consolidation. It is, of course, impossible to accurately forecast what telephones will be ordered out, or what changes will be made by the subscribers in the class of service desired after consolidation. As nearly as can be predetermined, however, assuming that no subscribers will be lost under the proposed schedule, its exchange earnings will be as follows: Estimated Rental Revenue Beatrice Consolidated Exchange of June 1, 1913, at Proposed Net Rates 169 Individual business at $3.50 $591.50 171 Two-party business at 3.00 513.00 105 Individual residence at 2.00 210.00 76 Two-party residence at 1.50 114.00 1,254 Four-party residence at 1.25 1,567.50 429 Farm, at 1.50 643.50 49 Business extensions at 1.00 49.00 52 Residence extensions at 50 26.00 6 County exchange at 2.00 12.00 9 One-way business at 2.50 22.50 2,320 Estimated rental revenue new rates $3,749.00 53 P.

            <seg id="p304">304 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT APPLICATION NO. 1802 In the Matter of the Application of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone Com - pany, of Ragan, Nebraska, for Authority to Increase its Switching Rate to 35 Cents per Month. Appearances: Allen Elliott, for Applicant. G. E. Shelburn, for Enterprise Telephone Company Taylor, Commissioner: The applicant is a corporation and a common carrier, conducting a telephone business in the town of Ragan, Nebraska, and con iguous territory. It owns and operates 111 telephones and in addi ion performs a switching service for two farm lines known as the Enterprise Telephone Company and the Scandinavia Telephone Company. On the Enterprise line there are twenty-two subscribers and on the Scandinavia line thirteen subscribers, making a tota of 146 operated by the applicant. The switchboard used in the operation of the plant is owned jointly by the applicant and the wo defendants, the farm companies each having a one-fifth interest 3ach company maintains its own lines. According to the record in this case, which was submitted a a formal hearing at Alma, Nebraska, on July 17, 1913, the applican has never had a written contract with either of the farm companie covering the switching charges. There have been verbal agreement at various times but the final adjustments at the close of each yea were seldom effected on a mutually satisfactory basis, due largely to the inability of the parties to agree as to the cost of the service Practically all of the verbal agreements have provided for the pay ment for the switching service on the basis of its actual cost to th applicant. Investigation developed that there is on file in the offic of the Commission a rate of twenty-six cents per month per sub scriber for switching service, but none of the parties were a war that this rate was in effect and consequently it has never been recog nized in the annual settlements. The applicant now asks permission to establish a switching rat of thirty-five cents per month per subscriber's station, or in lieu of that, authority to base the rate on the actual cost of operation &gt;lus a regular toll charge to four towns now connected with the exchange to which the defendants at the present time have free connection. The applicant was unable to furnish a detailed statement of the cost of operating the plant, the accounts being kept only in a general way, but according to the figures submitted for the year ending January 1, 1913, the total expense of operation was $931.61. This includes the cost of maintaining the plant, exclusive of the </seg>
            <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 305 witchboard, the amount for this purpose being $316.51. The salary f the operator during this period was $50 per month, or $600 per ear. It required $15 to maintain the switchboard for the year, this tern of expense being properly prorated over all of the property on tie basis of the number of telephones. In arriving at the actua ost of switching, the applicant applied only the $600 for direct peration and the $15 for maintenance of the switchboard. On a &gt;asis of 150 telephones switched this made a cost of $4.10 per station »er year or thirty-four cents per month. It will be noted that no ccount was taken of the general expense of the company, such as alaries of officers, printing and other incidental items, a portion o which would be properly chargeable to the switched stations. It is hown in the record, for instance, that every meeting of the boarc f directors entails an expense of $8 or $9 and that two or three meetings are required when a new operator is engaged. The secre ary of the company receives the nominal salary of $25 per year Jetween the meetings of the board of directors he is the active manager of the business and puts in considerable time at the work n addition to the service of switching, the farm lines have enjoyec he privilege of communication with the four towns of Upland Jloomington, Hildreth and Wilcox over lines owned by the applican nd for which no toll charge has been made. It will be seen, there ore, that the Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone Company has no &gt;een receiving the bare cost of the service it has been furnishin he two farm lines. While there is a joint ownership of the switch board by the three companies, the interest of the two farm line 8 so small that it has but little bearing on the case. The switch &gt;oard cost $140 originally, one-fifth of this amount being paid by ach defendant. Since its installation, however, it has been con iderably enlarged, the cost of all of the additions being borne by he applicant, so that the interest of the defendants does not repre sent a two-fifths ownership at the present time. They have refused o pay their portion of the cost on the ground that the addition were for the use of the applicants. That the present arrangemen las not been satisfactory to the applicant is evidenced by the fac hat at the time of the last annual settlement it offered to turn th peration of the plant over to the Enterprise Telephone Company nd pay such charge for switching service as that company shoulc find reasonable. This offer was refused, largely for the reason tha he Enterprise Company did not care to assume the responsibility f becoming a common carrier. While the applicant is willing that the switching rate be basec on the bare cost of operation provided it is permitted to charge the arm line subscribers a toll charge to the towns of Upland, Blooming on, Hildreth and Wilcox, it appears preferable to the Commission o fix a definite rate for switching service. The real contention in he past has been as to what this rate should be and to determine t now will remove this basis for contention in the future. Further </seg>

Appearances: Frank H. Woods, for Applicant. H. P. Wilson, City Attorney, for City of Geneva. Clarke, Chairman: On June 24, 1913, the applicant herein filed its petition with the Commission, alleging that it had purchased the Geneva exchange of the Fillmore County Telephone Company; that there were some 570 subscribers on the applicant's exchange, and 356 subscribers on the exchange of the Fillmore Company, making a total of 926, of which approximately 102 were duplicates; and requesting authority to consolidate said exchanges and to publish and collect an increased schedule of rates. The present and proposed rates are here set forth. Present Metallic Circuit Grounded Circuit ndividual business $30.00 r wo-party business 24.00 ndividual residence 18.00 rwo-party residence 15.00 r our-party residence 12.00 ""arm residence 18.00 </seg>

Farm business 24.00 24.00 The proposed schedule increases the one and two party business rates fifty cents per month; eliminates the four-party residence rates of $1.00 per month; retains a grounded circuit service farm line rate of $1.25 per month now in effect on the Fillmore Company lines, and provides a new rate of $2.00 per month for business tele- phones on farm lines. The Commission's engineer made a careful and complete estimate and valuation of the applicant's consolidated exchange, and after excluding all duplication and dead lines not devoted to the public use, reports the following: Value — Reproduction new $41,280.41 as against Applicant's valuation of 42,277.38 and Present or depreciated value of 31,059.00 Nothing is included in said valuation for franchise value, good will, cost of financing, or establishing the business, or working capital, except an item of $2,000 for stores and supplies. The value of the consolidated property so determined is $11,600 less than the value of the two properties reported as of June, 1912, notwithstanding the investment of some $12,000 new capital for new equipment and cost of removal of heavy pole lines from streets tc alleys and expense incident to consolidation. The average monthly earnings of the two exchanges aggregate $969.80, and the expenses $771.89, a net earning of $197.91, or $2,374.92 for the entire year. The estimated monthly earning of the consolidated exchanges under the proposed rates, after excluding the duplicate telephones and including $76.25 (one-fourth of estimated monthly toll revenue i. is $940.50, or $29.30 less than the aggregate of the earnings of the two exchanges. The estimates of expense after consolidation show a saving in certain accounts, to-wit, "general expense, and rent, light and heat," and increased cost in other accounts, to-wit, 'substation repairs, "renewals and changes," "farm lines" and "power." The net result is an average monthly expense of $760.23, or $11.66 less than the present combined expense of the two exchanges. If the estimates submitted are borne out by subsequent exper- ience, and we see no reason from the evidence or the past experience of the Commission to question their reasonableness, the operation rthe consolidated plant will present the following condition: Estimated earning $11,286.50 Estimated operating expense 9,122.76 Net earnings $2,163.74 </seg>
            <seg id="p308">308 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT kThe item of depreciation determined by the Commission's gineer on the straight line basis of 7.53%, properly chargeable operation, is not included in the above expense estimate. bThe net earnings accruing under the proposed schedule, as ive set forth, will return slightly less than 7% on the present ue of the plant, with no allowance for depreciation, or vice versa. tit is probable that the net earnings of the company may be creased by reductions in expense and increasing the number of its bscribers. Such increase, however, must be considerable in order furnish 'a fair return on the value of the property and provide sufficient reserve for depreciation. tin view of the foregoing, and the fact that the proposed ratea i in line with rates obtaining in exchanges of similar size and aracter, we find that they are reasonable and should be allowed. tThe applicant will be required to furnish the Commission nthly statements of the earnings and expense of the operation the consolidated exchanges. Counsel for the ■ city stated that the existence of two exchanges necessitating a large number of duplicate telephones, was burden some, and that if a consolidated exchange had not been consum mated by the two companies, the business men of the city woulc have solved it in some other way.

This case came on for hearing on an application of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company and the Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Rail - way Company to change the switching rates between the transfer tracks of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company and the industry tracks located on the O.

The Missouri Pacific Railwa Company and the 0. L. &amp; B. Railway Company have a transfe rack for interchange of traffic located at Thirtieth &amp; W Streets ?he applicants herein urge as the reason for an increase in rate uniform method of assessing the charge, based on the car unit •resent tariffs provide different rates for cars of 80,000 pound apacity and under as compared to cars of over 80,000 pound apacity. The application makes a flat charge for cars of an apacity. With the exception of the station of Idylwild, the appl ants herein make the present maximum rate the basis for the charg or cars of any capacity. At the station of Idylwild the applicatio &lt;eks to increase the rate fifty cents per car above the present rat or cars of more than 80,000 pounds capacity. The only protest lodged against this application was on behalf of the Nebraska Hinge Door Silo Company, located at Idylwild siding of the O. L. &amp; B. Railway Company. This industry is located approximately one-half mile from the transfer track at Thirtieth and W Streets. It was shown in the testimony that the switching charges on approximately 80% of the traffic that originates or desti - nates at industry tracks located on the O. L. &amp; B. Railway is ab - sorbed by the carrier having the road haul. However, there is a considerable amount of less than carload shipments made by the </seg>

We are of the opinion and we so find that the rate of $5.00 per car on a shipment between the transfer tracks of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company and the siding of Idylwild located on the O. L. &amp; B. Railway is unreasonable and excessive insomuch as that amount exceeds the rate of $4.50 per car. In view of the fact that the present switching rate between the ransfer track of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Com &gt;any in University Place is $5.00 per car, we are of the opinion am we so find that the rate of $5.00 per car between the transfer tracks of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company and the industry tracks of the O. L. &amp; B. located at University Place is a fair and reasonable harge for the services performed. In view of the fact that the present switching rate between the ransfer and industry tracks of the Missouri Pacific Railway Com any and Bethany, Nebraska, is $5.00 per car, and inasmuch as the O. L. &amp; B. industry tracks are located very near the business cente f the said town of Bethany Heights, we are of the opinion and we so find that the charge of $5.50 per car from the transfer tracks o he Missouri Pacific Railway Company and the industry tracks o he O. L. &amp; B. Railway Company located at Bethany Heights is reasonable charge for the service performed. That part of the application covering the movement of passenger mail and express cars between the transfer tracks of the Missour 'acific Railway Company and the industry tracks located on the O. L. &amp; B.

The end of the car ahead of the sleeper was crushed in badly. </seg>

This division is a double track main line and equipped with an automatic block system, so arranged that, when a block is occupied he home signal governing the entrance to that block shows red and yellow, the danger signal, and indicates "stop"; the distance signal at the entrance of the preceding block, shows yellow and green nd indicates "proceed under control"; while the signal at the en - rance of the second preceding block, shows double green, and indi - ates "clear," and permits full speed. During the night of the accident the signal between North Platte and Gothenburg, a distance of 35.5 miles, was working per - fectly, with the exception of the signals on the single track Platte River crossing, a distance of 1.8 and 2.2 miles of North Platte from the west and east bridge junctions, respectively. The signals on this crossing, being out of order, stood at danger throughout the night, and trainmen were so notified. kThis situation is governed by the provisions of Rule No. 504, the Rules and Regulations of the Union Pacific Railroad Cora - ny, which is as follows: "When a train is stopped by a block signal it may proceed when the signal is clear. On single tracks, send a flagman in advance immediately; wait the full time indicated by special rules on the time table (which is five minutes) after the flag- man has started, and then proceed under control to the next clear signal, or, if the signal in advance is in clear view, and the track ahead is seen to be clear, proceed under control not to exceed six miles per hour." Train No. 4 carrying one express, one mail, three baggage cats, wo coaches and one sleeping car left North Platte at 2:17 a. m. and in complying with the above rule consumed seventeen minutes n crossing the bridge, arriving at Brady Island at 3:13 a. m., or ixteen minutes slower than regular schedule running time and at Gothenburg at 3:36 a. m., or twenty minutes slower than regular chedule time. On the arrival of No. 4 at Gothenburg, its flagman dropped off the rear end of the train and started back to take his position ixty feet from the rear of the train, as required by rule. Upon eaching nearly the required distance he heard a whistle, indicating an approaching train and, immediately lighting a red fusee, began running back, waving the lighted fusee. His signal was seen and answered by the engineer of train No. 12. bWhen train No. 12 stopped after the collision the flagman was it one car length west of the rear end of that train, which con - id of one mail car, one baggage car, two coaches and two sleeping k According to the testimony of Superintendent Cahill, the pass - ger train flagmen of the Union Pacific, during the past several are, have been instructed as follows: </seg>

At any intermediate stop between stations flagman will go back at once with proper flagging equipment and prepare to protect his train as per rule No. 99." Gothenburg being a regular stop for No. 4, its flagman complied th the rules applicable at the time. At the time of the accident and for some time previous, a very severe storm was raging, accompanied by high wind an&lt; heavy snow. For this reason, Conductor Harding of train No 2, leaving North Platte at 2:37 a. m., or twenty minutes after Jo. 4, deemed it unsafe to compel the flagman to walk across he Platte River bridge, in accordance with the provisions of Rule io. 504, and instructed his engineer to carry the flagman on the ngine and proceed slowly across the bridge, consuming about ten minutes of time, thus gaining seven minutes on train No. 4. The; assed Brady Island at 3:19 a. m., or only four minutes after No had departed. tThe first block signal west of Gothenburg on east bound track o. 2556 is 1069 feet west of the station. The next .signal No. 2652 2427 feet west of No. 2556; signal 2572 is 5680 feet west of signal o. 2652, and the next signal No. 2582 is a mile west of No. 2572. Engineer Weinberger testified that on approaching signal No 582 he found it in caution position, but before passing it, it change* to clear. Signal No. 2572 also showed clear, while signal No. 256 ndicated caution. He at once shut off steam and applied the ai &gt;rakes, reducing the speed of his train to twenty miles per hour ly reason of the storm and the wind carrying the smoke and snow o the south, he missed signal No. 2556 entirely, and while driftin along endeavoring to locate his position, saw the red fusee bein waved by the flagman of train No. 4. He immediately applied th ir brakes, after which the collision occurred. kThe fireman of train No. 12 had some difficulty in keeping up am and saw none of the signals en route from North Platte, but ticed the red fusee as he reached up to put on the blower. LRule No. 302 of the Union Pacific book of rules, provides as Hows: "Enginemen finding a distant signal at 'caution' must immediately bring their trains under control, and be prepared to stop before reaching the home signal. They are reminded that although the distant signal indicates the position of the home signal, the home signal may assume the stop position after distant signal has given the clear indication, and while </seg>
            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 317 the train is between the distant and home signal. For this reason enginemen and trainmen must be on the alert, prepared to bring the train to a stop if the home signal indicates the stop, and be governed by rule 504." Rules Nos. 105, 106, 304 and 508 read as follows: " 105. Both conductors and enginemen are responsible for the safety of their trains and, under conditions not provided for by the rules, must take every precaution for their pro - tection." "106. In all cases of doubt or uncertainty the safe course must be taken and no risks run." "304. In foggy or stormy weather enginemen must ap - proach both Distant and Home Signals with great care, and have their trains under control." "508. An engineman of a train entering a block as pro - vided for by these rules, will be held responsible in case of accident caused by overtaking the preceding train." We are of the opinion and so find that Engineer Weinberger s responsible for the collision, in that he failed to have his train nder control, and was not prepared to stop at the home signal nd by his own admission ran his train by this signal without seeing The caution distant signal west of Gothenburg clearly indicatec o Engineer Weinberger that the next block was not clear, and in iew of the extremely severe storm prevailing he should have taken xtra precautions to have his train under such control as to have &gt;een able to see the home signal and be governed accordingly Engineer Weinberger at the time of the accident had been en duty wo hours and seventeen minutes, previous to which he had been ff duty more than thirty hours.

P. extra east bounc Freight No. 504, in charge of Ray Phillips, conductor; James Zalisky, engineer; James Cunningham, fireman; F. G. McManus head brakeman; and Charles Cradet, rear brakeman; at Mile Post No. 426, killing Conductor Phillips and Brakeman Cradet, three stockmen, and injuring two other stockmen, all of whom were in the caboose of extra No. 504. !Mile Post No. 426 is a telegraph office located at the western id of the double track main line of the Union Pacific Railroad Dmpany, about twelve miles west of Sidney, and 1.7 miles east o erdon, seven miles east of Potter and 15.9 miles east of Dix. The itire line from Cheyenne to Sidney is equipped with an automatic sctric block signal system, which was working perfectly during the ght and at the time of the accident. The wreck occurred about irty-five car lengths west of the west end of the double track. Extra west bound Freight No. 510 left Sidney at 1:35 a. m on the 14th, but on account of a severe snow storm accompaniec by high winds, which was raging over the division, did not read the end of the double track at Mile Post No. 426 until 3:42 a. m Here it was tied up because its water supply was exhausted to sucl an extent that it could not proceed, or return light to Sidney fo more water. Extra No. 504 left Cheyenne, Wyoming, at 6:10 p. m. on March 13, and reached Dix, Nebraska, at 12:03 a. m. of the 14th, when it was held until 2:35 a. m. at which points No. 7 and Second No. 9 west bound trains passed it. L Extra No. 501 left Cheyenne at 7:40 p. m.,. March 13, and ched Dix at 2:10 a. m. on the 14th. Engineer Cameron and Fireman Lang both testified that while trains Nos. 504 and 501 were standing at Dix, a conversation was had between Cameron of Train 504 and Conductor Phillips of Train 501, in the course of which Cameron requested Phillips to protec the rear end of his train with plenty of red fusees and Phillips promised to do so. No. 504 left Dix at 2:35 a. m. and reached Mile Post No. 426 at 3:35 a. m., when the signal was against them, and they stoppec or orders, but not until the engine and several cars had passec he office and ran on to the end of east bound double track. No 504 here received orders to pick up the engine of No. 510 which wa tanding on the west end of the west bound double track. In orde to do this No. 504 cut its train about four freight cars back of the engine and pulled ahead on the east bound track so that engine of No. 510 could run out on to the single track and couple on to train No. 501. Train No. 504 had laid at Mile Post No. 426 getting orders, and picking up engine to No. 510, about ten minutes, when train </seg>
            <seg id="p319">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 319 No. 501 ran into its rear end. Train No. 501 left Dix at 3:06 a. m and on its arrival at Potter the head brakeman, McGinnis, received orders from the dispatcher at Sidney with reference to a west bound passenger train No. 17, and was also advised that No. 504 was ordered to pick up engine to No. 510 at Mile Post No. 426. McGinnis testified that he advised Engineer Cameron with reference to No. 504 picking up Engine No. 510 at the Mile Post, but this is denied by Cameron. The conductor of 501 also went to the office at Potter for orders, and while so engaged his train de - parted, leaving him at the station. kNear the east end of Herdon switch, located about one-half le west of Mile Post No. 426, is Signal No. 4272, which is the home nal for east bound trains for the block east thereof. Cameron admitted that he was passing signals, without knowing heir indications; that they were holding lighted fusees out of the cab window of the engine to determine his location; that he knew when he passed east Herdon switch; that he knew there was a &gt;lock signal there, which is the home signal for east bound trains &gt;etween this signal and Mile Post No. 426, and passed it without mowing what it indicated, and under a reduced rate of speed collidec with No. 504. Brandle, rear brakeman of No. 501, testified to Signa &gt;Jo. 4272 showing red as the caboose passed it. Cameron testified that he heard no torpedoes explode on the rack nor saw any lighted fusees protecting No. 504 before strikini t. That Conductor Phillips and Rear Brakeman Cradet of train Jo. 504 failed to protect their train at Mile Post No. 426, by placing orpedoes on the tracks or red fusees, is clearly and positively proven &gt;y one of the injured stockmen, who was riding in the caboose, am who testified that he was awake when the train stopped at Mile &gt;ost No. 426, and that the flagman went out twice for a short ime only for the purpose of determining the location; that he saw lim take out no fusees or torpedoes; that he was not out eithe ime long enough to go back a hundred or more feet to place tor &gt;edoes; and that neither the conductor nor the brakeman knew where they were or why they had stopped. The Rules and Regulations of the Transportation Department of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, particularly applicable to the situation and conditions obtaining at the time of the above wreck and collision, are as follows: "27. A signal imperfectly displayed, or the absence of a signal at a place where a signal is usually shown, must be regarded as a stop signal, and the fact reported to the superintendent." "99. When a train stops or is delayed, under circumstances in which it may be overtaken by another train, the flagman must go back with stop signals a sufficient distance to insure full protection. One-fourth mile from the rear of the train he will place one torpedo on the rail, continuing one-half mile from the rear of his train he will place two torpedoes on the rail two rail lengths apart. He may then return to the single torpedo where he must remain until relieved by another flagman, or </seg>
            <seg id="p320">320 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT is recalled by the whistle of his engine. When recalled if he does not see or hear an approaching train, the single torpedo will be removed (and not before), if conditions warrant a red fusee will be displayed to protect his train while returning. "105. Both conductors and enginemen are responsible for the safety of their trains and, under conditions not provided for by the rules, must take every precaution for their protection." " 106. In all cases of doubt or uncertainty the safe course must be taken and no risks run. "302. Enginemen finding a distant signal at 'caution' mus immediately bring their trains under control, and be preparec to stop before reaching the home signal. They are reminded tha although the distant signal indicates the position of the home signal, the home signal may assume the stop position after the distant signal has given the clear indication, and while the train is between the distant and home signal. For this reason engine man and trainmen must be on the alert, prepared to bring the train to a stop if the home signal indicates the stop, and be governed by Rule 504." "304. In foggy or stormy weather enginemen must ap - proach both distant and home signals with great care, and have their trains under control." "504. When a train is stopped by a block signal, it may proceed when the signal is clear. On single track, send a flag man in advance immediately; wait the full time indicated by special rules on the time table (in this case five minutes) after the flagman has started; then proceed under control to the next clear signal, or, if the signal next in advance is in plaii view proceed under control not exceeding six miles an hour.' It is clear to the Commission that by reason of the storm tha was raging the trainmen neglected to comply with the foregoing rules, at a time and under circumstances which required the strictest compliance therewith; we find that the cause of the accident is directly attributable and in like degree: k First. To the failure of Conductor Phillips and Flagman Cradet protect the rear end of Train No. 504, as prescribed in Rule 99, ove set forth. k Second. To the failure of Engineer Cameron to comply with ule 27 and 504. From its investigation of the foregoing accident, and likewise of the one occurring at Gothenburg on the same date, the Commis - sion is of the opinion that additional precautions should be taken by the railroad company operating its trains under an automatic block signal system during severe storms. We are of the opinion and so find that whenever the weather is such that the enginemen or station operators are unable to easily and clearly discern a block signal within a distance of 200 feet such fact should be reported to the train dispatcher at the earliest opportunity. The dispatcher shall, thereupon, immediately operate the trains under his control under the manual block system, and not clear a train from any open station until the train occupying the track to the next open station has arrived and cleared the main line; or until he is advised by the operators along the line that the weather </seg>

Board of Exa'miners and In - vestigation. tAt said hearing it developed that Second 6 collided with the ear end of the Barnum &amp; Bailey circus train Extra 1750, running etween Lincoln, Nebraska, and Council Bluffs, Iowa, while No. 750 was taking siding at Richfield, Nebraska, to let Second 6 by. Richfield is forty-three miles northeast of Lincoln on the Ne - &gt;raska division of the C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway. The accident occurrei at about 12:35 a. m., on August 12, at a point 390 feet west of the west passing track switch on an ascending grade of 96 ' ; • At the &gt;oint of the accident the track is straight, but nine rail length west of the point of the accident a three-degree curve begins ant extends 2522.2 feet to the south through a deep cut, which obscures he view of an approaching train to the extent that an engineman cannot see the point where the accident occurred farther than wenty rail lengths. The track is straight for one and one-fourt] miles south of the south end of the curve. The weather conditions were clear, the temperature about 84 and the wind was blowing from the south. At the point of the accident the roadbed was in good condition, being laid with 80 - pound steel on mixed hard wood, treated hemlock and cedar ties m'lasted with crushed stone. The caboose of 1750 was totally demolished and the next ca o the caboose, a six-sill, 18-section wood bunk car, sixty feet Ion and containing fifty-four bunks, was crushed in, all the sills bein &gt;roken. The fifth car from the rear in the circus train was also damaged slightly and some slight damage was done to the engine of Second 6. The personal injuries were to the employes of th circus who were riding in the bunk car. Six of these were seriously njured; seven others were treated at the Clarkson Hospital in Omaha but joined the circus at Council Bluffs. Twenty-nine other were slightly injured but proceeded with the circus train. This division of the C. R. I. &amp; P. Railway is operated unde he manual block and train order system. Extra 1750 was unde order No. 73, reading: "Engine 1750, Lincoln. Engine 1750 run xtra, Lincoln to Albright — meet No. 97, engine 1781, at Murdock Extra 1750 east, hold maintrack at Murdock.

The train sheet hows that Extra 1750 passed South Bend at 11:59 p. m. on August 1, and that Second 6 passed the same place at 12:18 a. m., August 2. Second 6 passed Meadow at 12:28 a. m., a distance of 5.4 miles east of South Bend. Extra 1750 arrived at Richfield at 12:35 . m. where Second 6 ran into it, as the evidence shows, at 12:33 r 12:35. This is about 7.4 miles east of Meadow. Extra 1750 eft South Bend on the time of Second 6, but Second 6 received the estriction card above referred to at South Bend, which informed he crew that the circus train was in the block. This card should ave restricted the speed of Second 6 to that of the freight ahead, which on this division is thirty-five miles per hour. Conductor Spence, of Extra 1750, met the trainmaster, W. W. Cameron, at Lincoln, and according to the testimony Cameron urged the conductor to "keep going and give them a good run." However, this should have been no authority for him to violate the rules and train orders. Rule 99 of the Book of Rules is as follows: " Rule 99. When a train stops, or is delayed, under cir - cumstances in which it may be overtaken by another train the flagman must go back immediately, with stop signals, a sufficient distance to insure full protection. One-fourth mile from the rear of the train he will place one torpedo on the rail continuing back three-fourths mile from the rear of the train he will place two torpedoes on the rail, two rails lengths apart During foggy or stormy weather, or in the vicinity of obscure curves or descending grades, or if other conditions require it the flagman will increase the distance, placing two more tor - pedoes two rail lengths apart at the farthest point reached He may then return to the single torpedo, where he must remain until relieved by another flagman, or is recalled. When recalled but not before, if he does not see or hear an approaching train the signal torpedo will be removed. In stormy or foggy weather or if the view for at least one-fourth mile to the rear of the train is not clear, or if other conditions warrant, he will leave a burning red fusee to protect the train while returning. Shoulc a train be seen or heard approaching before the flagman has reachec the required distance, he must at once place one torpedo on the rail, and if it be night, or during fofjgy or stormy weather display a burning red fusee, continuing in the direction of the approaching train. If the flagman is recalled before reachini the required distance, he will, before returning, place tw&lt; torpedoes on the rail two rail lengths apart and a sufficient distance from the train to protect it while he is returning When it is necessary to protect the front of a train, or if an} other running track is seen to be unsafe or obstructed, the same precaution shall be observed. If for any reason an engineman finds it necessary to stop between stations, he will sound the whistle signal (14-C), and, whenever possible, stop where there is a clear view of the rear of the train for a distance of a 'east one-fourth mile. If it be a freight train, the front brake - man or, in his absence, the fireman, will also give the signa (12-E) from the front of the train until the like signal is returned from the rear of the train. "99-a. When a train requires protection within a block </seg>
            <seg id="p324">324 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT controlled by an automatic block signal, and such signal is not less than one-half mile to the rear of the train, the flagman need not go back to where the block signal is plainly seen to display 'stop,' and he must know that it continues to display 'stop' while the train requires protection. "99-b. Should the speed of a train be reduced, and its rear thereby endangered, making it necessary to check a follow- ing train before a flagman can get off, a burning fusee shall be thrown off at intervals to insure safety." It was shown that Conductor Spence informed his engineer to "keep going" and that he would protect the rear of his train against Second 6, which was running late on its order No. 74. Spence says that he did not throw off caution fusees between Meadow and Richfield. Rule 86 of the Book of Rules says: "An inferior train must clear the time of a first class train in the same direction not less than ten minutes, and unless otherwise provided by time table rule, must be clear at the time the first class train in the same direction is due to leave the next station in the rear where time is shown." According to the rule, Extra 1750 should have taken siding a South Bend, as it was on the time of Second 6 at that point, am mowing that he would not make the scheduled time of the pass nger's time, as the maximum of the freight was but thirty-five miles per hour, while that of the passenger was fifty miles per hour as order No. 74 gave Second 6 sixteen minutes to go 12.8 miles. Conductor Spence violated Rule 99 in not protecting his train and gave as excuse therefor that he was busy in making up his eports and depended upon his flagman, who was riding in the cupola of the caboose, talking to the roadmaster. Conductor Spence did make some effort to protect his train by going back about eight coach lengths to flag. Extra 1750 was moving at about five miles &gt;er hour, while the evidence shows that Second 6 was running a' a high rate of speed between South Bend and Richfield, and knowinj hat they were in the block of the circus train. Finding From the testimony introduced in this case the Commission finds that the conductor and engineer of Extra 1750 east are directly responsible for the wreck, in that they did not clear the time o rain Second 6, as shown in train order No. 74. Rule No. 86 o he Book of Rules specifically requires that inferior class trains mus clear the time of first class trains running in the same direction not less than ten minutes. According to the train sheet, Extra 1750 east arrived at Souti Bend at 11:53 p. m. Order No. 74 held Second No. 6 at Murdock until 11:53 p. m. Under Rule No. 86, Extra 1750 east should hav been in the clear at South Bend at 11:43 p. m. We find that th conductor and engineer of Extra No. 1750 east, entirely disregardin Rule No. 86, departed from the station at South Bend at 11:5 </seg>
            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 325 Fm., at which time they were using the main track thirteen minutes the time of Second 6 without protecting their train as provided Rule 99. We further find that Conductor Spence was derelict in his duty after he had disobeyed Rule No. 86 in allowing his train to leave South Bend, in that he did not properly protect the rear end of his train at Richfield. Knowing that he was on the time of Seconc No. 6, he should have dropped off fusees and further protected his train before stopping at Richfield to head in. We further find that Trainmaster W. W. Cameron unduly urged the conductor and engineer of Extra 1750 east to "keep going and give them a good run." While these instructions should have had no weight with the crew of Extra 1750 east, they no doubt did have considerable weight with Conductor Spence and Engineer We further find that Engineer Bitzer, on Second No. 6, did not use precaution in approaching the station of Richfield in that it was not shown in the testimony that he complied with Rule 10 of the "Time Table Rules" by reducing the speed of his train to not to exceed twenty-five miles per hour on curves. We further find that the last paragraph of Rule No. 317, o the Rock Island Lines Rules and Regulations of the Operatini Department, is deficient and dangerous, in that it provides tha a "first class" passenger train may be admitted to a block occupie&lt; by an "inferior class" train. This is especially true at night, when under the common practice, open telegraph stations are a muc! greater distance apart. As evidenced in this case, train men do no take the same precaution to protect their trains by flagging (as properly provided under the rules), by reason of the fact that they in a large measure depend upon the so-called "manual block system' for protection. We find that the rules governing the use of the "manual block' should be changed, so that when a first class train is allowed to enter a block occupied by a train of inferior class, running in the same direction, the first class train shall be given a clearance car« that shows on its face that they are to proceed with their train under full control at all times.

Martin Attorney General, Lincoln, Nebraska Dear Sir: tl am directed by the Nebraska State Railway Commission to luest of you an opinion in writing on such a case as is shown by i accompanying correspondence, passing between the Commission d the North Platte Gas &amp; Electric Company. The question is as to the jurisdiction of the Commission, when the subject involved is the voluntary withdrawal and cancellation by a corporation of a part of its stock and bonds. Do the provisions of House Roll No. 578, passed by the Legislature of 1909, apply? Awaiting your reply, I am Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, December 11, 1912. Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: Your communication of October 26, in which you asked for the opinion of this department with reference to the right of a public service corporation to withdraw a certain portion of its capital stock without the permission of your commission, was inadvertently over - looked. The correspondence submitted by you shows that the Nort 'latte Gas &amp; Electric Company was organized, and its origina rticles of incorporation filed with the secretary of state on Marc 7, 1909; that, at the time of its incorporation, it held a franchis rom the city of North Platte for the manufacture and furnishin f electric light and power in that city; that it also held a franchise rom said city authorizing it to erect and construct a gas plant hat the original purpose of the corporation was to establish th as plant, but this project was entirely abandoned and its franchise or that purpose was later forfeited; that when it had both projects n mind, that of furnishing electric light and also gas for the city t authorized an issue of capital stock of $250,000 and a bond issu f $150,000; that after the gas project was abandoned, the corpora ion found it was unnecessary to have such a large amount of capita </seg>
            <seg id="p331">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 331 stock or to issue bonds for the amount originally contemplated hat in June, 1912, it amended its articles of incorporation and filee said amendment with the secretary of state, by which its origina tock was reduced from $250,000 to $100,000 and its bond issue reduced from $150,000 to $60,000; and that by said amendment the company changed its name from North Platte Gas &amp; Electric Com pany to North Platte Electric Company. The question which confronts your Commission is whether the voluntary surrender, withdrawal, and cancellation by the corporation of its stocks and bonds in the manner aforesaid should have been submitted for your approval, under the provisions of House Roll 578. House Roll 578 was a bill for an act to regulate the issuance of stocks, bonds, and other forms of indebtedness of common carriers and public service corporations, and provided that stocks, bonds and evidences of indebtedness of public service corporations might &gt;e issued when permission therefor was authorized by the Com - mission, and when the Commission found the same were necessary or the acquisition of property, the construction, completion, exten - sion, or improvement of facilities, or for the improvement or main enance of its service, or for the discharge or lawful refunding o ts obligations. In my judgment, House Roll 578 was passed for the purpose of preventing the watering of stocks or over-capitalization thereof, and that it was not designed by this law to prevent a public carrier or public service corporation from voluntarily reducing its capital stock and bond issue by duly amending its articles of incorporation and filing the same with the secretary of state. It appears from this correspondence that the original organiza tion took place prior to the time House Roll 578 was passed by the legislature of 1909 and became a law. From the correspondence i appears that the reduction of the capital stock and the limitation o bond issue were found necessary because of the abandonment of th corporation's original purpose to establish a gas plant, and that when such reduction of stock and cancellation thereof were made it was done in good faith and for the purpose of preventing an apparen over-capitalization of the corporation. This action on the part o the corporation does not amount to an issuance of new stock Neither does it amount to a refund of its capital stock or of its outstanding liabilities. For these reasons, the provisions of House Roll 578 do not apply to the instant case, and the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the subject-matter thereof. Very respectfully, Grant G. Martin, Attorney General. </seg>

Dear Sir: I am instructed by the Nebraska State Railway Commission o request of you an opinion, in writing, as to the proper interpre - ation of the Nebraska "Anti-Pass Act," especially as to that part f the act providing an exception in favor of "officers, agents, bona de employees, the major portion of whose time is devoted to the service of such railroad company and the dependent members o! heir immediate families. " The question has been submitted to the Commission as to whether or not a railroad company can legally issue free transporta - tion to a housekeeper who is employed by an employee (a widower) of said railroad company, and who devotes her entire time to keeping house for and looking after such employee's children. As having possible bearing upon this inquiry, and for your convenience, I cite you to "Conference Rulings Bulletin No. 5" of the Interstate Commerce Commission, issued April 1, 1911, and to Subdivision (c), Ruling No. 95 thereof, reading as follows: " (c) The Commission holds that the word 'family', as use&lt; in Section 1 of the act to regulate commerce, includes those who are members of, and who habitually reside in, the house - hold of the person eligible to receive family passes, including household servants when traveling with the family or with an; member thereof, and relatives who are in fact dependent upon such person, although not actually residing in his household (See Rules 92 and 174.)

Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, December 24, 1912. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 20th instant, in hich you submit the following question: Is it a violation of the anti-pass law for a railroad company to issue free transportation to a housekeeper who is employed by an employee of the company and who devotes her entire time to keeping house and to looking after such employee's children? In this connection you have called my attention to "Conference </seg>
            <seg id="p333">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 333 E tilings Bulletin No. 5 of the Interstate Commerce Commission, sued April 1, 1911, and to subdivision c, Ruling No. 95, thereof, ading as follows: "The Commission holds that the word 'family,' as used in Section 1 of the act to regulate commerce, includes those who are members of, and who habitually reside in, the household o the person eligible to receive family passes, including householc servants when traveling with the family or with any member thereof, and relatives who are in fact dependent upon such person, although not actually residing in his household. (See Rules 92 and 174.) The Commission will, therefore, view passes in the following form as lawful: 'Pass John Smith, wife, two sons, three daughters, and two servants.' 'Pass Mrs. John Smith and daughter, account John Smith, Agent X. Y. &amp; Z. Railroad Company at Washington, D. C.' " The Interstate Commerce act is much more liberal in its terms with reference to the granting of free passes than are the provisions of our state law in relation to the same subject. The interstate ommerce act prohibits a common carrier frcm issuing or giving 'any interstate free ticket, free pass, or free transportation for pas engers, except to its employees and their families, its officers, agents ervants, physicians, and attorneys at law," etc. The Nebraska aw permits a railroad company to issue free transportation to its 'officers, agents, bona fide employees, the major portion of whose ime is devoted to the services of such railroad company and to he dependent members of their immediate families." Under the interstate commerce act, the employees or agents of a railroad company may receive free transportation whether they are devoting a part or the whole of their time to the company's ervice, whereas under the Nebraska law such agents or employees &gt;efore they are entitled to receive free transportation must devote he major portion of their time to the service of the company .likewise, under the interstate commerce act the word "families' is not limited in any particular. The families of the employees come within the excepted class, whereas under the Nebraska law free ransportation is limited to the "dependent members" of the em &gt;loyees' families. The Interstate Commerce Commission, as indicated above, has held that the word "families" without any qualifying term used n the law, may include paid servants of the families. This con struction can not be given the Nebraska law, for the word "depend nt" is evidently used in its ordinary sense and means one who is not self sustaining; one who is sustained by another; one who relies upon another for support. If the housekeeper referred to in your question is paid for the services which she renders the employee of the railroad company, as such housekeeper, she can in no sense be deemed a "dependent member" of the employee's family, and, under this law, those who </seg>
            <seg id="p334">334 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT t entitled to free transportation must be "dependent members of immediate "family '" of the employee. The words "dependent" and "immediate" were used in this law for a purpose, and in the construction of the same they must be given their usual meaning, and when so considered the classes who may receive free transportation under the laws of this state are much more circumscribed than those under the federal law. In your communication you say that the housekeeper was em - ployed. I take it from this she was paid wages for her services If so, she would not be entitled to free transportation under the laws of our state. If, however, she was not receiving wages for the services she rendered, but was dependent upon the employee of the company who received her services, and was a member of his im - mediate family, she would come within the excepted classes which are entitled to free transportation.

If in your opinion the Commission has not authority to require the intersecting roads to construct a joint depot, to what extent has it jurisdiction to order facilities for the transferring of can, passengers, and property?" </seg>
            <seg id="p336">336 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT The substance of your first three inquiries has been discussed and passed upon by this department in an opinion rendered your body on November 20, 1911, a portion of which is as follows: "Under the first provision of this section are railroad com - panies required to provide transfer facilities at all points of connection, intersection, or crossing of different railroads, regard - less of whether such transfer facilities are reasonable and neces - sary for the conduct of business at the points involved? The law does not require a vain and useless thing to be done. Ob - servation and experience teach that it is very common for one railroad to cross another at a point where it would be a waste of money and an unnecessary hardship to require the installa - tion of transfer facilities. " The word 'practicable' is not here used in a physical or mechanical sense, but rather in a commercial or business sense. There is authority for its use in that sense. (United States v. Wise, 7 Fed., 190; The Benton, 51 Fed., 302.) "It may be argued that this word 'practicable' is used in a mechanical sense in the first instance, inasmuch as in the second clause of the section, where the transfer facilities are required to be placed at points where the tracks of two railroads are within five hundred feet apart, this word 'practicable' is joined with the words 'and deemed reasonably necessary.' But the argument that the latter words are used as somewha definitive of the former and perhaps as almost synonymous with it, is equally as convincing as the contrary view. "Under this section sufficient transfer facilities are require( to be placed at such points of construction, intersection, o crossing of different railroads as are deemed feasible from a mechanical and engineering point of view, provided the com merce, business, and necessities of the people demand thei installation. It then becomes the duty of the Commission to take into consideration all these facts and circumstances, am make its order accordingly. In any event, its order must be reasonable. An order to place transfer facilities where there i no business necessity for them would be unreasonable. I am strengthened in this view when I read the section following which is as follows: " 'The State Railway Commission is hereby empowered and required to investigate all cases arising under this act, whether upon complaint or otherwise, and to make such order in the premises as shall seem reasonable, and to fix a time for compliance with said order.' (Compiled Statutes of 1909, Chapter 72, Article 1, Section 30b.) "Thus, the power to investigate matters of this kind is lodged in the Commission, and its orders in relation thereto should be governed by their reasonableness as disclosed by the investigation." (Report and Opinions of Attorney General for 1911-1912, pp. 44, 45.) The views expressed therein are still adhered to, and answer your questions one, two and three. Answering questions four and five will say this law does not specifically authorise the Commission to order the establishing of a joint depot on railroads at points of connection or intersection. The legislature seems to have purposely avoided using the words "depot or joint depot" in this act, otherwise it would have been natural to have provided for their establishment in specific terms. </seg>
            <seg id="p337">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 337 "he constitutional provision creating the Railway Commission gives t general powers over the service of public carriers, as the legislature hall provide by law, but it also provides that, in the absence of pecific legislation, the Commission shall exercise the powers and &gt;erform the duties enumerated in this provision. Here the legislature las undertaken to prescribe the powers of the Commission with eference to requiring railroad companies to furnish facilities at onnecting or intersecting points, but, as observed before, it does not expressly require such companies to establish a depot. It might be argued with sound reason that, inasmuch as the egislature has specifically provided for cases of this kind, thereafter the Commission could not exercise greater powers, under the general constitutional provision, than the legislature had seen fit to authorize t to deal with under specific enactments. From information derived from a member of your body, I learn hat one of the railroad companies concerned has a depot anc tation facilities located in or near the business center of the city and it is thus situated at a point where the company naturally secures a larger proportion of public patronage than its competitor f required to abandon this location, or to duplicate these facilities at a point farther from the business center where this road intersects that of its competitor, such requirement might work a grievous lardship upon the company, and might possibly subject such an order to judicial attack, on the ground of taking the company's &gt;roperty without just compensation. It is true the rights, convenience, and welfare of the public are to be fully considered at all times, but even these can not justify a law or an order of the Commission which is violative o this constitutional prohibition. This law evidently was meant to cover cases which might arise where new villages are starting, o where railroad business is demanding a more speedy outlet at point of railroad intersection. In such cases, your body is authorized to order in such track connection, passenger platforms, and facilities as may be considered by you practicable and reasonably necessary for the handling of property and the accommodation of passengers in making transfer from one road to the other. In such instances there might arise the necessity for the railroad companies to con struct depots or waiting rooms sufficient to protect and accommodate the traveling public. The size, character, and convenience of these facilities would necessarily depend upon the character and magnitude of the business transacted, both freight and passenger. The Commission has the undoubted right to order in a depo and station facilities at a point on a line of railroad where there ar none, if the same are found to be practicable and reasonably neces - sary. It also has the power to order the repair, rebuilding, and con struction of such facilities as will meet the requirements of the traffic But, as suggested above, neither the law under consideration, no the provisions of the Railway Commission Act, was intended to </seg>
            <seg id="p338">338 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT authorize the Commission to order railroad companies to abandon heir station facilities already located by them at convenient am profitable places for the purposes of their business and re-establisl uch facilities on the basis of a joint enterprise at inconvenient o emote places, simply because their lines happen to intersect, connect or run close together at certain points. To recapitulate: The word "practicable" in the law is not used in a physical mechanical sense, but rather in a commercial or business sense. 2. This act imposes upon the Commission the duty of investi - gating all cases which might arise under this provision, in making such orders in the premises only as shall be deemed reasonable This presupposes that where there is an intersecting or crossing o two railroad lines, and the companies fail to act on their own ini - tiative, the Commission may, on either complaint or on its own initiative, have a hearing and pass upon the practicability and the reasonableness of the facilities needed and make orders therefor as it may see fit, at all times keeping in mind the rule that its orders must stand the test of judicial inquiry. 3. The orders of the Commission made, under the provisions of this act, should be supported by findings of fact that the proposed track connection, passenger platforms, and facilities which the com - panies are required to install at points of intersecting railroads, are both practicable and reasonably necessary. 4. Neither this law, nor the provisions of the Railway Corn mission act, was intended to confer upon the Commission arbitrary &gt;ower to compel the companies to abandon long established depot ocations and re-establish them in the form of a joint enterprise at points which might prove disadvantageous to one or more of the ompanies. 5. Under this act, the Commission is clearly authorized to order in transfer facilities for both freight and passenger business and such facilities would, under certain circumstances, include buildings or waiting rooms, which might properly be designatec depots; that these should be limited to cases where such installation is practicable, reasonable, and necessary for the transfer of property and passengers, after taking into consideration the facilities alread; afforded by the companies in the village or city on their separate lines. 6. The law expressly provides for a division of the expenses n the construction of tracks and switches for track connection lence, these expenses become joint obligations of the companies ffected. But, as to the cost of platforms and other facilities a points of intersection, the law is silent. This silence of the statute ndicates that orders of the Commission, with reference to passenge latforms and other facilities, should issue against the companies separately, and joint contribution for the same, if found desirable hould be voluntary on the part of the companies concerned.

Dear Sir: The Commission directs me to request of you an opinion in writing as to whether or not the Morris Transfer Company of Lincoln is a "common carrier" under the law, and hence subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission under the terms of the Railway Commission Act. The Commission requires that all common carriers shall file n this office an annual report covering its business transactions The Morris Transfer Company has declined to file its annual repor for the year ending June 30, 1912, on the theory that Jt is not a common carrier under the law, and hence not subject to the Com mission's jurisdiction. I submit to you herewith certain correspond ence that has passed between the Commission and the company. If the Morris Transfer Company is liable to the Commission for an annual report, we wish to be so advised at your earliest convenience, as we need the data from said company to incorporate in our Fifth Annual Report, which is now in process of preparation. Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, February 6, 1913. Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: I beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 31st ultimo, which is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p340">340 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT "The Commission directs me to request of you an opinion in writing as to whether or not the Morris Transfer Company, of Lincoln, is a 'common carrier' under the law, and, hence, subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission under th terms of the Railway Commission Act. "The Commission requires that all common carriers shall file in this office an annual report covering its business transac - tions. The Morris Transfer Company has declined to file its annual report for the year ending June 30, 1912, on the theory that it is not a common carrier under the law, and, hence, not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction." I understand the facts to be that the Morris Transfer Company las an arrangement with the Lincoln 'Traction Company, of the ity of Lincoln, by which it uses certain cars of the said Lincoln ompany for transporting express and freight from the city o Lincoln to the suburban cities adjacent thereto, these suburban ities being University Place, Havelock, Bethany, Normal, anc ollege View; that the Morris Transfer Company receives express nd freight at these points, and transfers the same from one point o another according to a certain schedule of rates; that the Lincoln 'raction Company owns the cars, furnishes the power, and conveys he cars over its line to and from these points; and that in some ases, when express packages are sent by express from distant cities nd their final destination is one of the suburban cities mentioned le express company receives full payment for delivery at one of the uburban cities out of Lincoln and afterwards prorates the charges with the Morris Transfer Company; in other words, that the Morris 'ransfer Company undertakes to, and does, perform a service on ne Lincoln Traction Company's lines, in conveying express am reight, similar to that performed by express companies on the various ines of railroad. Section 17, Article 8, Chapter 72, Compiled Statutes of 1911, ovides: "All persons, associations, or corporations engaged in the transportation of money or merchandise for a money considera - tion, in cars other than freight cars, and on trains other than freight trains, shall be deemed an express company within the meaning of this act." Other provisions of the act require that companies doing this sort of business shall file with the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission a complete schedule of rates and charges for the transporta - tion of merchandise within this state by such companies. I understand that the Morris Transfer Company has filed such schedule of rates with your Commission. It may be that the ilorris Transfer Company does not strictly come within the defini - ion of an express company as the same is defined by the section above quoted, but is it not a common carrier as denned by our tatute? Section 4, Article 8, Chapter 72, Compiled Statutes of 1911, among other things, provides: "The term common carriers as used herein shall be taken </seg>
            <seg id="p341">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 341 to include all corporations, companies, individuals, and associa - tion of individuals, their lessees, or receivers (appointed by any court whatsoever) that may now or hereafter own, operate. manage, or control any railroad, interurban or street railway line, operated either by steam or electricity, or any other motive power, or part thereof, or any express company, car company, sleeping car company, freight and freight line company, telegraph and telephone companies, and any other carrier engaged in the transmission of messages or transportation of passengers or freight for hire." This section, clearly interpreted, means that any carrier which ransports freight for hire is a common carrier and amenable to the &gt;rovisions of law in relation thereto. From the nature of the business ransacted by the Morris Transfer Company, it is evident that it omes within the definition of a common carrier, and should be overned by all provisions of the law applicable to such common arriers. The Morris Transfer Company seem to have so construec his section, in that it saw fit to file its schedule of rates with the Commission. Section 9, Article 8, Chapter 72, Compiled Statutes of 1911 equires that every common carrier shall thereafter annually transmi o the office of the Nebraska State Railway Commission a full am omplete statement, under the oath of its proper officers, of the {fairs of such common carriers, as the same existed on the firs ay of July next preceding. This section further prescribes in etail the nature of the statement so to be filed. kit follows, in my judgment, that the Morris Transfer Company required, under the law, to file such an annual report, and it is duty so to do.

Gentlemen: I am in receipt of yours of the 12th instant, which is as follows "Directing your attention to section 4120, Cobbey's Anno - tated Statutes of Nebraska for the year 1911, and the decision of the supreme court of this state in the case of White r.

This section is a part of e general corporation laws of the state. Section 4116, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, provides hat any number of persons may be associated and incorporated or the transaction of any lawful business, including the construction f canals, railways, bridges, and other works of internal improvement, 'his provision, undoubtedly, authorizes the incorporation of rail - oad companies, and when incorporated thereunder they are amenable o all the provisions of the general corporation laws. Said Sections 4120 and 4116, as now constituted, were originally passed by our territoria 1 legislature, together with the general pro - visions relating to corporations, and were duly approved on January 25, 1856. There is another chapter of our present law which relates pecifically to the incorporation of railroads. This chapter is 47 Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911. Section 10500 provides that any number of actual persons, not less than five, may become a &gt;ody corporate, with all the rights, privileges, and powers conferrec &gt;y and subject to all the restrictions of this subdivision. The section following the above designates just what shoulc &gt;e stated in the articles of incorporation, and in a general wa; equires that the certificate contain the name of the company, the esignation of the termini of the road, the counties through whicl shall pass, and the amount of the capital stock. When the cer ficate is duly acknowledged before a notary public, forwarded to ie secretary of state, and recorded in his office, a certified copy hereof shall be prima facie evidence of the existence of such cor &gt;oration. This law further provides that when these requirements have been fully complied with, the persons named as corporators are authorized to carry into effect the objects named in such certificate in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. In this special ace there is no provision similar to that con ained in said Section 4120, relating to the statement of the amoun f the indebtedness, as contained in the genera) corporation law 'he provisions referred to in this later act are in substantially the ame language as they were at the time of its origina! passage. I was passed and duly approved February 8, 1864. The law as it hen existed, and still exists, fixed the liability of stockholders equired the making and filing with the auditor of public accounts an nnual report, required the maintenance of a public office in this tate, and empowered the company so organized to exercise the right f eminent domain. The provisions thereof further authorized sai&lt; ailroad companies to borrow money on the credit of the corpora ions, to execute bonds or promissory notes therefor, and to secure he payment thereof by pledging the property and income of such ompany. Such railroad companies are authorized to mortgage or </seg>
            <seg id="p344">344 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT execute deeds of trust of the whole, or any part, of their property to secure money borrowed from them for the construction and equip ment of the roads, and to issue their corporate bonds in sums o not 'ess than $500, secured by said mortgages or deeds of trust This law further provides that the mortgages or deeds of trust m»d upon lines, road, or other property shall bind and be valid liens upo all the property mentioned in such mortgages or deeds, includin rolling stock, and such mortgages or deeds of trust may also, by their terms, include and cover not only the property of the com panies making them at their date, but property both real and per sonal which thereafter may be acquired by them. In a general way, the questions submitted by you are all in eluded in the one question as to whether or not a railroad company organised under this subdivision, is required to conform to all th provisions of the law applicable to general corporations, and particu larly to the requirement that the articles shall contain a statemen of the highest amount of indebtedness to which such corporatio shall be subjected, which in no case shall be in excess of two-thirc of its capital stock. In the case of White' v. Blum, 4 Neb., 562, referred to by you, one portion of the syllabus is as follows: "The subdivision of the general incorporation law, entitled 'Corporations,' applies to railroad companies organized under said law, and a failure to comply with its provisions renders the stockholders individually liable for the corporate debts. Per Lake, Ch. J. " Apparently this is an authority to the effect that a railroa&lt; corporation organized under the special railroad corporation law is also required to comply with all the provisions of the general cor poration laws. But, it will be observed that the syllabus quote&lt; was that of Judge Lake himself, and was not concurred in by th court. One of the judges did not sit in the case, and Judge Maxwel the third judge, concurred in the judgment of affirmance by Judg Lake on the first proposition discussed. The syllabus quoted relatet to the second proposition discussed, and in relation thereto Judg Lake says: "It must be borne in mind that these several provisions, they now stand upon the statute book, were enacted as one law, and at the same time. One is in fact no older than the other; they were created by the same legislative fiat, and must be considered in pari materia, and interpreted together accord- ing to the well established rules of statutory construction appli - cable to such cases." Judge Lake was evidently mistaken in stating it to be a fact that the act which specifically provided for the incorporation of railroad companies was passed at the same time as the act providing for the formation of general corporations. As stated above, the general corporation act was passed in 1856, and the one relating to the incorporation of railroads in 1864. It is possible that Judge Lake would have arrived at the same conclusion had he known of </seg>
            <seg id="p345">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 345 &gt; Cis fact, but it is likely that had he known it he would have taken e view generally laid down by other courts. "Where there is one statute dealing with a subject in gen- eral and comprehensive terms and another dealing with a part of the same 'subject in a more minute and definite way, the two should be read together and harmonized, if possible, with a view to giving effect to a consistent legislative policy; but to the extent of any necessary repugnancy between them, the special will prevail over the general statute. Where the special statute is later, it will be regarded as an exception to, or quali- fication of, the prior general one." (36 Cyc. 1151.) " Where the general provisions of a statute and those of a later one on the same subject are incompatible, the provisions of the latter statute must be read as an exception to the pro- visions of the earlier statute." (City of Cincinnati v. Holme*. 56 O. St., 104.) "A special statutory provision in one chapter of a code. substantially withdrawing, from the operation of another chap ter, one of the subjects thereof, and making specific and com prehensive regulations respecting the same, apparently com plete so far as they go, and radically different from those of the general provisions by which the subject had been previousl; governed, except such subject from the operation of the genera statute to the extent to which it is governed by the specia provision, and is pro tanto a substitute for the general statute formerly governing the subject matter." (Hawkins v. Bar* &amp; Carter, 63 W. Va., 431.) Our own supreme court had under consideration Section 37 Chapter 16, Compiled Statutes of 1905, which related to the organi ation of corporations formed for the purpose of engaging in th &gt;usiness of manufacturing. This was a special act, and nowhere i he act were the articles of such corporation required to be ti!e&lt; with the county clerk, but such requirement was made in the pro visions applicable to general corporations. The court held that thi manufacturing concern was properly incorporated because it hat ompUed with the specific act relating to the filing of articles of sue orporation, and that it was not required to file its articles of incor &gt;oration with the county clerk as provided for by corporation organized under the general incorporation act. (Meyer-Cord Co v. Hill, 84 Neb., 89.) See also Bolton v. Nebraska Chicory Co. 69 Neb., 681. i There was a time in England, and it prevailed to some exten i this country, when railroads were constructed on the money erived from stock subscriptions. Of late years, it seems that enter rises of this kind are often capitalized for a sufficient amount t lake the surveys and do the preliminary work, and the real con auction and equipment of the road is provided for by the sale o onds and securities. I do not know whether the legislature had this condition of affairs relative to railroad construction in mind at the time it passed the special act, providing for railroad incorporation. One thing ia sure, that the law-making power of the territory provided as early </seg>
            <seg id="p346">346 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT as 1856 for the incorporation of general corporations under whicl almost any sort of a corporation might have become incorporated nd that nine years thereafter the legislature saw fit to enact a law he subject of which specifically related to the incorporation of rail oads, and prescribed in every detail for their organization. I am orced, by reason of the action of this legislature and the decision f the courts of other states, as well as our own, to the conclusion hat the legislature of 1864, when it passed a specific act providin or railroad incorporation, intended that such special act should be onsidered a qualification of the provisions of the more general on &gt;assed something like nine years before. I, therefore, conclude in answer to your first, second and thirc questions that, if the railroad company under consideration was in corporated under the special railroad incorporation act, it is no equired to state the highest amount of indebtedness to which i may be subject, and is not limited in the issuance of its bonds to wo-thirds of the amount of its capital stock. Your body is authorized to approve such an issue of stock &gt;onds, or other evidence of indebtedness, as is reasonably requiret or the purpose of such railroad corporation, and, in order to deter mine the amount of such necessary issue, you are authorized t xamine estimates of the cost of construction and equipment, con racts, books, and documents relating thereto and to limit such issu o an amount which will not exceed the acutal necessities of sue proposed enterprise or one already in existence. In answer to your last question I will say, in my judgment hat before the Commission is authorized to approve the issuance o tock in excess of the amount fixed by the railroad company' riginal articles all of the provisions of law 'elating to an increase o tock should be strictly complied with by said company, and espec ally the one which requires the giving of public notice of the increase hereof by publishing the same for sixty days in a newspaper pub ished in the county in which said company maintains its public am rincipa! office.

            <seg id="p348">348 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Our supreme court has held that the Railway Commission did ot have the power to order in railroad crossings in cities and illages. Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska State Railway Commission, 132 N. W., 409.) I do not find any tatutc that confers upon the Railway Commission express authority o order in railroad crossings in territory outside of cities and vil - ages. The Railway Commission Act confers the power upon the Commission to examine into and inspect the condition of each railway r common carrier; its equipment, and the manner of its conduct and management with regard to the public safety and convenience in his state. So far as our court has expressed itself, I am led to the con - lusion that the Commission's authority is rather one of inspection of such railway crossings as have already been constructed and the ordering of repairs thereon, so as to make the same safeguard the ives of passengers, employees, and the public generally. (Chicago Rock Island &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska State Railway Com mission, 129 N. W. 439.) It does not necessarily follow that the court would hold the Commission has authority to order the origina onstruction of a railroad crossing in territory outside of cities am villages. It is true that Section 110, Chapter 78, Compiled Statutes of 1911, makes it the duty of railroad corporations, whose railway crosses any public or private road, to construct and keep in repair good and sufficient crossings within their right-of-way. The facts disclosed in your letter do not show any public roat crossing at the point where the railroad crossing is required. Neither does it show there has been any private passageway crossing the railroad company's right-of-way at that point. Hence, the above provision might not be held applicable to this state of facts. In any event, had the Railway Commission the power to order n the crossing asked for, its order would not be final in case the ailroad company refused to comply therewith, but its order woulc lave to be enforced by a court proceeding. Our courts, in a numbe of cases, have held that where a railroad crossing or facility is neces sary, and it is incumbent upon the railroad company to provid he same, an action in mandamus may be commenced to compel i to install such crossing or facility. So that, time is saved and result obtained much more speedily by instituting a mandamus in the courts in matters of this kind. In case the Commission should orde he company to place in the crossing asked for, it would have firs 0 find it was a necessary and reasonable facility. That matter would be subject to appeal; then, in case the company refused to comply with the order, an action would have to be brought to enforc ts compliance therewith. This delays a proceeding of this kind fo several years in spite of all that can be done. There is much doubt as to whether or not the request for plac - g in this crossing at a point within 500 feet of a regular railroad </seg>

In view of the uncertainty of the right of the Commission to order in the crossing, under the decision of our court, I think this matter is one that should be litigated by the village against the railroad company by mandamus in the district court of Cedar county. A much more expeditious determination of the qvestion could be secured thereby. Very respectfully, Grant G. Martin, Attorney General. No. 48 Lincoln, July 31, 1913. Honorable Grant G.

Nebraska corporations already in existence 2. Nebraska corporations hereafter created, 3. Corporations of other states which have been in existence five years, etc., or does it apply only to cases of individual sales or securities owned by the seller prior to the taking effect of the act and purchased before March 1, 1913, by the seller. Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, July 31, 1913. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: b Yours of the 31st instant duly received. You call my attention subdivision "B" of Section 3 of Senate File 4, commonly known the Blue Sky Law, which is as follows: "This Act shall not include within its purview sales of stock in Nebraska corporations already in existence, and in Nebraska corporations hereafter created, but which have been </seg>
            <seg id="p350">350 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT in existence one year or more at the time of such sale, an&lt; incorporations of other states which have been in existence five years or more at the time of such sale, the majority o stockholders, directors, and officers of which were at the time of commencing business, and are at the date of the approva of this act, citizens of the state of Nebraska, nor individua sales of securities owned by the seller prior to the taking effect of this Act and purchased by such seller prior to March 1 1913, when no commission or other compensation of any char- acter whatsoever is to move in the transaction, and no publicity is used in accomplishing the sale." The question is as follows: Do the words "When no commission or other compensation of any char - acter whatsoever is to move in the transaction, and no publicity is used in accomplishing the sale," at the conclusion of said paragraph above referred to, apply to Nebraska corporations already in existence, Nebraska corporations lereafter created, and incorporations of other states, which have been n existence five years or more, and the majority of whose officers are citizens of this state, or do said words have application only to the sales of securities owned by the seller prior to the taking ffect of this act, when purchased by such seller prior to March , 1913. The grammatical construction of this subdivision B indicates that the words "when no commission or other compensation, etc.," are intended to modify the clause immediately preceding it, which relates to the sales of securities owned by the seller prior to the taking effect of this act. Ordinarily statutes are construed in accordance with the usua rules of grammatical construction, but this rule is not followed when it clearly appears that the legislature had a different intention It is difficult to determine what was the true legislative intent con cerning this matter. Our Supreme Court has held that — "A proviso should be construed as referring to what im - mediately precedes it only, unless a different intention is appar - ent from the act itself." (School District v. Coleman, 39 Neb. 391.) k While the words under consideration are not strictly a prcviso, ey are clearly qualifying terms, and the rule laid down by the urt would evidently apply. "By what is known as the doctrine of the 'last antecedent,' relative and qualifying words, phrases, and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding, and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote, unless such extension is clearly required by a considera - tion of the entire act." (36 Cyc. 1123.) The Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota had under con - sideration one of 'the provisions of the charter of a city, the construc - tion of which was very similar to this law. A part of the syllabus in that case is as follows: "The charter of the city of Minneapolis authorizes the city council to license and regulate 'shows of all kinds, circuses, </seg>
            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 351 concerts, places of amusement and museums for which money is charged for entrance into the same.' It is held: (a) That the clause, 'for which money is charged for entrance into same,' refers to 'museums' only, and does not qualify any other pre- ceding word or subject; and (b) that the theater conducted by defendant, as stated in the opinion, comes within the class designated in the charter as 'amusements,' and is subject to the regulation and control of the municipal authorities, though no admission fee is charged for entrance therein." (State v. Schaffer, 104 N. W. 139.) These rules of construction lead me to hold that the last clause of this law relating to commission, compensation and publicity are ntended to modify the clause immediately preceding it, and that the ales of stock in Nebraska corporations already in existence, and in Nebraska corporations hereafter created, but which have been in existence one year or more at the time of such sale, and incorpora ions of other states which have been in existence five years or more at the time of such sale, the majority of whose stockholders an&lt; officers were at the time of commencing business and were at the ime of the approval of this law, citizens of this state, are not within the purview of this act.

Gentlemen: LI beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 26th ultimo, which as follows: "The Nebraska State Railway Commission directs me to ask of you a written opinion as to the proper interpretation to be placed on H. R. No. 21, passed by the Legislature of 1913, being the Telephone Physical Connection Law. "Does this law require the physical connection of local and competing companies for the interchange of local calls, or are its provisions applicable only to long distance or toll calls?" A portion of the act referred to is as follows: "Any telephone company, corporation, association, person or persons doing a public telephone business in the state o Nebraska shall take the calls or messages coming from an; other telephone company, corporation, association, person o persons, and so switch and connect its wires that such telephone message from any point in Nebraska may be delivered to an; subscriber served by its telephone exchange or switched through so that any message may be passed on to another exchange over such trunk or toll lines as may be available and designate&lt; by the exchange or switching station where the call originated regardless of the ownership of such lines." (Section 1, Chapte 79, Page 221, Session Laws.) In my judgment this law was designed to require the trans mission of long distance messages from the lines of one company on to the lines of another company, and was not intended to provide for the interchange of local calls or messages over the lines of two or more competing local companies. In this opinion I am simply giving my view of the proper con truction to be placed upon this law, and am not undertaking to go nto the question of whether or not the legislature might not have he power to require physical connection of even local competini orapanies, for the purpose of the transmission and interchange o ocal calls or messages.

            <seg id="p353">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 353 already in existence" should be interpreted or construed to mean corporations in existence at the time of the passage and approval of the act, or at the time the law became effective. Yours truly, A. B. ALLEN, Secretary. Lincoln, August 7, 1913. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: LThis department is in receipt of yours of the 6th instant, which as follows: * • " Directing your attention to paragraph b of section 3 of the Blue Sky Law, I am requested by the Commission to ask for yo'ur opinion in writing as to whether the phrase 'Nebraska corporations already in existence' should be interpreted or con - strued to mean corporations in existence at the time of the passage and approval of the act, or at the time the law became effective." The phrase "Nebraska corporations already in existence' vidently has reference to such corporations as were in existence at the time this act took effect, which would be on the 17th day o uly, 1913. This is the construction usually given to similar statute? unless a different intention may be clearly drawn from the subdivision or act itself. Inasmuch as other parts of this same subdivision xempt foreign corporations, which have been in existence five years or more, and the majority of whose stockholders and officers were at the time of commencing business, and at the date of the approva of this act, citizens of the state of Nebraska, it would seem that the egislature did not intend to include Nebraska corporations already n existence at the time of the passage and approval of the act lse it would have so expressed itself. Failing to apparently express that intention, it occurs to me that the phrase "Nebraska corporations already in existence" has refer - ence to such corporations as are in existence prior to the taking effect of the act, rather than prior to the passage and approva of the act. Yours very truly, Grant G. Martin, Attorney General.

            <seg id="p354">354 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT filed their articles with the Secretary of State and a resolution with the Board of Directors thereof, agreeing to comply with the laws of the state, shall be treated under the provisions of the Blue Sky Law as a domestic corporation or as a foreign corporation. Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, August 7, 191^. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: Your communication of the 6th instant, is as follows: "I am directed by the Commission to ask for your opinion in writing on the question as to whether foreign corporations who have filed their articles with the Secretary of State and resolution with the Board of Directors thereof agreeing to comply with the laws of the state, shall be treated under the provisions of the Blue Sky Law as a domestic corporation or as a foreign corporation." I In 1889, the legislature passed an act, now known as Section 137 of Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, which is as follows: "That any corporation organized under the laws of any other state or states, territory or territories, which has filed, or may hereafter file with the secretary of state of this state true copy of its charter or articles of association, shall, on filing with the secretary of state a certified copy of a resolution adopted by its board of directors, accepting the provisions of this act, be and become a body corporate of this state." Under this act, when a foreign corporation accepts the provisions of the general corporation laws of the state, it is declared to be a body corporate of this state, and hence is entitled to all of the privileges contemplated by the corporation laws of the state. The last session of the legislature passed what is now know as the Blue Sky Law. It provides that foreign corporations sha nclude every corporation organized outside of the state of Nebraska nd that domestic corporations shall include every corporation or anized under and pursuant to the laws of the state of Nebraska 'hese provisions of the Blue Sky Law make the character of th corporation as to whether it is domestic or foreign depend upon th lace of its organization. The Blue Sky Law further provides tha orporations of other states which have been in existence five year r more at the time of such sale, the majority of stockholders irectors and officers of which were at the time of commencin usineaa, and are at the time of the approval of this act, citizen F the state of Nebraska, are exempt from the provisions of the act bit would seem from this that the legii'ature intended to define class of foreign corporations, which are exempt from its pro - ons, and to limit them to the class whose stockholders and </seg>
            <seg id="p355">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 355 officers were citizens of this state. Inferentially it would follow that corporations organized in other states, which were not of this class, would not be entitled to exemption from the provisions of the Blue Sky Law. These considerations lead me to conclude that a corporation organized in a sister state, although it has become domesticated under the provisions of Section 4137 above quoted, is not entitled to exemption from the application of this act. Yours very truly, Grant G. Martin, Attorney General. No. 52 Lincoln, June 4, 1913. Honorable G. G. Martin Attorney General, Lincoln, Nebraska Dear Sir: I am directed by the Commission to ask from you a written opinion upon the question submitted herewith: Section 11 of S. F.

The par value of all stocks sold or offered for sale must be one hundred dollars." A number of companies which are now "selling their own securities" in this state (the law not yet being operative), and others which propose doing so, desire to sell certificates of stock whose par value varies from $100.00, said par value in some cases beini $1.00 per share, and in others $5.00, $10.00, $25.00 and $50.00 per share, depending on the articles of the company.

It is follows: "I am directed by the Commission to ask from you written opinion upon the question submitted herewith: "Section 11 of S. F. No. 4, passed by the last legislature and known as the 'Blue Sky Law,' provides: "Sec. 11. Before offering or attempting to sell any securi - ties to any person or persons, except to a dealer as herein defined, or to a corporation, or offering to do any business whatever in this state or with a person residing in this state, excepting that of preparing the documents hereinafter required, every 'company selling its own securities' shall comply with the following requirements: "One of the requirements referred to is indicated under subdivision g, Sec. 11, and reads as follows: " 'g.

"A number of companies which are now 'selling their own securities' in this state (the law not yet being operative), and others which propose doing so, desire to sell certificates of stock whose par value varies from $100.00 per share, and in others $5.00, $10.00, $25.00 and $50.00 per share, depending on the articles of the company. "Under the provisions of the law referred to, must all companies affected confine their stock selling operations to shares of the par value of $100.00?" It will be noted that subdivision "B" of Section 3 exempts certain corporations from the provisions of this law. Section 11 of this act permits a company to sell its own securities to a dealer or to another corporation, but in case of such company wishing to sell its own securities to persons outside of these exceptions, it must comply with certain provisions. Among them is the following: "The par value of all stock sold or offered for sale must be one hundred dollars." This provision should be interpreted as if it read as follows: "The par value of each share of stock sold or offered for sale must be one hundred dollars." It is safe to say that the legislature used the words "par value' n the same sense in which they are used in commercial and financia circles, and in the ordinary business affairs of life. The terms 'par value," when used to refer to the value of a bond or share o tock, means a value equal to the face of the bond, or share o tock. (See Village of Ft. Edward v. Fish, 50 N. E., 973). The egislature evidently had some purpose in undertaking to fix the hares of stock in this class of securities at $100 each. Just what hat purpose was, I cannot say. It might have been to prevent he sale of stocks issued for small amounts, which were of a ques ionable character, and by reason of the smallness of the shares of such stock, might be sold more readily to persons of moderate </seg>

No. 53 Lincoln, August 12, 1913. Honorable G. G. Martin Attorney General, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I am directed by the Commission to again call jjour attention to Senate File No. 4, passed by the legislature of 1913, and known as the "Blue Sky" Law, and to ask for an opinion in writing as to whether or not said law does not require every "dealer," as define&lt; n the act, to apply for and take out a permit to do business in his state, regardless of the kind of securities that he sells or offers or sale. t Attention is called to Section 1 and to paragraph 1 thereunder, ifining the term "dealer." These sections of the act read as fol - ws: "Section 1. The words and phrases used in this act and in proceedings pursuant hereto, shall, unless the same be in - consistent with the context, be construed as follows: 1. "Dealer shall include every foreign and domestic cor poration, copartnership, joint stock company, declaration o trust association, and every other character of association, am every individual who sells or attempts to sell or negotiate fo the sale within the state of Nebraska of any stocks, bonds, o other securities of any kind or character whatsoever." Section 12 refers particularly to dealers, and reads as follows "Section 12. Before offering or attempting to sell any securities to any person or persons, except to a 'dealer' as herein defined, or to a corporation, or offering to do any business whatever in this state, or with any person residing in this state, excepting that of preparing the documents hereinafter required, every 'dealer' shall comply with the following requirements:" Under said Section 12 are subdivisions a, b, c, d and e, which define the duties and restrictions placed upon the dealer, and seem - ingly indicate that these subdivisions are entirely independent from that part of the act relating to the sale of securities by a company issuing the same. k Attention is also called to Section 2 of the act, which might be nstrued to exempt dealers from taking out a permit unless they re selling securities which were not exempted under the act. Attention is also called to Section 16 of the act, beginning with the last sentence on page 13, which reads as follows: "It is further expressly provided that each section and each part or subdivision of a section herein, so far as an inducement </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT for the passage of this bill is concerned, is independent of every other section and every other part or subdivision of a section," etc. Therefore, if every section is to be construed separately, Section 2 would have no application to the provisions under Section 12.

Lincoln, August 13, 1913. Nebraska Stat* Railway Commission L Lincoln, Nebraska. ENTLEMEN: Yours of the 12th instant, asks for my opinion as to whether or not Senate File No. 4, passed by the last legislature, and better known as the Blue Sky Law, requires every "dealer" to apply for, and take out a permit to do business in this state, regardless of the kind of securities that such dealer sells or offers for sale. While subdivision 1 of Section 1 of said act defines the wore dealer" and makes the same applicable to every individual who sells or attempts to sell within the state any stocks, bonds or other securities of any kind or character whatsoever, it must be observe&lt; lat Section 2 of said law classifies those persons, companies am ealera, who are subject to the provisions of the act, and expressly xempts from its provisions, dealers and others who sell or negotiate or sale to any person in this state any stocks, bonds or othe securities except such as are hereafter excepted. k Referring to Section 4 of said act, government bonds, state nds, county bonds, in all about fourteen different classes of securi - s, are exempted from the provisions of this law. Sections 12 and 13 of the act also indicate that a "dealer" who Is or offers for sale any character of securities should first obtain a permit therefor. However, it does not seem to me that a fair nterpretation of this law would require a "dealer" to secure a per - mit and pay a license therefor in order to lawfully sell securities which are designated by Section 4 as exempt from the provisions of the law. It follows that a "dealer" who deals only in such exemptec securities is not required to pay a license fee and secure a permi herefor, and when he undertakes to sell or offer for sale to persons other than "dealers" or "corporations," securities which are no xpressly exempted from the provisions of the act, he should pay he license fee required by law, and be duly authorized to act aa a dealer by your body.

An early reply to this inquiry will be appreciated. Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, August 22, 1913. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska.

"An early reply to this inquiry will be appreciated." This department has heretofore held that subdivision g. Section 11, requires that each share of stock sold or offered for sale by every "company selling its own securities" shall be of the par value of $100, and that every such company shall comply with that require - ment as well as a number of others mentioned in said Section 11. b Under the provisions of Section 3, dealers who make sales of urities to other dealers, or to corporations, are exempt from the visions of this act. Under Section 12 of the act, every "dealer" is required to comply with certain provisions. As stated by you, subdivision g, of said Section 11, relative to the par value of stocks, is not included among these requirements to be complied with by a dealer. Hence, it follows that the answer to your question may be determined upon the fact as to whether a dealer could be successfully prosecuted if he saw fit to offer stocks or securities, the par value of whose shares was made less than $100 each. This not being one of the requirements prescribed by law for a dealer to comply with, a dealer who had come into pos - session of shares of stock the par value of which was fixed at less than $100 each, could not be successfully prosecuted for offering to 8211 or selling the same.

Gentlemen: I have yours of the 21st instant, which is as follows: "I am directed by the Nebraska State Railway Commission to submit to you the following inquiry received from Mr. E. W. Reed, special examiner for the Commission's 'Blue Sky' Depart- ment, and to request of you a written opinion upon the question involved. Mr. Reed's communication is: "A company has recently been organized for the purpose of operating a line of co-operative stores in Omaha and South Omaha. This company has applied for a permit to sell its securities under the Blue Sky Law. Among other provisions in its articles of incor - poration is the following : " ' Article 4. The authorized capital stock of this corpora - tion shall be one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), divided into seven hundred and fifty shares (750) of preferred stock of one hundred dollars ($100) each and two hundred and fifty (250) shares of common stock of one hundred dollars ($100) each, which shares of stock or fraction thereof shall be fully paid when issued, either in cash, real or personal property or its equivalent, as shall be determined by the board of directors, and shall be non-assess - able. At the meetings of the stockholders each share of common stock only shall represent ten votes, which may be cast either in person or by proxy. ' " " 'It is desired to obtain the written opinion of the attorney general on the following points: "1. Is the foregoing article of incorporation in violation of paragraph g, Section 11, of the Nebraska Blue Sky Law? All certificates issued by the said company to read $100 par value in case of the sale of less than $100 worth of stock, the same to be designated as one or more tenths of a share. "2. If it is found that said company cannot sell its own securities to the public and should sell such securities to a dealer, can such dealer then sell the securities as above described to the general public? "3. If it is the opinion of the attorney general that a frac - tional part of a share of stock having a par value of $100 cannot be sold by the company issuing such securities, will the same strict construction of the section providing that 'the par value of all stock sold or offered for sale must be $100' permit such com - pany to sell more than $100 worth of stock to one party? "An early response to this request will be greatly appre - ciated.' " K Every "company selling its own securities" should make the value of each share of its stock $100. The Commission is author - to issue a permit to every "company selling its own securities" </seg>
            <seg id="p363">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 363 which complies with this provision and the others designated in sai&lt; Section 11. The Commission should not by this permit authorize uch company to sell fractional parts of a share, such as one o more tenths of a share of stock to different individuals. This woulc &gt;e authorizing such company to circumvent the plain provisions of the law. If such company has the right by law to sell a fraction of a share, it would have such right without authority from th /Ommission, and the Commission ought not to grant a company he right to do something which would nullify one of the provision of the law. Your second question is answered in a prior opinion of this department, as of this date. kin answer to your third question will say one or more shares stock of the par value of $100 each may be sold to persons desir - g to buy the same.

Gentlemen: LThis is to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 2d instant, which part, is as follows: "Upon request of Mr. E. W.

It then devolves upon the Commission to make an examina - ion of the data so submitted, and to determine therefrom as to whether or not the company should receive a permit to do business n the state, under the provisions of this act. For this examination and report by the Commission, a fee is required to be paid by the applicant. When this fee for such exam - ination and report is paid, the Commission is authorized to issue a permit to the applicant to do business for the first year. Taking all these provisions into consideration, it appears that he fee is exacted for the examination and report, and is to be reated as a payment for the same, rather than to be treated as a ee for issuing the permit. In case the Commission, after making he examination, should find that the applicant ought not to receive a permit, the Commission would still be entitled to the fee for the examination, and, hence, would not be required to return it. Espec - ally would this be true when the Commission had received the fee and turned it into the state treasury. There is no authority for securing a return of fees when they have been turned into the state reasury, unless it is done by filing a claim and receiving approva of it and an appropriation therefor by the legislature.

Dear Sir: I am instructed by the Nebraska State Railway Commission to request of you an opinion in writing on the following question: Under our stock and bonds law can prosecution be sustained against a foreign corporation, organized under the laws of another state, which sells or attempts to sell within Nebraska its stock or bonds without first securing from this Commission authority for the issuance of such stock or bonds? An early reply to this inquiry will be appreciated Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. </seg>
            <seg id="p366">366 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Lincoln, October 17, 1913. Nebraska State Railway Commission L# Lincoln, Nebraska. entlemen: Your inquiry of the 11th instant is as follows: "Under our stock and bonds law, can prosecution be sus- tained against a foreign corporation, organized under the laws of another state, which sells or attempts to sell within Nebraska its stock or bonds without first securing from this Commission authority for the issuance of such stock or bonds?" The act referred to by you, which deals with the subject o ■suing stock and bonds, is Sections 37, 38 and 39, Article 8, Chapter 2, Compiled Statutes of 1911. It provides that a common carrier or public service corporation organized, and incorporated or hereafter ncorporated, under or by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska may issue stock, bonds, notes, or other evidence of indebtedness irovided that an order shall be obtained from your Commission authorizing the issuance of the same. It is further provided by said act that every common carrier and public service corporation which shall violate any of the pro - visions of the act shall subject itself to the forfeiture of a sum not to exceed $5,000 for each offense. Any officer or agent of any common carrier or public service corporation, who violates or aids in the violation of the provisions of said act, subjects himself to prosecution or a felony, and upon conviction shall be punished by confinemen n the penitentiary for not less than one nor more than ten years This act expressly restricts its provisions to such common arriers or public service corporations as are organized or incorporatec under the laws of the state of Nebraska. It is likely this restriction wa an oversight on the part of the legislature. The legislature migh live required foreign corporations owning public service propertie n this state, which properties were used as a basis for the issuance of stock and bonds, to have secured from your body authority fo he issuance thereof before such stock and bonds would operate a iens upon their properties located in this state. However, when a prosecution is instituted and a complain filed for a violation of this act, one of the essential allegations shouh necessarily be that the common carrier or public service corporation is incorporated under the laws of this stats. Even though it wer the intention of the legislature to include foreign corporations, they are not regarded as included unless specifically mentioned, and complaint or information, charging a violation of the law, canno be aided by inference or the intention of the legislature. The propo - sition is elementary that a complaint or an information, chargin a criminal offense, must explicitly state all the essentials to con - stitute such offense under the law, and nothing can be interpolated therein and its averments will not be aided by intendment. (Has* r. Stats, 74 Neb. 493.) It must not be overlooked that the provisions of Section 215, </seg>
            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 367 Chapter 16, Compiled Statutes of 1911, provide the manner in whic oreign corporations may become domesticated in this state. Thi s done by filing with the secretary of state a copy of their article of incorporation and a certified copy of the resolution adopted by heir boards of directors accepting the provisions of this act, by means of which, under the law, they become a body corporate o his state. When foreign corporations have done this, as is the case with some of the public carriers, they are to be regarded as beini ncorporated under the laws of this state. In such cases, I think they would be subject to the provision of the stock and bond law referred to above, but foreign corpora ions which have not become domesticated under the provisions o his latter act could not be successfully prosecuted for failure to &gt;rocure an order of your body authorizing the issuance of thei tock and bonds. It may be that foreign corporations may take dvantage of this oversight on the part of the legislature and organize with a view of carrying on public service plants within this state hereby avoid the necessity of submitting their stock and bone ssue to your body. If this be true, as no doubt it will be, I see no way to avoid it until the legislature has, in express terms, by some appropriate method, included within the stock and bond law oreign corporations which may undertake to carry on their line f business within the state, and own and operate plants therein Very respectfully, GRANT G. MARTIN, Attorney General. No. 58 Lincoln, November 22, 1913. Honorable Grant Martin, Attorney General, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I am directed by the Commission to request of you an opinion in writing as to whether a permit to issue stock, under the provisions of the Blue Sky Law, will be required in the following instances, to- wit: First, where a Nebraska corporation has been organized and in existence for over a year, and has issued all the capital stock author - ised under its charter. By reason of the growth of its business it desires to increase its capital stock by amending its articles. Is it necessary to secure a permit in order to sell or dispose of the stock provided for in the increased capitalization? t Second, the incorporators of a company desire to subscribe for entire issue of capital stock and do not propose to dispose of </seg>

Lincoln, November 25, 1913 rbraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: This office is in receipt of your communication of the 22d instant, which is as follows: "I am directed by the Commission to request of you an opinion in writing as to whether a permit to issue stock, under the provisions of the Blue Sky Law, will be required in the following instances, to- wit: "First. Where a Nebraska corporation has been organized and in existence for over a year, and has issued all the capital stock authorized under its charter.

The incorporators of a company desire to sub - scribe for the entire issue of capital stock and do not propose to dispose of same to the public. Are they required, under the law, to secure a permit under such circumstances?" In reply to your first question will say that this act does not nclude within its purview sales of stock in Nebraska corporations which have been in existence one year or more at the time of such ales. The fact that a corporation of this kind is required to amenc ts articles of incorporation and increase its capital stock, so as to properly carry on its business, would not, in my judgment, subject uch corporation to the necessity of securing a permit in order to sell the stock representing its increased capitalization. Replying to your second inquiry I will say that where the incor &gt;orators of a proposed corporation purpose subscribing for and taking he whole of the capital stock therein, and do not intend to rely upon disposing of any of the stock to outsiders, under this law they would not be required to secure a permit which authorizes the sale of stock to persons generally. Should such corporation thereafte conclude to sell its stock to those not incorporators, a permit there or should be secured. Very respectfully, Grant G. Martin, Attorney General. </seg>

Dear Sir: I am directed by the Commission to ask your opinion in writing as to whether or not co-operative associations, as defined by Senate File No. 88, Session Laws of 1911, Sections 228 to 232, inclusive, of Chapter 16, of the Compiled Statutes of 1911, are required to secure a permit, under the provisions of the "Blue Sky Law." Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, November 29, 1913. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: Yours of the 25th instant is as follows: "I am directed by the Commission to ask your opinion in writing as to whether or not co-operative associations, defined by Senate File 88, Session Laws of 1911, Sections 228 to 232, inclusive, of chapter 16, Compiled Statutes of 1911, are required to secure a permit, under the provisions of the Blue Sky Law." The act referred to by you provides that a co-operative com - pany, corporation, or association is defined to mean a co-operative company, corporation or association which authorizes the distribu - tion of its earnings in part, or wholly, on the basis of, or in pro - portion to the amount of property bought from or sold to members, or of labor performed, or other service rendered to the corporation It also provides that any number of persons, not less than wenty-five, may be associated and incorporated for the co-operative ransaction of any lawful business, including the construction o canals, railways, irrigation ditches, bridges, and other works o nternal improvement. This act further confers upon such co-operative association the usual corporate powers exercised by general corporations. Under his law, these co-operative associations are also required to pay he same amount of incorporation fees as are required by 'aw for ike capitalisation of general corporations in this state. The so-called Blue Sky Law, which is Chapter 199, Session Laws of 1918, defines "domestic" corporations, and says they shall include every corporation organised under and pursuant to the laws of he state of Nebraska. This law further defines "companies selling heir own securities," and says they shall include every character of company incorporated, or otherwise selling its own stock or </seg>
            <seg id="p370">370 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT securities by itself or through any character of stock promotion scheme, or through either or both such methods. Section 11, Chapter 199, Session Laws of 1913, provides that &gt;efore offering or attempting to sell any securities to any person or ►ersons, except to a dealer as therein defined, or to a corporation or offering to do any business whatever in this state, or with a person residing in this state, excepting that of preparing the docu - ments therein required, every "company selling its own securities' hall comply with the following requirements: Here follow ten equirements, designated a to j, inclusive; these include a permit rom the Commission and the requisite that the par value of al tock sold, or offered for sale, must be $100. Co-operative associations are being organized in a number o ounties in this state. Some of them are organized for the purpose of carrying on an elevator and grain business, some for engaginj n mercantile pursuits, and under this law they may be organizec or almost any kind of business, including the construction of canals ailways, irrigation ditches, bridges, and other works of interna mprovement. The sale of stock in some cases is limited to member f certain organizations, and in other cases the stock is sold indis riminately to the citizens of the locality in which the organization s promoted. Considering the law under which co-operative associations are rganized and the general character of the business upon which they may enter, is there any possible theory on which they are exempt rom the requirements of the so-called Blue Sky Law? The latter aw does not specifically exempt such co-operative associations although it specifically exempts building and loan companies organ - zed in Nebraska, corporations organized at the time the law took ffect, and corporations organized thereafter which have been in xistence one year or more at the time of the sale of their stock nd corporations of other states which have been in existence five years or more at the time of the sale of their stock, the majority f the stockholders, directors, and officers of which were at the ime of commencing business and were at the date of the approva f the act citizens of the state of Nebraska. Had the legislature intended to exempt co-operative associations rom the application of the Blue Sky Law, it has entirely failed to o so specifically or by inference. By the phraseology of the act t has expressly included such co-operative associations. If these ssociations should not have been included, and are compelled to uffer by reason of this law, the legislature is chargeable with the wrong and to it they must look for relief. Until the legislature makes lain its purpose to exempt them, such co-operative associations, be same as other corporations offering their own securities for sale, re amenable to the provisions of the Blue Sky Law.

Very truly yours, A. B. Allen, Secretary. Lincoln, November 29, 1913. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: Sometime ago you called my attention to the fact that the various railroads of the state were refusing to comply with the pro - visions of Senate File 174, the same being the law providing for the ssuance of free transportation to shippers of live stock on single carload shipments. t Senator Grace, of Mascot, who was .the author of this amend - »nt to the law, also called upon me and urged that some steps be ken with regard to the enforcement of this law. I have made some investigation of the authorities, and have furnished Mr. Grace with a copy of my views on this subject. I herewith present you with a copy of the letter written to Senator Grace. It has been suggested that possibly an action might be brought by this department to enjoin the railroad companies from violating </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT Ei law. I do not think an action of that kind could be main - ned in any event, and certainly not where there is no penalty ivided for a violation of the law. The only remedy provided is a civil remedy, and that is given to the shipper who is refused return transportation.- As suggested in my letter to Senator Grace, he may bring an action in his own name, and recover costs and attorney fees providec the law is a valid one. I also suggested in the letter to the senato that I would be pleased, in case any individual started an action to assist in preparation of briefs and in the trial of the case, so that the question might be tested in this state, although the authori ties referred to by me in that letter show that statutes of this kinc have been declared void when they reach the courts. Yours very truly, Grant G. Martin, Attorney General. Lincoln, November 13, 1913. Honorable J. M. Grace, L Mascot, Nebraska. r Sir: Since you were in the office, talking relative to Senate File 174, hich you introduced and which was passed by the last legislature, have been giving this matter considerable consideration. I find that your act simply amended Section 10602, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, which is Section 6, Article 1, Chapter 2, Compiled Statutes. In looking for the original act I find no penalty attached to it for a violation of this particular section [ence, this section cannot be enforced by criminal prosecution 'here is a liability provided in favor of the shipper, and it becomes ecessary for him to bring an action against the company anc ecover the cost of transportation to which he is entitled, with costs nd attorney fees.- The only penalty in the act is the one which elates to the subject of furnishing a caboose or suitable car for the ransportation of shippers of live stock. In view of these facts, I do not see how I can enforce this act by any proceeding in the name of the state. It would be different if there were a penalty provided, and then I might have a prosecu - tion instituted by the county attorney of the county where the offense took place. I know that where the amount is small very few shippers will be inclined to bring an action, but this privilege is clearly conferred upon each shipper. I have also been investigating the subject to determine whether or not an act of this kind can be sustained in the courts. I find that the courts of several of the states, in considering legislation of this kind, have held the same unconstitutional, on the theory that </seg>
            <seg id="p373">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 373 it takes property of the railroad company without compensation and does not afford the companies equal protection of the laws. The supreme court of Kansas held: "The statute (Chapter 167, Laws 1897), being 'An Act to require railroad companies to furnish free transportation to shippers of stock in certain cases,' etc., is a deprivation of prop - erty without due process of law, and a denial of the equal protection of the laws, and is therefore unconstitutional and void, under the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitu - tion." (Atchison T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Campbell, 59 Pac, 1051.) The supreme court of the state of Missouri, in 1908, said: "Rev. St. 1899, sec. 1085 (Ann. St. 1906, p. 933), in so far as it requires railroad companies to furnish free return transportation to shippers of stock by carload over the line of their road or roads to the point from which shipment is made, is invalid as a deprivation of property of the carrier without due process of law, in violation of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution. "Such section is also invalid as a denial to the carrier o the equal protection of the law, in that it denies to railroad companies the right to charge and exact payment of tolls o fares for the transportation of shippers of stock over their linea which they are allowed to charge other shippers for the same service." (McCully v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. Ry. Co., 110 S. W 711.) The Missouri court held as follows in another case: "Rev. St. 1899, sec. 1085 (Ann. St. 1906, p. 933) in so far as it requires railroad companies to furnish free return trans - portation to shippers of stock by carload over the line of their road to the point from which shipment is made, is invalid as depriving the carrier of property without due process of law.' (George v. Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co., 113 S. W. 1099. I also learn that recently the United States circuit judges rend ered a decision in the city of Council Bluffs, Iowa, in which the; held that the railway commission of that state could not require the railroad companies to convey passengers to special assemblies state fairs, etc., at a less rate than that fixed by law, which is also two cents per mile in that state. Thus far I have not been able to find any court holding a statute ike ours, or similar to it, as valid. In view of these precedents t is very doubtful whether an action could be successfully main ained by an individual shipper to recover the damage done him, as provided by statute. However, in case there is anyone who wi &gt;ring this action, I would be glad to assist his attorney in briefin he same for the supreme court of our state. Of course, our court might take a different view of the law but it seems that the supreme court of the United States has also ruled adversely to our contention in a case presented to it where the principle is very much the same but the statute under considera tion not exactly like ours.

Honorable Gentlemen: Being privileged again to cover the subject of physical valua ion in brief outline, it can be said that much work announced as &gt;ending in the report of 1912 has now been consummated an&lt; appears herewith. Values found for public utility properties seem o be increasing in interest and importance generally and are reflecte&lt; n certain degree within our commonwealth. Methods and interpre - ations with reference to the same are being called for in variou orms, which has suggested additional statements for present valu not heretofore advanced in the work of this department and will b« ound herewith attendant in part. Special reference to the sam s given under the particular headings affected. It is believed alto - gether the labors progressed to date cannot be said to have been ess exacting than heretofore, and that the results will meet a reasonable expectations. L During the past eleven months no further efforts have been ade relative to: ELECTRICALLY OPERATED INTERURBAN RAILROADS, STREET RAILROADS, EXPRESS COMPANIES' PROPERTIES, and therefore no statements appear covering the same. Steam Railroads and Allied Properties. The attendant report covering this class of properties will be found dated as of July 1 1911, excepting one as of July 1, 1912. The cause for delay in com pleting same has already been mentioned. The statements represen a careful re-valuation, after consideration of the exacting prio efforts of 1909. Owing to incompleteness of several of the owners reports for re-valuation, none are shown herewith. As already indi cated amended methods are in evidence in determinations for presen value, more particularly outlined in the addendum following. Telegraph Properties. No more intricate task has likely been undertaken than the determining and allotment of worth in the making up of the statements herewith, where close relationship to the steam railroads obtains. A large portion of one company's property exists thus associated, and the problem principally was </seg>
            <seg id="p520">520 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT vision of ownership. The several contracts between the railroads nd the telegraph company under which their possessions were ealized and have been maintained presented intricacies not deciph - red with facility, and were further complicated by overlapping ubsequent agreements. An exhaustive reading and interpretation these matters suggesting the sacrifice for each party is developed the statements following. One company's property appears nearly dependent, only complicated in slight measure as indicated. Prac - cally a complete field check on the part of the department corro - orates the reports. Telephone Properties. For sake of convenience and clearness nd to briefly cover attendant circumstances for each, it has been lought advisable to submit herewith a complete list of all treated 'his it will be found repeats some of the figures presented last ear, but serves to convey 'additional pertinent information. The tey and footnotes accompanying the figures it is trusted will serve le purposes desired. Because of much difficulty to get in close ontemporaneous touch with all of the telephone properties, as .-eviously hinted no complete report seems possible for any certain ate. Also field checking has been limited only to properties where sues have been raised. The scope and extent of the work may be videnced when it is said 280 several companies' properties have &gt;oen considered, possessed of 523 separate exchanges, and comprising 76,243 subscribers' stations, 42,990 pole miles, 156,465 wire miles nd 5,172,423 feet of cable. A great deal of time and energy during the past several months las been expended upon the important work of special appraisals or use in well known rate cases. Important contentions and even hallenges of the department's figures found have had much to do with the labor involved in the determinations. Wherever and when - ver satisfactory checkings of the properties in question have been made, it is gratifying to note that the department's findings have not been proven inconsistent or inaccurate. Information Furnished Taxing Authorities. A large amoun of data covering railroads, telegraph and telephone properties has been prepared and furnished various taxing authorities throughou he state. Because of the intermittent nature of such, no compre hensive statement can be rendered as to the amount of time o xpense consumed. The most conservative estimate indicates durini he past twelve months, six or seven months' exclusive time fo one engineer. This seems to show a valuable service extended in his manner, not, however, a duty devolvent upon the department Working Force and Expense. No correct accounting can be rendered as to the cost of conducting the work herein mentioned, for the reason that the last legislature, as you are aware, appro - priated no separate fund for this undertaking and all since April first has been in common with the Commission's affairs. The number </seg>

Again the sincere and capable efforts of the variou ssistants employed is held in kindly acknowledgment, and it i &gt;elieved the efforts of all in combination has brought about reliable nd satisfactory results and which will greatly influence futur medications, no doubt.

ARGUMENT Supporting Formula No. 2 from which is derived and presented herewith statements setting out present value of steam railroad properties, and modifying methods of 1909 now of record altogether for consideration. All appraisals suggested for''consideration under public regula ion must be predicated essentially upon ideal principles. To under ake to set out a modification or make amendments to that which las obtained heretofore at once introduces many questions, some o which it may be advisable to mention here, but the discussion o he same because of desired brevity should be very limited and in some cases entirely omitted because the characteristics are wel cnown. Therefore, only the salient matters concerning some o he prime steps will receive mention. of the first duties of a valuator in determining a physical esent value or state according to accepted methods is to apply proper measure of depreciation to the established reproduction oat new. This involves as a general plan the influencing of each tem of the inventory credibly and scientifically and sometimes rbitrarily based on judgment, in order to find the desired con - lusion. Thus it is agreed manifestly the solution comprehends bat which is ideal in accounting, and the hypothetical findings are xpected and desired to coincide with the realized depreciation i: pread over a considerable period of years and under normal con - itions. UA number of steps in accepting principles to be adhered to •nts many times not altogether generally agreed to separation </seg>
            <seg id="p523">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 523 f accounts; but which if taken altogether in the make-up of an xtended history of a property should make little difference in the inal figures. To illustrate, amortization of certain elements dissipat ng and re-appearing, versus capitalization; what shall be embracet nd understood as maintenance costs, versus depreciation; and traight line depreciation versus that estimated less interest on an ssumption of being a fund partly loaned. To assist in disentangling ome of the controversies which might appear in these matters nd give a more uniform understanding and practice, certain class cations of accounts have been prescribed and accepted resulting in much progress in standardization, and which has been held in mine n organizing valuations. In spite of the advances in the methods for appraisals, there emains a considerable of oscillating about pivctacable points, anc herefore there is commanded for consideration a review from al laimed rational angles. Such demands may arise because of pecu iarities incident to one estate where issues are raised, that are no o be found in others. It is reasoned that fallacious treatment may thus be discovered, even to the extent of inaccuracies in thing hat are basic. Valuations are intended to be so found to avoic s near as possible such criticisms, and therefore any modifie&lt; rinciples adopted may as in this case show different figures unde ifferent plans for present condition, whereas if a question of rat f decadence is asked for, a careful study will reflect no considerabl ariance. Thus is evolved the suggestion and use of the appraisa made. In establishing a valuation to be employed in the public regula ion of utilities, and which is not considered complete unless a reproduction cost new is set up together with a so-called presen value or state, which latter is generally understood to represen elatedly the remaining age of the dollar invested, the same is am may be expected to be considered under two distinct phases witl certain modifications with the ramified associations of each, and from which pertinent deductions may be drawn. One premises may be that the reproduction cost new sha represent the proper invested cost upon which to predicate earnings and other pertinent matters. Shall this be accepted, then the con elusions as to present value would serve but two attending purposes viz: that of setting out the extent of the physical decay for th study of probable serviceable life, and that of comparably measurin a required depreciation reserve fund. Another basis may be that the present state of the propert thus measured in money value remaining, may be made fundamenta as the proper amount upon which to base earnings, in lieu of th former, and which obviously would give greater importance to th latter mentioned figures, viz: that of present value. In case sue should obtain the related attributes already outlined in the firs instance together with additional ones would still remain. </seg>
            <seg id="p524">524 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT It is expected here not to argue over the various principles adopted into the 1909 appraisal following the above outline, but onl set out certain reasons why changes for certain items have bee suggested for study. Some of the accounts in the classification can not rationally be said to be affected by depreciation, while other as treated heretofore as not lessening in worth when in the presen state, have been pointed to for reasons thought worthy of considera ion as liable to the action here mentioned. Therefore these only will receive any attention. 11. Track Laying and Surfacing is an item that may be claimed as related to the material accounts of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 and being largely the labor placing and using the said material is given the same ratio as that found for the average of the severa elements just mentioned. 32. Engineering and Superintendence, which upon close analysis seems to present a dual situation, in that a certain portion of the result of the expenditure becomes emblazoned upon record and the earth's surface permanently without deterioration or loss while the remaining portion may be directly related to the structura lements in association. This account generally approximates a ost of $1,000.00 per mile of roadway. The enduring portion jus efined approximates a cost of $400.00 per mile of roadway, o wo-fifths of the total, while the remaining three-fifths is depreciated n measure found for the average of all of the structural element n the roadway, viz: items 3 to 30 inclusive. t38. Rent and Repair* of Equipment During Construction in be said to be related to all of the structural items of the road - ay, viz: 3 to 30 inclusive, and is lessened in measure as found for le average of the total of the same. 39. Inspection and Purchase of Equipment may be claimed in coincidence to accounts 33 to 37 inclusive, and is depreciated according to the average of the total of the said items. k40. Transportation of Material can be said to be related all of the structural elements of the roadway, viz: 3 to 30 in - usive, and is lessened according to the average of the same. 42. General Expenditures — Contingencies. It may be con tended that this account is affected by certain lessening of worth related directly or not to certain or all of the other items comprisini the inventory. A careful study seems to develop the following based upon the principles outlined. Organization, Administration and Legal Expenditures seem o present in certain measure an element not affected by decadence, an&lt; may be said to be in part unaffected and enduring and which is the mental concept of the organized estate, somewhat akin to that describee or a portion of item 32 above. No other means at hand has been dis erned than to arbitrarily fix the amount non-depreciating as four fths of the total, at the time considering that the remaining one-fifth </seg>
            <seg id="p525">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 525 Ein character experimental and of a departing nature and in relationship the physical machine. This remaining one-fifth is lessened by the tio found for all of the items 1 to 40 inclusive except 31. Printing, Insurance on Property, Taxes, and Interest on Money During Construction can be claimed as related to the physical machine comprising items 1 to 40 inclusive except 31, and therefore the present value is measured by the average of the said items. Contingencies, being an element related to all of the foregoing except item 31, seems to be correctly treated by depreciating in measure found for the average of all of the foregoing except account II. To avoid any misunderstanding as to the foregoing, it seems prope to definitely state that intangible -values of every kind in accordance with the department's interpretation are entirely excluded from con sideration, and especially where bases are mentioned that might seem to involve, and may do so, investment or property beyond the physical no such elements are reasoned as being embraced in the discussion. </seg>

            <seg id="p577">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 577 INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTS Nebraska State Railway Commission, Engineering Department Information secured and services rendered by Engineering )epartment covering work other than physical valuation during the fiscal year just closed present an interesting study of the Commis ion's business and the extent and diversity of the work required by he general public. Each of such investigations are necessarily omplete within themselves and made in such manner that the Com mission is fully informed upon each detail that it may properly djudicate the cases which come to its attention. It must be furthe ealized that the accuracy and completeness required in evidence nd information so gathered is used as a verification of all othe nformation and evidence presented by contending parties. Many nformal complaints or petitions presented to the Commission require s extended study and investigation as do some of the formal com -plaints and the Commission must necessarily have at its commanc n efficient corps of competent employees whose time and labors are epresentative of and substituted for the time and labors of the Commissioners themselves. tA brief review of such investigations is presented herewith, parated into several sub headings for convenient and ready refer - ee. Steam Railroads. Roadway and Service Inspections SIGNALS AND SAFETY. Considerable effort has been put orth to bring about the adoption of uniform safety devices, par icularly with reference to block signals and interlocking plants so hat the concerted action of a number of states may eventually &gt;ring about the general adoption by steam railroads of a compre lensive system of safety devices, the construction or completion o block signal systems and the protection of every railroad grad crossing by a mechanical or electrical interlocking plant. A set o uniform rules covering the construction, maintenance and operatio of signal systems and interlocking devices has been considered b he states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Nebrask and Kansas, several of these having adopted such rules. CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION. During the past year Union Pacific Railroad has completed three new lines, viz., Hastings to Gibbon, Callaway to Stapleton and Northport to Gering, and thi construction has been carefully watched by the Engineering Depart ment to amplify its information relative to construction methods an&lt; costs. GRADE CROSSINGS AND OVERHEAD HIGHWAYS. Several inspections have been made of grade crossings in Omaha, particularly where the Omaha street railway tracks cross those of a steam railway. Several overhead highway bridges have been 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p578">SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT tpected and recommendations made as to their reconstruction, ension and location. STATION FACILITIES. In connection with station facilities and accommodations for traffic, quite an extended study was made of a proposed union depot project at Falls City just prior to the construction of the Burlington's new passenger station at that place; I study and estimate of cost was made concerning the relocation the passenger station at Gering; the arrangement and cost of elters at U. P. R. R. stations on double track; a recent inspection ;ats with conditions at Steinauer in connection with the passenger ition and stock yards; investigations and estimates have been epared for industrial trackage, transfer and direct connections tween railways; and general conditions affecting the safety and nvenience of the public. ROADWAY CONDITIONS. Special effort is made in this ine toward the correction of defects and the improvement of track onditions affecting the safety and the speed of trains. Particular eference is made to complete detailed inspection of Missouri Pacific ail way "s branch lines extending from Talmage to Crete and from uperior to Prosser and of the Rock Island Branch from Jansen to orton, Kansas. This latter line has been subjected to three distinct nspections and also the issuance of an official order requiring extensive mprovements and is at the present time under consideration for urther action by the Commission for the extension of such irn - &gt;rovements. Stock and Bond* Act I Among the more important investigations and estimates made ■ the information of the Commission relative to the granting of thority for the issuance of capital are found the proposed financing the Omaha, Lincoln and Beatrice Railway, an electric interurban erating a short distance out from Lincoln, Nebraska, and its DJected completion to Omaha. The Nebraska Central Railway, io an electric interurban line, projected to serve Omaha, Fremont, &gt;rfolk, Sioux City, Niobrara and a number of other points in the rtheastern part of the state, together with two water power develop - ;nts near Niobrara, has just been investigated and construction estimates rifled, the authorization of capital being now under consideration the Commission. Several smaller utilities where investment was rifled or estimated have been investigated, among these being a oposed hydroelectric development near Louisville, the St. Edward ectric Company and others.

A re-tabulation in detail of steam railroad values has been made for the State Board of Equalization. The value of information secured and at hand relating to land values within this state as gathered by and under direction of Mr. 2. W. Reed, a member of the Engineering Department, and the amount of labor required to secure same should not be overlooked, nor forgotten by those who desire to inform themselves on this ubject and it is surprising that this information, together with the extensive cost data applying to steam railroads, electric interurbans, express, telephone and telegraph properties is not more generally used, since it is open to the public and always available. C. H. Gerber. Engineer. November 30, 1913 NEBRASKA CLASSIFIED LAND VALUES FOR 1913 The land values shown in the following tabulation are the resul of a careful study of all data gathered by the Engineering Depart ment of the Railway Commission during the last four years, togethe with all other available data bearing upon the subject. The average value of each class of land is based upon a carefully compile* estimate by bankers in every county of the state. The fairness o hese estimates were established by checking them with actual sales wherever such information was available, and with information in he possession of the Engineering Department. The acreage in each county is based upon the State Auditor's report of land listed for </seg>
            <seg id="p580">5*0 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT assessment in 1912. The population of each county is based upon the United States census for 1910. The land is divided into three classes, viz.: Best farm land, (which in some counties includes hay land); second class farm land, (being land devoted to farming, but of inferior quality compared with the best land in the county), and pasture land. This latter includes all land not suitable for farming purposes or hay land and is useful only for grazing purposes. The portion (in percentage) of each class of land in each county is based upon wide investigation by the author; a study of contour maps made by the United States Geological Survey; and Agricultural Survey of Nebraska by J. A. Warren, Assistant Agriculturist, United States Department of Agriculture; topographical maps of Nebraska, being prepared under the direction of Dr. George E. Condra, Uni - versity of Nebraska, and the valuable data given in Dr. Condra's Geography of Nebraska, 1912. As a check against the average values thus obtained, the value determined by the United States Census Report for 1910 is also shown. It will be noted that the average value of land in the state for 1913 does not greatly exceed the value for 1910 although there has been a general increase of land values in the state during the last three years. This seeming discrepancy is due to the fact that this list contains 560,480 acres more land than is shown by the United States Census Report.

            <seg id="p585">PART VII BLUE SKY DEPARTMENT Lincoln, Nebraska, December 1, 1913. To Nebraska State Railway Commission, L Lincoln, Nebraska. ENTLEMEN: tl beg to submit for your consideration a report of the Blue y Department from the date of its organization to November , 1913. Senate File No. 4, known as the Blue Sky Law, was passec and approved April 21 and became effective July 17, 1913. The supervision of the law was delegated to the State Railway Commis - sion, conferring upon that body power to exercise judicial discretion in passing upon the merit of certain securities when offered for sale in this state. tThe object of the act is the better conservation of investments ■ requiring detailed and complete reports to be made regarding security before permission is given to vend it in the state, thereby eluding from the state worthless and fraudulent securities. Organization In accordance with authority given by the act to employ such subordinates as might be found necessary to properly conduct its administration, the Commission in May, 1913, assigned to E. W Reed, who was already in its employ as right-of-way appraiser am statistician, the additional duty of directing the clerical admiristra tion of the law under the official title of "Special Examiner for the Blue Sky Department" and directed him to make such investigaton as seemed advisable as to the practice followed in other states having similar laws and to prepare such blank forms as might be required to conduct the business. On July 1, 1913, Miss Grace M. Steward was employed in the apacity of stenographer for the Blue Sky Department at a salary t $65.00 per month. She is the only employee whose salary is targed to the funds derived from the business of this department 'he terms of her employment are that when she is not busy on ork for that department she will be subject to assigrmert of work rst by the Valuation Department and second, to any other depart - ment of the Commission where her services may be needed. During le five months prior to November 30 her time has been fully mployed approximately as follows: Two-thirds of her time for le Blue Sky Department and one-third for the Valuation Depart - ment. tOnly a nominal amount of money has been expended for office uipment, being confined to one combination filing case costing </seg>
            <seg id="p586">586 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT K6.10, the necessary blank forms and stationery amounting to 7.60. Publicity An effort has been made to give as wide publicity as possible o the provisions of the law upon the limited means available for lat purpose. The legislature provided for the printing of the lue Sky Law in pamphlet form, and in order to place this pamphlet n the hands of those coming into close touch with the various nvestments made in every community and those directly interested n the conservation of small investments, a copy was sent to the ,000 banks of the state, together with a letter asking them to keep available for public inspection and to co-operate with the depart - ment by reporting promptly all violations of the law that might ome to their attention. Hundreds of copies have been mailed by equest to interested parties in Nebraska and other states. The ewspapers have also aided materially by frequently publishing matters of general public interest regarding the law and its inter - retation and administration. Interpretation Unfortunately, the Nebraska Blue Sky Law is encumbered by many imperfections. Passed during the rush incident to the closing ays of the legislature and having met with vigorous opposition rom various interested sources, many of its essential features were o amended as to make them void or indefinite and seriously cripple he force and effect of the entire act. The Commission and the pecial examiner were immediately confronted with the perplexing ask of interpreting its various provisions and moulding it into shape or practical operation. The Attorney General was freely consultec n an effort to arrive at the correct legal status of indefinite sections f the act. Ten separate written opinions of the Attorney Genera were received and are briefly summarized below: 1st. Holding that the last clause of Sub. B, Section 3 of the Jlue Sky Law relating to commission, compensation and publicity are intended to modify the clause immediately preceding it. This uling excludes from the purview of the act, first, Nebraska corpora ions in existence July 17, 1913; second, Nebraska corporations organized since July 17, 1913, after one year; third, corporations of other states in existence five years at time of sale, the majority of stockholders, directors and officers of which were, at time of com mencing business, and are at date of approval of this act, citizen of the state of Nebraska, and fourth, individual sales of securitie owned by the seller prior to March 1, 1913, when no commission or other compensation shall move in the transaction and no publicity s used. 2d. Holding that "par value of each share of stock sold or </seg>
            <seg id="p587">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 587 Eered for sale (by the corporation issuing such security) must be e hundred dollars." Holding that "Nebraska corporations already in existence, ans corporations in existence when the act became effective." b4th. Holding that "foreign corporations becoming domesticated der Section 4137, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes, 1911, does not nstitute a Nebraska corporation as the term is used in this act. 15th. Holding that a "dealer" as denned by Sections 11 and 13 f the act, is not required to take out a permit unless the securities ffered by such "dealer" are subject to regulation under the act." k'6th. Holding that the restriction of sales of stock to such have a par value of one hundred dollars per share does not apply stocks sold by a "dealer." 7th. Holding that fees provided for under subdivision A o Section 11, Subdivision B of Section 12, is payment for the "exami nation and report" on the application and is earned and should be retained by the department if such examination and report is made whether a permit is granted or not. k8th. Holding that the Commission cannot authorize the sale fractional shares of stock having a par value of $100 each under e provisions of Section 1 1 of the Blue Sky act. 9th. Holding that the increase of capital stock by amendment of articles of incorporation by a Nebraska corporation, existing prior to July 17, 1913, does not have the effect cf creating a new corpora - tion and requiring the taking out of a permit. 10th. Holding that co-operative corporations will have to com - ply with the requirement of the act with reference to the sale of stock, prohibiting the sale by such corporation of its stock having a par value of less than $100 per share. Care has been exercised to handle all controversies in an oquit able manner and upon a conservative basis and therefore no litigation has developed from the enforcement of the act. Corporations have generally keen courteous and prompt in supplying information askec for and in conforming to the requirements imposed by the law. Administration The feature of the act that has caused the greatest inconvenienc and called forth the greatest amount of adverse criticism is th unfortunate provision requiring all stock, when sold by the compan ssuing it, to be $100 per share par value. This feature has n &gt;enefieial effect in keeping out objectionable securities, but has marked detrimental effect in virtually prohibiting the organizatio of many kinds of co-operative companies for the mutual benefi of farmers, laborers and various other community interests whic are perfectly legitimate and commendable enterprises. It is to be regretted that the act was so amended before final passage as to effectually prevent any supervision or regulation of </seg>
            <seg id="p588">588 SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT and promotion schemes. While some of these schemes are legiti - mate, many of them are frauds exploited for profit to the promoters only. The department has received more complaints regarding activities in this class of promotion than all other kinds combined since the law became effective. The Act, however, provides that in - vestigation of land propositions shall be made by the "State Conser - vation and Soil Survey" when requested so to do by any interested &gt;arty. That department is under the direction of Dr. G. E. Condra of the State University, and he is exercising all the powers conferred by the Act in exposing all fraudulent land exploitation schemes. Another disappointing feature of the act is that it is not pro- ductive of sufficient revenue to be self-sustaining if the salary of the special examiner was to be charged to and paid from the revenue derived therefrom. The only possible way of carrying on the work under the present act is the one adopted by the Commission in assigning the clerical administration as an additional duty to some - one employed by it in some of its other departments. A slight modification of the law would obviate this defect. While the number of permits granted has been small, the volume f work incidental to organizing the department and the regular outine of making examination of applications and handling corre - pondence has .been heavy. In all matters which are not governed &gt;y mandatory direction of the act, it has been the policy to adopt what has seemed to be the broadest common sense view and to place as few obstructions as possible in the way of legitimate business. 'he theory has been to exclude from sale in the state all such securi - es as would in all probability work a fraud upon the purchaser, r securities that were of such a nature that their purchase would in all probability result in loss to the purchaser. The moral effect of the Blue Sky Law has resulted in much ood to the people of the state. A vigilant watch and immediate otice to either comply with the law or cease operations has resulted n driving agents handling questionable securities out of the state, '(trough reports received and investigation made much reliable nformation has been accumulated relative to many kinds of enter - &gt;rise3 which have not applied for permission to sell their securities, 'his information has, on various occasions, been supplied to parties asking for it and is available to the public at all times on application.
