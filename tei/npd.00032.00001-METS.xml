            <seg id="p003">OFFICE OF STATE LIBRARIAN Lincoln, December 19, 1914. To the Honorable John H. Morehead, Governor of Nebraska: As provided by law I herewith submit my report as li - brarian of the Nebraska state library for the biennium ending December 1, 1914. It is to be noticed that on December 1, 1912, there were 65,871 regularly accessioned volumes in the library and that since that time there have been added 1,420 volumes by purchase and 2,317 volumes by exchange and donations, making a total of 69,608 volumes now in the library. These figures, however, do not include unbound volumes, pamphlets, etc., which, while of great value to a working library should hardly be listed as "vol - umes received." By the publication of volumes 91, 92, 93, 94 and 95 the number of volumes of Nebraska supreme court re - ports has increased from 26,518 to 27,665. These reports are in the hands of the librarian for sale, the price being fixed by law at $2.00 per volume, the proceeds being paid to the state treasurer and retained by him in a fund known as "state library fund for the purchase of books." During the last biennium there has been paid into such fund $5,210.20, all of which amount is now in the state treasurer's hands. The legisla - ture of 1913 did not appropriate this fund as it had heretofore done, but appropriated the sum of $6,000 out of the "general fund" for the purchase of books. The amount appropriated was not sufficient to purchase the needed books and the library is is asking for $750 to cover the deficiency that will exist by April 1, K15. The appropriation for the ensuing biennium for the rchase of books should be not less than $7,000. The work of card cataloguing the library, which was well in hand two years ago, has progressed as well as could be hoped and patrons are now being served more expeditiously and satis - factorily than ever before. Since the date of my last report the sum of $817.75 has been expended for binding and rebinding 1,021 volumes of periodicals, newpaper files, public documents and law books. Experience has demonstrated that buckram is in every respect better than any other style of binding, and I </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 REPORT OF THE WOU1G rCCOlTllTitrOCl LTlclL SCSSlOil 1HWS, nOUStr dUQ StrHtilfc* JOUITlalS and all state publications of a permanent nature be so bound. Pursuant to a joint resolution of the legislature of two years ago, on March 6, 1913, the Secretary of State delivered to me for distribution and sale 288 copies of the report of the com - mission to revise the general laws of Nebraska. These copies have been distributed as directed, 36 sold at $6.00 each, and 18 are now in my hands. The sum of $350, which was appropriated in 1913, for book - cases and shelving, has been expended in building bookcases on top of the stacks at the east and west ends of the main library room. We are still crowded for room — hundreds of volumes being piled in the windows, on the gallery ledges and on the floors — and all that can be done now toward securing necessary space for books is to lay a floor upon the remaining stacks in the center of the room and build bookcases thereon. Architects and engineers say that they believe the main library floor will bear the additional weight. This will cost about $1,500, and I am requesting an appropriation of that amount. I would not be performing my duty as custodian of Nebraska's priceless library if I failed to direct your attention to its shameful neglect by those whose business it is to provide it with suitable quarters and protect it from destruction by fire. In 1904, 1906, 1908, 1910 and 1912, your Excellency's predecessors, recognizing the deplorable and dangerous conditions that existed, brought the matter to the attention of the legislature and urged prompt action. Local interests — local appropriations — political hopes and fears — and consequent log-rolling in each legislature have prevented even a vote being taken on a proposition to provide a needed building. And during these years we have seen the libraries of Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin and New York devas - tated by fire! This is the situation. Nebraska's splendid library, worth approximately half a million dollars, the achievement of fifty years of well directed effort, is crowded and cramped in poorly lighted, poorly ventilated quarters in a crumbling, tottering building, every day exposed to the dangerof destruction by fire and absolutely nothing being done for it by those who are respons - ible for its preservation and safe keeping.

            <seg id="p005">STATE LIBRARIAN, 1913-1914 5 the value of our library is increasing at the rate of $20,000 every year by reason of the enhancing price of out-of-print books which are now on our shelves. It would seem that ordinary business judgment would demand that this valuable property be cared for. To my mind this would be best done by completing at least so much of the building on the half block east of the Capitol grounds as would temporarily accommodate the Historical Society, Supreme Court and State Library. I trust that your Excellency will not only recommend favorable action on this matter in your message to the legislature, but that the executive department of .the state will take such an interest in the subject that something will be done. Attached to this report is a statement of the condition of the library and supreme court funds, of the disposition of the printed reports of the commission to revise the laws, a detailed state - ment of the receipt and disposition of supreme court reports, also an appendix showing the additions to the state library alphabet - ically arranged. Very'respectfully, H. C. LINDSAY, State Librarian. </seg>
