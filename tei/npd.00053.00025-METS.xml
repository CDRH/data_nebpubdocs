INTRODUCTION The Purpose, Scope, and Method of the Survey. tThis Bulletin gives the results of the third annual survey the organization, condition, and business methods of C0 - rative companies in Nebraska. It follows somewhat closely the plan of Bulletins 108 and 109, published by the Bureau of Markets and Marketing, State Department of Agriculture, and covering the years 1919 and 1920. From the Bureau's experience, it was thought that the companies would be able to supply reliable data of a more comprehensive char - acter than heretofore, hence an attempt has been made to go with greater detail into the internal management and practice of each company. Accordingly, the data show important facts about the capitalization, credit policy, management and ac - counting methods of the companies in relation to a successful co-operative business. Co-operation in distribution is regarded by many as the hope for consumers by its elimination of profits as the main ob - jective of capital investment. In practice, however, co-opera - tive companies are recognized as often weak in their organi - zation and operation because there is lack of appreciation of the importance of a continuous supply of ready capital for suc - cessful business. Likewise, it has been claimed that in a typi - cal co-operative enterprise there is too little incentive for men of surplus means to devote their capital and energy to pro - moting its success. It is therefore of interest to study the facts as disclosed by this investigation in order to get further light on these questions.

            <seg id="p006">STATE OF NEBRASKA I the features of true co-operation, are co-operative in pur - e and nature, if not in name. It is not intended to include mers' companies organized as regular stockholding corpor - &gt;ns. Of 281 returns received, 230 were considered complete &gt;ugh to use. In view of the general industrial depression I the searching nature of the questionnaire those who made urns show a deep interest in co-operation. The distribution firms reporting and the completeness of the larger propor - n of individual returns indicate a representative survey, es - dally since the questionnaire method was in some cases sup - mented by personal investigation. History of Co-Operation in Nebraska The development of co-operation in Nebraska dates from the time of the Patrons of Husbandry, or the Grange, in the early seventies ; and later the Farmers' Alliance flourished. It began thus as a farmers' movement, and as such has for the most part continued. While true co-operation in the sense of the term employed herein was incidental and not fundamental to these earlier organizations, many were started that were truly co-operative in aim, if not in formal structure. Chief among co-operative organizations more recently has been the Farmers' Union. That there has been considerable advance in the recogni - tion and application of co-operative ideas in the state is shown by the continual enactment of legislation favorable to the for - mation of true co-operative companies. Formerly under the Ne - braska constitution such a company could not be established unless it incorporated under the general law as a regular stock corporation. Thus, in 1911 the legislature passed a law author - izing any number of persons, not less than twenty-five, to as - sociate and incorporate under the general laws of the State, "for the co-operative transaction of any lawful business". This law also recognized for the first time in Nebraska, the prin - ciple of the distribution of earnings on the basis of patronage instead of stock ownership. In 1919 the co-operative law was changed specifically removing co-operative associations from the class of corporations and classifying them as limited part- </seg>
            <seg id="p007">BULLETIN NO. 118 7 nerships, a form of organization provided for under the general laws. The new constitution adopted September 21, 1920, re - lieved co-operative companies from the original constitutional limitation, and permitted them to adopt the "one man, one vote" rule. The amended co-operative law of 1921 permits as small a number as fourteen persons to form a company, and re - quires the company to use the word "co-operative" in its cor - porate name. Co-operative principles are recognized in sec - tions of the law limiting the amount of stock owned by one person to not more than 4 per cent of the capital, requiring a fixed rate of interest of not more than 10 per cent on the cap - ital, and a patronage dividend to customers or patrons, and permitting any company to limit the voting power of any mem - ber to one vote per person. Explanation of Terms The meanings of certain terms used in this Bulletin are as follows: A Co-operative Company limits dividends on capital stock to a fixed rate not to exceed 10 per cent, shares profits in pro - portion to patronage of customers, and limits the control of the individual stockholder by a restriction on the amount of his stock ownership or his voting power. A Patronage Dividend is a dividend based upon the amount or value of goods bought from or sold to the co-operative com - pany by a patron who is usually a member. A Fixed Rate of Dividends is the rate of interest on capi - tal stock fixed by law and by each companny, in no case to ex - ceed 10 per cent. The Limit on Share Ownership limits the shares of stock which may be owned by one person. The Limit on Voting Power, of "one man, one vote," may be placed on members according to the 1921 law. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 STATE OF NEBRASKA Capital includes only funds secured from the sale of capi - tal stock. Inventory is used to include the amount of commodities handled by a companny on hand at the beginning or the end of its fiscal year, and does not include articles of equipment or buildings. (Purchases and sales similarly include only com - modities handled and do not include equipment.) b Stock Turnover indicates the frequency with which the irage inventory of commodities handled is sold and replaced a year. kA Balance Sheet or Financial Statement is a statement owing assets and liabilities, the difference representing the tual value of all capital stock outstanding. kA Full-time Bookkeeper is one who devotes all his services the work of keeping books, and is employed at no time in 1 other capacity. Cash Sales are those made for cash, and do not include sales made on 30 days' time. PRINCIPAL AND SUBSIDIARY LINES OF BUSINESS OF 230 CO-OPERATIVE COMPANIES The 230 companies from whose returns the data for this survey were taken have as their principal lines of business, ele - vators, stores, creameries, lumber yards, and combinations of two or more of these, and many of them handle as subsidiary lines the commodities listed below: 1. ELEVATORS 122 Subsidiary Lines: Flour, Oil, Twine Posts, Coal and Feed, Tankage, Machin- ery, Building Material, Farm Supplies Produce. </seg>

Less th cent of the 59 stores reporting were in existence at the I ning of 1913, as against 26 per cent of elevators im prior to that date. Attention is directed to the fact that 131 companies, or •&gt;, per cent of all, began by purchasing an established business, while 99 companies, or 43 per cent, began by establishing ;i new business. Thirty per cent of the 59 stores, and 65 pei cent of the 122 elevators purchased a going business at th€ beginning. Apparently, it was considered safer to start tht mercantile business as a new corporation and not by purchas - ing an established stand, than to enter the elevator busines. - as a new concern. The reasons for this are the fear that \v case of taking over an established mercantile business the co - operative promoters might get old and worthless stocks ol goods on hand ; and, also, the fact that a co-operative store does not to such an extent, as do other types of co-operative busi - ness, depend upon outside sources for its customers or patrons as the store from the outset is started for its stockholders as a means of obtaining merchandise at lower prices. e ♦• n ■I — 122 32 90 43 79 108 105 116 </seg>

These data indicate that the 230 companies have great potential power of expanding their business. The aver - age authorized capital of the companies is $37,102, while the average paid-up capital is only $17,503. There are 30,751 stockholders, or an average of 136 for each of 226 companies. Each of these stockholders owns an average of $130 of stock in his company. These facts show a very good distribution of small holdings of stock among individuals. But the average stock holdings of the co-operative member are so small as to fail to enlist his active interest and to induce him to contribute additional financial support in case the business requires it. </seg>

It will also be observed from e :'.. below, that 59 stores report 241 regular employees, ex - ve of extra salesmen, or an average of more than four em - ees per store.

The amount of wages paid the 407 regular employees in 1921 was $507,559, and the amount paid in salaries to 230 managers was $402,574, or a total expenditure for labor by the 230 elevators, stores, creameries, lumber yards and other companies of $910,133. The average wage paid all 637 of the employees, including managers, was $1,428, while the average wage paid 407 regular employees, excluding managers, was $1,247. The average salary paid managers was $1,750. Elevator company employees received $1,518 as an aver - ge wage, the highest average wage paid per person. The owest average wage paid was $1,301 for employees of stores. Tiis is explained by the fact that managers of elevators with igher salaries constitute a larger proportion of the labor force n elevators than they do in stores, as there are 122 managers f elevators and only 90 other employees and 59 managers of stores and 182 other employees. </seg>

            <seg id="p018">18 STATE OF NEBRASKA OPERATING MANAGEMENT OF COMPANIES One of the most important factors influencing the success - ful outcome of any business enterprise is the quality of its executive management. In the case of co-operative undertak - ings, it has long been asserted that at this point lies one of their main defects, and that skilled and capable managers have not been sufficiently appreciated. An effort has, therefore, been made in this survey to assemble data which would throw light on the qualifications of the managers of the companies, and which could be correlated with certain marks of a success - ful business. Table 5 on the preceding page shows the facts concerning the previous occupation, salary, experience, and the frequency of business reports of managers of the companies in the dif - ferent lines of business. It will be observed that 77 of the 230 managers, or 33 per cent, were previously engaged in farming, 71 of them, or 30 per cent, had been managers, 24 of them, or 10 per cent, salesmen, and the remainder had followed other varied occupations. Forty-five of the 122 managers of the elevators, or 36 per cent, were previously engaged in farming, while 23 of the 59 store managers, or 38 per cent, had been farmers. Furthermore, 37 managers of elevators, or 30 per cent, had previous experience as managers, while 14 of the managers of stores, or only 24 per cent, had previous manager - ial experience. These data apparently indicate that the ele - vator companies have secured managers who were somewhat better fitted for their work by reason of experience than were the managers of the stores. The average annual salary of the managers of all compan - ies is $1,750, which appears to be low in comparison with sal - aries for similar positions in other lines, and confirms the criti - cism frequently made of co-operative companies to the effect that they do not offer sufficient remuneration to secure the best managerial services. The average salary of elevator managers is $1,649, the lowest average paid in any line; and the highest average salary paid is $2,360 for managers of creameries.

Two hundred and seven managers report that they make written reports to their boards of directors either annually, nonthly, or at irregular intervals, while 23 fail to indicate that they make written reports. Some of the managers make monthly as well as yearly reports, and a considerable number report only irregularly. Thirty-nine stores, and 70 elevators nave managers who make monthly reports, a very excellent practice. Proportionally more store managers report monthly an do the managers of any of the other companies .

In some companies a restriction may be placed upon the right to transfer stock of co-operative members. The amount of authorized capital is fixed in the articles of asso - ciation by Nebraska companies. The practice of the companies in borrowing capital is a K&gt;int in management which requires constant scrutiny and one t which the data tend to show one of the most serious weak - nesses of co-operative companies. As shown in Table 6 bor - owed capital amounting to $2,567,429 at the beginning of the year diminished to $2,333,300 at the close of 1921. Although S917.399 of notes were paid off, $683,270 of additional money were borrowed during the year, permitting the net deci to be only $234,129. In view of the generally strained fina conditions of the year, any diminution in borrowings is i mendable. Companies in all the different lines of business off larger total amounts of notes than they borr year.

Furthermore, the average borrowed capital of all compan - &gt; 10, 145, is extremely high, when taken in relation to paid - ipital, which averages $17,503. In the case of stores, the capital was found to be $17,881, while borrowed money by the table to average $11,895.

It was also found that 61 companies sell on a strictly cash basis, while 167 reported that they sell on credit. The credit &gt;eriods range fi-om one to twelve months for various com - &gt;anies.

On the face of it this would appear to &gt;resent a favorable condition. But other facts must also taken into consideration. The average paid-up capital for 230 companies is $17,503, while their average borrowed cap - 1 represented by the amount of notes outstanding January 1922 was $10,145, and the average borrowed capital of 157 ■npanies reporting notes outstanding on that date was $11. - 1. If we regard borrowed funds as constituting a part of z working capital, then 45 per cent of the total average cap - ,1 of all companies represents borrowed funds, and 36 per it of the total average capital of 157 companies represents tstanding obligations. It seems, therefore, that a large pro - rtion of the 210 companies owning their buildings are hold - f them and at the same time owing notes with heavy inter - t-bearing obligations. Under such circumstances the own - ship of its building by the company might be merely nom - il and not necessarily favorable. ACCOUNTING METHODS One of the objects in this survey was to ascertain the pre - vailing practice of co-operative companies in regard to account - ing, auditing, buying and selling methods. Table 8 presents the facts as disclosed by the returns concerning book-keeping practices of the 230 companies. It shows whether or not cer - tain standard methods are used, and the frequency of their use. It will be observed that 179 companies employ the double en - try method of keeping books, while 51 others are still attempt - ing to keep records by inferior systems. One hundred and six- </seg>

Of 212 companies whose books were audited, 152 make yearly audits, and 144 companies re - port that professional auditors were engaged to do the work. It is worth noting that only 66 companies keep full-time book - keepers, although 179, or nearly three times as many, follow the double entry method. This indicates that it is possible to introduce and use good accounting practice without the expen - diture for labor ordinarily supposed, especially since good, yet simple, double entry methods may be installed.

Many of the companies did not supply balance sheets or financial statements with their returns, al - though a few others furnished statements which could not be used because they were incomplete. The businesses included in this table are distributed as follows : elevators, 38 ; stores, 18 ; creameries, 1 ; combinations of two or more of the preced - ing, 16. One of the first things of interest in a balance sheet is the relation of the current assets to the current liabilities ; or, in other words, the relation of the items available for the pay - ment of debts, as cash, and those which it is expected to turn into cash, as merchandise, accounts and notes receivable, etc..

It will be observed that the total of the current assets is Sl.786.4o7, while the total current liabilities amount to $1, - 118,757. Although these figures show an excess of assets, the excess is not as large as is usually desirable. For the average business it is generally considered that the ratio of current tssets to current liabilities should be at least 2 to 1, whereas he ratio in this consolidated balance sheet is 1.6 to 1. Exper - ence has shown business men generally that this 2 to 1 ratio desirable; current assets are largely in forms other than ish. and where the current assets are not considerably in ex- cess of current liabilities, it has been found that these other kinds of current assets cannot be turned into cash as rapidly as the current liabilities become due. The aim should there - fore be to keep the capital of the corporation in the form of current assets as much as possible, so as to avoid difficulties meeting obligations as they become due. This latter point is also of importance in considering the relation of the fixed assets, such as real estate, building and equipment, to the outstanding capital stock. Fixed assets are those which it is not expected to turn into cash during the life of the business, therefore large investments in such assets permanently remove these amounts from the group of current assets. The result is that in many cases money must be bor - rowed to carry on the business, or large amounts must con - tinually be owed to wholesalers and manufacturers.

A question was also included calling for an in - dication of the prospects for the co-operative movement. Table 10 shows that 60 per cent of the managers considered that their co-operative companies had positively benefitted consum - ers. In view of the fact that many of the elevators, which as a whole constitute more than half of the 230 companies, handle primarily commodities which they are selling for local pro - ducers to outside markets, this 60 per cent may be regarded as comprising all the companies selling at retail to consumers. Seventy-seven per cent of the managers reported that their companies were of distinct benefit to producers. Fair 1 34 | 14.5 Very Good 16 | 6.9 Unfavorable 10 4 Good 1122 ! 53.

The co-operative movement in Nebraska is predomin - antly one of producers, as 58 per cent of the principal lines of business carried on by the 230 companies are elevators and 26 per cent are stores. 2.

A large majority of so-called co-operative concerns ac - tually conform in organization and practice to the essential tests of true co-operation, as prescribed by the constitution and laws of the State. 4. The membership of co-operative companies is well dis - tributed in each locality, and the capital stock holdings are in - dividually small. The 30,751 stockholders make an average of 136 per company, while the stock held by each member aver - ages only $130. 5. A small proportion of the total number of employees and managers are stockholders in their respective companies, as only 33 per cent are so reported. 6. Average wages and salaries of employees and manag - ers are lower in stores than in elevators. 7. The volume of business transacted per company is smaller in 1921 than in either of the two preceding years. 8. For all stores reporting, the average inventory for the year in proportion to paid-up capital is too high, being 101 per cent. 9. Among stores there is a laxity of practice in charging orf bad debts, as only 53 per cent of the stores charged off bad debts in 1921. 10. Many companies disregard the practice of concen - trating their purchases with as small a number of wholesale houses as possible. 11. The ratio of borrowed capital to paid-up capital is unfavorable when considered in the light of good business practice, as the data show that the companies tend to keep their borrowings up to the legal limit. 12. Double entry book-keeping methods may be used without employing a full-time book-keeper. 13. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities for </seg>

Of 73 companies which furnished complete balance eets too much of the capital was found to be invested in ed assets. CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS With a view to making readily adaptable to the needs of co-operative companies the essential points of the conclusions from this survey the following suggestions of a constructive character are submitted : (1. Since the authorized capital of the companies is t\ iat of the paid-up capital, when a company needs additu fipital it should be subscribed by securing new members 01 etting additional sums from those already members or b he average amount of stock owned by stockholders being I 130, this amount should be increased. k2. It is often advocated that employees shouh u raged to buy stock in the company on the ground 1 11 tend to insure greater interest and loyalty. 3. High turnover of your stock of merchandise or con: nodities each year does not necessarily indicate a profitabl business, as money can l&gt;e lost through a high turnover wit' oo high operating expenses. Watch these expenses in rely ion to your volume of business ; increasing the volume of busi r.ess reduces overhead or fixed expenses per unit of produc handled. 4. Stocks of merchandise or of commodities should be reduced or paid-up capital increased, in cases where a com - pany is over stocked or the borrowed capital approaches the sixty-six and two thirds per cent of paid-up capital. 5. A cheap manager is too often just what he is asserted to be. Efficiency requires high compensation. Data of this survey show that efficient managers can be secured, if offered </seg>
