PREFACE 

In the preparation of this non-technical introductory 
report concerning the geology of Nebraska, the writer has 
been actuated by a desire to anticipate the wants of citizens, 
and to prepare something which may be useful and helpful 
to them ; and if those who receive this paper will kindly reciprocate 
by correcting errors and offering suggestions, it will 
be helpful in turn in the preparation of future papers ou 
special subjects. 

Errors and omissions incident to initial work will be overlooked 
the more readily if it is known that this work has 
been conducted for the past ten years without compensation, 
and in many instances at personal expense. 

Rigid economy has compelled the omission of many maps, 
figures, and descriptions, but as the State Geological Survey 
grows and comes to enjoy the moral and financial support 
of the people, the writer can look forward hopefully to the 
completion of reports of increasing accuracy and usefulness. </seg>


            <seg id="p017">
HISTOIJICAL INTRODUCTION 

A history of the Geological Survey of Nebraska is briefly 
fold, for its inauguration has Iteen so recent that little is to 
be recorded. Citizens of the state, viewing the common 
wealth as one rich in agriculture and poor in mines, have 
come to the false conclusion that a geological survey of the 
region is superfluous, if not wasteful. However erroneous 
such a conviction mnv lie, it lias served to check state appro 
priations for making public in printed reports the resources 
of which t lie state can boast. Prior to April, 1901. no legis 
lathe appropriations had been made, and the work of the 
Qeological Survey was conducted at private expense. In 
1891, i lie writer was appointed Acting State Geologist by 
Governor Thayer, and successively reappointed by Governors 
CrooBM and Boyd, and by the legislature of IMS, in which 
year it was enacted that the head professor of geology at 
the University of Nebraska should be the geologist for the 
state, with the title Acting State &lt;ieologist. At the same 
time there were likewise established the offices of acting slate 
botanist, chemist, and entomologist, all of these being purely 
honorary positions and carrying no salary. 

The writer has willingly derated his vacations and holidays 
to the state survey as a pure gratuity, his office not even 
being provided with stationery or postage for a voluminous 
correspondence, nor with any means of publishing facts and 
results. Citizens will therefore excuse the tardy appearance 
of formal reports. 

Past conditions were somewhat reversed in 1899, at which 
time the Kegents of the University of Nebraska, in recognition 
of the importance of a geological survey, provided that 
|500 be devoted to this object during the year 1899 and &amp;.'."&gt;n 
a rear for 1900, 1901. 1902. </seg>

NEBRASKA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 

These iim, though wholly inadequate to the work 
involved in so magnificent an area, were nevertheless very 
iaportaat, and rendered possible certain lines of investigation 
whicli otherwise could not have been conducted. In 
the meant hue. funds varying from several hundred to one 
thousand dollars a year have been furnished the department 
of geology by the. Hon. Charles II. Morrill. of Lincoln. This 
private aid was of grot importance 1 in supplementing the 
work of the State &lt; Jeologkal Survey, inasmuch as it enabled 
the giM&gt;logist to send partial to various regions to collect 
specimens of fossils, rocks, clays, limes, cements, soils, and 
numerous other resources. 

HISTORY OF THK MOKUILL GEOLOGICAL EXPEDITIONS 

Through the generosity of the Hon. Charles II. Morrill, of 
Lincoln, the expeditions seat out annually from the University 
of Nebraska, known as the Morrill Geological Expeditions, 
have become a permanent organization of the University. 
Therefore it is but a fitting mark of respect that a 
report of these expeditions be given, in order that it may 
become ¦ matter of record. 

Introductory to this work, a private geological excursion 
was undertaken in June of 1891 by the writer, in the interest 
of the University of Nebraska. At this time the Daiinonelix 
l»eds of our state were discovered and explored, and the Bad 
Lands of Nebraska and regions in South Dakota were visited, 
the result being that a very considerable collection was 
made, and several new genera and species found. In May 
of IS'.tL* a second trip (likewise at private exjiense) was made 
to the Sioux county Had Lands and to the Daiinonelix beds. 
Again a large amount of material was secured and added to 
the collections of the State Museum. At this juncture Mr. 
Morrill proffered liberal contributions for the prosecution 
and continuance of the work. Then followed, during June, 
July, and August of the same year, the first of what has 
become the annual Morrill Geological Expeditions. 

A well-equipped party of seven visited and collected in </seg>

HISTORICAL 

Ehe Bad Lands of the state and the Dairaonelix hods, eoninuiiiic 
thence into Booth Dakota and to the Dinosaur beds 
f Wyoming. 

In l!S!t:{, a similar sum fires bj Mr. Morrill Bade possible 
the second annual .Morrill Geological Expedition, durinj; 
which collections were made in the Rhinoceros beds of Kan- 

sas, the Hat Creek Bad Lands, and the fossil Corkscrew beds 
of Sioux countv. 

During the third annual Morrill Geological Expedition, 
894, the party drove from Hot Springs to the l'.iir Bad 
&lt;andfl of South Dakota, where some six or eight weeks were 
pent; thence to the Hlack Hills and beyond into Wyoming 
uul Montana, the result of the expedition being the accuinu 
ation of a larjre amount of material of great variety, 
nclndine fossils, minerals, rocks, etc. 

In 1893 the party constituting the fourth annual Morrill 
Geological Expedition continued work from the Daimonelix 
&gt;eds and the Little Had Lands of Nebraska to the Big Had 
.ands of South Dakota, and thence to the Black Hills and 
leyond. This was the largest and best equipped party as 
et sent into the held. 

In 1896 the fifth annual Morrill Geological Expedition 
extended its work to eastern fields, after spending some time 
in the Carboniferous of Nebraska. 

In the summer of 1897 the members of the sixth annual 
Morrill Geological Expedition again visited and collected in 
he Ri&lt;j Had Lands of South Dakota, the Black Hills region, 
he Little Had Lands, the Daimonelix bed* of Nebraska, and 
leyond into Wyoming. 

In 1898 the seventh expedition was influenced by the 
Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha, and the museum 
force and assistants in the geological department became 
interested in the preparation of exhibits illustrating our 
natural resources. The quarries of the state, more particularly 
those of southeastern Nebraska, were visited, and important 
economic sets of building stones, clays, soils, etc., 
were added to the Morrill collections. </seg>

The members of the eighth expedition, 1899, were divided 
into five distinct parties, two of which were provided with 
trains and camp accoutrements, the other parties going by 
rail from place to place. A party of two followed the Dakota 
Cretaceous from Oklahoma to South Dakota. Another 
drove throvgll tlie quarry regions in southeastern Nebraska. 
A third party, spent the summer collecting Hryozoa in the 
Carboniferous. A fourth party sj&gt;ent BOOM weeks collecting 
invertebrate fossils in the Carboniferous exposures, while 
the director, with an assistant, visited tields in Wyoming, 
.Montana, Dakota, and Nebraska. Over two hundred bo 
of excellent material were thus added to the collections of 

the State Museum. See fig. 1. 

In 1960, work, though chiefly 
n-ea, was extended beyond tin 

¦onfined to the Carboniferous 
state into Colorado. Wyom- 

ing, Utah, Booth Dakota. Kansas, and Iowa, as shown in 
fig. 2, and a large amount of valuable material was obtained. 

I In 1901 the assistants found the extraordinary heat of that 
ummer hard to bear, and active work was soon suspended, 
lowever. the quarries along the Platte from South Bead 
astward were visited. Later in the season the writer made 
tour of tlie fossil tields and mining regkNM in Colorado, 
"tali, and New Mexico. The work of 1902 was confined to 
estricted areas in the Carboniferous. 

I The years l!)01 and H&gt;02 mark the decline of the Moitill

lie State Museum is located in a building particularly liable 
0 destruction by fire, and hence Mr. Morrill has decided to 
emporarily withhold his patronage. As it is. there is 
ittle incentive for private citizens to invest money in 
xpensive cases and valuable specimens for their state. 
'uch generous gifts as these, when withheld, are a loss to 
ny community, especially since but few citizens in a com

RF.ltJRT ON THE INITIAL WORK OF THE STATE GEOLOGICAL 

SURVEY OF NEBRASKA 

In a state such as Nebraska where there is no "mineral" — 
a term which in the West has come to mean gold and silver — ¦ 
it is difficult to convince the masses that there is the lead 
possible economic importance in a State Geological Sarrey. 

If "mineral" did occur, apathy could much more easily he 
ven ome, and the appeals for a survey would tind more wiling 
and receptive ears. I?ut something stronger than apathy 
&lt; encountered in the prejudice which has bcca engendered 
gainst a state survey by men who have sought to establish 
oca for the evident purpose of holding otnce; that is, of 
taking a political jolt of it. This prejudice seems justifiable; 
evertheless, it is none too easy to live down. 

A good many yean have passed since our admission to 
ateliood. yet Xeliraska. a commonwealth greater than all 
*e\v England, has never made an allowance of any kind 
•r a state survey, not even for its unavoidable expense! 
lat literally not so much as one cent has ever Ween voted 
or such work until now. Even moral supjioit has beea 
ithheld. save that the titles acting botanist, acting rlieinst, 
and acting have been conferred, these titles 
ing the sole emoluments of otnce. However, the prelimitry 
work of a survey, which has engaged the writers atten 
on for successive summer vacations since 1891, has recently 
¦ceived from the University of Nebraska i wtomt aging reeogition 
and an allowance, which, tnongh small, is substantial, 
or the biennium of 1899 and 1900, f 1,000 was allowed by 
ic Hoard of Regent* for the initial work of the University 
eotagkal Survey. The sum of $500 a year may seem ridieuously 
small, yet it made possible several lines of work, 
amp outfits were obtained for several field parties, one of </seg>

¦r Carboniferous counties of Nebraska. At each quarry, pit. 
ind exposure, photographs were taken, nieasureinents ami 
M-ciions niaile. notes recorded, and liberal samples taken 
from the soil and sulisoil down through every layer. 

One hundred and fifty localities were thus examined; the

K'in&lt;j seven feet hifjh by one foot wide. These are placed 
lermanently on exhibition to illustrate the rock and day 
•esiiinces of the slate. A second party, cooperating in the 
merest of the Moirill Expedition of that year, was provided 
vith team and camp outfit, and drove from Oklahoma 
hrougfa Kansas. Nebraska, and northwestern Iowa into 
louth Dakota, following the Dakota Cretaceous, (her one 
inudred boxes of material were collected, with (he result 
hat new forms were found, some valuable rock-bearing beds 
ocated, and one of the largest known collections of 
letaceous leaves made, numbering abort five thousand 
peiiinens. 

A third party spent the spring and summer collecting the 
nssil Bryoaoa in the Carboniferous exposures, with the 
esult that some thirty localities were visited and a large 
ollection made, representing over forty species, several 
teins new. 

A fourth party visited quarries in the Carboniferous and 
'eiinian. for the sole purpose of collecting fossils. &lt;&gt;\«t 
weittv thousand of the commoner species were procured, 
pine of them apparently new to the state, with three or four 
[iccies supposed to be undescrihed. The Acting State (ieoluist

work as far as he was able. Freezing and pressure 
¦sts of the mortar, cement, and building rocks collected

which was of such intensity and duration that active work 
in the field was finally suspended, fair progress was made. 
A request for funds, amounting to $1,2&lt;M&gt;, for publishing the 
first reports of the State ( ieolojjieal Survey was presented 
to the legislature, and was passed without comment or dissent. 
This may lie recorded as the first sum voted by the 
state for the examination and publication of its resources. 
and, though small, it helped fo make pomible the initial work 
of the State Survey. 

Such field work as could he accomplished in the season of 
L901 was confined to the eastern counties, where occur 
the greatest Dumber of quarries, clay pits, and exposures. 
Likewise the work of 1902, conducted chiefly by Dr. Condi*, 
was confined to the quarries of southeastern Nebraska, these 
being of (special economic importance. 

Evidently sufficient time lias elapsed in the history of the 
Nebraska Geological Survey for the accumulation of both 
material and facts; data and statistics have lieen obtained 
and experiments conducted, and a large number of manuscript 
reports prepared by the various workers of the geological 
start'. These are to lie compiled and published as rapidly 
as means will allow. Among the first of these to receive 
attention will be a report on the building stones of Nebraska, 
to be followed by a similar report on the clays. Other reports 
are to follow in regular order until our resources, ran^inj; 
from water to minerals, rocks, and soils, are made known in 
published form available for the use of present as well as 
prospective citizens. </seg>

PRACTICAL APPLICATION 

27 

THE STATE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND ITS 

PRACTICAL RELATION TO THE 

PEOPLE OF NEBRASKA 

Unfortunately hitherto Nebraska lias made no appropria 
ons for the geologic*] survey of its resources. It is often 
lid that no other state in Anieriea has so persistently 
pored the importance of ¦"¦Mug its resources known, in 
rder that they might lie developed. This results largely 
•oin the fact that eoal, the baser metals, and preeious orea 
o not occur in paying quantities. Bat why aeglecl other 
Unable resources? It is just as honorable to gel goU from 
good stone quarry as to get it from a gold mine. The 
lonev received from clay and clay products is far greater 
tan that from the combined gold and silver mines of the 
nited States. 

Why, then, should not the state pay some attention to its 
•xtensive beds of clay, stone, cement, ochre, etc.? In that 
vent it would come about that we need not liny so much 
irick of Illinois. Iowa. .Missouri, and Kansas, but instead 
ould patronize our own people. Nor would we need to ship 
tone from neighboring states, particularly Kansas, when 
&gt;recisely the same stone is lying unused in our own 
indevelopcd quarries. 

Neglect of our resources is a mistake which comes home to 
s the more forcibly when we see that our increase of popu 
ation, at the time of the last census, was small, while that of 
etgnhoring states makes a far better showing. This has a 
irect relation to our undeveloped resources, for developed 
(•sources always insure stability for a commonwealth. 

If the crops fail, men can find employment in the quarries, 
brick yards, tile kilns, lime kilns, paint works, cement works, 
etc., and need not be driven by adversity from our state to 
the quarries and mines of Kansas, Iowa, Colorado, South </seg>

Dakota, ami elsewhere for employment, adding to their population 
and subtracting from ours. Those unfamiliar with the 
duties of the geologist have little idea of the amount of work 
done or of its close relation to practical affair*. For instance, 
many real estate transfers pass through the office 
of the state geologists, for non-residents often refuse to pur 
chase property nntil the state geologist — whom they view a^ 
a fair and wholly disinterested person — has pronounced judgment 
upon it. and lias thus given assurance that the property 
in question is as represented. As many as six transfers 
have been made in the geologist's office in a single day. 

Finns in every city write to the geologist concerning places 
in which to locate a growing business, and also Inquiring 
where every imaginable kind of natural resource can be 
obtained. 

Sheep men and cattle men write from various stales to 
learn aliout the conditions in this county or that. In short, 
in a thousand ways the work of the geological survey is 
closely in touch with the practical and economic interests of 
the people. 

Six months after the first report of the geologist of Illinois 
was published, some eighteen to twenty thousand more persoii&lt; 
were employed than before, due wholly, it is said, to the 
rapid development of resources brought to light by this one 
report It had. of coarse, a most salutary effect upon the 
rapid settlement of that state. 

Assuredly it is a matter of fundamental importance to this 
state and can lie conducted at a relatively small expense 

For the past ten years the geologist lias conducted this 
service gratuitously, and without funds from the state with 
which to work. Nine summers in the field without pay, and 
the balance of the year devoted to the work of teaching, examining 
deposits for citizens, and answering a voluminous correspondence, 
mean hard, continuous work, rendered the 
more arduous by lack of funds. It is certain that when all 
the facts are properly presented to the legislature the 
Geological Survey of Nebraska will receive support. </seg>

PRACTICAL APPLICATION 

While we all recognize that practical men, such as miners, 
liiarrymen, clay workers, and, above all, farmers, are worthy 
&gt;f first consideration, inasmuch as they must blaze the way 
n the work of development, yet we must not ignore the W 
iiid demands of the merchants, lawyer*, doctors, and teachin 
of Nebraska. The most pressing demand for geological 
¦eports comes from the fanners and teachers of the staii'. 
vliicli only emphasizes the educational as well M the 
•radical value of all such work. 

Many letters from the farm and ranch received at the office 
f the geologist practically amount to appeals. Sous and 
aughters write that they are remote from the centers of eduatiou, 
from reading, rooms aud libraries, that for prudential 
easons they have been denied the lieuetils of higher educaion, 
hut that nevertheless they have not lost their ambition 
o learn, and beg for state reports, even courteously offeriag 
i pay for any such which would enable them to better underlain! 
the resources of their slate, and to account rationally 
or the phenomena around them. Teachers are constantly 
sking for geological reports in order to become better 
lformed concerning the geological conditions, and thus be 
Babied to satisfy the various inquiries of pupils and parents. 

When firms send representatives from eastern cities to the 
tate Museum to consult the geologist and to examine the 
.re of the Lincoln lest well before taking contracts for deep 
rilling, it shows the work of the state geologist is eminently 
radical. When members of an eastern firm visit the oAce 
f the geologist to learn the nature of the ground in which 
ley must dig, before making bids or taking contracts for 
•tting posts and putting up woven wire fences to protect 
&gt;eople and stock from danger from passing trains along a 
lilroad line, you say this is practical geological work, too. 
ut what. pray, omitting other example*, has been more 
¦niiinely practical to everyone of us than the simple educaon 
received in the public schools? The training received 
lere is put to practical account every hour of our li 
liether we are conscious of it or not. If published reports </seg>

aid the work of public instruction, it is just ;is practical ;is 
the other cases ahead; cited. Bad, if anything is of wider 
use. These facts. though few in nuiulier, are dwelt upon to 
assist in showing those who have little time for considering 
the Matter, and for weighing the evidence for themselves, 
that well-systematized geological reports are not simply 
ornamental, hut are strictly useful and highly practical. 

Since, throughout the world, soils constitute the hasis of 
agricultural wealth, and ores constitute the metallic liasis 
of our civilization, whichever way we turn we are invariably 
led hack to the earth as the ultimate source; hence that 
science which aids in the understanding of the earth is 
peculiarly and fundamentally practical. 

Daring the part two years several reports have been prepared 
by the department of geology touching the clay and 
quarry products, yet funds have not been available for the 
publication of such works, no matter of how much economic 
importance they may be. This should have attention, for it 
is Important that qaarrymea, builders, contractors, and citizens 
should have some way of learning about our rock and 
clay, what pressure they will stand, whether or not they 
weather well, whether they break down under heeling and 
thawing, whether there is iron pyrite present to disfigure 
buildings with rust, etc. All the quarries in the state either 
have been or will be visited, sections and drawings made, 
and Maples of rock. clay, sand, etc., taken, showing what can 
be found in each and every layer in every quarry and clay pit. 
The samples already secured are to be seen in the .Museum of 
the State University at the present time, where they can be 
examined by citizens living in or near Lincoln, but for others 
they are useless until properly described for the people. 

l'reezinir. thawing, and pressure tests have been made of 
our building stones, and the result', with all kinds of instructive 
and suggestive illustrations, are ready for publication. 
Pressure, freezing, thawing, and "rattler'' tests are 
being made of the bricks of the state, and these results, when 
published, can but be of value to the people who wish to 
build. </seg>

31 

PKACTICAIi APPLICATION 

tAll t li«- various ndereloped reaoareea of the state are 
in&lt;* studied, and a number of reporta are ready for the state 
intinj; board. 

Another useful end which is served by such publications 
is the great saving to men who squander targe sums in prospecting 
for oil, coal, jjold. silver, and other ores, where none 
exist. In UM over twenty tliousiind dollars were spent in 
the eastern half of Nebraska prospecting for coal and Batumi 
,U r as alone. One man spent 95,000 in this way durinjj 
that season. The sum total of the money and time spent in 
aimless prospecting in Nebraska can not fall much below 
fifty thousand dollars annually. A few simple reports would 
save all of this loss. 

.Men can be found in every county who devote more or less 
alualile time to the work of prospecting without having 
ven the most meager working knowledge of the subject in 
and. All such work is done at a heavy loss, and could be 
voided if they were jMissessed of the proper information. 
[en are daily prospecting for coal ill Nebraska in regions 
\ here numerous deep wells show positively that coal can not 
&gt;e found, yet they dig away cheerfully. It is just as much 
he doty of the state geologist to inform people how to avoid 
qoandering their money on useless prospecting as it is to 
nake valuable resources known. This can only be done by 
iiakin^ the people familiar with our resources through the 
iiedium of published reporta. 

Prospecting in Nebraska results in a very serious loss to 
lany over-zealous and over-confident people. Oil, coal, _ 
old, and silver excite their attention, and nothing can disnade 
them from devoting their time and property to the end 
f developing resources which they believe to be there. .Many 
farm has been sacrificed in ambitious attempts to find imlossible 
things in impossible places. It is often pitiable, 
specially in the ease of foreigners, who. on consulting a 
"eologist, command so little English that an interpreter is 
lecessary, and even then they fail to fully explain themselves 
or to understand explanations which are offered. </seg>

II 11 certain ]&gt;]a&lt;t-s large numbers of Russians, elsewhere

that the surface configurations resemlile those around the

have their minds made up it is all the harder to reason wit 
them in a strange tongue, and they will m &gt;t lie convinced 0

them why coal. oil. gas. or the precious ores are not to 1

lives, and the charge is preferred over and over again th; 
in giving such advice the members of the Survey are actin 
in the interest* of railroads or other corporations, and th 
as a stimulus to greater activity on the part of the pro 
pector. We have known parties to sink shafts as far as the 
could dig or drill, at expenses varying from a few hundre&lt; 
in live thousand dollars, and. after actual experiments showed 
them that nothing could lie found, they cheerfully dug a 
otid, third, and fourth time, all within an acre of ground, an 
at a total loss. All of this waste was directly owing to son 
practical miner who based his judgment, on such thing! 
slupe of ground, in blissful ignorance of evidence, and lac 
of proof from deep borings and wells in his yicinity. an 
who was totally uninformed of the geology of the place c

PRACTICAL APPLICATION 

Sometimes it is arraaged that tlie expenses shall be pto•tod; 
hence the burden of the cost falls not upon the indiidual, 
but upon a community of fanners. This arraagelent, 
thoaga wasteful and sadly misguided, is not so apt ti&gt; 
ead to financial embarrassment. When the individual ven 
ures to assume financial risks to the amount of several thoiiand 
dollars, it is too apt to mean a mortgage on his proprly, 
which often foreshadows bankruptcy. These rases mm 
0 frequently under the observation of a state geologist that 
le is si lonely inclined to s}&gt;eak feelingly on the subject. 
binding everything lost, or in danger of foreclosure, appeal 
or aid is made to the governor or to the state university. 
Jut no funds are provided for the pros.tution of private 
iiining ventures, especially in a state so peculiarly 
gricultural. 

A prospect hole, though costing several thousand dollars 
tad yielding nothing material in return, is not to be viewed 
is a total waste of good money, for it furnishes the geol. 
vith valuable information concerning the strata passed 
hroiigh. and warns the community of the inutility of neglectug 
regular avocations, and hazarding property and time in 
uining schemes in regions where it can be foretold, without 
he expenditure of a dollar, that the undertaking must end in 
lisappointinent and failure. 

Cases have been known in Nebraska where individuals 
uive spent as much as twenty thousand dollars each pro* 
K'cting for coal, chiefly in the Pierre shale, which is destitute 
•f coal. The shales of the Pierre and Deatoa are dark, to be 
Rare, but so are many other barren beds dark. A dark color 
s not proof nor even evidence of coal, and no one is justified 
n following his own fixed belief, basing his judgment on s.&gt; 
uperticial a thing as color or texture. No one can afford to 
ound a costly enterprise on mere hope. 

Numerous small companies are organized annually to drill 
and dig, and yet this long continued, strenuous, and costly 
effort, though yielding a little negative information, has produced 
nothing material as yet. Probably no two years have

witnessed tin- bunching of mk Mining schemes than those 
nf the past liiciiiiiiitn, companies baring been formed En most 
of the tow us of any size in the state. The Imlk of such enterprises 
is reported from the eastern and southern edges of the 
state, very few being found in central, northern, or north 
western Nebraska. Prnhnhjj the wise and liberal bounty 
offered l&gt;\ the stale for the discovery of a good workable bed 
of coal is responsible, in part, at least, for the coal fever. At 
any rate, samples of "coal" are often sulunitted at the omce 
of the State Geological Survey and the bounty claimed. It 
should he explained thai most of this is not coal ai all. l&gt;ut 
simply a dark carbonaceous shale which would serve for 
brick better than fuel. 

Though exact figures are never obtainable, yet the Geologist 
feels warranted in reporting more than one handled 
thousand dollars involved in the mining ventures of this state 
during the past two years. To add to the expense, a good 
many people have employed mining experts to travel from 
Chicago, Denver, and elsewhere to pass on "coal propositions" 
in Franklin and other counties where coal is least to 
be expected. If this were productive employment of capital, 
less would be said, but as it is we must regret this misuse of 
good money, and regret more than ever that more funds are 
not available for the furtherance of the geological survey, in 
order that it may do the double duty of checking needless 
expenditnre in prospecting, and of making known the state's 
resources foi- those who wish to aid in developing them. It 
• an not be gainsaid that enough money is spent each year in 
useless prospecting to make a superb survey of the state as ;i 
whole, and enough is wasted in ten years to make an exact 
survey by counties. 

The gold excitement has claimed many victims in Nebraska 
as well as in Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri during the 
past few years. As nearly as the writer can learn, this has 
been fostered by certain concerns outside of the state. Still. 
it has resulted in a great deal of disturbance of the peace and

United States proper, extending northward from the fortieth 
to the forty-third degree of north latitude, and westward 
from the ninety-fifth to the one hundred and fourth degree 
of longitude, west from Greenwich, measuring in miles L'o^ 
from north to south, and 4-10 from east to west, and including 
within its boundaries 77,000 square miles (49,000,000 
acres). This exceeds the area of all New England by 11,060 
square miles. 

It is bounded on the north bj South Dakota, on the south 
by Kansas and Colorado, on the east by Iowa, from which 
it is separated l&gt;.\ the .Missouri river, and on the west by 
Colorado and Wyoming. 

It may not lie out of place to mention just enough of the 
history of Nebraska to show that it was included within 
Louisiana, ceded to I he United States by France, April 30, 
L803; explored by Captains Lewis and Clark, isoi; organised 
as a territory with certain extensive Indian reservations 
in 1854, when settlement began; had a population of 
l»41 by I860; admitted to the Union as a state on March 
I. 1N&lt;",7. with a population of 60,000, and at the present 
writing has a population of over 1,000,300. 

Those who have traversed the state in all directions find 
its possibilities commensurate with its magnificent distances, 
although a wholly different impression was formed 
of this region in the outset. Then it was viewed as a desert, </seg>

ut the conditions which conspired to make it such have 
•mpletel y changed. Then it was a region trampled by herds 
f such size that ."iOO.OOO buffalo have beea counted in a 
ngle band. The result of such vast herds was over-grazing

during periods of drouth. Insects which are destroyed

ieir numbers or their ravages. The tribes were accustomed 
o burning the prairie grass, which added to the work of 
estruciion, and left the ground bare and exposed to the 
weeping wind, converting the region into one of creeping 
nd shifting sand dunes. 

Settlers can still remember when this was tree of Kansas 
nd Nebraska, and the very regions in these two states which 
ere. wandering sand dunes in their day are now so well set 
it li valuable grasses that a shifting sandhill is worthy of 
oniment even in the heart of the sandhill region. Times 
lave changed, and with them the western desert to such an 
xtent that where once the sandhills were worst, now the 
raxing lands are beat, and where the desert was now there 
re not only grazing lands, but farms and homes, villages 
nd towns.

The surface configurations of Nebraska and the general 
vlief of its surface are very unlike the popular conception 
[ a prairie as being level as the floor. Though very level in 
laces, it is surprisingly rolling and even broken elsewhere, 
r cut into canyons, ridges, and buttes. lnsieatl of the 
lonotony of scenery which the tourist pictures to himself

•autiful, it is true, but there is nothing much more promndly 
impressive than the vast stretch of the ocean and

report entitled "The climate of Nebraska, particularly in 
reference to the temperature and rainfall and their iatec 
upon the agricultural interests of the state."' Ex. Doc., Efa 
115, 51st Congress, 1st Session, 1899. 

It is said that Nebraska, lacking mountain ranges and 
arge forests, has the physical conditions which insure a 
lomogeileous climate. It is strictly an inland or continental 
imate, being 1,600 miles from either ocean. miles from 
le Gulf of Mexico, and 500 miles from the Great Lakes. 
In contradistinction to marine climate the term implies, 
or Nebraska, winters of considerable severity, summers of 
nusual warmth, rainfall in limited quantities, marked and 
udden changes of temperature, large seasonal and daily 
emperature ranges, and dry, salubrious atmosphere, with a 
nail percentage of cloudiness, and a large percentage of 
untune." 

t Nebraska is the geographic center of the United States 
uper, and, considering its remoteness from the sea, its 
mate has characteristics which are remarkably constant. 

1'uKcii'iTATioN. — The moisture precipitated as rainfall 
over Nebraska is derived directly or indirectly from the Gulf 
of Mexico. The variation in rainfall in different sections of 
the state exerts a strong control over the character of creeks 
and rivers, plant and animal life, and the activities of man 
in the respective regions. Nebraska is much more favored 
in the matter of precipitation than is generally known, the 
annual rainfall of the state being over twenty-three inches, 
distributed as shown in tig. 10. 

I Nebraska has an advantage over many states in that the 
infall is most plenteous at the critical months for agriculre. 
namely, April, May, June, and July. 

I This is one of several causes which enables Kansas and 
ebraska to raise phenomenal crops (against which other 
ates can not compete i on a limited precipitation, so limited 
i to produce drouth and complete crop failures in the 
stern states.

As a bytlrographic basin Nebraska presents mam feaures 
of interest, and some of siifiicient importance agrieulurally 
to warrant s|&gt;ecial study in special reports, Perhaps 
10 single question since the drouth of lS'.u has engaged the 
serious attention of citizens at large as much as that of 
rater. In a state, the most distinctly agricultural of any in 
he Union, where the soil is of extraordinary depth and &lt;&gt;f 
he most undoubted fertility, and where the rainfall is a 
rifle scant, the water problem becomes foremost in agriculnre. 
Anything helping to solve this water problem in ten 
ral and western Nebraska determines its agriculture. 
Nothing else is kicking. This seems to be the concensus of 
•pinion of our practical farmers and business men. 

Such lieing the facts, no better work is before (lie geoij;ist 
than the study and full understanding of all the eondiions 
of our broad hydrographic basin. Accordingly, the 
'niversity of Nebraska is measuring and gaging all streams 
nd lakes, and determining the amount of rainfall, the run 
ff and evaporation over the state, the underground wat 
nd the possibility of utilising them for purposes of irriatioii. 
The amount of rainfall raaghi and retained in our

I At present we must confine oor attention to certain main 
ii m-es of our streams and rivers, whose history antedates 
it of the mountains through which they cut. BoBM may 
called fossil rivers; that is, the channels through which 
•y formerly flowed, with their sand liars, gravel, pebbles, 
d boulders, have beta turned into stone. By means of 
• fossilized channels the North Platte and its tributaries 
iv be traced for miles in western Nebraska. The coarsest 
of the material is indicative of the size and the position 
the river gravels, while the buttes show the former level 
the streams, which was much higher than at present. In 
like manner the terraces of the North Platte tell of its 
liner size. The up]K'i* terrace tells of a deep, broad stream, 
werful enough to carry coarse pebbles and boulders. Step 
Dg down to succeeding terraces, the material jjrows liner 
id the channel narrower, until we come to the river as it 
ists to-day. This is a hint at the ancient history of our 
icrs which will make an interest injj chapter some day. 

Iof our present rivers the Platte and Missouri have their 
urces in the Bockj mountains, while all the others rise in 
i- great plains. .Most of our streams are perennial ami 
rnish water the year around; but a few dry up in whole 
in part daring seasons of drouth. As a third class may 
named those which have no outlet, but which How a cerin 
distance and then disappear by sinking and evaporation. 

Elevations at different points determine in part the velocity 
of streams and hence their power to reduce and transport 
rock. On steep slopes streams cut deep valleys and carry 
away all loosened particles. Where the slope is slight they 
deposit sediment.

(Jeographk-alljr this is our must important river. Its character 
varies in the different regions through which it low*. 
In Wyoming the North IMatte has cut through mountain 
ranges, producing magnificent canyons between whose narrow 
walls it flows u a torrential si ream capable of trans 
porting great loads of rock waste. In the Ugh table lands

miles wide and seven hundred or more Feet deep. The valley 
floor, representing sediment deposited in a former greater 
valley, is bordered by numerous large canyons and many 
forms of liuttes. Bordering terraces tell of the river's former 
greater size when it flowed as a much wider stream and at 
a higher level. Iii the tipper terrace are found coarse pehhie 
and cobMe stones which were carried bj a deep and

Some thirty-live niih* farther west ocean another lake 
region near the western boundary of Cherry county at the 
head of the North Loop river. There are tliirty or forty 
lakes worthy of Mention in this group. 

Southern Sheridan county has live or six townships well 
dotted over with lakelets, only a few of them being large. 
At many points in Fillmore, Adams, York, and other eomi 
ties on the level loess plains occur the weather ponds and 
swamps. Few of them contain enough water to lie called 
lakes. They are a hindrance to farming and result from 
imperfect drainage. 

South of the l'latte in Kearney and 1'helps counties there 
are numerous lakes, and along the river courses, particularly 
along the .Missouri, occur many cut -off lakes, resulting 
from the excessive meandering of the river. An attempt is 
made to represent some of these lakes and cut-oH's in the accompanying 
maps, but the hulk of them are too small to 
show on this scale. Some of the lagoou lakes have been the 
occasion of interesting litigation. For instance, the boundary 
between Iowa and Nebraska is the axis of the .Missouri 
river. However, since the stream shifts so rapidly that it 
swings out of its course a mile or two in a season, it is plain 
I hat portion* of Nebraska are going to be left mi Iowa, and 
portions of Iowa included in Nebraska. At Florence lake 
and Cat-Off lake, just north of Omaha, a portion of Iowa 
was left in Nebraska when the .Missouri cut a channel across 
the neck of a great meander, and it has been the decision of 
the supreme court that this land shall still continue as a 
part and property of the state of Iowa, subject to its laws; 
though, in fact, as the river now stands, it is distinctly in 
Nebraska. In a similar manner a township of laud belonging 
to Nebraska is entirely east of the Missouri river. It 
happens that government boats in improving the Missouri 
were compelled to travel miles around a great curve or oxbow 
in "riprapping" the banks to protect the railroad from 
washing away. They found it possible to shorten the journev 
bv cutting a channel across the narrow neck of the bow. </seg>

Ehis channel the river accepted at once as a shorter niul bet¦r

og Thief island, stranded in Iowa. 

t These lagoon lakes are usually quickly reclaimed to dilution, 
being particularly rich, tiled as the; are with alluum 
from the neighboring hillsides, and with wind-bone 
nd and aquatic plants. 

The lakes of the sandhills are important economically in 
hat they afford a remote ami safe breeding ground for large 
lumbers of water birds, and are stocked with bass and other 
ood fish, and supply water for the herds of the region — 
attle raising being almost the exclusive industry of Cherry 
and adjacent counties. The sandhills are on a gencroM plan 
iere, rising ridge above ridge like mountains, so that they 
catch and hold the rainfall and dole it out to the lakes, 
prings, and streams of the region. 

The season of 1891 was one of exceptional rainfall, ami 
hese lakes were at their best. During the protracted drouth 
rom 1882 to 181)5, they were reported as being seriously 
ffected. Since that time they have reached their normal 
ondition, even passing it during the phenomenally wet year 
f 1902, for the rainfall of that year exceeded all records, 
H?ing over forty inches. 

Innumerable artificial lakes and ponds are being contructed 
yearly, and in this method of storing water lies 
K)ssibilities of economic importance. Few states can lend 
hemselves more readily to the impounding of water for 
lock and irrigation than our own. especially in the butte 
region, where it is possible by simple and inexpensive dams 
o set back and impound large volumes of water. In some 
egions it is the practice to protect the cattle and sheep indusry 
by damming draws and streams at certain intervals to 
nsure a constant and ample water supply for the great 
icrds. 

kThe cattle, sheep, and irrigation industries may greatly 
neAt by the multiplication of artificial lakes, ponds, and 
ols. But there are other industries to be considered as </seg>

well. The ice harvest is an important industry, ami in many 
places is dependent on the artificial pond. Perhaps the 
known and largest artificial pond or lake is that on the 
estate of ]&gt;i\ George L. Miller at I (eertield, ¦ snlinrlt of 
Omaha. This lake covers from thirty to forty acres, is well 
stocked with desirable food tish, aiid famishes ice for one of 
the largest packing houses of Omaha. It is f(&gt;d hv a small 
stream and springs, bat niaiuly by a ten inch artesian well. 

In the valley of the Miiiichadu/a creek just, north of Valentine 
is one of the most beautiful artificial lakes in the 
state. It furnishes power, water. fishing, skatinjr. and lioat 
in*:. The water is clear, deep, and of spring origin. The 
steep valley slopes are well covered with pines and deciduous 
trees. 

Sail lake or Burlington beach, just west of Lincoln,

This in a certain sense is a natural salt lake. Imt in another 
sense is artificial, inasmuch as its extent has been ureatlx 
increased by a dam. See Kg. 33.

Springs are so seldom observed along the ordinary routes 
of travel that one is inclined to imagine none exist. To the 
contrary, there are many springs in the state, some of them 
of considerable importance. Furthermore, they are pal t" 
a great variety of economic uses. The weaker springs are 
turned to account in filling the water trough and milk house, 
while some, by the aid of the hydraulic ram, deliver water to 
the house and stockyard. Some of our springs are so strong 
that they are s^iken of as artesian springs, and if their 
waters are confined in a tnbe, they will rise two or three 
feet, showing they come to the surface under a -rood head. 

In certain regions, noticeably the sandhills, there are so 
many springs that streams start from them, and are fid by 
them along their courses until they become good streams of

WELLS OF NEBRASKA 

Closely akin to the springs of the state are the wells, which 
iv be considered as artificial springs. 

Wells are of the utmost consequence to a commonwealth, 
nd while space will not admit of a discussion of the subject 
t this time, nevertheless certain features should be briefly 
lentiiuied. The depth to water, tlie constancy of the sup&gt;ly, 
and the quantity and quality obtainable concern every 
itizen. It is said that that country is assuredly healthful 
vhich boasts of pure air and pure water; either of these, if 
onUiminated, is apt to prove detrimental to health. 

Fortunately, the well water of our state, though hard as </seg>

NEBRASKA CKDUKMCAI, SURVEY 

a rule, is pure and free from contamination, and found at 
little more than ordinary depth. 

Il may he stated at the outset that as a state we are proided 
with the best of water by ordinary wells of average 
eptli. Some of these toward the northern central part 
ield soft water, those of southeastern, southern, and western 
Nebraska yield hard water, similar to that found in the limetone 
regions of other states. Some wells yield iron, sulphur, 
nd mineral water, and a few are astringent from the presnoe 
of free sulphuric acid in the water. 

ilii certain portions of the Cretaceous shale regions, wells, 
f they yield water at all, yield a very alkaline sort, unfit 
or the use of animals, plants, or even for boiler purposes 
Such regions are exceptional and of restricted area. 

In the southeastern, or Carboniferous counties, wells and 
• itain springs are distinctly saline, often too salt for use. 
t is frequently a question how to avoid striking saline water 
u digging wells, and farmers often report that great cue 
mist be exercised not to dig too deep, or, after using a while, 
he water will become salt. The same trouble is sometimes 
xperienced in digging for town supply, as at the F street 
nd South street wells in Lincoln, where they had good water 
t the start. In order to increase the supply they dug deeper, 
ind in spite of their best contrivances the city could not 
hut out the salt water, and the pumping stations wen 
baadoned. 

In several counties salt water is almost a certainty at a 
niudred to one hundred and fifty feet, and thence downward 
the water continues salt. In a few places in the southeast- 
W* enmities where the Carboniferous rock comes close to 
he surface, wells yielding enough water for ordinary mm 
ire hard to find. However, all of these are to be viewed as 
M ¦cptions. and any prospective citizen can depend on findng 
water throughout the state. 

In the butte regiou, where the table lands are from one 
hundred to six hundred feet above the general level, w&lt;ll&gt; 
arc often deep, varying from one hundred to three or four 
hundred feet, the water obtained being the verv best. </seg>

ARTKSIAX WKI.I.S 

Ground water is almost universal and is the source of the 
supply of eoinnion wells. In addition to this there is the ex 
traordinarv subterranean water which supplies artesian 
wells. In the common house well the water seeps in and

stands quietly at a certain level. Iu the artesian well it 
comes in under pressure. This is the only essential difference 
between the two. The artesian wells in Artois, France, 
from which the name "artesian" is derived, were the fust 
dug and observed. These were spouting wells from deep 
sources; hence the term artesian presupposes in the public 
mind a spouting well from deep-seated sources. </seg>

This early conception, however, is not the true me Many 
urtesian wells arc shallow, not over sixty to eighty feet in 
It'lM li. lint yet in true artesian wells. .Many throw line 
streams from a iVw inches to several feet high, and are uuliiestionably 
artesian wells; but a short distance away at a 
iigher level the same water will rise in ihe well under the

s not sufficient to force it above the surface. The one is an

i'o be foond, which are already put to many ttoaoinic uses, 
nd farms which are models of their kind draw their water for 
rrigation from tliis source with no cost. These are positive 
r iowiag artesian wells. On farms ¦ few feet hijjluT precisely 
the same water is struck. It rises to the surface, hnf 
U not How over it. 

It is universal experience that rocks, some soft and porous, 
MM dense, are found in the state arranged in horizontal 
icds. Tile denser layer will constitute the impervious jacket 
round the more porous layers. The layers which are deeply 
mried here, and hut inappreciably tipped, may come to the 
urface elsewhere and form a catchment basin, perhaps at a 
Miint far distant, as is the case presumably with the deeper 
veils found along the northern and northeastern boundary 
&gt;f the state. 

The artesian wells, as far as reported, fall into four rather 
latural groups, as follows: The deep wells of the Carbonferous, 
such as those al Beatrice, Lincoln, and Omaha, vary 
n&lt;r from ."&gt;.~&gt;tj to 2.4t»:&gt; feet ; the artesian wells of the northastern 
counties in the Dakota sandstone, 300 to 606 feet 
leep, being a continuation into Nebraska of the South Dacota 
artesian basin; the shallow wells in glacial sands and 
lays, such as those at Cook and elsewhere; and other shalow 
wells not in the drift, such as those in Holt and Rock 
ounties. 

There are local artesian basins in the state which are more 
•asily understood than the deep wells. There are small basns 
of ten to fifteen square miles each in the valleys of 
treams, depressed noticeably below the general level of the 
surround ing hills. Within this circumscribed area, wber¦ver 
the impervious roofing or encasement of clay is pierced — 
he depth varying from forty to one hundred or more feet — 
here comes a strong and constant How. Such wells arc too 
hallow to draw their water supply from a distance. 

I It is at once apparent that the artesian supply for these 
ical basins is drawn from beds of alternating gravel, sand, 
nd clav, and that it is rather limited and local, though nine </seg>

BIX) WING WELLS 

Oiii- rather phenomenal class of wells found throughout 
i large portion of the state, especially son t It of the Platte 

liver, deserves particular notice, and is worthj of the criti__pni^Ipiid 
lon^-continued studv which ii is lioi&gt;ed it in;iv vet 
receive. These wells are known by rarious namen, "lilowinjj;,'' 
"roaring," "breathinp," '"singing, v or "weather" \\t IN. 
according to the widely separated communities in which 
they occur. It noes without saying thai these wells ;n-e held 
in doubt elsewhere, but the f;ict of their existence is established 
beyond all qnestioa. In some communities, noticeably 
those of Jefferson county, all such wells are readily 
distinguished at a distance because of the mound of earth 
heaped up around the curbing and pump to check the wind. 
Frequently they are banked up with snow instead, and this 
soon becomes melted and riddled bv numerous blowholes.

it concerning roaring wells. There can he ao possibU 
ulii about the freeting of these pipes and bo1 little doubt 
i&lt;&lt; the canse. 

Reports have come in from about twenty counties, dis 
tributed pretty evenly over the siiitc. chiefly south of the 
Platte. The information is derived from land owners, farm 
well diggers, ministers, principals of schools, civil engi 
iK i rs, ti iid students whose fathers own sueli wells, the only 
difference in the reports being th;it which arises from dif 
ference of observation. These accounts agree with persoaal 
ivations. There are periods when these wells Mow out 
for consecutive days and an equal period when they are re 
led. This is tested with the flames Of candles and by 
dropping paper, chair, feathers, etc.. into the rasing, to 
it Mown out or drawn in with some force. It is further 
stated that blowing often indicates high or low conditions 
of barometer, and that some wells blow niosi audibly when 
the wind is from the northwest, whereupon water rises to a 
higher level in the well than before; but when the conditions 
.ire reversed the air is drawn in, and in most reported wells 
i lie water is lowered. .Many observers notice a reverse of tin 
current according as it is morning or evening, and according 
as the temperature is high or low. During the progress of a 
low -barometer area over one of these regions the wind is 
expelled from blowing wells sometimes violently, and with a 
noise distinctly audible for several rods. Coaseqnent to tin 
approach of a high-barometer area the blowing becomes rap 
idly less until the current is reversed, when the high-barom 
eter area is central over the region.

leased vapor. Shortly after the current is reversed the 
hawed circle freezes again. Water vapor, coming from the 
-iratuin of invariable temperature, in winter is warmer when 
¦\[M'lled than is tlie outside air. This may explain the fad 
hat the pipes, if not too badly frozen, are often thawed uui 
vlien the well Mows. It is said thai commonly inhalation 
which carries the surface temperature to the bottom of the 
\ell, thus freezing the pipes), precede* the phenomenon of 
exhalation i which carries vapor at the average temperature 
if about 56°, and sometimes thaws the frozen pipes). 

Experience has tanght the people that the blowing of their 
veils is premonitory of an approaching storm; hence the 
wine "weather" wells. This is an entirely reasonable and 
orrect observation, for the falling barometer sanities a 
rhange of weather. The blowing means a tow-barometer 
uea, the sucking a high-barometer area. It is interesting 
n this connection to notice that the periods of most prolounced 
or unusual exhalation or inhalation are coincident 
¦espectively with periods of exceptionally low and exeepionally 
hi&lt;jh barometer areas. 

Professors Loveland and Swezey, of the Signal Service 
Itatioo of the University of Nebraska, have made observaions 
on such u well in Perkins county, the owners recording 
he hour when the blowing or sucking begaa. These, when 
ompared with the record! of the barometer, were exactly 
oincident. The citizens have elaborated many explanations. 
ome of them as interesting as ingenious. Some reason that 
he blowing is plainly due to the liberation of natural gas; 
hat natural jjas is from petroleum; that petroleum is the 
latural distillation from "rent coal fields, and staking their 
ortune on this original reasoning they have spent no small 
am, besides valuable time, in prospecting for coal. A few, 
toticing a change of current every twelve boon — that. is. 
oomittg and evening — think the blowing wells are due to 
idal action of the sheet water, considering the sheet water 
s a &lt;;reat subterranean lake. They should recall that the 
(feet of tides on the (Jreat Lakes themselves is scarcely 
ppreciable; what. then, could it be in the sheet water? </seg>

tThc phenomenon is most generally attributed to atmos 
icrir preww, which is probably the true bat not neees 
rilv the sole rattae. 

It is plain that tho air abore and the air inclosed in the 
ock and gravel below arc alike subject to the fluctuation of 
he barometer. If the surface air is rendered less dense by 
low barometer, the air below will pass out by any opening, 
atural or artificial, until equilibrium between the rarer and 
lie denser air is established, when they remain stationary, 
'he reverse etlect follows a hi&lt;jh barometer area. The an 
lior can not believe that this would account for the force 
isplayed in the expulsion of air. Instead, the energy dfc&gt; 
laved seems due to the air forced out by the rising of the 
ater below. Any force, barometric or otherwise, which 
ould raise the water level in this layer would displace a 
ertain amount of air. (in the other hand, a lowering of the 
ater table would admit a certain amount of air. but freeon 
ofegremand ingress is retarded by roofing layers which 
re perforated here and there by an occasional well, and 
"in such opening!) the air is expelled or drawn in. Confine 
Ms over a wide area, and it is apparent that a slight rise in 
ater level would expel air from a well for several consecii 
ve hours or even days. There is probably such close hydrotatic 
connection in the sheet water of the state that it is 
verywhere senshive to differences of atmospheric pressure, 
nd the difference is made sensible in certain localities by 
lowing ur racking wells. Awaiting the time when eontined 
study shall have made exaol explanation of this pheonienoii 
possible, it is safe to attribute it to atmospheric 
ressure: but this is not the sole cause. The immediate et 
¦ct is not so much the result of any one cause as of several,

IMPORTANCE (IK WATEE RESOURCES 

Iii Nebraska, as in other portions of the Great Plains 
region, the principal source of wealth lies in the soil. 

Except the soil and its products, the natural resources of 
Nebraska are few, and water, owing to its comparative 
rarcity and its importance in agricultural economy, i

of showers or flood, simply because of hydrostatic 
onnection with some other region which is flooded.

ainfall of luit 23.3 to '2~&gt; inclies, produce crops and withtand

egions poanessing lonble the annual precipitation. At first 
i seemed incredible that snch magnificent yields could come 
rom so insignificant a rainfall. Nevertheless, the fact 
lands. There are two apparent reasons for this. The rainall 
in many eastern regions amounts to :{."» or 40 inches, bat 
me half is lost by running oil' and carrying with it valuable 
oil fertility, the other half Making into the ground, while 
n Nebraska tin- water lost as run-off is only about one-tenth. 
lence, a far greater proportion of storm water is stored here 
or future use. This is largely due to the sandy nature of 
he soil. Bven some of the so-called clay soils, though lookup 
and acting like clay, are in fact exceedingly tine sand. 

Prom the mechanical analyses of soils and subsoils made 
hus far it is shown that Nebraska soils are pecoliarly rich 
n sands and poor in clays. The amount of sand — including 
n this term coarse, medium, and fine sand and silt — runs 
s high as !)7 to M per cent. The lowest, percentage thus 
iii' is about &lt;i(&gt; per cent, while the average is probably about 
s jK-r cent, baaed on the analyses made by Prof. Milton 
Vhitney. of the Department of Agriculture. In a. word, 
here is a preponderance of sand in Nebraska soils, which 
euders them at once light and capable of readily imbibing 
larger proportion of rainfall than is possible in eastern 
tates. This is a very significant fact. 

The more one cultivates the virgin prairie, which when 
lard packed sheds water like a roof, the greater will he the 
iniount of storm water caught and stored in the soil and the 
ess the run-off and evaporation. Increased cultivation tends 
award the conservation of soil moisture, and this in turn 
•eacts, making it possible to catch more moisture, since soil

ment must not be confounded with the popular but erroneous 
l&gt;elief that the animal precipitation is inr »— iiifl 

When the spring rains cease and a season of settled 
veather or possibly drouth sets in. and tlie surface soil dries, 
i force of great interest and of profoundest importance begins 
to act. This force is capillarity, by virtue of which 
rater is drawn up through the minute, hair-like passageways 
• f tlie soil and subsoil, rising automatically as much as six 
&gt;r seven feet. This, then, is a second way by which water is 
eld in the soil, and its far-reaching importance is instantly 
pparont when one consider! that the very passageways up 
vhich this water is drawn are those down which rootlets 
row. Soil moisture laden with soluble plant food is thus 
arried np to the rootlets or feeders of growing vegetation, 
'rops and grasses are nourished by capillary water and 
aved by it. uninjured in time of drouth, even daring seasons 
f long-protracted drynew (if not accompanied by hot 
rinds), such as could not but blight crops and grasses elsevhere. 
However, it is not to be forgotten that this force 
vorks equally well both ways, thereby carrying moisture up 
r down, according as the surface soil or the deep subsoil is 
he drier. This only emphasises the importance of utilising 
11 available rainfall in saturating the deeper soil as com 
letely as possible, in order that the full energy of capillary 
ttraction may be expended in drawing soil moisture to the 
ootlets. 

Thus far two means have been considered by which water 
s held by tlie soil — first, as ground water, sinking by gravty. 
and, second, as capillary water. There is another means 
&gt;&lt; subtle and concealed as to merit little more than passing 
otice — hygroscopic water, which is inherent in many niinrals, 
rocks, soils, and substances, and may be obtained by 
ong-continued roasting. 

SIIKKT WATKU 

There is in common parlance a rather indefinite and puzzling 
use of the terms, first, second, and third water, and </seg>

beet water. Ky first water is meant the first surface water 
hat seeps into the well, a supply often weak and readily 
xhausted. By second or sheet water, as it is coiniuouh 
ailed, is understood the deeper ground water, which is uiiiniited 
in aiiiount, since it is contained in porous material 
hat delivers water rapidly. Third water, as the term is 
xipularly used, is doubtless the same second water struck 
t a lower level, after passing through a local layer of line 
naterial of slow delivery. 

Sheet water is a greatly abused term, about which has 
lathered false impressions not easily dispelled. It carries 
vith it wherever used the idea of subterranean water flowng 
at an exaggerated rate under ground. It is perfectly 
rue that ground water flows and that it has certain thanids, 
naturally decided by the coarseness or fineness of the 
naterial, but one hears repeatedly of well diggers striking 
iibterranean currents of sheet water flowing at the appar 
•ntly incredible rate of four or five miles an hour, a faster 
ale than that of the [Matte itself. This fallacious statement 
s made repeatedly in all sincerity and good faith. A \er\ 
lopular conception of this torrential sheet water is that it is 
he angry and pent-up floods of subterranean caves, which 
ire seeking outlets to the sea. This erroneous conception is 
•ntirely fallacious and misleading. 

There is no such current in the sheet water, and there are 
o such extensive caves and underground lakes, and can m»t 
»e in the sandy soil of Nebraska. Caves are formed in limetones, 
not in sands, for naturally the sand would cave in 
nd fill any great underground passageways as fast as 
orincd. This misconception comes about naturally enough 
u some cases, and is cherished with a faith not to be shaken. 
The well digger, who. while bailing or pumping out water 
in one side of the well, sees it flowing in from the other. 
•an tell without hesitation in which direction the water 
flows, for he "has seen it himself;" but let him set his pump 
m the opposite side of the well and the current will set in 
roin the other direction. </seg>

Of course there is a current whose rate is regulated by 
he coarseness or the fineness of the material through which 
t flows, but this same current is inconceivably slow. OOUM 
uaterial with rapid delivery of water may have a current as 
xlow as a fraction of a foot a day, or as rapid as several foH

o little or nothing. A better understanding of the power 
&gt;f delivery of various materials would correct many of then 
errors. 

If an old pail or keg, having holes in the bottom, is filled 
vith clean, coarse pebbles, and a stream of water poured in. 
he rate of delivery is practically as rapid as the rate ai 
vhich the water is poured. Its rate is so rapid that the 
vater flows down through the gravel in a column, scarcely 
etting the other pebbles. With sand, however, the water 
pleads out or is diffused through much or all of the

This set of experiments tends to show the rate at which

inderground currents is in any way comparable with that of 
urface streams. 

CONSERVATION OF SOIL MOISTURE 

The importance of the conservation of moisture has not

During the last five years various means for catching and 
oldinjr surface water have increased enormously, and now 
Mention is directed to the results consequent upon the bets' 
conservation of soil moisture, all of which will aid iu the 
eclamation of important tracts of remarkably productive

birds of those who answered had noticed an unexpected rise

that this is real, and is a matter of annual occurrence. 

One explanation is that the decreased evaporation and the 
increased cohesion of water in winter allows more ground 
water to accumulate. The majority reported the rise as 
tcrarring in February. Stockmen in the most arid portions 
of Nebraska depend implicitly upon this rise of water, which 
they assert is of annual occurrence and independent of precipitation. 
This matter seems as worthy of critical study

Throughout southeastern Nebraska salt wells are so mi 
nitrous that it is often uncertain how to avoid them. In 
|kx)1s, surface wells, and deep wells a strong brine is ofteu 
met. The most conspicuous salt marsh is that of the extensive 
flat on Salt creek, near West Lincoln, which has beea 
retained by the state as public land. 

Here at one time a considerable industry sprang up, and, 
M the early founders of the state had hoped, salt was i»n&gt;dueed 
and shipped to neighboring states. Here the early 
freighters to the mountains bought their supply. With the 
discovery of the salt, beds of Kansas, however, this industry 
rould no longer survive. This basin, which is a mile or two 
across, is apparently depressed below the surrounding level, 
and one side has been cut. away by a small stream. Though 
standing for a number of years as waste public land, it 
has recently been leased from the slate by an enterprising 
company who, by damming up one side of the salt basin 
and setting the water back about one and a half miles. 
made a salt lake. Groves were planted around it; parilioM, 
bath houses, and restaurants were built; a small steamer 
and numerous sail and row boats added, and the whole 
given the rather pretentious name of Hurlington Beach. Bee 
tig. 2;&gt;. Few several years this furnished inland people with 
an attractive pleasure and health resort. Any decline in 
this undertaking is to be viewed with regret by people living 
so remote from all aquatic scenes and sports. Numerous 
salt springs rise from its bottom and along its sides, thus 
supplying it with salt water. In addition, the abandoned 
test well (bored to a depth of 2,163 feet | is feeding into it a 
G-inch stream of salt water. 

In ordinary wells it is often found that fresh water 
can be drawn from the top and salt water from the 
bottom. The fresh water floats because of its lower density 
as compared with salt water. Considerable care is exercised 
in such cases in lowering the well bucket, so that the water 
may be agitated as little as possible in order to prevent the

salt and the fresh water front becoming mixed. In one well 
the pump is so arranged as apparently to yield salt water or 
fresh water from the same pipe by placing one pipe inside 
of the other. 

Wells in southeastern Nebraska in the region of the Car 
boniferooa below a depth of l."&gt;&lt;&gt; feet are liable to be of to 
become saline. Below this to a depth &lt;&gt;f ."&gt;iki to l.ooo feet or 
more salt water is to be more or less expected. The salinity 
is greatest at l'.'mi to 980 feet. It is strong at 500 feet, and 
the water is distinctly salt at 1,080 feet. When the well at 
Beatrice, 1,260 feet deep, was bored for the city supply the 
quantity but not the quality of water was expressly stipulated 
in the contract. When-all the requirements were met 
the city refused to honor the bill because the water was salt. 
Losing the suit which followed, the contractor proceeded to 
make the best of a bad job by palling up the pipe of this 
artesian well for use elsewhere. This would undoubtedly 
have saturated the drift of the region, and so have rendered 
worthless all the wells in and around Beatrice, but this was 
promptly averted by purchasing the pipe from the contractor. 
This saline well was si ill flowing when last visited. 

The IJiverview Park artesian well in Omaha, l,0ti&lt;i feet 
deep, passed almost through the saline layer, but still is 
noticeably brackish. See ti^. 32. 

So far as can be learned, the first recognition of the 
hygienic possibilities of the saline water and its first utilization 
was by a former hotel proprietor in Lincoln, who is 
reported to have earned a considerable fortune, due largely 
to the salt baths which his hotel furnished. These salt baths 
were deservedly popular and enjoyed a local reputation, espe 
cially aawg those afflicted by rheumatism. At the present 
time their place is taken by the sanitarium of Doctors M. EL 
and J. (&gt;. Everett, called the Sulpho-saline Bath*. This is 
an expensive and important institution, fitted with a great 
plunge and swimming tank 50 by loO feet, and 3 to 10 feet 
deep, with baths and appliances of every description representing 
an investment of f 100,000. Two artesian salt wells. </seg>

GENERAL KKATl'ULS 

The genera] reader is well aware that the geological fea 
ures of Nebraska arc obscured and often wholly concealed 
rom puldic view In a deep mantle of soil. The student must 
fteu travel miles to tind an exposure of rock, for it is only 
icre and there that streams have worn away the mantle and 
iid bare the bed ruek. A difficulty arises here in the matter 
f popular description, for the average citizen very naturally 
icws this great mantle of soil as something simply to he 
'lowed and harrowed, and as having little relation to »eolgy. 
He views geology as beginning at bed rock. In other 
vords, if the slate were divested of all soil and soft surface 
laterial down to lied rock, if would represent a true geologial 
mail, according to popular conception. But why dig 
own to bed rock in making a map, when the surface mateial 
is a geological formation as much as though it were 
uird as rock instead of soft as sand? 

The oldest formations are ill the very eastern corner of 
he state, mill younger and still younger formations appear 
is one travels westward, though generally concealed under 
i deep mantle of soil. The rocks of Nebraska are all uutlisurlied 
sedimentary rock, such as common sandstone, lime 
tone, and clay or shale, and there are no native crystalline 
¦ocks. such as granite, marble, etc. 

There are no rocks in the stale older than those of the coal 
leasure or upper Carboniferous, found in southeastern Neiraska. 
These rocks saij or dip to the west, and. by the time 
iincoln is reached, have passed out of view, and are buried 
bout three thousand feet in central Nebraska, and do not 
ppear again until upturned along the Rocky mountains. </seg>

The trough thus formed is tilled with layers of Cretaceoa* 
rock, which have a total thickness of three thousiind to four 
thousand feet in central and western Nebraska, and reach 
the astonishing thickness of eight thousand to ten thousand 
feet in the Denver basin. 

tThe Carboniferous and Cretaceous constitute our oldesi 
ck. and upon them lie the newer rocks, conforming in 
metal to the eastward slope of the state. 

Those familiar with the succession of beds will observe 
hat the Jurassic and the Triassic, representing a great lapse 
f time, are missing altogether, but are magnificently repre 
sented further west in Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana, 
'he reason is that our neighboring states during that ex 
ended period were deeply submerged, and hence received 
eposits of all sorts, but Nebraska bad emerged from water, 
nd stood higb and dry as a laud surface, so, instead of 
receiving deposits, it was being carved and carried away. 

There is only space enough at ibis juncture to allude siui 
&gt;ly to the geological ups and downs of the state, its salt 
vater. fresh water, and land conditions. The eastern fifth 
of the stale is covered by a tine mantle of glacial drift, over 
ain by a blanket of loess, sometimes exceeding one hundred 
eet in thickness. The glacial drift thins out rapidly and is 
lard to trace west of Seward. where it presents a ragged, 
bscure morainal front, but the loess continues diagonally 
cross the state to the south west. To the west, more par 
iculurly in the northwest, occurs the Bad Land clay (Oligo 
ene). The Hutte sandstone (MtDCPne) and the .Magnesia 
Pliocene I are widely distributed. Tlu^most. recent deposits 
n the state, excepting of course the alluvial banks and bars

will he described in detail in succeeding reports. At present 
we must consider the Carl&gt;oniferous simply us a bed of rock, 
outcropping along certain stream bed* in the above counties, 
then disappearing from view. The name Carboniferous car 
ries with it the idea of coal, and it is true that our Carbon 
iferous bears a thin seam of coal, but it thins out rapidly 
and disappear! altogether. At best it is scarcely more than 
eighteen inches thick ami can not be worked with profit. 

It seems a sad loss of time and money, but nothing can 
prevent men from "prospecting for this formation" in central 
Nebraska, oblivious of the fact that it is probably more 
than two thousand feet below the surface near Kearney, 
and from three thousand to four thousand feet below 
ground at North IMatte, and can not lie found again 
until the Hanks of the Bock; mountains are reached, where 
it is barren of coal. Thousands of dollars can be saved in 
Nebraska by this knowledge, for there are many engaged in 
the determined effort to find the Carboniferous in ini]x.s- 
Bible placet. An unfortunate aspect of this affair is thai 
many ]&gt;cople report their undertakings to the geologist and 
ask for advice, but are averse to receiving it. They seem 
to covet encouragement rather than to learn facts, and take 
exception in most cases if a report adverse to their views 
and expectations is rendered, and. stimulated by a desire to 
show that the judgment of others is in error, dig resolutely 
downward. In one instance a foreigner, at the cost of his 
farm, sunk four deep shafts, all within a couple of acres. 
for the porpoaeof demonstrating that the Carboniferous was 
there, as he knew. In another instance, a ranchman in ecu 
tral Nebraska, after drilling &lt;&gt;00 feet, asked advice, and after 
getting it, drilled unsuccessfully 1,100 feet more, out of a 
spirit of opposition, as he plainly confessed. It ought to be 
made plain to all citizens, foreign as well as native born, 
that the geologist of a state in giving advice is actuated by 
right motives, otherwise he is unworthy of the trust reposed 
in him by the people whose interests he is mipposed to serve 
in the strictest fidelity and in a manner free from prejudice. </seg>

The rocks of this formation are characterised by the occurence 
of innumerable nodules of Hint or chert, which prove 
liiite detrimental to many beds. These nodules are in evilence 
in many of our foundations, and as time goes on they

DAKOTA FORMATION 

The Dakota formation, so called became &lt;&gt;f the typical 
xposures found at Dakota City, Neb., is ordinarily spoken 
f as Dakota sandstone, for the reason that every one in 
astern Nebraska is familiar with its very characteristic 
indy layer, which has such a rusty or ferruginous appear 
nee that once recognised it is never forgotten. In reality, 
ipre is as much clay as sand in this formation, and some of

tant clay deposits in the Dakota. It is characterized, in 
many places by the impressions of countless leaves, over five 
iliousiind specimens being displayed in the State Museum as 
the result of one summer's work. 

The Dakota clays are yellow, blue, red, and Mottled, and 
yield brick of any desired color or kind. The Dakota sainls 
¦re mostly crumbly or friable; sometimes lijjht in color, but 
generally dark, and strikingly rusty; in fact so heavy with 
iron in layers as to pass for iron ore. Here iron concretions 
i&gt;r balls, often hollow within, are common, and since the\ 
resemble iron ore are often considered meteorites. 

The Dakota sand rock is sometimes soft enough to be dag 
v the hand like sand; in some places it is half compact, and 
pod enough for rough building purposes, in spite of its 
nfortunate dark brown or rusty color. In other place* it 
as hard as qnartsite, as in the case near Fairbury, ami in 
•altered exposures in the northeastern counties. Here the 
•ment is lime instead of silica, and the rock is of an attracte 
color, tine texture, and densely hard. Unfortunately, in 
le quarries producing this grade of stone, there are inniilerable 
fossil leaves of a dark color, twi^s and limbs con 
erted into iron pyrites, besides scattered crystals, and 
troches or nodules of pyrite, which quickly oxidize on ex 
•osure. The rock which at sight seems so presentable is 
leaked with iron-rust in a season, and its value as an srchi 
¦ctural stone is ruined. This rock will surely be found in 
ariotis quarries in eastern Nebraska free from this blemish.

THE BKNTON I'OIt.M ATION 

The Henton. like ihe other formations already described, 
is so concealed by drift and loess that many people an 1 mi 
aware of its existence, and yet it can lie traced the length of 
the Kepublican river from central Red Willow county, eastward 
to Thayer and .TetTerson. thence northward in widely 
distant exposure* to Dakota county, thence westward aloug 
the .Missouri to central Bojd comity; a total distance exceedinj; 
four hundred miles. 

Il consists essentially of two strikingly different layers, 
easily recognised when once known; a black layer of shale, 
and a white or lnilT overlying layer of chalk rock, correlated 
with the greenhorn limestone of the Rocky mountains. This 
chalky layer has been incorrect 1\ called the Niohrara formation, 
as Dart on finds. 

There are numerous quarries only a few miles distant 
from Hebron, and many buildings are constructed of the 
chalk rock. Around Fairbury. in Jefferson county, several 
&lt;|iiarries and lime kilns are in operation, making use of this 
limestone. At .Milford, under the bridge by the Soldiers' 
Home, the white and black layers are clearly shown, and 
may be traced for souk- rods along the creek. 

The next important exi&gt;osures occur along the Missouri 
front in the northeastern counties, where the Itenton limestone 
is again put to use for building purposes with satis 
factory results. Though soft, it looks well and lasts surprisingly 
well, whether used alone or combined with brick 
or with building stone of some contrasting color. Bee tig. 14(1. 

When taken fresh from the quarry it is so soft that. a&lt;

¦eqoestlj it grows hard, and is laid up with mortar in the 
isu;il way. We have seen cliiH-clirs, residences, and business 
¦locks built of this chalk rock, which, although built twenty 
&gt;r twenty-five yean ago, show little change In Kansas the 
•halk rock is sawed into building stones, etc., but mote 
iiiticciilily into fence posts fur wire fences, hitching |&gt; 
amp ix&gt;sts. etc.. thus making it serve useful ends where hunter 
is high priced. Ir is not improbable that the selfsame 
•]m»si," layer may be traced to Nebraska and put to use in 
in equally advantageous manner. Just across the line at 
Vanklon, S. I&gt;.. the Bentou furnishes material for the 
Manufacture of hydraulic cement, which is being put to 
steadily increasing use, and is in demand over the whole 
•ountrv. The chalk rock is simply mixed with a certain 
iropoition of the accompanying shale and roasted. It is an 
mportant industry of that state, and a large number of men 
re employed and a natural resource develojH'd. 

South of us, in Kansas, great progress is being made in 
he manufacture of hydraulic cement, and the industry is 
teing pushed to the front, while our cement resources lie 
intouched ami undeveloped. 

The thickness of the Melllon is 154 to 2M feet, allowing 
1(10 to 150 for the dark, shaly portion, and ."id to T."&gt; for the 
chalk rock. There are no exposures to enable one to judge 
correctly, and well records furnish meager information. 

These beds are readily distinguished from the preceding 
and succeeding formations by means of their fossil oyst

Heretofore the chalky layer ol the Bentoa has been 
ailed Xiobrara. It seems t(» he the most illy-defined formaion

'1'lie Pierre format inn, so Darned after Pierre, S. 1).. where 
t is so broadly exposed, is commonly spoken of as the Pierre 
hales, lieeause consisting wholly of various shales, mostly 
•iy dark. In places it i.s called by the people the gumbo, 
"•cause when wei it mils up on the wagon wheels as any 
limbo or clay noil is apt to do. It consists of a variety of 
hales, mostly of a dark color, and underlies the entire state 
\est of Sew aid county, increasing in thickness from several 
undred feel at York, to 999 feet at Dsnnehrog, 1,100 feet 
t Hastings, 2,508 feet at Kearney, probably 3,000 at North 
Matte, and :{.r&gt;00 to 1,000 feet under the western tier of 
ounties; and t hence the thickness increases steadily to the 
estward. and reaches the astonishing thickness of 7,000 
•et in the 1 &gt;enver basin. 

Great as is the mass of Pierre, it is destitute of value to a 
onimuiiity, for it contains uo stone, do building material, 
o water. If a little water is struck, it is apt to be unfit for 
se for house, stock, or steam boilers. This works serious 
ardahips in northwestern Nebraska, but more especially iu 
outh Dakota and Wyoming. In these regions it is a great 
iroblem where and how to get water. .Many deep wells have 
eeii sunk, at great expense and without results. Some of 
ie '.owns and stations near the Bad Lauds have no water, 
ive what is brought on the water cars. 

i Besides being too thick to penetrate with ordinary drillg, 
the Pierre "sheUs-in" badly, making it necessary at frelent 
intervals to cast the drill hole solid with Portland 
neat, let it set, then drill through it. This repeated often 
OUgh enables the well digger to drill deep into it, but it is 
&gt;W and costly and yields no results. Though attempts are </seg>

rally known throughout the state, ;in«l for that matter 
lnoimli.piii the world, as the in«&gt;si famous fossil field. The 
!;id Lands nre made up mainly of li;_'ht colored clays and 
oroe sand, varying in thickness from 600 i&lt;» 9M feet. These 
eds yield little or no water, and that of poor quality, and 
urnisli no building materials as far as known. Their eeooniic 
importance consists then mainly in the fossils found 
here, which are universally prized, and often command high 
•rices, a number of people being engaged in digging and 

¦olleoting them for eastern imiseiims and curio dealer 

Surrounding the Bad Lands are valuable grazing lands. 
nd herds find shelter in the recesses and deep cuts, so they 
eive an economic purpose in protecting range cattle. The 
tame Had Lands is a misnomer, the lands not being bad in 
he sense of sterile, lint bad in the sense of hard to traverse. 
s the original French expression shows, "Manrtiinct temt 
Imrt rxi r." 

Tlie Rail Lands are rather well elevated, standing at a 
eighl of alpotit 3,500 feet, and are in the right position to 
ash excessively. Where the wash is not excessive thev 
"in become good lands, producing crops and valuable 
rasses. They are entirely of fresh water origin, unlike the 
ther descrilied formations, which are mostly marine. 

A great freshwater lake, or sea as it should lie called, 
ivei-ed the western part of South Dakota and parts of Coloido 
and Wyoming. This lake was filled with Tertiary mud 
i a depth of alioiit one thousand feet in the backbone of the 
til Bad Lands of South Dakota. Drainage has carve;] the 
ad Lands in a style of magnificent grandeur. .Many touris, 
finding these lands accessible since the I!, ft M. and the 
*.. EL ft M. V. railroads have extended their lines into the 
lack Hills, visit these places from the nearest stations, 
mis giving employment to a considerable number of guides, 
¦ainsiers. and hotel keepers during the summer months.

iportance to scientists, can not even he hinted at here,

THE O0AIXAI.A FORMATION' 

The Ogallala formation, so named by Darton because of 
typical mmni occurring around the town of Ogallala, in 
Keith county, night be better known to the people under 
the name '"magnesia." It is called magnesia in Kansas ami 
Nebraska. It is also called Tertiary grit and "the mortar 
beds'' in Kansas. 

It is essentially a limestone with impurities, ranging in 
olor from light gray to nearly white. It is a calcareous 
n*it with a calcareous cement, often containing pebbly conjomemte 
and beds of Rocky mountain sand and ledges of 
airly compact sandstone. At the base of the Irregular cliffs 
f the caleareotM magnesia, it seems to break down into a 
KCaliar irregular lime gravel. On Hat tables of magnesia, 
lie soil changes insensibly into magnesian gravel ami then 
nto the unaltered magnesia. It breaks down into soil easily 
nd is prod active. 

Just how far east one can trace the Ogallala is not safe 
o assert until the stratigraphy of the state can be studied 
lore in detail. However, interesting quartzite rocks in 
'ranklin county are related to the Ogallala. These green 
naitzite are known at Woodruff, Kan., and in Franklin, 
ortheastern Ifock. and Knox counties, Nebraska. These 
uartzites are economically of some importance, being of an 
ttractive green color, fine texture, and of the most lasting 
uality. The county jail at Franklin, and other buildigs, 
foundations, and bridges are built of this rock, 
¦Inch probably - ranks as the densest, strongest, and most 
&gt;eautiful stone in any formation in Nebraska, though 
8 yet it is the least used. The B. &amp; M. railroad is beginning 
o use large amounts of it for ballast, and some of the alleys 
nd crc^ssings in Lincoln are paved with this rock, which 
¦ears like granite. 

At Verdigris, apparently the same stone occurs again, and 
is used in the flouring mill, in the construction of dams, 
foundations, etc. Though a beautiful and lasting stone, it 
seems to occur in rather restricted areas in Nebraska, </seg>

twever. it may lie viewed as t he closint; act in glacial hisy. 
When the iicneral drainage was impeded, and all of 
streams congested and fenced out of their hanks, marshy 
shallow lake conditions prevailed and glacial imids were 
iidily deposited. These we call loess. 

Some view the wind ax the chief agent. The loess is laid 
c-.'iily over hills and hollows alike, and some think this can 
1m- accounted for only by the wind. The internal arrange 
nient also argon for the wind theory. 

It must he admitted that the velocity of our wind is high, 
1 the power to transport dust. silt, and sand correspondl.v 
great, and that the wind must have lieen one of the 
tors to lie reckoned with in accounting for the loess; still, 
are compelled, without entering into arguments, to view 
is so much glacial mud and slush, deposited in the retreat 
the i.e. 

The chief cconoinjr advantages of the loess are agricultural, 
and lie in its remarkable depth and inexhaustible 
fertility, its power to catch ami to conserve the rainfall, 
and to withstand drouth. These are important agricultural 
advantages; Imt the deposit is also of great advantage to 
brick makers, as well as to those buyers who wish to gel 
cheap brick. The process of making brick from l&lt;iess is 
simple, and where the material is more argillaceous 
than usual the brick are excellent. When pressed dry, a 
very superior product results, beautiful in color and 
tine in texture, with true edges and faces, of lasting quality, 
and capable of sustaining heavy pressure tests. The Klose 
Bros., of Lincoln, hare their extensive brick business based 
on the utilization of the loess, and they turn on t a great 
number of brick of various grades. Since the loess is so 
widely distributed in Nebraska, it may lie viewed as a resource 
without geographic limit, and limited only in its 
development by the price of fuel. 

Kf any one fails to recognise the loess, let him compare 
shells obtained in his hank with those shown in ig. Ill 
he can make his identification sure. </seg>

THE SANDHILLS 

Tlio sandhill region has already licen sjwken of as burntinj; 
More stable since its settlement bj the white man. Since 
the extermination of the native wild herds which trampled 
its grasses and loosened and excised the sand to the trans 
porting power of the wind, and the expulsion of the native 
people, who made a practice of setting fire to the prairie 

grasses, the sandhills hare become stable instead of shifting 
as formerly. They are completely &lt;;rassed over, ami tame of

111 former times the sand was blown into hills and ridges,

As to the origin of the sandhills, which cover hundreds of 
miles, it may lie said that the sand is derived from Tertiary 
sandstone, chiefly that of the Arikaree. Since Tertiary sandstones 
are young and poorly consolidated, and i nimbir readily 
under the action of the weather, they quickly break down

It is interesting to note that many farmers report alfalfa 
as growing luxuriantly in the moister place*, and even creeplag

reported that water is found within a few feet of the sin '

is {jreat expectation of producing large quantities of this

Alluvium, or valley \\;isli. ocean to ¦ greater or less extent

Tlie alluvial deposit along the Klkhorn, though nar

¦Me a model hay Held throughout its length, as riewed 
roni the 1".. E. ft M. V. railroad. Tlie valley of the Platte is 
o extensive and productive as to sustain a large population, 
nd varies from a few miles in width to fifteen miles in the 
eiitral part of the state. 

The valleys of the llepulil ican. Blue. Niolirara, and eveu 
lie lesser streams all have alluvium, and are of great agriculoral 
importance. Our Cretaceooa and Tertiary rocks, being 
¦oft, are the More easily nil into wide valleys, and so afford 
iroad floors for tlie deposit of alluvium. 

Alluvium consisis essentially of a heterogeneous mixture 
if line soil or loam. silt. sand, gravel, and pebbles, and occasional 
lieds of clay, all more or less mixed with ground-up 
ejretable matter or humus, and as a soil it contains all the 
•lements of fertility, liesides being so situated as to have a 
Kiitmoil abounding in moisture. 

Another economic feature of alluvium is its clay beds. 
',\ the assorting power of water certain irregular banks of 
lay are deposited, generally mixed with sand. This is used 
u many places for the production of brick. A short paper 
.11 the Comparative Value of Bluff and Valley-wash Deposits 
s a Brick Material, by &lt; '. A. Fisher, may be found in the 
initial report of the Stale Hoard of Agriculture for 1900 

Alluvium is the last and youngest of the geological deposits, 
and. although it was forming when the river first began 
to llow. its deposition still continues, and brings the alluvial 
formation up to date.

Native jrold ocelli's in the state in the sands of the Platte 
and in the glacial drift, and several parties interested have, 
after a number of years, panned out a few dollars worth of 
these gold scales or nuggets. They are very small, lint real. 
However, they are so small ami so widely scattered that it 
seems improbable that the day can ever come wheu the gold 
will lie of the least economic importance. The fjeolo«;ist 
regrets that it is accessary to report it in this way, for of late 
strong hopes have been built on {jold mining in Nebraska, 
and considerable sums sacrificed in developing the work. 

The older residents say that these gold excitements have 
recurred periodically for the last thirty-ire years, and it is 
stated on good authority that the gold excitement in Iowa, 
Kansas, and Nebraska is kindled and kept alive by men who 
are working ostensibly for the development of mining interests, 
but really are working in behalf of certain manufacturers 
of Mining and pumping machinery. Nearly everj 
town from Milford and Crete to Qering has had its gold 
excitement, but, from the point of view of the geologist, 
gold in paying quantities can not be hoped for in Nebraska.

less authentic yield a dollar or two per ton.

the investigation of the uhx-ial sands of his place. He lias 
taken the pains to try various methods of --old extraction, 
has bought and set up machinery, and lias gone to the &lt; j \ 
pease of baring many assays made. Manj of the prosperous 
far mo re of [Measantdale and Mil ford have cooperated with 
.Mr. lHllenbcck in this work. 

Gold lias been variously reported from layers of iron pjTite 
in llarlan county, and gold and silver from some of the deep 
wells in Omaha. Analyses of gold have been made in nearly 
every county, bat many of them lack authenticity or have 
lieeii lost, and the record is verv meager. 

!A* a rule these analyses run low. liut a few, apparently 
tirely authentic, run so high as to cause them to he disedited. 
A single Fragment recently broughi to the departmi 
of chemistry at the State University was bristling 
ith free gold, and gave an assay of four thousand to the 
ousand dollars per ton. It must lie understood that this 

i mere fragment, and in spite of all efforts those inter 

could tind no more. 

tin ihis connection it seems advisable to say a word about 
hi pyrite. which is constantly sent to the office of the geolist 
for determination. It is very like gold in appearance. 

i much vi that it lias long been called "fool's gold." vVe 
in think of no simpler test for the average home than to 
•oiiiid the grains; if it is gold, the grain will flatten because 
f the great malleability of gold ; if iron pyrite, it will break 
powder, [{oast a little of the iron pyrite on a hot stoveid, 
and it will give oil" sulphur fumes, turn Mack, and beome 
magnetic, which u&lt;&gt;ld will not do. 

Ii is also an almost daily occurrence for the geologist to 
ive samples which turn out to he mica scales. In the 
lacial drift there are boulders and pebbles of granitic rock; 
&gt;n rotting down, the mica scales are liberated, and since it 
lappens that mica closely resembles gold at some of its sia^o 
f decomposition, many are deceived by its color. Perhaps 
he simplest test on the farm is to try picking it into scales 
mi to test its malleability by pounding it. It sometimes lias 
strikingly silverv look, but it is merely an imitative color.

The writer li;is been shown samples of genaine jjold, well 
authenticated as coming from the river sands and from the 
glacial drift, hut its occurrence is simply a matter of interest 
to mineralogists, and it is to be feared that gold in Nebraska 
can never hare the least economic importance. 

COPPER 

The writer has been shown small flattened grains of native 
opper found in Cherry and Nemaha counties. There is 
lso preserved in the State .Museum a piece of native copier, 
weighing about one-half ounce, found in Chase county, 
tear imperial, in a well at a depth of ninety-two feet. PI. 
"Ill, tig. 1&lt;). This seems to be authentic. Other bits have been 
eported from other counties, but most of them are plainly 
tits of ore from the llocky mountain regions accidentally 
Iropped or lost in Nebraska. Aside from the fragments 
lready described, there is no copper in Nebraska. The little 
ound ami reported interests the mineralogist, but has not 
he slightest economic significance. 

TKBRKSTKIAL IUON 

Pure iron has been rei&gt;orte&lt;l from Auburn, and in the tun 
¦earn of the department of chemistry in the University of 
Nebraska may be seen carefully preserved specimens. It is 
ound in a tenacious clay at a depth of some sixty feet, and, 
tccording to tin- report of well diggers, is sufficient in amount 
o interfere with wel! digging. The individual bits of tei•esifial 
iron resemble the common bean in shape and size. 
ilthough some are as large as a pigeon's eggs. Smh occur¦euces 
are very rare, for iron almost never occurs pure in 
tatnre, hut is always combined with some other element, 
such as oxygen, sulphur, etc. Associated with this very 
inique native iron are grains of native copper.

Later a much larger iron Meteorite was found in Red Wil&lt;tw 
county, weighing 6.13 pooods ii'.TTC graats), as shown 
n tijrs. lit; and 117. This excellent specimen has been badly 
lounded by a hammer on one face. When a small face was 
•laiied. polished, and etched, faint and indistinct Widman 
latten figures were developed. This is attributed to the 
rystalline derangement incident to the pounding to which 
t had been subjected. 

A third meteorite was found in Kock county, the finder 
'ouching for tlie fact that he observed it fall between twelve 
md one o'clock on the night of October Hi. 1898, that it was 
ominous, and that it made a loud noise in its descent. This 
I'M the first fall of a meteorite observed in the state. It 
raghed twelve ounces (346 grains). The Lancaster county 
ueteorite, just brought to light, weighs twenty-nine pounds,

But little economic use as yet has been made of 1 1 1bracks

up in neat packages, and rendered attractive l&gt;y ornamented 
labels, and sold by small dealers in various towns as an 
excellent polishing powder, and such in fact it is. It may 
also be used as a nonconducting packing for steam pipes, 
water pipes, etc. 

Because of a certain similarity in color and texture, citizens 
of the state often confound diatomaceous earth with 
the much more common deposit, volcanic ash. 

A simple test is at hand. Our diatomaceous earth, in 
broken blocks, floats like cork till water-logged. Volcanic 
ash sinks at once. </seg>

PEAT 

Peat lias already been alluded to as occurring iuterheddeii 
with diatoinaceotis earth, sand, day, etc., along the bauks 
of the Loop system. 

Harden and early geologists called attention to the beds 
of jK?at in this state as a |li&gt;— illli means of fuel supply, hut 
there lias been no development, as far as t he writer can learn. 
In fact, the state is so large that he has not had time to visit 
the peat beds reported. Several excellent specimens of peat 
have been sent to the State .Museum, and reports of numerous 
peat bogs come in from those living along the river courses. 
However. Nebraska would not be looked aposj us a peatproducing 
state. 

One peat bog is reported from Logan county as six miles 
ong, of variable width, and fifteen feet in thickness, (lood 
cat beds have been reported also fnim Gredey and Seward 
ounties. "While all of these beds have been reported in 
ood faith and are doubtless reliable, they have not been vis 
ted and continued by the geologist. This must be done, and 
special report must be prepared touching this matter, inas 
mch as a number of eastern firms having in view the develpment 
of our best peat beds are making inquiry about these 
eposits, with a view to locating in Nebraska. 

Heavy machinery has been devised and is in operation in 
Canada and eastern states compressing peat, which is often 
mixed with a little cheap slack and made into bricks which 
are said to burn well and give good results. Peat may be 
viewed as incipient coal.

ral bountv for the discovery of a workable hofl of coal 
Thousands of dollars and months of time have hem devoted to 
tie work of coal prospecting in Nebraska dwiag the |&gt;;ist 
wo years, and this same money would have made n geotogial 
survey of the state! It is never an agreeable task to 
nfonn people that there is little prospect of ever finding 
oal in their state, but such is the fact in Nebraska. Many 
f these prospectors have insisted that there is coal east of 
s in Iowa and west of us in Wyoming, therefore it must of 
ecessity occur here. This seems reasonable, but it is neverleless 
fallacious. The Carboniferous in Nebraska is a deepsea 
deposit, and the coal beds which are productive in Iowa 
lave thinned out in Nebraska to a few inches. \Yest of Lin 
olu all coal soon disappears, and there is no coal in the Car- 
Kmiferous of the Uocky mountains. There the coal is found 
n the Upper Cretaceous, which does not occur in Nebraska. 

At one time, for four or five consecutive years, the total 
output of coal, mined chiefly by farmers, was estimated at 
fifteen hundred tons, and valued at six thousand dollars. 
Recently the Rulo Coal Co., under the direction of Mr. Bullock, 
of Lincoln, mined coal at Rulo, but the undertaking 
proved unprofitable and has been abandoned. 

In the northeastern counties some coal is being produced ; 
it is a. lignite coal from the Cretaceous, and the bed is 
scarcely eighteen inches in thickness. Other phases of this 
matter are discussed under the Carboniferous formation.

CLAYS 

tThe state is particularly rich in good clays, the chiet 
nounts being found, as already described, in the Carbonerous 
and Dakota Cretaceous formations. 

This being probably the most important single resource, it 
will be reported in detail in a special paper. It is enough 
o say that we are importing into the' state all kinds of buildng. 
paving, and ornamental brick, when we have here the 
greatest abundance of clays of the best quality. Large brick 
ndustrie8 are already established around Beatrice, Table 
iock, Omaha, Lincoln, and other cities, and many towns 
boast of their brick factories. The writer is very sanguine 
bout the possibilities of this resource; it is capable of magnificent 
development. 

It seems possible that some of our clays, especially those 
containing a proper percentage of iron and lime, may yield 
material for the production of hydraulic cement. Practical 
experiments are already being made along that line, although 
the great source for hydraulic cement is in the chalk rock 
and shale of the Benton formation.

SALT 

The salt spring and salt basin at Lincoln used to be a 
¦OWN of salt supply for the West, but no beds like those 
of Kansas have been or are likely to be found, and since no 
method of producing salt by evaporation from saline water 
is as cheap as that of mining it, this industry has ceased to 
• xist. It is safe to say that our numerous deep wells would 
have revealed salt bods long ago if they existed. 

Salt lake was for a while turned to account as a sort of 
inland summer bathing beach, under the name Burlington 
Beach, as described on page 107. Salt waters are turned to a 
still greater account in the Sulpho-saline baths of Lincoln, 
1 1 escribed on page 108. A considerable amount of salt marsh 
land was reserved as public land by the state, and still stands 
unoccupied. 

VOLCANIC DUST OR NATURAL PUMICB 

Associated with our soils and surface deposits is often 
found a silvery white powdery mineral, so unlike the soil 
and other material in which it occurs that it excites the immediate 
attention of every one. The constant inquiry is, "What 
is this strange white substance which we find on our farms 
and ranches?" It seems fitting that a public answer be given 
to this inquiry. If you ask about the distribution of this 
powder, or volcanic dust, as it should be called, we would 
refer you for an answer to the map of the state, fig. 147, on 
which is shown those counties from which we now have samples 
in the State Museum. The same volcanic dust occurs 
in many, if not all, of the intermediate counties, although 
those only are indicated here which have furnished actual 
samples. The answer, then, as you will read it for yourselves 
is that this volcanic dust is found in scattered beds over the 
entire state. Hut its real limit extends far beyond and 
includes western Iowa, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Kansas. 
Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana and regions farther west 
Iowa is plainly its eastern limit, for it occurs very sparingly </seg>

The discovery of petroleum is often reported in the hopeful 
headlines of county papers, hut in every case, as far as 
can be learned, the scum or film of oil proves to be an irridescent 
film of iron instead. Iron water on coating to the 
surface sutlers from the oxidizing action of the air, and a 
film of iron exactly resembling oil is formed. From Rock 
county a specimen of sand rock saturated with oil has been 
received, and from Brown county come authentic reports of 
small amounts of oil having been collected and preserved in 
bottles. This is mentioned more as a matter of interest than 
as one of prospective utility. • i 

THE SOlUS OK NEBRASKA 

Since Nebraska stands as the most distinctly agricultural 
state in the Union, its soils must rank as a natural resource 
of profound importance, and worthy of the utmost development. 
It seems the more ironical, then, that so much tinitand 
attention should be paid to the development of mines, 
when our agriculture yields annually more gold than all the 
combined gold and silver mines of the Tinted States. The 
Mil is literally inexhaustible, and there is no predicting what 
may not result from the full development of our agricultural 
resources. 

There are several well-defined, broad soil areas, and others 
much more restricted in extent and not generally known. 
Our western soils are native soils, resulting from the rotting 
and breaking down of native rocks, while our eastern soils 
are transported soils, some having been carried glacially 
from regions five hundred to six hundred miles to the north, 
and dropped by the melting of the ice. 

Lin general, the soils of a region correspond to its geologi-1 
divisions, but there ate exceptions here because of the </seg>

epth to which many of our rocks are buried. The eastern 
ftli. or the glaciated i&gt;ortion, constitutes a region of drift 
&gt;il where not covered by loess. The southeastern half of 
"ebraska is almost wholly a region of loess soil. The sandlills 
constitute another soil region of broad extent, with one 
mgue of sand extending well to the northeast, and two 
nigues extending to the extreme smith west. Scattered 
irough the sandhills, and occurring in large tracts further 
est. is ¦ soil characterized as one digs downward by increaslg 
amounts of lime and lime pebbles, known as magnesia 
? II. This soil region corresponds with the magnesia rock. 
• the Ogallala formation. The writer is frequently conilted 
about this same magnesia soil, which is viewed with 
istrust by many. 

I A lime soil is counted a productive soil, and experience 
ow s our magnesia suil to be particularly so. About all it 
cks is moisture. I'nder irrigation it is \it\ productive. 

The western counties constitute a soil region which may 
be called butte soil, characterized by tine sandy soil and am 
pie lime. The soil of this region is derived from the breaking 
down of Arikaree or Rutte sand. With ample rainfall 
this. too. is highly productive. 

Throughout the West, and more particularly the Northwest, 
are scattered tracts of Had Lands which constitute 
another soil area. In the region of shales, es|Hvially the 
Pierre shale, are tracts known as gumbo soil. Along the 
river courses, most noticeably the IMatte. are broad, level 
tracts of alluvial soils. In certain places there are alkali 
suils. due chiefly tn imperfect drainage. The area of salt 
land soil is too restricted to be mentioned, being confined to 
Salt creek and the salt marshes near Lincoln. 

THE MKCIIAMc At. ANALYSES OF THE SOILS OF NEBRASKA 

Under the auspices of the State Hoard of Agriculture and 
the State Geological Survey, the writer undertook, in ls'.c'. 
the work of collecting the soils of the state, both for permanent 
display in the State .Museum and for the more technical 
purjxises of analysis. </seg>

MINKRAI. RESOURCES 

Ordinarily, it is sufficient to collect the soils from a few 
ypical region*, but where the state is unusually large, and 
vhere the counties are correspondingly large, and their citizens 
zealously interested in their respective counties, it has 
been the attempt to have each and every county in the state 
epresented. The soil survey will he counted unfinished until 
this is done. A county line is a purely artificial and arbirary 
boundary, yet there is reason to regard it in making 
lie soil survev. 

In spite of the old and well-established saying that the 
udjfineut of a good farmer is to be relied upon in the seleeiou 
of a good soil, rather than the analysis of sin experi•nced 
chemist, yet the importance of the chemical deternination 
of soils in the I'nited States has grown in popular 
recognition to such an extent that the government has denoted 
a special department to this particular research, with 
he result that the old saying is all but disqualified. 

In many regions it is a matter of national importance to 
leteraune the nature of cotton soils, tobacco soils, truck soils. 
¦agar beet, wheat, and con! soils; to determine chemically 
vhat they lack of fulfilling the requirements and what can 
&gt;e done for their improvement; and when they are worn out 
or overtaxed, to determine mean* for their reclamation or 
M-tterment. as the case may be. All of this can be deteruined 
by geological and chemical methods. 

In Nebraska the need of such exact, determination is less 
conspicuous than in some of the less fortunate stales, for 
the reason that our soils are particularly deep, and have all 
the elements of fertility; accordingly, it is not so essential 
that the chemist should determine for us the question of 
fertility and fertilizers. That seems (o have been settled 
for us by a very bounteous nature. Nevertheless, as 
we come into closer agricultural competition, and are 
brought, little by little, to more diversified agriculture, it is 
plain that good must come out of a fundamental knowledge 
of our soils and the amount and kind of their constituents. 
Such a knowledge comes m one way. and one way only; </seg>

1893, and again by the Trans-Mississippi and International 
Exposition at Omaha, in 1898. In both instances the soils 
of our state were to come into close comparison with those 
of other states, older and better represented. For a young 
state, with so much land yet to be occupied, and M many 
favorable or unfavorable impressions to be coarcjed. it 
seemed worth while to put forth especial efforts in this direction, 
the result l&gt;eing that no better showing was inailc u 
either of the great expositions, ami very substantial awards 
were received. It is believed that no state in the I'nion lias 
a larger or more representative collection of soils than Ne 
braskn, and there are many yet to lie added. It. is necessary. 
in some cases, to take more than one sample from a county 
in order to fairly represent it. Some counties are characterised 
by sandhills in one part, and rich valley soil in another. 
One soil sample Blight, therefore, show the soils of that particular 
county in a false light Sometimes there are clayey 
uplands and sandy bottoms; here •gala, to make it representative, 
two, or sometimes three, samples must lie taken. 

This explanation is necessary, because, though the soil survey 
of the state is well began, yet. as the writer plans it. it 
will not be done in fact until all soil conditions of every 
county in the state are as fairly represented as jxissible. 

If we make a composite soil, by striking the average &lt;&gt;f all 
the soils as far as analyzed, the result will be about as sliown 
in the bottle. The clay will equal about 14..") parts; silt and

A FEW BOOKS ON Sol US 

Every progressive farmer will find himself at once interests 
and instructed by perusing some plain treatise on the 
rigin and nature of the soil — the very foundation on whk-h 
!. r riculture is laid. Accordingly, he should surely have one 
r more such works upon his shelf. The writer would recomiend 
to the farmers of Nebraska that most admirable little 
&lt;&gt;ok by King, entitled The t&gt;oil. It is simple, yet scientific 
'hough short, it is lon&lt;r enough to show clearly the relation 
f things. There are ;ilso numy other good works. A few

NATIVE 1M.ASTKI 

A number of communities produce a native plaster with 
which houses are successfully and very cheaply plastered, 
lowever, the writer is unable to recommend it for use, be 
ausc of the readiness with which it breaks down when wet. 
Vrtain ledges in the Arikaree and Ogallala yield a tine 
railed, sandy rock which is quarried for plaster. This rock. 
vhich consists essentially of very tine sand, or silt, united 
y cla.v and lime, slacks, as it is called, very quickly when 
.laced in water. This is mixed with four parts of sand to 
ne part of the native mortar, and is applied directly to the 
lths. It is hard and takes a skim coat and lasts, accord iug </seg>

to all accounts, for years. Tests were made on a number of 
cubes of this native plaster properly cast and dried, and 
gave the following results: 

The compression test on a cube 0.9 inches square gave Ml 
pounds. When mixed with hair, it withstood a pressure of 
23d pounds. In the tension test an inch square briquet of 
the native plaster, without hair or fiber, stood a tension of 
75 pounds. 

This native plaster is plainly harder and better than much 
•heap plaster which goea on many walls, and costs nothing 
o those living near the source of supply, but it will not bear 
uoisturc. Any leak in the roof or exjtosure to water rums 
he plaster almost instantly. One of the cubes, such as had 
MM'ii used in the pressure tests, when plunged in water was 
reduced to fine mud within two minutes. Several attempts 
lave been made to put this plaster upon the market, and 
iopes are still entertained that it may yet be done, but in 
ts present form it is not to be considered a resource worthy 
)f development. 

CONCRETIONARY FORMS 

Throughout the claystnties, limestones, and sandstones of 
ny region it is a common occurrence to tind a great variety 
tf concretionary forms which excite inquiry. Without enering 
into technicalities, it may lie explained that com re 
ionary structure generally results from mineralization 
round some center. Hence, a concretion is generally round 
n outline and harder than the surrounding rock. Accordngly. 
when the mother rock rots down, numerous balls of 
arious sizes and shapes are left behind, some being solid, 
thers more or less hollow. It is quite a common occurrem-e 
0 tind pyrites of iron crystallized into balls, as seen in plate 
III, figs. 1, 2, and 3. In the loess, or "yellow clay," irregu 
ur lime balls, such as appear in figs. 11, 12, and 13, plate 
III, are almost universally present. Sand is often cemented 
nto concretions ranging in size from peas to cannon balls. 
V sand concretion, such as is verv common in Sioux county. </seg>

aga. !t and Ki. plate VIII. ti^. Ki being a qwcfaaoi brakes 
open to ¦BOW the radiate structure. Sometimes the comic 
tions or lialls break in various directions on shrinking, and 
the cracks subsequeutly liecome tilled with some hard 
mineral. 

These concret ions are very abundant and often of gigantic 
size in shale. A specimen of this sort from the Carboniferous, 
presented to the State .Museum by Hon. Kobeft W. I'm 
nas. is shown iu plate VIII. ti«j. 8. Its form, though like that 
of a heart, is purely imitative. So closely do certain concretions 
imitate many living things that people are excusable 
for being deceived. In the dry stream beds of the Bad Lands 
one encounters trains of clay balls often studded over with 
bright colored bits of rock and pebbles, as shown in plate 
VIII, tg. 1"&gt;. These not infrequently are as much as two feet 
in diameter, and result from detached pieces of toagh clay 
being rolled down stream daring a sudden storm. In the 
same region there are great numbers of lime balls malting 
from the crystallization of lime in the Bad Land clays. Poor 
such ealcite balls are shown in fig. IS, plate VIII. 

In the same plate, in f i jx. 17, two stalactitic forms of chalcedony 
are shown. In our limestones and clays, a structure 
called cone in-cone is common. Fig. 14. plate VIII, represents

GEYSERS AND VOLCANOES 

(At one time it was believed that extensive geysers existed 
Nebraska, and the idea survives in "geyserite." the name 
¦st applied to our volcanic ash. Strangely enough, this 
eory was defended by several geologists. Qeywrito soap, 
ide in Denver of volcanic ash shipped from Harlan county, 
res its name to the same error. Geyserite is wholly unlike 
Iconic ash in all respects; they bear no relation to one 
lother, and the idea is the result of a misconception. There 
nothing akin to geyserite in the state. 

tAt Ionia, Dixon county, is found the "volcano," or "burng 
hill." Though said to be declining in activity, this hill 
is once an object of considerable interest, especially after </seg>

point the plain extends east to the county line and south 
along the east line of the county to the shite line. 

It is cut by the somewhat shallow valleys of Cub and 
Indian creeks, tributaries of the Big Bine river. The divide 
in the west between the Little Blue and IJose creek is a portion 
of the same plain, and has an elevation of 1,540 feet. </seg>

to a depth of about 180 feet. Its narrow valley is bordered 
in some places by steep bluffs into which its small tributaries 
are slowly cut ting their way. forming the hilly portiOM 
of the COanty. At other places the slopes are more gradual 
and the surface is rolling. Some of the hills that arc capped

tin- southwestern part, while the eastern and northea&gt; 
parts are drained by Indian creek and Cub creek, trihut.i 
of the Big Bite. The streams flow rapidly and furnish excellent 
water power. 

The geological formations in the county, as shown by ex 
posures, are Dakota ( 'retaceuus, Benton, Glacial Drift. L 
and Alluvium. 

The Dakota is characterized, begjnnng at lower stratum, 
by sand, always water- bearing, and the water fmaieii'ly

salt or alkaline, mottled clay, and sand rock. The first 
stratum is reached only in deep wells, and it has been impossible 
to procure definite information as to its thickness. The 
clay varies in thickness from a few feet to ISO feet. On top 
of this is sand rock, in some places ll'."&gt; feet in thickness.

and underlie every part of the county. Some of the Mad 
rock is quite rich in fossils. 

The lienton Cretaceous consists of a layer of shale from 
20 to 200 feet thick capped with lime rock, in some places 
30 feet thick. The rock is composed Largely of marine shells. 
It consists of four or five layers of moderately hard rock 
from 8 to 10 inches thick, separated by layers of softer Material 
4 to ~&gt; feet in thickness. This deposit underlies the 
western part of the county and is exposed in many places by 
erosion. Very little water is found in it. About 1^ miles 
east of Powell a thin vein of coal is found in the Benton 
&lt; 'retaceous. 

The glacial drift consists of a bluish clay, boulders, and 
sand, oftentimes mixed indiscriminately, but many almost 
i beds of sand and gravel occur, and in some places boulders 
are found alone, the other material having been eroded. 
The drift is exposed wherever the loess is eroded, except in 
the southern portion. There are no surface indications of 
drift on the elevated portion of the country south of Boat 
creek. The beds vary in thickness from a few inches to Iff 

The sand is stratified and layers vary from fine to coarse 
and are frequently cross-bedded. When this overlies Dakota 
it usually contains good water, but overlying the Benton. 
water is not so likely to be found. 

tThe most common boulders are the pink Sioux quartzite. 
ut in the southeastern part of the county (in T. 1, B. 4 K. i 
lie graj is much more common. 

The loess mantle is complete except in the hilly section 
where it has been eroded. It is a yellow clay, columnar in 
structure, and in places contains considerable gravel mixed 
through it. It varies in thickness from 1 to 100 feet, and 
forms the basis of the farming lands of the county. It con 
tains little or no water. 

Very narrow belts of alluvium are found along all of the 
streams. It is shallow and is not important compared with 
the other formations of the countv. </seg>

The Dakota furnishes a fair quality of building iteue 
Many foundations ami some entire building* have Ween eo» 
structed of it. The principal quaniea ate sontli of Fairbury 
and east of Endicott. 

The clay makes excellent tiling, pottery, and brick. A 
Beatrice firm, a few yean ago, ship]&gt;ed over a thousand c .u-loads 
from Endicott, which they made into an excellent iialitv 
of tiling. A company at Hastings is now shipping, from 
a pit three-miles east of Endicott, ten carloads a week, which 
it is making into brick. 811111c of the more ochreous clay lias 
been nsed with considerable success as a body for paint 

The Beaton, east of Powell and also south of Thompson, 
furnishes a quantity of lime or chalk rink. It is 
quite extensively for building purposes, and a fair quality of 
lime lias been made from it. 

The c|iiartzite of the glacial drift is a very durable rock, 
and is somewhat used in foundations, but the sand and gravel 
of this epoch are of the most value. Two miles west of Fairbury 
on the C, Ik. I. &amp; P. 1». I{. the company has a sand ami 
gravel pit which it has worked for the part eight years, during 
which time. they have skipped an average of about three 
a day for plastering, cement, and ballast 

Ou the R &amp; M. II. EL, one half mile west of Kcsterson. i&lt; a 
pit which they have worked quite regularly for the past lifteen 
years, using most of the sand for ballast, but they are 
now using it for cement work. Fairhury and vicinity 
most of their sand from a pit just east of the city limits. 

Loess is used for making brick at Fairbury, and is important 
in its relation to the agriculture of the county. </seg>
