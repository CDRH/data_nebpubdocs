            <seg id="p001">Twenty-First Biennial Report OF THE Department of Roads and Irrigation TO HONORABLE R. L. COCHRAN GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN. NEBRASKA 1935-1936 </seg>
            <seg id="p002">November 20, 1936 TO HIS EXCELLENCY. R. L. COCHRAN GOVERNOR OP THE STATE OF NEBRASKA MY DEAR GOVERNOR: In accordance with Section 81-6302 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, I have the honor to submit the following report of the work of the Department of Roads and Irrigation during the past two years. Principally as a result of unprecedented climatic conditions in the past two years, activities in the Department of Roads and Irrigation, both in high - way and irrigation work, have shifted and changed with unprecedented rapidity. Following the spring drought of 1935, floods in the Republican valley and other parts of the State, shortage of water for -irrigation in the Platte valley, unusually cold weather accompanied by deep snow in the winter of 1936, floods in the Elkhorn and lower Platte valleys in the spring of 1030, and drought conditions in the summer of 1936, again creating problems in irrigation in the western part of the State, all have tended to make unusual demands and a constantly changing program. Should these conditions continue, they will again necessitate revisions in the regular program of this department. The continuance of loyalty by employees of this department, in handling unusual conditions, is an outstanding item. Special efforts were required of the office force in order to prepare plans to restore damaged highways and bridges and to relieve unemployment, and also by the field construction and maintenance organizations in handling the work, and their application to their respective duties without regard to the length of day worked or personal con - venience has made possible the successful handling of the unusual and trying situations that have arisen and has clearly demonstrated the effort and desire of all employees of the department to perform in the true sense of public service. In spite of the unusual conditions and requirements, finances have been handled so that all bills have been paid promptly, and at no time has there been any deficit under the "pay as you go" policy. This report gives in detail summaries of the work done, receipts, expendi - tures and gives detailed reports of the various activities of this department. Bureau of ltoads and Hririgps The accomplishments under your administration In this biennlum have re - sulted in adding about 122 miles of new highways to the total mileage of State-maintained highways and have closed numerous gaps In otherwise continuous hard-surfaced roads, namely. Highway No. 30 across the State. Highway No. 6 from Lincoln to Hastings, Highway No. 20 from Sioux City to Plainview, Highway No. 8 from Omaha to Norfolk, except for 714 miles, and from the State line south of Falls City to Tekamah on Highways Nos, 73 and 75, exctpt for 111 miles. There are still approximately 2.770 miles on the State Highway System, designated by the Legislature, not yet constructed or maintained. Attention is called to the part of the report showing 144 miles of concrete and 346 miles of bituminous mat paving constructed or con - tracted during this biennium. It is the writer's belief that construction of pavement of a type adequate for the location under consideration should be continued to provide all weather, dustless surfaces as quickly as funds permit. In general the maintenance organization has handled the work the same as In previous blenniums. In 1035 considerable extra maintenance . costs were incurred as a result of flood3. In 1930 reductions were made in maintenance costs although the standard of maintenance has been kept up. Extreme and extended dry weather has made it difficult to obtain entirely satisfactory results on gravel highways. With the resumption of regular Federal-Aid appropriations by Congress and with a knowledge that. In addition, feeder road appropriations have been made by Congress, both of which have to be matched, your attention is directed to the fact that the State will be unable at the present rate of financing to meet the regular Federal Aid as rapidly as it becomes due. Al - though the rules and regulations that will control the expenditure of the feeder funds are not yet available from the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, it is likely that the feeder road funds may be used to help the counties in the construction of roads that will qualify as feeder roads, the counties therefore deriving the same benefit with respect to the feeder roads that the State de - rives from the regular Federal funds. II </seg>
            <seg id="p003">For four years the Federal government has required a certain percentage of Federal funds to be usd for roadside improvement. Legislation is needed and the writer recommends suitable legislation to permit the State to acquire additional right of way beyond that needed for regular road work to permit roadside parks, roadside plantings and to take full advantage of the Federal requirements for roadside improvement. Ilur.au of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage Although the drought in 1033 was not as severe as In 1031, much difficulty was experienced both in 103J and in 1936 in administering the water and meeting the demands of appropriators. Office and field work has been carried on by the department both In the Bridgeport and Lincoln offices, in connection with the suit initiated In the Federal Supreme Court by Nebraska against the State of Wyoming. Two hearings have been held before Mr. Michael J. Doherty, Special Master in chancery for the Federal Supreme Court and further hearings will be necessary. In addition to the work that has regularly been carried on by the Bureau of Irrigation. Water Power and Drainage, additional work has been necessi - tated by this bureau in the last biennium in connection with Public Power. Irrigation, and Rural Electrification Districts. Representatives from this department attended and supervised lcttlngs of the Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District, Loup River Public Power District, and The Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District, and the lettings of Rural Electrification Districts at Beatrice, Mitchell, Gerlng. and Lincoln. There are fifteen Rural Electrification Districts now organized in the State, of which light have received Federal loans. The report of the Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power, and Drainage is given in detail in Part 11. State Planning Board Following the appointment by you of the State Planning Board in January. 1938, and' an .appropriation by the Legislature of l IS.OOO for the use of the State Planning Board, the board began functioning. Following public meet - ings held at Lincoln, North Platte, Columbus, and Hastings in the spring of 1935, mi inventory of Public Works Prefects was made and furnished to the Federal Government. Close cooperation with the National Resources Committee of the Department of the Interior at Washington, followed by financial assistance through the Works Progress Administration and the National Resources Commit - tee resulted in the assignment of a part-time consultant and In a project for field and office work with special emphasis on a study of Nebraska's water re - soureos, giving consideration to topography, geology, climate, vegetative cover and human occupancy in the drainage basins as well as to the origin, supply, quality, availability, control and uses made of both surface water and ground water, on which reports have been made and are now available to the public. Special emphasis was given to flood control studies and recommendations for definite control in the Republican river valley where unprecedented flood* occurred in June of 1935. The work of the Planning Board has Included many other additional studies, the first being undertaken to determine those basic and fundamental findings of greatest Interest to the Nebraska people. The National Resources Com - mittee appointed our State Planning Engineer to the position of Research Technician and placed him on the Federal payroll. The staff of the Planning Board Is obtained through the Works Progress Administration so that the State's portion of the financing of the Planning Board is limited to those non-participating items which cannot be obtained through the various Federal agencies cooperating in this work.

            <seg id="p011">TWENTY- FIRST BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE Department of Roads and Irrigation OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA Part 1 Report of Bureau of Roads and Bridges : •" I BRIEF HISTORY The Nebraska Legislature in 1895 created a department known as the "State Board of Irrigation". The Governor, Attorney General and Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings constituted a Board with power to appoint an Executive Secretary. The duties of this board were confined exclusively to irrigation matters. In 1911 the name of the Board was changed to the "State Board of Irrigation, Highways, and Drainage", and its duties relative to irrigation and drainage matters were outlined. However, no provision was made relative to highways except as to design and joint super - vision of State Aid bridges. The first legislative authorization for a State Highway Department in Nebraska was in a bill passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor on April 21, 1913. Under this measure the Board was authorized to give counsel to counties concerning highway improve- 11 </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER ment. Prior to that time all matters pertaining to roads were under the supervision and direction of the several county boards. The next step in the development of the State Highway Depart - ment and the beginning of the present era of road construction was by the passage of the Federal Aid road Act by Congress on July 11, 1916. The following year, in 1917, the Nebraska Legislature passed a law to provide funds sufficient to carry out the provisions contained in the Federal Aid Act and appropriated $640,000.00 to be raised by a mill levy on the assessed valuation of the State. This Federal Act provided for Federal cooperation with the States in the construction of rural mail routes and authorized funds from the United States Government to pay up to 50 per cent of the cost of any construction work on these roads, and was the beginning of the "matched dollar" program of Federal Aid construction. Following the acceptance of the terms of this Federal Act by the State Legislature in 1917, the State Board of Irrigation, High - ways, and Drainage, with the cooperation of all the county boards in Nebraska, designated certain routes for improvement and presented a program of roads construction to the Federal Government on which Federal Aid was requested. The 1919 Nebraska Legislature laid out a definite State Highway System totalling about 5,000 miles of road, generally connecting county seats, and with the provision that where - ever any road was built with State and Federal funds even though it was not on the State System that road automatically became a State Highway. The 1919 Legislature adopted the civil administrative code bill. Under this law the State Board of Irrigation, Highways, and Drainage was superseded by the "Department of Public Works" which included the Bureau of Roads and Bridges; Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power, and Drainage; and the Division of Motor Vehicle Registration, all un - der the authority of the State Engineer. In 1919 Congress appropriated additional Federal Aid road funds, one of the main purposes being to relieve unemployment, particularly among ex-service men who had been recently demobilized after service in the World War. In order to make this program effective, it was required that the work be widely distributed within each of the States. In Nebraska a program, consisting almost entirely of grading and construction of small drain - age structures, was started, with wide distribution over the State. In 1921 Congress passed a new Federal Highway Act, amending the previous Federal Aid Road Act and delegating authority to the United States Secretary of Agriculture to spend the Federal Aid ap - propriation on a system of highways in each State called the "seven </seg>
            <seg id="p013">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION per cent system". In Nebraska the Department of Public Works certified in 1921 to the Secretary of Agriculture that there were 80,272 miles of roads in Nebraska and designated 7 per cent, or 5,619 miles, as a system of highways on which Federal Aid projects would be requested. In general, this system was superimposed over the State Highway System designated by the Legislature in 1919; and, with minor changes, has remained substantially as originally approved. Prior to 1923, all bridges in Nebraska were constructed by the counties, or jointly by the county and State as State Aid Bridges. In 1923 Federal approval was granted to spend Federal Aid for the construction of bridges on the Federal system and the Department of Public 'Works established its present policy of relieving the counties of building bridges on the State Highway System. As more and more roads were graded, the use of the motor vehicle was increased. Motor transportation in Nebraska received its greatest impetus, however, when about 1923 it was learned that a relatively thin application of gravel on the surface of an earth road would transform it into an all-weather road. These gravel surfaced roads encouraged the use of low-priced motor cars and motor trucks. The economical improvement and de - velopment of the motor vehicle and the increased traffic combined to pyramid the demand for highway mileage and for better, roads and bridges. Up until 1925 all State funds for matching Federal funds and for other construction work and maintenance were raised by a levy on property, with the exception of the proceeds of a $3,000,000.00 bond issue in Douglas county, a considerable portion of which was spent under the direction of the State to match Federal Aid for pavement in Douglas county. The 1925 Legislature provided for the first gasoline tax, two cents per gallon, all of which was appropriated, to the State for construction and maintenance of State highways. This 1925 Legislature also passed a law requiring the Department j of Public Works to maintain the State and Federal highway system,[ef - fective January 1, 192G, and provided that 30% of all motor vehicle registration fees be transferred to the Department of Public Works for maintenance, the remainder of these fees remaining with the counties collecting same. In 1927 the total mileage of State highways was approximately 5500 miles, which mileage had remained approximately the same from 1919. The 1927 Legislature added additional highways to the State System by establishing the second bracket of State highways up to legislative No. 149, with an estimated mileage of 1811 miles, making a total mileage of 8012 miles, of which 6298 were marked and main - tained as of November 30, 1928, which left 1714 miles not maintained. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER In 1927 the Legislature passed a condemnation law permitting the Department of Public Works to acquire right of way by condemnation. In 1929 the Legislature established a third bracket of State high - ways up to legislative No. 204, with an estimated total mileage in - cluding the 1929 additions, of 9752 miles, of which 6882 were marked and maintained as of December 31, 1930, which left 2870 miles not maintained. The 1929 Legislature increased the gasoline tax from two cents per gallon to four cents per gallon, one cent going to the counties for use on county roads and three cents going to the State with a provision for one-sixth of the State's .share, establishing the (a) fund for construction and improvement; another one-sixth in the (b) fund for paving; and the remainder into a (c) fund for construc - tion and maintenance and requiring an apportionment to the counties if any State funds were used In conjunction with Federal Aid money in the (c) fund. No expenditures have been made in conjunction with Federal Aid money under the lc) fund, hence no apportionment was required from 1929 to 1936 inclusive. In 1931 the Legislature did not add any additional State high - ways and made no material change in the gasoline tax law. In 1933 the Legislature made a substantial reduction in the amount of the State revenue available for State highways by greatly reducing the registration fees for motor vehicles, and by increasing the counties' share of the gasoline tax from one cent to one and one - half cents and reducing the State's share from three cents to two and one-half cents per gallon. After the adjournment of the 1933 Legis - lature, it looked as if there would be a small program of construction on State and Federal highways. However, in June 1933. a 100 % Federal appropriation was made by Congress in the National In - dustrial Recovery Act, providing for considerable highway work, one - half of which had to be on Federal Aid roads outside of municipalities, one-fourth on the Federal Aid system within municipalities and one - fourth on secondary or feeder roads. The feeder roads mentioned above were the beginning of construction off the State and Federal sys - tem. These feeder roads were maintained by the counties until the 1935 Legislature authorized State maintenance on same, effective August 1, 1935. Congress, in 1934, appropriated other funds similar to the 1933 appropriation and also reinstated the regular Federal Aid program, effective July 1, 1935 and also removed restrictions on lim - itations of funds within city limits on the Federal Aid system. In 1935 the Nebraska Legislature increased the gasoline tax from four cents to five cents per gallon for a limited period, appropriating the proceeds from the additional one cent for the use of the State </seg>
            <seg id="p015">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION Assistance Committee for relief purposes and also appropriated the anticipated revenue from four cents per gallon of the State tax paid on gasoline used in airplanes for the use of the State Aeronautics Commission and provided for a 10% exemption on alcoholic blended motor vehicle fuel, containing from 5% to 20% alcohol, provided the alcohol is distilled from agricultural products of the United States. On April 8, 1935 Congress passed an "Emergency Relief Appropriation Act", providing for 100% Federal Appropriation for grade crossing eliminations and highway construction. In May and June 1935 there were cloud bursts and unprecedented floods In the Republican valley west of Nebraska and in Nebraska. The Republican River, with its tributaries In Nebraska caused the loss of nintey-four persons reported drowned and three others dead from a tornado at the same time near McCook. The flood destroyed 341 miles of highway, 307 bridges, 1,007 buildings, as well as destroy - ing crops on 55,000 acres of land and damaging much property. The immediate repair and reconstruction necessary on State and Federal highways in the Republican valley affected the program over the entire State, due to an immediate expenditure of about ¥750,000.00 of State funds for repairing and rebuilding damaged roads and bridges. In addition, the Federal Government provided $276,000.00 for the first time in this State from Emergency Relief funds for bridge con - struction to be matched by a like amount of State funds. The 1935 Legislature revised the State Highway System by es - tablishing a fourth bracket of highways up to legislature highway No. 292, making a grand total of 11,142 miles, of which 8245 were marked and maintained as of November 1, 1936, which left 2897 miles not maintained. In conclusion, it should be pointed out that the Nebraska State highway system has always been operated on a "pay as you go" basis. All work done has been paid for and there are no outstanding obli - gations. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER NEBRASKA STATE HIGHWAY MILEAGE The following description gives the status of the mileage of the Nebraska State Highwaj^System estimated as of October. 31, 1936. The total mileage of State and Federal highways when completed equals approximately 11,1^2 miles. The origin of the 11,142 miles on the Nebraska State Highway System is as follows: From the State system established by the 1919 Legislature, of which 5,630 miles are now on the Federal-aid system; and also 571 miles on the old State system which became State highways as pro - vided by law between 1919 and 1923 by having been built with State and Federal funds prior to establishment of the Federal 7% system in 1923 6,201 miles Statutory highways number 10 to 163 inclusive and not included in the above 6,201 miles, ap - proximately 2,401 miles Statutory highways number 164 to 214 inclusive, approximately 1,181 miles Statutory highways number 215 to 292 inclusive, approximately 1,359 miles Approximate total 11,142 miles The 1935 Legislature amended the then existing laws, which designated the roads under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads and Irrigation, to provide for changes in and additions to the State Highway System. This legislation set up four brackets of statutory highways and provided for the sequence in which they were to become parts of the highway system. At the time when the work now under contract is completed the status of the marked and maintained Nebraska State Highway System will be approximately as follows: Paved roads 2,059 miles Gravel roads 5,899 miles Graded without surfacing 414 miles Total marked and maintained, approximately 8,372 miles Mileage designated for the State system but not yet maintained, approximately.. 2,770 miles.

The totals shown in this table are not the same as those given in the preceding paragraph which in - clude some mileages improved by counties and municipalities, and some natural gravel roads that did not require construction. FEDERAL FEEDER ROADS During this biennium an additional number of roads known as "Federal Feeder Roads" were constructed in various parts of the state with Federal Funds. An Act of the 1935 Legislature (HR35) makes it, "the duty of the Department of Roads and Irrigation to maintain the whole of the State Highway System, and any additional highways built in whole or in part with federal funds appropriated for highway purposes which are constructed under the exclusive direc - tion of the State Department of Roads and Irrigation including bridges thereon".

I REPORTS OF THE DISTRICT ENGINEERS i The map on the adjoining page shows the district limits and headquarters of the eight district engineers. As in the past few years, permanent district headquarters have been maintained at Lincoln, Norfolk, Grand Island, Bridgeport, McCook, North Platte and Ains - worth. The duties and activities of the district engineers have increased during this biennium due to additional requirements in connection with an increased number of projects and an increase in mileage under maintenance. Extreme climatic changes and floods in 'the last bien - nium in various parts of the State have made special requirements on regular employees and special and favorable comment is due them for the results accomplished. Following is a brief description of the activities in each district in the past two years. DISTRICT 3JO. 1 This district is composed of twelve counties located in the south - east corner of the State. C. W. Eubank was District Engineer for the first six months of 1935, and was succeeded on July 1, 1935, by R. F. Weller. Headquarters for the district are in Lincoln. Under normal weather conditions, the soil in this district Is favor - able for good roads. During this biennium, however, unusually dry weather has prevailed, which has made the maintenance of graveled roads very difficult. The lack of moisture causes the gravel mat, which normally, acts as an all-weather surfacing, to ravel and then become soft and slippery when rains finally come. When the pre - cipiation again reaches normal and the percentage of moisture in the soil increases, it will be possible to again build up the gravel mats. Reference to the severe conditions experienced during the winter of 1935-1936 is made in the report of the Division of Maintenance. Important new construction in the district, during the biennium, is summarized in the following paragraphs. Fillmoro County. The most important construction in this county was the pavement on Highway No. 6, from Exeter west to the county line, which completed the paving between Omaha and Hastings. High - way No. 41 was paved through Milligan. Highway No. 81 was re - located at Fairmont, in order to make a direct connection with High - way No. 6. Thayer County. Bituminous mat surfacing was constructed on I </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER Highway No. 81, from Chester north five miles. Four miles of graveled road were built from Highway No. 3 toward Alexandria. At the present time a relocation of Highway No. 81, between Stoddard and Hebron, Is under construction. Jefferson County. With the exception of a graveled road from Dlller north to connect with Highway No. 3, most of the improve - ments in this county were on Highway No. 3. West of Fairbury, a grade crossing was eliminated by a viaduct, and overflow pavement was eliminated by the construction of bridges and the necessary ap - proaches. East of Fairbury, the highway was relocated all the way to the county line, and a viaduct was built at Jansen over the main line of the Rock Island. This Highway Was Kept Clear of Snow by Snow Fence on the Right Saline County. On Highway No. 33, concrete pavement was con - structed in Dorchester, with a graveled connection to Highway No. 6. West of Dorchester, on Highway No. 6, a viaduct has been completed over the main line of the Burlington Railroad. Highway Xo. 82. between Wilber and Crete, has been reconstructed preparatory to sur - facing. Gage County. The dangerous "X" overhead crossing over the Burlington tracks at the south edge of Beatrice, on Highway No. 77. has been eliminated by the construction of a new viaduct, which has been connected to the city pavement by new concrete pavement. Seven and one-half miles of bituminous mat surfacing were built south of Beatrice on Highway No. 77. Highway No. 3 was partially relocated and entirely rebuilt from Beatrice west to the county line, joining the relocated road in Jefferson county. Lancaster County. A new viaduct was constructed on Holdrege Street In Lincoln, over the Rock Island tracks, replacing an old wooden structure. Two sections of stabilized gravel mat, treated with calcium chloride, were constructed as experimental low-cost dust-proof roads </seg>
            <seg id="p035">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION I in the following locations: One mile at Woodlawn, on Highway No. 2; and one mile north of Bennet on Highway No. 42. There was also constructed on. Highway No. 77, north of Havelock, one mile of ex - perimental bituminous mat surfacing, using coal tar as a binder. Bids have been received on the following projects in and near Lincoln: the grading of North 48th Street, between Holdrege and "O" Streets; the relocation of Highway No. 6 around Havelock, in - cluding a viaduct over the main line of the Burlington; the extension of Cotner Boulevard around the east side of Havelock to make a new connection with Highway No. 6; and the construction of a cut-off on Highway No. 6 from North 10th Street to "O" Street, which includes a viaduct over the Burlington and Union Pacific tracks. Con - struction has not yet been started on any of these projects. Cass County. The only construction in this county of any great importance, during this biennium, was the extension of the concrete pavement east from Elmwood for four miles, which leaves only ten miles unpaved, on Highway No. 34, between Seward and Union. Otoe County. The bituminous mat surfacing on Highway No. 2 was extended from Palmyra to Syracuse. Also, Highway No. 2 was regraded and graveled between Dunbar and Nebraska City. A new graveled road was constructed from Talmage to Dunbar. A viaduct over the Missouri Pacific and Burlington tracks in Nebraska City, on Highway No. 75, is under construction at the present time. Johnson County. A graveled road has been constructed to con - nect Elk Creek with Highway No. 50. Kemaha County. The following graveled roads have been con - structed iduring the past biennium: from Brock east to connect with Highway No. 75, from Johnson south for a distance of eight miles, and from Nemaha south to connect with Highway No. 73. Richardson County. On Highway No. 4, concrete pavement has been constructed from the junction with No. 73, east of Verdon, to the junction with No. 75, north of Dawson. A viaduct was built over the Missouri Pacific, at Verdon. Pavement was also built from Daw - son north on Highway No. 75 to the junction with Highway No. 4, east of Humboldt, connecting with the pavement on No. 4, which runs east to Verdon. Graveled roads were constructed from Stella west to Highway No. 75 and from Shubert north to the county line. Also Humboldt was connected with Highway No. 4 with a bituminous mat road. Pawnee County. Highway No. 65 was completed and graveled from Table Rock west to where it joins Highway No. 4, north ol </seg>

The work west of Lincoln included a pedestrian sidewalk paralleling the highway. DISTRICT SO. 2 The district is comprised of eleven counties in the center of the east third of the State. Edwin Olmstead, Lincoln, has been District Engineer for about nine years with headquarters in Lincoln. Major construction projects undertaken during the past biennium consist of the following: The relocation and grading of the S.Y.A., from a point north of York to the Hamilton County line. This eliminates two bad grade crossings and shortens the distance for U. S. Highway No. 34 and Highway No. 2 about a mile. The completion of Highway No. 8 with a paved surface from Scrlbner to West Point. This closes up the gap on No. 8 except for a half mile section at Crowell, which is to be improved by a grade separation when funds are available. The construction of a viaduct at Waterloo, which eliminates a very hazardous grade crossing of the double-track Union Pacific main line and Highway No. 30-S. Starting the construction of a viaduct over the Chicago and North Western Railroad yards southeast of Fremont. This will eliminate all rail crossing hazards on Highway No. 30-S between Fremont and Omaha. The paving of Highway No. 30 between the Blair Bridge and a point east of Kennard and between Arlington and Fremont. This completes the paving of all the Lincoln Highway in Nebraska ex - cept ten miles between Arlington and Kennard. A viaduct on Highway No. 77 over the yards of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago and North Western, and the Union Pacific Railroads in Fremont has been started. After the devastating drought of 1934, climatic conditions dur - ing the year 1935 returned to near normal through this part of the state. However, the year of 1936 has been one of the most unique on record. Starting about the middle of January, this district waged a </seg>
            <seg id="p037">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION continuous snow-removal fight until the first of March. Storms fol - lowed each other in such rapid succession that it was impossible to keep highways open for more than a few hours at a time. To make the work more gruelling the temperature ranged far below zero most of the time. Too much credit cannot be given to the men operating the snow-fighting units and the mechanics who kept them in repair. These men, without a word of complaint, worked for days without proper food, with little sleep, and suffering in many cases from frost bite and carbon monoxide poisoning. On March 1, Salt Creek' broke up and the ice destroyed one bent of the bridge on the Lincoln-Omaha road, about two miles east of ~\UU At • View from First Bridge East of Platte Hirer on Highway No. 6, • Mar.

On March 2, No. 77 to Fremont was closed on account of high water in the Platte River. On March 3, the Loup River washed out the grade and a small bridge south of Genoa and No. 81 was under water from Shell Creek south of Platte Center. On March 4, the Platte River broke up taking out a section of dyke north of Venice, permitting the river to flow down an old channel and to wash out about GOO feet of pavement on Highway No. 16; at the same time, water from the Platte and Elkhorn Rivers over - flowed the bottoms west of Gretna and washed out approach fills to bridges in the bottoms.

Sunday, March 8, saw No. 75 and No. 73 closed by a washout at Oreapolis. This road was opened Tuesday March 10, and No. 6 was opened the day following. By March 15, all roads and bridges, except the Valley Bridge were open for traffic. This flood of the Loup, Platte, and Elkhorn Rivers was the worst on record, with the possible exception of a flood in 1912. After the abundance of moisture during the winter and spring o'f 1936, the weather turned dry and the country suffered a near repetition of the 1934 drought. The absence of high winds made surface maintenance easier than in 1934. The season was not at all favorable to roadside beautification work and the loss of trees and shrubs has been very high in spite of constant watering. Grasshoppers were also a serious problem to contend with in maintaining roadside plantings. The following is a brief resume of construction work done during the past biennium in each county: Butler County. Five miles of concrete pavement were laid in this county on Highway No. 16. Of this, one and one-half miles were built by direct labor under State supervision as a check project on costs and methods involved in this class of work. In addition the David City-Seward road has been brought to modern standards for a proposed bituminous surfacing project. This work involved lengthening practically all culverts, widening three bridges and regrading the entire road. Colfax County. Concrete pavement was laid through Schuyler on Highway No. 15 from the Lincoln Highway on to the north city limits. Dodge County. The work done in this county includes com - pletion of the pavement between Fremont and West Point on High - way No. 8 ; construction of a viaduct over the Chicago and North Western Railroad south of Winslow on Highway No. 77; paving from Fremont to Arlington on No. 30; construction of a temporary bridge and widening of two other bridges on the relocation of No. 77 be - tween Winslow and Uehling; beginning the construction of two viaducts in Fremont, one on Highway No. 30-S over the Chicago and North Western Railroad yards and one one Highway No. 77 over the Chicago, Burlington and Qulncy, Chicago and North Western, and Union Pacific Railroad yards.

DISTRICT &gt;'O 3 This district is composed of thirteen counties in the northeast corner of the State. J. B. Martin has been District Engineer for. six and one-half years, with headquarters at Norfolk. Construction work during this biennium has been general through - out the district, however, by extension of projects, highways have been improved through the district. For example, Highway No. 20 from Waterbury west to Plainview and Highway No. 8 from the county line south of West Point to Neligh. Because of the construc - tion work on Highway No. 8, six railroad grade crossings were elim - inated and the route shortened. Weather conditions during the 1935-1936 biennium have been adverse for maintenance. Drought existed during the summer months and the winter of 1935-1936 was the worst experienced during the past fifteen years. In the early part of June 1935, a flood occurred </seg>

On Friday evening, February 7, 1936, a severe snow storm struck northeast Nebraska, accompanied by a strong northwest wind and sub-zero temperatures. Highways were drifted shut, autoists were stranded, farms and towns were snow - bound, and trains could not move. Business was paralyzed. Many communities were without daily papers for many days and kept In touch with the outside world by radio. Before the territory recovered from the first storm, another descended on Thursday evening, February 13, and there was additional snow on Friday evening, February 14, Saturday evening, February 15, aifd Sunday evening, February 16. • The blizzard was the climax of a period of thirty-eight, days, from January 15 to February 21, with an average temperature of eight below zero, accompanied by forty inches of snow. One night the tem - perature [dropped to thirty below and there were three nights of twenty-five below. Only three nights of the period saw a tempera - ture of zero or above. Snow removal operations were almost impos - sible, due to the extremely low temperatures and strong winds. Con - tinuous snow fighting was in progress until February 28, 1936. Antolope County.

DISTKICT NO. 4 District No. 4 is comprised of the following twelve counties lo - cated in the east half of the south-central part of Nebraska: Adams, Clay, Greeley, Hall, Hamilton, Howard, Merrick, Nance, Nuckolls, Sherman, "Valley and Webster. The area includes 6551 square miles with a total population of 158,415. A. W. Bohner is District Engineer with headquarters at Grand Island. The State and Federal .highways under State maintenance in this district equal approximately 1010 miles on which there have been many improvements in the past two years. There was an increase of 35 miles of concrete paving, 3 miles of bituminous surfacing, and 50 miles of gravel surfacing over the type of construction two years ago. The total mileage now consists of 145 miles of paving, 26 miles of bituminous surfacing, and 817 miles of gravel surfacing. Seventy-one miles of new road have been added, consisting chiefly of feeder roads. The most extensive construction work has been in the relocation and rebuilding of existing main highways to improve alignment and grades. to eliminate grade crossings, and to shorten distances. . Maintenance conditions, during the biennium, have been ab - normal due to the fact that this district, in common with other dis - tricts, suffered the effects of unusual weather conditions. In the spring of 1935 the Republican River, flowing through the south part of Webster and Nuckolls counties, reached the highest flood level in history, flooding highways and washing out many bridges including the State and Federal bridges at Red Cloud and Guide Rock. In the winter of 1935-1936 heavy snow, with high wind, blocked the high - ways and necessitated more maintenance activities than were ever before experienced in the district. In the summer of 1936, the drought caused the maintenance of earth and gravel roads to be very difficult. It was found necessary to haul many thousands of gallons of water to some of the main traveled highways to keep the surface com - pacted. Some of the newly completed graded roads were closed to traffic for a considerable time until sufficient moisture was received to compact the surface. Adams County. This county located in the south-central part of Nebraska with Hastings as the county seat, has an area of 565 square miles and a population of 26,275. The main highways are Xo. 6, No. 74 and No. 281. Other highways under State maintenance are Highway No. 6 connection to Juniata, Highway No. 6 City Route </seg>

Dur - ing the biennium, the most extensive improvement to the highways in this county has been the relocation of Highway No. 281 through the city of Hustings, which included the construction of 0.8 miles of pavement and a structure over the St. Joseph and Grand Island railroad tracks on Kansas Avenue. This relocation has greatly im - proved the route of Highway No. 281 through Hastings, and has eliminated a dangerous crossing on Kansas Avenue, w^iich had been a great inconvenience to traffic, as it was often blocked during switch - ing operations' of the St. Joseph and Grand Island railroad. Another important improvement in the county was the construction of the new grade, bridges and culverts on : the unpaved 7 miles of Highway No. 6 at the west end of the county. i !. ■ . ■.■.'■ - - Clay County. This county with an area of 579 square miles and a population of 13,571, is located in the south-central part of Ne - braska. Clay Center is the county seat. It is served by Highways No. 6, No. 74, No. 14, No. 41 and No. 5. During the biennium, all of Highway No. 6 has been paved across this county. This improve - ment includes new grading, bridges, culverts and concrete pavement for a distance of 25.3 miles, over a new location for a distance of 16.5 miles. The new location eliminated a dangerous grade crossing with the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railroad main line in Sutton, and also, a hazardous alignment at the subway east of Harvard. One - half mile of Highway No. 14 was paved through Clay Center with a new pedestrian subway crossing for school children. Construction of 8 miles of regrading on old Highway No. 6 through Harvard was started late in 1 1936. This is preliminary to the construction of sta - bilized base and 2-inch bituminous mat. Greeley County. This county with an area of 571 square miles and a population of 8,442, is located in the central part of Nebraska. Greeley Center is the county seat.

At the present time this mileage is made up of 28 miles of oiled sand and 262 miles of oiled gravel. The last gap in the Xincoln Highway was hard surfaced late in 1935 and it became the first paved and oiled road completed across the United States. In 1936 projects were com - pleted to make a continuous oiled and paved road from Antioch through Alliance, Minatare, Scottsbluff, Mitchell and Morrill to the State Line near Henry, a distance of 94 miles. With the exception of a two mile project at Whitney and a short section in Crawford, Highway No. 20 is oiled and paved from Hay Springs to a point six miles west to Crawford, a distance of 50 miles. Grade separation projects have reduced mileage and increased safety in several counties in this district during the past two years. Viaducts were constructed in Chappell, in Crawford, one-half mile east of Alliance, and two miles northwest of Bridgeport. A subway will be built in the west part of Alliance during the winter of 1936 and 1937. A relocation was made southeast of Sidney to eliminate a railroad crossing near the Burlington depot in Sidney. Traffic on Highways Nos. 30 and 19 may proceed through and near Sidney with - out passing over a railroad grade crossing. The past two years have presented many maintenance problems on account of weather extremes. In the spring of 1935 we received almost the total annual average precipitation during the months of April, May and June and since that time the total precipitation has been less than fifty per cent of normal. With the exception of the extreme northern part of the district the snow fall was very light dur - ing. the winter of 1935 and 1936 and very little snow removal was necessary. The summer of 1936 was the hottest and driest ever recorded and the traffic on highways was heavy. As a result the maintenance of earth and graveled roads became a very difficult undertaking. Summaries of conditions during the past two years, and highways in the various counties of the district are given below: Banner County. This county, in the dry farming area; has raised light crops in the past two years on account of lack of moisture. The soil conditions are such that many fields will be subject to consider - able wind erosion during the coming winter on account of lack of vegetation and the removal of crops leaving no protection from the wind. There are no cities or villages in Banner county except Harris - burg, the county seat, and as a result the population is almost wholly made up of farmers and ranchers. The county has no railroads, and farm products, livestock, etc., are hauled to Kimball, Scottsbluff and Gering. The principal highway, No. 29, is a graveled road running </seg>

Box Jiutte County. This county has no irrigation and must de - pend on natural precipitation for its moisture. Experimental wells are being drilled at several points in order to determine the feasibility of pump irrigation when the normal precipitation fails. Crops have been poor in Box Butte county during the past two years, production being lower in 1936 than in 1935. This county usually excells all others of the State in the production of potatoes, but the 1936 drought caused a complete failure of this crop. Winter wheat, ordinarily a good crop, is very light this year and practically no corn was raised. The people of Box Butte county are farmers and ranchers, with the exception of those living in the towns of Alliance and Hemlngford.

Highway No. 19 runs north and south through the county, and is graveled with the exception of the section south of Alliance. Alliance is an important town, being the second city in District 5 in population and the division headquar - ters for the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad. Cheyenne County. This county has a small irrigated area along Lodgepole creek watered partly from the running stream and partly from wells. The natural precipitation was greater during the past two years than in most of the adjacent counties, and crops were fair. Hay is the principal crop in the Lodgepole creek valley, particularly on the low ground. In 1936, the winter wheat was the best crop produced. Some corn was raised although many fields were injured by hail and drought. Late fall rains in 1936 came in time to make the planting of winter wheat possible. </seg>

Dawes County. This county is in the dry farming area with the exception of the Whitney Irrigation District, which consists of ap - proximately twelve thousand acres. The irrigable area raises alfalfa and sugar beets and on the dry land the principal crops are wheat, corn, and potatoes. Dawes county has suffered during the past two years from a severe drought as well as a plague of grasshoppers. A few isolated spots raised good crops of winter wheat in 1936. Corn, potatoes and feed crops are very poor this year. Late* fall rains have materially aided the dry parts and some pasture growth is noticed at this late date. Highway No 20 running east and west through Dawes county is paved and oiled with the exception of one mile in Crawford and two miles near Whitney. This transcontinental route carries heavy traffic particularly in the summer months. Highway No. 19 running north and south is oiled for a distance of eight miles south of Chadron, the remaining portion being graveled. Highway No. 2 is a graveled road traversing the southwest part of Dawes county, and in conjunction with No. 19 carries almost all of the traffic from western Nebraska to the Black Hills. Chadron, the county seat and principal city, is located on Highways Nos. 19 and 20. Crawford, a thriving city in the southwest part of Dawes county, is at the crossing of Highways Nos. 2 and 20. The only other town in the county is Wayside, on Highway No. 19, in the north part. Denel County. This county, the smallest in the district, has no irrigated land except small private projects along Lodgepole Creek. In common with Cheyenne county it has probably received more mois - ture than adjacent counties. Crops were fair in 1935 but poor in 1936, although some winter wheat was raised. Small grain and corn crops were very light in 1936. ■ Highway No. 30 with a paved or oiled surface from the east to the west county line, divides the county about midway. Highway No. 138 connects the Lincoln highway with Julesburg, by way of Big Springs. Highway No. 27 running southeast from Chappell to the State Line connects with Colorado Highway No. 51. northwest of Jules - burg. This highway is combined with No. 30 from Chappell to a point </seg>

Chappell is the county seat and principal city and Big Springs is the only other town in Deuel county. ■ Garden County. This county is divided into three district areas— the irrigable land in the North Platte valley, the table land in the south part of the county, and the sand hills in the north two-thirds. Conditions during the past two years have been about the same as in other counties of western Nebraska. Crops have been very poor in the farming district but pasture and hay in the sand hill area have been about normal. Garden county has but two highways, Nos. 26 and 27 both of which are graveled. Highway No. 26 parallels the North Platte river in a northwesterly and southeasterly direction. Highway No. 27 has been: constructed from the approximate mid-point of the south county line to a point approximately four miles north of Oshkosh. Oshkosh is the county seat and principal city and Lewellen and Lisco are the only other towns. Kimball Count}-. This county has a strip of irrigated land lying on both sides of Lodgepole Creek in the center of the county, the remaining part being dry farm land. Crops in the irrigated area have been- good during the past two years, but in the remaining part of the county they have been very poor. Kimball, as well as Cheyenne and Deuel counties, has a large crop of winter wheat under normal condi - tions, but a deficiency of moisture over the past twenty-four month period has materially reduced this crop. Kimball county has two highways, Nos. 30 and 29 which divide it into four almost equal parts. Highway No. 30, crossing the county from east to west has paved or oiled surface the entire distance. High - way No. 29 from the north county line to a point ten miles south of Kimball is a graveled road. Kimball, the county seat, is the prin - cipal city and it is located at the intersection of Highways Nos. 30 and 29. Other towns in Kimball county are Bushnell in the western part and Dix near the east edge. Morrill County. This county, in common with Garden county, has three distinct areas, the table land in the south part, the irrigated section in the North Platte and Pumpkin Creek valleys, and the sand hill region which occupies approximately one-half of the county lying to the north and east of the North Platte river. Crops in the irrl - sated section have been fair to good during the past two years, with the non-irrigated areas raising very little. In the sand hills, pastures and hay crops have been about normal. ' The principal crops are sugar beets, alfalfa, potatoes, and grain. A sugar factory is located at Bayard. The precipitation, as recorded in the office of the Bureau of Irrigation </seg>
            <seg id="p054">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER at Bridgeport, shows a total of 7.04 inches in the 14 month period from August 1, 1936 to October 1, 1936. Mori-Ill county probably holds the record, in the district, for limited precipitation for the period mentioned. Morrill county has numerous highways, the principal ones being Noa. 26 and 19. Highway No. 2 6 is oiled from Bayard north and west to the county line and for a distance of approximately four and one-half miles southeast of Bridgeport. Highway No. 19 is oiled from a point ten miles northwest of Bridgeport to the north county line near Alliance; the remainder being a graveled road, with the exception of eight miles southeast of Bridgeport which is oiled and part of which is on No. 26. Highway No. 26N is oiled from a point ten miles north - west of Bridgeport to the Junction with No. 26, four miles north of Bayard. Highway No. 88 forms a connection with No. 29 near Har - rison, in Banner county, by way of Redington. Bridgeport, the county seat, Is located slightly west of the center of Morrill county. Other towns on Highways in Morrill county are Bayard, Broadwater, and Angora. Scotts Bluff County. This county has the largest acreage of ir - rigated land of any county in the district, if not In the State. The irrigated area is confined entirely to the North Platte valley, the re - maining part being a dry farming area with some rough hills and timber land. The principal crops are sugar beets, alfalfa, potatoes. and grain. Scotts Bluff county had excellent crops during the past two yearB in the irrigated section, but the yields have been very light in the dry farming area. Scotts Bluff county has five sugar factories which are located at Scottsbluff, Gering, Mitchell, Minatare, and Lyman. Approximately 65,000 acres of sugar beets are planted annually in the territory tributary to the six sugar factories in Scotts Bluff and Morrill counties. The principal highways of Scotts Bluff county are Nos. 26, 29 and 86. Highway No. 26 bisects the county from north - west to southeast running through or near the towns of Scottsbluff, Minatare, Mitchell, Morrill, and Henry. This highway is paved or oiled throughout the county. Highway No. 29 runs north and south through the center of the county and is combined with No. 26 from Mitchell to Scottsbluff and, with the exception of this section, is a graveled road. Highway No. 86 runs from northwest to southeast diagonally through Scotts Bluff county by way of Lyman, Haig, Gering, Melbeta, and McGrew. Highway No. 86 Is on or near the historic Oregon Trail and Is known locally as the Oregon Trail Highway. High - way No. 86 is a graveled road. Scottsbluff, the principal city, is located on the north side of the North Platte river, almost in the center of the county, and Gering, the county seat, is located across the river, two miles south of </seg>

Sheridan County. This county is divided into three areas — the rough timber land in the northern part, the, table land farming district in the north central part, and the sand hill region which makes up approximately two-thirds of- the total area. Sheridan county has suf - fered severely from drought and grasshoppers during the past two years, although the sand hills have raised about normal crops of hay and pasture. There are no irrigated lands and therefore the farm - ing area must depend on natural precipitation for moisture. Crops have been fair in 1935 and poor in 1936. This county, as well as Dawes and Sioux counties, has probably experienced worse conditions on account of drought and grasshoppers than other counties of the district. The principal highway is No. 20. which runs through the north part of the county from east to west by way of Gordon, Clinton, Rush - ville, and Hay Springs. Highway No. 20 is oiled from a point near Hay Springs to the west county line and from Gordon to Clinton, the remainder being a graveled road. Highway No. 2 crosses Sheridan county near the south county line. This highway is oiled throughout the county with the exception of the part between Antioch and a point two miles east of Lakeside. Highway No. 87, beginning at White Clay, runs through Rushville and is combined with Highway No. 20 between Rushville and Hay Springs, then runs south from Hay Springs paralleling the west county line for a distance of ap - proximately twenty-seven miles, connecting with Highway No. 19 in Box Butte county sixteen miles north of Alliance. Highway No. 27 runs from Gordon north to the State Line and south to the Niobrara river. All unoiled portions of highways in Sheridan county are graveled roads. Rushville, the county seat, is located in the north central part of the county on the Chicago, and North Western Rail - road. Gordon, in the northeast corner, and Hay Springs, near the west county line on No. 20, are both ; thriving cities. The other towns are Antioch, Lakeside, Ellsworth, and Bingham which are all located near the south county line on Highway No. 2. Sioux County. This county lies in the northwest part of the dis - trict and has a small area of irrigated land in the extreme southwest corner, tributary to the North Platte valley. The remainder of Slouz county consists of dry farming areas and ranches, although there is considerable timber land in the northern part. Ranching and dry farming are the principal occupations. Exclusive of the irrigated area, crops have been very poor for the past two years on account of drought and grasshoppers. The principal highways are Nos. 20 and 29. Highway No. 20, </seg>
            <seg id="p056">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER crossing the northern part, is an oiled road from a point near Harrison to the west State Line and for a short distance in the east part of the county near Crawford, the remainder being a graveled road. High - way No. 29 crosses the county from Harrison south towards Mitchell and this highway is an earth road. Highway No. 2 runs through the extreme northeast portion and is a graveled road. Harrison, the county seat and the only town, is located in the northwest part of the county, on the Chicago and North Western Railroad. DISTRICT IfO. 6 This district is composed of the thirteen counties south of the Platte River in the southwestern corner of the State. F. C. Smith has been District Engineer for ten years with headquarters at McCook. The Republican River, which is formed by the confluence of the north and south fork of the Republican and the Arickaree In Dundy county, and the Frenchman River are the principal streams in the territory. They flow in an easterly direction and are fed by numerous creeks and dry canyons on each side. The Platte River skirts the district on the north, but only the runoff from a part of the north tier of counties goes into this stream. The two principal highways in this district are Highway No. 6 and Highway No. 3, both of which traverse the district from the east boundary to the Nebraska-Colorado State Line on the west. These highways converge at Oxford and are one until the junction west of Culbertson is reached, where they separate, crossing the State Line thirty-six miles apart. During the early spring of 1935 this part of the State was visited by unusually severe dust storms. Loose earth whipped by the wind from fields, made dry and bare by a year of unprecedented drought and augmented by red dust from States to the south, filled the air to such an extent that, on several occasions, it was dark and street lights were lighted in midafternoon. These storms made highway travel dangerous due to lack of vision and many automobile motors were ruined by the sharp dust particles drawn in through the carburetors. Considerable damage was done to highways by dust drifting in the road and filling the road ditches. Great difficulty was experienced in taking down snow fence, in the eastern half of the district, due to dust drifts being formed by the fences, sometimes burying them. Early in May, 1935, this dry dusty condition was broken by soaking rains. On May 20, 1936, streams reached flood stage and considerable damage was done to approach grades and weak bridges. While this was a flood condition which would have been considered </seg>
            <seg id="p057">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION important in normal years, it was dwarfed by the condition which oc - curred a few days later. • On May 31, 1935, the most destructive flood in the history of this region roared down the Republican Valley, inundating the fer - tile farm lands to an extent previously thought impossible, and carry - ing death and destruction in its path. The flood water, averaging a mile wide and churned into foaming waves, was black with floating debris carried down by the quickly swollen creeks. Houses and barns, floated by, like boats, only to be dashed to pieces against the remains of a bridge or a large tree not yet uprooted. Whole herds of cattle with small calves bawling piteously, horses, and bogs swam by in the muddy waters and the carcasses of many animals unable to longer swim floated on the surface. Farmers and their families, hesitating to leave their homes, were trapped when the rushing water, rising to unheard of heights, cut off their escape. Others farther east in the neighborhood of Oxford, where the flood struck later, were caught in their sleep and awakened by the jar of their houses leaving the foundations to float down the stream. .■■..■■;• ■ .. ■ There were many miraculous escapes and heroic rescues. As the waters receded persons were taken from trees where they had clung for 24 hours fighting desperately against sleep, and suffering from exposure. Planes roared up and down the valley locating marooned persons so that boats could go to the rescue. As the waters receded the transportation and communication facil - ities of the region, as well as many public utilities, were found to be in a sorry plight. Not only was every bridge on the river washed out or badly damaged, but Highways Nos. 6 and 3, paralleling the river, were blocked by washouts and debris. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railroad was damaged by the loss of miles of track and numerous bridges, and all telephone and telegraph lines in the valley - were so badly damaged that these forms of communication were para - lyzed. In s,ome towns light and water plants were put out of com - mission. A clearer idea of the havoc wrought may be gained from the fol - lowing statistics, which were published a year later: Ninety-four persons drowned (approximately 30 of these bodies have not been recovered). Three dead from the tornado. Damage approximating $2,000,000.00 done to property of the Burlington railroad. Other property damage totalling approximately $8,000,000.00. Three hundred forty-one miles of highways damaged. One thousand seven buildings lost. </seg>

Forty-six thousand five hundred seven chickens lost. J ■ ■ ■, In bringing order out of chaos, the highways of the region played an important part. Detours were established around washouts and temporary bridge repairs were made so that mail and supplies could move by truck. Materials and men were trucked in to start repair work on the railroad and telephone lines. Trucks brought C. C. C. men to hunt bodies, bury cattle, and perform other emergency sanitation work. ' Through railroad service was not resumed on the main line until June 24th, and on branch lines, service was not resumed until much later. The following months were devoted to work of an emergency re - pair nature. Temporary timber bridges were constructed, debris was cleared up, obstructed sections of highways were opened, and necessary detours were graveled. Several permanent structures were built, and a great deal of grade, bituminous mat, and concrete pavement repair and replacement was done during this period by maintenance forces. While surveys were started as soon as the water receded, it was fall before any contracts were let and the permanent replacement pro - jects carried well into 1936. However, with few exceptions, traffic on all highways of the devastated region moved with comparative facility after the first few weeks. The Republican River and its tributaries were again at flbod stage on June 17, 1935, and August 25, 1935, damaging work already re - paired. However, these floods only slightly retarded the restoration work. The restoration of county roads was greatly aided by an appro - priation of $150,000 of FERA funds, which was secured by Governor Cochran while on a special trip to Washington in behalf of the area. This was administered locally under the guidance of the Department of Roads and Irrigation, and used for materials and labor to build county bridges and protect bridge sites with revetment worki The year of 1936 saw the completion of a large restoration pro - gram of bridges and approach grades. In some instances, entire pro - jects were relocated to take advantage of higher ground and better stream crossings': There was also a comprehensive program of regular construction projects, widely distributed over the district. jThe win - ter was dry, followed by a dry summer, making gravel maintenance </seg>

Considerable excitement prevailed, as the flood of a year before was still fresh in the minds of the valley residents. As this rise was caused by excessive rains in Colorado with none in Nebraska, the force of the water was lost as it reached the east half of the district. Chase County. Being near the headwaters of the Frenchman River and its tributaries, Chase county suffered little flood damage, and maintenance conditions during the past two years have been normal. Considerable improvement .has been made on Highway No. 6, as follows: One mile of concrete pavement In Imperial. Bituminous mat pavement between Imperial and Wauneta and between Wauneta and Hamlet. The construction of a relocation through Wauneta. Regrading, preparatory to hard surfacing, is now in progress between Imperial and Lamar. Oiuuly County. Dundy county suffered heavy losses during the flood, and as a result maintenance conditions were very difficult dur - ing 1935. Replacement bridges were constructed at Parks and Haigler, a relocation also being made at the latter place. Over a mile of Highway No. 3 east of Benkelman was constructed on a relocation to get away from the river which washed deeply into the old location at this point. Franklin County. Flood damage was severe in this county. The river bridge on Highway No. 10 was badly damaged and a temporary bridge was constructed to carry traffic during the restoration and extension of the concrete and steel span and approach grades. Con - crete pavement was built on Highways Nos. 10 and 3 in Franklin dur - ing 1935. Dust drifting was severe In this county in the early part of 1935. Frontier County. .Being located in rugged topography, the high - ways In Frontier county were seriously damaged in 1935, by the water of streams tributary to the Republican. Besides numerous smaller washouts, bridges were destroyed west of Moprefield and across Medi - cine Creek, east of Stockville. These have both been replaced by permanent structures of larger capacity. Grading is in progress be - tween Curtis and Moorefield, preparatory to gravel. Maintenance con - ditions have been normal during 1936. Furnas County. Furnas county was affected by the flood waters of both the Republican River and Medicine Creek. The town of Cambridge was badly damaged, when water covered almost half of the village. The river crossings at Arapahoe and Oxford were com - pletely destroyed.

Highway No. 6 from Holbrook to Arapahoe has been regraded, and new bridges built, and the same highway between Arapahoe and Edison is being reconstructed onj a new location. Be - tween Edison and Oxford, bituminous pavement has been !completed. Concrete pavement was built on No. 6 through Cambridge and Arapa - hoe in 1935. No. 21, from Arapahoe north to the county line and from the junction of No. 21 and No. 89 south to the Kansas State Line has been graded and graveled, making this highway complete across the county. Gosper County. The State highways of this county escaped seri - ous damage in the 1935 flood. New construction Included the grading and graveling of No. 21 from the junction of No. 23S and No. 21 south to the county line, which completed the graveling of the State highways in this county. Maintenance conditions have been normal during the bienium. Harlun County. The highways of Harlan county suffered heavily in the flood of 1935. The bridges and highway across the river bot - tom west of Orleans on No. 89 were completely! destroyed.. 1 The' river bridge at Alma and the concrete pavement across the river bottom were damaged, but these were repaired quickly. At Orleans on No. 89 new permanent bridges and grades have been constructed on a relocation. On Highway No. 83 north of Alma, fourteen miles of bituminous mat pavement have been completed. Dust drifting was severe in this county in 1935. Hayes County. Hayes county also felt the force of the flood waters in tributary streams, the chief washouts being two bridges on Highways Nos. 25 and 17. Both were replaced with i permanent structures. Between Hamlet and the Chase county line,; a distance of six miles on No. 6, a bituminous mat has been placed. , Regrading is being done on No. 6 between Palisade and Hamlet, preparatory to hard surface.

Kearney County. Being located on the flat table land, Kearnej county was not affected by the flood of 1935. Improvements for the past two years consist of concrete paving on No. 10 in Minden, the relocating, grading, and graveling, preparatory to hard surface, on No. 6 between the Phelps county line and Axtell, and from Minden to the Adams county line. An overpass over the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railroad was constructed at Heartwell. With the exception of dust drifting in 1935, maintenance conditions have been normal. Phelps County. Maintenance conditions were normal in Phelps county during the biennium. New construction for the biennium consisted of concrete pavement on No. 83 in Holdrege, and regrading and gravel preparatory to hard surface on No. 6 between Funk and the Kearney county line. Perkins County. Perkins county was not damaged by the flood, having no streams of any consequence in the county. On No. 17, between Elsie and Grainton, the highway was graded and graveled for a distance of six miles. Maintenance conditions were good during the past two years. Red Willow County. Flood damage was exceptionally severe in Red Willow county during 1935. The approach fills to the Republican River bridge at McCook were destroyed, the bridge on No. 183 across Red Willow Creek was carried away, and the Red Willow Creek bridge east of McCook on No. 6 was seriously damaged. Concrete pavement west of McCook was undermined and one mile of bituminous mat was destroyed east of Indianola. Minor washouts occurred in the south part of the county. New work, which includes replace - ments, consists of a viaduct on No. 183 over the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railroad in McCook; new overflow bridge, revetments, and fills across the Republican River south of McCook; bituminous mat on No. 6 from Perry to the Hitchcock county line; a new bridge and two miles of grading and graveling at Red Willow Creek north of McCook on No. 183; the extension of the Red Willow Creek bridge east of McCook on No. 6, and the completion of No. 89 with gravel between Danbury and No. 183. While the biennium just closing has included some of the most severe conditions to be encountered in highway maintenance, it Is a pleasure to report that the close of 1936 finds the general condition of the highways of the district better than at any previous time. </seg>

Grant, Hooker, Thomas, Blaine, Logan, Custer, Buffalo' Dawson, Lincoln and Keith; the last four lying in the Platte Valley, the remainder almost entirely in the sand-hill region of the State. John McMeekln has been District Engineer for a period of one and one-half years, with head - quarters in the County Court House at North Platte. The principal highways of this district a-e No. 30 and No. 2. No. 30, also called the Lincoln Highway, crosses this district in an east-west direction through the Platte Valley. Approximately two hundred miles of U. S. No. 30 is in this district, all of which is hard surfaced with concrete or bituminous mat. No.! 2 enters at the south - east corner of the district and runs in a northwesterly direction a distance of two hundred twenty miles, of which ninety miles is bituminous mat, the remainder being gravel. ! From Anselmo north and west, this highway goes through the heart of the sand hills. Oiled sand surfacing has been adapted for use in this territory and is rap - idly replacing the existing clay surfaced gravel roads. Other highways of local importance are, jNo. 40, running in a westerly direction from Kearney to Tryon, and No. 83 running from Elm Creek across the east side of the district; this being the first improved road through the sand hills to the north. Traffic on Highway No. 30 has increased much in the last two years, due to the fact that it is the first completely hard surfaced road across the State. Considerable traffic has been routed over this highway because of the flood damage to roads and bridges in the Republican valley during 1935. Important construction projects in this district during the past biennlum are as follows: The completion of twenty-eight miles of concrete pavement and ten miles of bituminous mat on Highway No. 30, between North Platte and Big Springs made No. 30 the first hard surfaced highway across the State. Five grade crossings on Highway No. 2 were eliminated, using funds made available by the Works Program Administration, by the relocation of the highway on the south side of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad track, through Sherman, Custer and Blaine counties.

Maintenance activities during the biennium consisted of the usual routine, although the extremely heavy rains of May and June, 1935, necessitated considerable repair in the southern part of this district. During the drought of 1936, the light clay surfaced mats broke up badly, making reclaying necessary, and on many patrols water was hauled on the road, to protect them from complete destruction. Main - tenance equipment is repaired and rebuilt at the State shops located at Ogallala, North Platte, and Broken Bow. Arthur County. Located in' the heart of the sand hills, Arthur county is one of the three counties without a railroad. The county seat is located in about the center of the county, and is provided with an all weather road, Highway No. 61, running south to Ogallala. As this county is all sand hills, construction and maintenance costs are high, due to the lack of suitable surfacing material. Since this is an inland county, the highways carry considerable truck traffic, importing supplies and exporting livestock. Considerable maintenance expendi - ture is made necessary due to the damage done to the surfacing, shoulders, and signs, by the movement twice each year of large herds of cattle on the highway. Buffalo County. All State highways in this county have been graded and graveled, or paved, with the exception of three miles be - tween Watertown and Miller on Highway No. 40. No. 40, between Riverdale and Watertown, has been built to a permanent grade and graveled during this biennium. This road has been relocated on the north side of the Kearney-Stapieton branch of the Union Pacific, eliminating three grade crossings. A part of this work was done with relief funds made available by the WPA. During the heavy rains of June, 1935, the bridge on the South Loup river at Pleasanton was completely destroyed. This bridge was replaced by State forces, using salvaged material from bridges removed in other parts of the State. A channel change was made and a new abutment built on the South Loup river bridge at Miller. This structure was also damaged con - siderably by the high water of Ju'ne, 1935. Highway No. 30 crosses the south part of the county and is all paved. The alignment was improved and the city pavement was widened in the vicinity of the Kearney State Normal school. Custer County. Work in thi3 county during the past biennium consisted mainly of improving the alignment and of surfacing of the existing highways. Notable improvements have been made from Broken Bow southeast to the county line, on Highway No. 2, by the relocation on the south side of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy </seg>

Six miles on Highway No. 40 have been built to permanent grade and graveled. ■The completion, of this project gives a gravel surfaced highway from Stapleton to Kearney. The topography of this county is very rough, and the construction and maintenance of roads Is very expensive. Gravel for surfacing is not found locally and must be shipped or trucked to the road from long distances, which adds materially to the cost of this type of road.

Lyle Carey has been District Engineer for about two years, with headquarters at Ainsworth. Construction of adequate highways through the sandy country, which is typical of most of this district, has always been a major problem. A sand sub-grade topped with a clay mat and with a sand gravel wearing surface, provided the first satisfactory all-weather roads. . A succession of dry years, together with Increased traffic and size of truck units, has increased maintenance costs and developed the need of a more stable surfacing to insure lower maintenance costs. |. • Oil sand surfacing, to an average depth of five Inches, has met these requirements, or in cases where a stable sub-grade was available the use of a bituminous mat .has prpven very satisfactory. This »con - .struction varies from l ] / t " to 2" in depth, and the mat is composed of a graded gravel aggregate and filler material. Highway No.- 20 is the principal highway across the district, ex - tending from east to west, for a distance of two hundred and twenty - seven miles. Of this distance one hundred and twenty-seven, miles are surfaced with pavement, bituminous mat, or oiled sand surfacing. During- the past biennium, the construction, of oiled sand projects on the Bassett East and "Leat West roads and Irom Crookston. to Nenzel, and bituminous mat from Johnstown to Wood Lake, has (tided mate - rially in decreasing the mileage of Highway No. 20, which previously had not been hard surfaced.

Garfield and Ix&gt;up Counties. Drought conditions have prevailed in these two counties, although all forage crops are much better than in 1934. A distinct feeling of optimism is noticeable because of the imminence of construction operations on the Loup Valley Irrigation Projects. Several major maintenance projects have been completed in raising grades, reconstruction of bridges, etc. Wheeler County. This county has experienced the same general conditions that have prevailed in the district. Grain crops have been below normal and forage crops are adequate in most cases. Construc - tion work on the Ericson-Burwell route has completed another step in the improvement of an east and west highway of major importance to this section of the State. Eradication of bind weed has been carried on where this plant is becoming noticeable. Improved machinery has been added to the maintenance equipment. Installation of a gasoline transport system has proven very satisfactory and resulted in more efficient and eco - nomical operation of equipment. The further improvement of the patrol shed at Ainsworth, and purchase and improvement of a patrol shed at Valentine, will be of lasting benefit to maintenance opera - tions in this district. . ;. •■ ■- rh ■ ■■■■ • •■•■■»!•■■•■ ' ■ ; .-■-•■■ - ■ ■ . </seg>

S. Works Program Highway and U. S. Works Program Grade Crossing appropriations of May 16, 1935, and to the completion of the programs undertaken under the National Recovery appropriations of June 16, 1933 and June 18, 1934. Completion of the work under the National Recovery appropria - tion of 1933 has been accomplished during this period. Of the 1934 National Recovery appropriation, we have completed 95 per cent, have under construction 4 per cent, and only 1 per cent remains to be contracted. The rules and regulations governing these funds were outlined in the last biennial report. ! The allotment of regular Federal Aid funds made available, to Nebraska for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1936, was in the sum of $2,581,663.00, this sum to be matched with an equal amount of State funds. It was required that a minimum of 1 per cent, or $25,817.00, be applied to roadside improvement. Of the above allotment $38,724.95 was applied on highway planning. With the exception of the road - sfde improvement, all of this allotment has been completed or is under construction. Of the Federal Aid appropriations made available to Nebraska for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1937, we have contracted only a. small portion, or approximately 3 per cent. Federal funds were alloted on July 1, 1935, and became actually available in September, 1935, to this State as follows: Works Program Grade Separation Funds $3,556,441 ; Works Program Highway Funds 3,870,739 These funds were made available to the State for expenditure without being met by State funds and were to be expended In ac - cordance with certain regulations as set down by the Federal Bureau of Public Roads.

Requirements were also set up relative to the division of the Works Program Grade Crossing Funds, which provided that this money could be applied to projects without any limitations as to the loca - tion of projects, except that not less than 25 per cent of . the State's apportionment should be expended at railroad grade crossings on secondary or feeder roads. The department was urged also to locate projects in such a way that they would be located close to population centers. In order to relieve unemployment to the greatest extent possible. It is apparent throughout the entire rules and regulations, as furnished us by the Federal Bureau of Public Roads, that their primary purpose in making these expenditures was for the reduction of unemployment. The department was refused approval on certain pro - jects which, from the standpoint of elimination of hazards, were very desirable, due to the fact that the unemployment situation at those locations was not suitable for a program of this character. Grade Crossing funds were available for the following uses, in connection with the elimination of hazards at railroad crossings: 1. The separation of grades at crossings. 2. The protection of grade crossings. 3. The reconstruction of existing railroad grade crossing structures. 4. The relocation of highways to eliminate grade crossings. The department attempted to take full advantage of the last classification and were successful in making a number of very de - sirable relocations, which not only eliminated highway grade crossings but furnished new alignment. This in most cases reduced mileage and gave us these new improvements which would not have other - wise been possible. The total mileage of relocations made was 87.5 miles, which added that amount to our improved highway mileage. The details of the apportionments under the WPH and WPGH Funds will be listed in another part of this report, so will not be gone into in great detail here, but the following represents some of the most important separations and eliminations.

Since this program was primarily for the purpose of reducing unemployment, the work had to be so laid out that the greatest possible amount of labor could be used. These designs and projects were worked out in such a way </seg>
            <seg id="p074">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER that it was necessary for the department to supplement only a very few projects by addition of State funds, and In these cases the amounts added were very small. Some increase in cost of the various items of work was noted, but not to the extent that the work could be classed as uneconomical, in view of the fact that a greater percentage of labor was being employed. In the latter part of the program, an alternate plan method was used, which permitted the department to apply labor credits from work performed by strictly State funds on other classes of work. When the man hour requirements were eliminated, the costs were reduced materially. . II IHUIIIhb The I. unrest Box Culver!

In the latter part of May, 1935, the Republican river rose to. an unprecedented height and did damage amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars, to the highway system throughout the length of the river from Haigler to Superior. This department made application for assistance from the Federal Government in the reconstruction of our highways and bridges, and an allotment was made to the State in the sum of $276,000, which amount was to be met by State funds. This was known as the Emergency Flood Relief Appropriation, and was to be used only in the rebuilding of structures damaged or destroyed by flood. Highway crossings affected by this flood were at Parks, at Haigler, south of Trenton, south of McCook, south of Arapahoe, south of Oxford, west of Orleans, south of Franklin, south of Red Cloud and south of Guide Rock. : Many of the tributaries of the Republican river were also at flood I </seg>

The reconstruction work done from the Emergency Flood Relief Funds was !as follows: Extension to Red Willow creek bridge east of McCook. Republican river bridges south of Trenton.

Republican river bridge south of Red Cloud. Frenchman river bridge west of Culbertson. Red! Willow creek bridge north of McCook. Medicine creek bridge east of Stockville. Muddy creek west of Stratton. One river crossing at Parks yet remains to be constructed from these emergency funds. A new bridge was constructed south of Guide Rock by State funds. Bridges over the Republican river and Muddy creek south of Arapahoe were constructed by State funds. In addition to the above, much damage was done throughout practically the entire length of Highway No. 3, which was entirely washed out in many places. This necessitated entire reconstruction, and in some places, relocation of the highway. When bids were first taken on the McCook and Franklin bridges they were found to be in excess of what the department considered they should be, and it was decided to take them over to be built by the State with I direct labor. Considerable delay was occasioned, due to the department having to organize equipment and crews to carry on the work, | purchase materials, etc., which necessarily threw the work into jthe winter months. This, of course, created further de - lays which retarded the completion of both structures. Very serious difficulties were encountered on the Franklin bridge, due to attempting to place tubular piers into solid rock. This was made necessary by the desire of the Federal Bureau of Public Roads to determine the character of the failure of the original bridge which had been built but a few years previously. The tubes were sunk in this pier to within a very few feet of the shale, and at this point every effort was put forth to determine how the previous piers had failed. It was later determined that the only feasible method of sinking these tubes into a solid foundation was by the use of air, the cost of which would have been far in excess of the benefits to be received. Inasmuch as the State was doing their own work. </seg>

The 1935 construction on Highway No. 30 west of North Platte, in conjunction with bituminous construction farther </seg>
            <seg id="p078">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER west, marked the first hard surfaced highway which completely spanned the State. Construction on Highway No. 6 in 1935 and 19 36 has linked Hastings and Lincoln with an all paved highway. With the exception of a short stretch west of Pilger, there is now pavement from Omaha to Norfolk on Highway No. 8. In addition to these gap closing pro - grams, there were also constructed, extensions to existing pavement on .heavy traveled routes. Among these are the construction on both the north and south ends of Highways Nos. 73 and 75 which parallel the eastern State boundary, and construction on Highway No. 20 west from South Sioux City. Another notable feature of the past two years' construction is the fact that much of the pavement has been laid on completely re - located routes. This has been due to the trend for more direct line linkages, as well as the elimination of hazardous railroad crossings. These relocations have permitted the designing of wider curves, better drainage facilities, and greater sight distances. Careful supervision and precise control of materials and methods have been maintained on all concrete paving. The construction of paving projects is carried on under the direction of the paving en - gineer through the district and project engineers. The engineering organization in direct charge of construction in the field, consists of a project engineer, one or more instrument men, rodmen, chainmen, grade inspectors, gravel inspectors, culvert and bridge inspectors, plant inspector, slab inspector, and helpers. The members of each field party reside close to the project and are constantly in touch with every detail of the work. The details of supervision include the setting of line and grade stakes for the guidance of contractors, the inspection of work per - formed and materials used, the interpretation of plans and specifica - tions, measurement of quantities of work for which payment is to be made to the contractors, the preparation of monthly pay estimates. and formal acceptance of the work after it is completed. When a number of projects are active at the same time, a considerable super - vising force is needed. On certain large projects when two or three grading outfits, two culvert crews, one or two bridge crews, and two paving outfits have been in operation at the same time, three survey parties have been required to keep ahead of construction operations. One grade inspector is placed with each grading outfit, and a culvert or bridge inspector is kept with each crew constructing these drainage structures to see that they are built in accordance with the plans and specifications </seg>
            <seg id="p079">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION I ' ' ! A plant inspector and helper are assigned to each concrete materials proportioning plant, and a slab inspector and helper to each paving crew. In the construction of fills or embankments, the earth is placed in successive horizontal layers not more than 6 inches in depth and each lajer is rolled at least twice with a roller weighing 275 pounds per inch width: of tread. This is done to obtain satisfactory compac - tion and prevent future settlement of the pavement. In the con - struction of culverts and bridges, the steel is required to be placed accurately as indicated on' the plans and the placing, curing, and finishing of tlie concrete is carefully controlled. All concrete ma - terials for pavement, with the exception of water, are weighed ac - curately and carefully handled to prevent loss and keep them clean. Water is measured by volume. Bulk cement is uBed exclusively except in the case of short projects where the quantity required is too small to warrant the installation of platforms and scales for handling. The details of the preparation of the s.ubgrade, form setting, and of the mixing, placing, finishing, and curing of the concrete are given rifiid inspection. The time for opening pavement to traffic is based on the strength of the concrete as determined from results of beam specimens which are made from each day's run. These beam tests are made In the field by the plant inspector. Acceptance of the concrete is based on the compressive strength of cylinders made during the progress of the work. Two cylinders are made from each day's run and are sub - mitted to the Testing Laboratory at Lincoln for test. A check on the concrete pavement acceptable for payment is made by drilling cores from the pavement shortly after it is laid and determining the depth of pavement on the basis of measurements of these cores. De - ductions in the payment are made when the core measurements in - dicate a deficiency in the depth of the pavement. Sand gravel, most of which has been of Platte river origin, has continued to be the prevailing aggregate for concrete used for pave - ment. Standard coarse gravel and crushed limestone have been used only in those few projects whose location has resulted in low shipping rates for these! more expensive aggregates. The outstanding feature with regard to paving aggregates has been the marked trend to the use of the divided sand-gravel aggregate. Up to 1933 it had been the custom to produce and use sand-gravel material as a single com - bined aggregate which required a greater cement content, to equal the strength of concrete made from standard coarse and fine aggre - gates. It was found, however, that by separating the sand gravel into two sizes that, through the benefit of closer control on grada- </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER tion when the two sizes were recombined for concrete, a saving of cement could be made and the concrete would still meet the strength requirements. Concrete of this class has the added advantage of being somewhat more dense than the concrete using only a single combined aggregate. The use of the divided sand-gravel aggregates has been very popular and has given good results. Except for a few special cases, where it has been necessary to fit local conditions, the design of concrete pavement has been well stabilized. The standard two-lane pavement has a 20-foot width, an edge thickness of 9 inches, and a center thickness of 7 inches. Wire-mesh or bar-mat reinforcement are used with both the com - bined and divided sand-gravel aggregates, but are not used with !•' •"■ LSE^'iSfiBteLi^li .jiff ''■'•. A Bituminous Pnvril Road standard coarse and fine aggregates. The use of reinforcement in sand-gravel concretes is based on the fact that special surveys of cracks in concrete pavement have indicated that concrete made from sand-gravel aggregate has shown considerably more cracking than concrete made from the standard coarse and fine aggregate and that the use of wire mesh or bar mats as reinforcement will reduce the amount of cracking and thereby reduce the cost of maintenance and increase the life of the pavement. Expansion joints, consisting in most cases of a 1-inch premoulded asphalt material, are placed at 90-foot intervals. Wherever wire-mesh reinforcement is used throughout the slab, one contraction joint or plane of weakness is placed between each pair of expansion joints, making the contrac - tion joint interval 45 feet. Where wire mesh is not used, these joints </seg>
            <seg id="p081">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION are placed at 30-foot intervals. The transfer of wheel loads across a joint in the pavement is accomplished by the use of %-inch by 2-foot steel dowels spaced at 15-inch intervals across the joint. Prior to 1936 construction, there had been no means of insuring that these dowels would remain in proper position after the concrete was placed. The present design requires that a dowel-bar assembly shall be used. This assembly holds the dowel bars in position and insures the proper location and position of the dowel bars so that loads may be trans - ferred more effectively across the joints. The general specifications provide that the concrete pavement shall be cured by one of three general methods. These are: curing with wet burlap for 72 hours, curing by ponding for 72 hours, or curing with wet earth for. 7 days. The method most generally used is the ponding method which involves building dikes on the edges of the pavement and allowing water to stand on the pavement for the required period. As an experimental procedure, the use of sisal - craft paper Was' allowed to be used for curing on one project con - structed in 1936. With this type of curing, the concrete is covered with a continuous laminated sheet of sisal-craft paper which is sealed down at the edges of the pavement, and allowed to remain over the pavement for the full curing period. Advantages of this type of curing lie in the fact that the pavement is not covered with dirt and mud which would have to be removed, the shoulders adjacent to the paving sre not flooded with curing water, and the concrete is considerably whiter than concrete cured by standard methods. How - ever, tests have not yet been made to determine whether the strength developed In this method of cure is equal to that of standard curing methods, anc therefore no definite conclusions may yet be made. Experimental Installations were also made in connection with joints, to determine the effect of sealed joints on heaving of pave - ment subsequent to the laying of the concrete. On one project con - structed during 1936 several patented types of joints were installed in order to compare their effectiveness in reducing the distortion which often occurs in pavement slabs. Most of these joints used a copper sealing strip which was imbedded in the concrete on both sides of the joint, the principle being that this copper seal would prevent the infiltration of moisture into the subgrade below the joint, thereby eliminating Boil swelling and the resultant distortion of the pave - ment slab. Surveys will be made on this section, from time to time, to determine! the moisture conditions near the joints and to determine what, if any advantage is offered by the several types of joints. The problem of eliminating pavement distortion due to swelling of subgrade !soil was also approached by the method of subgrade sta- </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER bilization. On one project, the stabilization was accomplished by moisture control. The subgrade soil was treated with moisture, to various depths on different sections, so that the soil would contain the proper amount of moisture to obtain maximum density when compacted. The subgrade was then compacted to that maximum density and maintained at the proper moisture until the pavement was laid. On another project the stabilization was accomplished by mixing fine sand with the existing subgrade material, controlling the moisture content, and compacting to maximum density. Studies will also be made on these projects to determine the effectiveness of the treatments. Inasmuch as this experimental work was done on 1936 construction projects, no conclusions have been made with regard to the benefits 'which may result. ; Studies are being continued on the strength of concrete as de - termined by compression tests of cores cut from pavement each year. Several cores are taken from each project, each being cut within a short distance from the original cor,e. This study is bein^ conducted on several projects and the tests show that in most cases the strength of concrete is increasing progressively each year. The construction methods of the past two years have shown a trend to a more complete mechanization of the paving processes. On one project a mechanical subgrader was used, which planed the sub - grade to the proper elevation and conveyed the excess subgrade ma - terial outside the forms. On several projects, a small internal type vibrator was used along the form lines and along transverse joints to reduce voids and honeycombing. On a few short experimental stretches, a vibrating unit was used on the screed of the finishing machine In an effort to obtain concrete of higher density and greater .strength. Another mechanical unit to make its appearance on paving work was the mechanical longitudinal float. These and other me - chanical time and labor saving equipment are tending to produce pavement of higher quality and through the labor saving element will result in more economical highways. i ROADSIDE IMPROVEMENT Roadside improvement projects were started near the end of the previous biennium. This report will include roadside improvement projects from the time of their beginning in August, 1934, when W. L. Younkin was appointed landscape engineer, to the present time. The principle aims of roadside improvement are best described by quoting from the Instructions of the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads </seg>

The first Federal allotment of $39,145.81 in July, 1934, pro - vided the funds for the first roadside improvement work. In 1035. $39,643.64 was provided. In 1936, $38,707.39 of Federal funds, under the Works Progress Administration, was made available. To date expenditures have been made only from the above funds. Under the regular Federal Aid funds made available, there was alloted $25,816.63 for the fiscal year of 1936 and $25,862.6" for the fiscal year of 1937. These funds will have to be met by State funds, and legislative authority is needed and will be requested to permit the use of State funds on roadside improvement work. At the start of roadside improvement work, considerable study was made to determine highways suitable for improvement, bearing in mind that such work should be distributed throughout the State in order to spread interest and equalize the benefits. Improvements on the heaviest traveled roads afforded the greatest opportunity for results, both to residents and out-of-state visitors and also, due to being close to population centers, provided a means of relieving em - ployment. Two distinct types of improvement presented themselves; first, avenue approaches to cities or villages, and second, the intensifying of open country planting. Avenue approaches receive ' formal or semi-formal treatment, consisting of studied arrangement of small plant life backed up with rows of stately trees. The countryside re - ceives treatment of group planting in an effort to create the impres - sion that such trees and shrubs as exist came by their location through nature. The U. S. Bureau of Public Roads permitted expenditure upon a few recreational parks adjoining the highway. To take advantage Of this offer, the city of Crawford furnished a 13 acre tract, about 6 miles south of Crawford. The Kimball Irrigation District furnished a park site of 6.42 acres, adjoining its reservoir west of Kimball. Recreational parks lying upon highways and belonging to the Game, Forestation, and Parks Commission are now receiving consideration. A compilation of the projects executed to date within the State are shown in Table 16. In addition to the projects Included in Table 16, the following </seg>

NRH-1, NRM-5-C, and NRH-5-B embraced shoulder sloping and underground drainage. Work on the roadside parks included grading of drives and trails, stone gateway and flag - ping; toilet facilities, ovens, curbing, rustic bridges, picnic sets and guard rail. One project received concrete sidewalks. Due to the large mileage of highways in Nebraska, the wide variety of climate and country encountered, a careful selection of plant life was necessary, and a greater variety of species was also possible. A few of the trees planted were American elm, Chinese elm,, hackberry, locust, linden, sycamore, red oak, pin oak, willow, bull pine. Austrian pine, Scotch pine, red cedar and silver cedar. The shrub list included honeysuckle, mock orange, lilac, Japanese quince, Russian olive, buck brush, caragena, cotoneaster, barberry and matrimony vine. It is regrettable that the beginning of roadside improvement work in Nebraska occurred during years of excessive heat and drouth. Even with such extremes of climate as have been experienced, plant - ings show a loss of only 20 per cent in trees and 13 per cent In shrubs in the spring of 1936. A toll of the loss during the summer of 1936 cannot be arrived at until the spring of 1937. It 1b worth while to note that the smallest loss has occurred among the ever - green trees. I ■■ Too much should not be expected of the immediate results in appearance of the work now being done. Small size stock have been planted to insure a maximum in life, and eight or ten years may be required before the public will have an opportunity to be impressed with results. It is not intended that roadside plantings shall re - ceive "garden" care after several years but that they shall be able to take care of themselves. Immediately after planting and until the plant life has become established, constant and careful mainte - nance is by far the most important part of all roadside improvement ■work. </seg>

The State Is divided into eight districts, comprised of about eleven or twelve counties each, and each under a District Engineer, who is responsible to the Main - tenance Engineer, for the maintenance activities in his district. Each of the eight districts is subdivided into maintenance divisions with a chief patrolman, or resident engineer, in charge. There are about five maintenance! divisions to each district, the size of each depending upon. the type of highway, the amount of traffic, the topography and climatic conditions. Then, finally, that portion of the highway system which is eligible for maintenance is divided into patrol sections of varied lengths. A patrolman with proper equipment is assigned to each patrol. Another important part of the organization is the mechanical division which keeps the equipment in condition, so that the road maintenance force can carry on their work without undue delay. This division is in charge of a chief mechanic, working directly under the Maintenance Engineer, who has general supervision of all mechanical work. In each of the eight districts there is a district mechanic who works under thq District Engineer, and each district is divided into three to four mechanical divisions, each with an assistant mechanic. The assistant mechanics have definite equipment assigned to their care and are held responsible for keeping those pieces in proper repair. A main repair shop Is located at Lincoln, where complete motor overhauling jobs and other heavy work is done for all districts. The work done at iiincoln is of such nature that it would not pay to equip each district repair shop to perform this work. The clerical and statistical work of the organization is centralized as much as possible in the Lincoln office. Each of the eight dis - tricts has a district clerk who prepares and forwards payrolls for labor and voucners- for materials, which must be purchased in the field, to the Lincoln office where they are checked, recorded and forwarded for payment . The Lincoln office keeps records, in itemized form, of the costs of each patrol and each piece of equipment. The information necessary to accomplish this is taken from the daily re- </seg>
            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER ports made by each employee as to the type of work done and in - formation regarding equipment operation. It requires approximately 435 regular employes to operate the maintenance organization. More than two-thirds of this number are patrolmen who maintain a certain section of road assigned to them. Their duties are routine and require their services part time only, depending to a large extent, upon the elements and the amount of traffic. Extra laborers are used to do special work of a major nature Hud Jack Used for Leveling Old Concrete Pavement and the number employed varies considerably throughout the year. It has been the policy of the Maintenance Division, since the Na - tional Reemployment service has been organized, to cooperate with it in obtaining its labor requirements. The Rules and Regulations for carrying out the provisions of the U. S. Works Program High - way Appropriation Act of 1935, provide that the cost of Works Pro - gram Highway Projects shall not exceed $1400 per man year of em - ployment. An alternate plan has been provided whereby credit may be given for the employment on other work of intermediate grade and unskilled labor taken from lists furnished by the National Re - employment Service. Since much of the work of maintaining the highways consists of labor, considerable credit is being obtained to apply on the alternate plan by requiring maintenance supervisors to employ all necessary unskilled and intermediate grade laborers through the National Reemployment service to the extent that such laborers are available. </seg>

REPUBLICAN BIVEK VALLEY 1'LOOll During this biennium the Maintenance Division has been con - fronted with abnormal weather conditions which presented problems of a major nature, and which required unusual expenditures. The Republican river valley flood was one of the major catastrophies oc - curring during this period. Friday, May 31, 1935, was the beginning of the State's most dis - astrous flood, when the many tributaries of the Republican river overtaxed that usually mild running stream, and sent it swirling over an area from two to three miles wide, causing a great loss of life, destroying homes and other valuable property, killing a large number of live stock, and probably making, useless, for a good many years, hundreds of acres of rich farm land. A tabulation of the losses in - curred is included in the report of District No. 6. While it seems impossible, the records indicate that this comparatively small stream carried four times as much water as the Platte river had ever carried since records have been kept. The greatest flow, during the flood stage,' ever recorded on the Platte river is 56,000 second-feet. Most of the towns along the river's course were cut off from each other and the outside world, except through the use of airplanes. Tele - phone and telegraph lines were gone, railroads were washed out, high - ways were under water, and bridges were destroyed. Long sections of rails and ties were torn from the railroad roadbed and carried several hundred feet, sometimes coming to rest on the highway, where </seg>
            <seg id="p097">DKI'ARTMKNT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION the ties on end with rails attached gave the appearance of a picket fence. Traffic on all highways, in the vicinity of McCook, was para - lyzed. In many places along .the highways, groups of cars were stranded, unable to move in either direction due to water pouring over the roadbed, and structures being either completely washed out, or damaged to the extent that they were unsafe to cross. The high waters began receding late Friday, and by Saturday morning it was possible to survey the situation. Information re - irarding the damage to highways was necessary in order to ascertain from where it would ha desirable and feasible for the department to begin, in attempting to enter McCook with vehicular traffic. On Saturday, several attempts were made, without success, by employees of this department, to reach McCook via motor vehicle from the east, west, and north. It was impossible to proceed from the east farther than within a few miles of Oxford, from the north only to a few miles south of Maywood, and from the west only to Imperial. Alter contacting the department's District Engineer at McCook by airplane late Saturday afternoon, it was decided to make every possible effort to reach McCook by working on Highway No. G to the east and No. 1SJ to the north. Several carloads of material started out of Lincoln, by truck from the department supply base, late that night and arrived in North Platte the following day. Several large crews of men worked desperately Saturday night and Sunday, both north and easu out of McCook and on both ends towards McCook, repairing washed out grades and bridges. By Sunday noon, it was possible to enter McCook by motor vehicle from both north and east. This was the only means of transportation available for the purpose of bringing in food and other necessities to the inhabitants til the affected area. As a matter of fact the restoration of highway communication preceded that of telephone, telegraph and railroad lines and it was through the use of the highways that other systems of communication were restored. All twelve State highway bridges and grades crossing approxi - mately two hundred miles of the Republican river in Nebraska were damaged so that it was necessary to close them to traffic for a period which varied from a few days to several weeks, until repairs were made or temporary crossings provided. The above highway crossings or bridges were located at the following places: Superior, Guide Hock, Red Cloud, Franklin.

The above are some of the major bridge washouts, there being many other smaller drain - age structures and grades which were affected, and which required emergency temporary repairs before traffic was able to move. All available equipment and materials were rushed to the flooded area from all parts of the State, and by Monday morning June '■&gt;, or three days after the flood struck, traffic was restored on Highways No. ti and No. 18U. which made it possible for other organizations to enter the affected area with men, equipment, materials and supplios to bei;in restoration work immediately. An immediate expenditure in excess o£ $150,000.00 was required in order to bring about complete, but temporary restoration of all highways, so that permanent work could proceed on a systematic basis. Much credit is due the employees of the department, who worked so faithfully, under .adverse conditions, to accomplish bucI) line results. SNOW REMOVAL The prevention of snow drifts and removal of snow is one of the most important activities of the maintenance organization. Sine - travel by motor vehicle and transportation of commodities over tin - highways is rapidly increasing, the demand for good highways th&gt; - year around has likewise increased. It is, therefore, obvious thai every possible precaution must be taken to keep the highways con - stantly open and clear of snow drifts as well as to keep the surfaces free of snow and ice, even though they are not blocked by drifts. Therefore, since there is no way to predetermine whether there will be heavy snow storms or not, it is necessary each year to erect several hundred miles of snow fence in order to insure, insofar as practical, the elimination of drifts at those points on the highways most sub - ject to drifting. It is also necessary to maintain, in good order, trucks and tractors with snow plows attached in readiness to cope with the snow problem if it arises. It is the policy to purchase sufficient new snow fence, each year, to protect new roads which have not been previously on the system and replace to some extent old fence which has deteriorated beyond further use.

The coming winter presents an unusual problem that is difficult to cope with. Due to extreme drought and the failure of the corn crop generally over the state, the highways are deprived of the pro - tection generally afforded by the hundred of miles of standing corn ttalks which act as a snow fence. It is impractical to purchase suf - ficient snow f|?ncc to fill those Ears, which total several hundred miles, since in normal years the fence would not he required.

            <seg id="p100">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER SXO1V SXOB3I OF 1936 . The department had hardly recovered from the damaging effects of the disastrous Republican river valley flood when early in the winter of 1936, an unprecedented snow condition presented Itself- Snow began falling; in the eastern half of the State on January lf&gt;. and continued intermittently until January 2H, during which period approximately twenty-four inches of snow fell. Tin- snow did not drift, due to there being little or no wind and all snow was removed from the road surface Immediately without difficulty.

February •". This storm resulted in many one-way passages existing thioimli those sections where heavy driftiiiK occurred and snow was piled up on both side* from four to eight feet in height. Where it was possible to clear the entire surface, ridges from lour to five feet hieh lay along both sides of the highway. The work of widening out the narrow sections was well under 'way when, on February 7. at " I'. M., snow began falling and r strong wind started in the northeastern part of the State. The wind increased in velocity and spread to- the south, covering the entire eastern half of the State, so that by Saturday evening. February 8. the department was faced with the problem of opening up approxi - mately four thousand miles of badly drifted and snow blocked liiu r h- </seg>
            <seg id="p101">DE 'ARTMENT OP ROADS AND IRRIGATION ways, this being about one-half of the total maintained mileage in the State. Thti condition was aggravated due to the fact that previous .snow, two feet in depth, covering the ground had drifted to the extent that all snow k'ences were filled and failed to afford the usual pro - tection. Each time that the highways were opened and then' re - drifted, the problem of reopening became more difficult, since the old snow ridges on the sides held the snow which filled in between id Hie top of the ridges. The problem of finding a place to put the snow became more difficult each succeeding time. Due to sub-zero weather prevailing for twenty-nine consecutive days, from January 22 to February 19, the Maintenance Division was severely handicapped in its efforts to open and clear the highways of snow. All available equipment was transferred to the snow area, from those sections of the State where no snow had fallen. Ap - proximately one hundred and fifty trucks and tractors equipped with snow plows were in action day and night. These units were assisted by over two hundred regular maintenance tractor units, and approxi - mately three thousand men were employed for shoveling. Clearing the highways of snow to make it possible for all traffic to begin moving would just about be accomplished when another -.torin would follow, redril'ting to a greater extent those roads just cleared. After the storm of February 8, reoccurrences more damag - ing than peviously were had on February 13 and 18, and both times t tie same four thousand miles were reblocked. Then, through the untiring efforts of the men in the field, who shoveled snow and oper - ated and repaired the equipment under the most severe weather condi - tions, it was possible to finally cope with an almost impossible under - taking. The department received many distress calls for help from in - land towns during the early period of the storms, which were given immediate attention. However, the necessity of this prevented, to some extent, the proper correlation of the work, and as a result more heavily traveled routes were, in many cases, not opened as soon as expected. The problem of getting food and fuel to towns during the latter period of the storm became acute, not only for inland towns, but also for those located on railroads. And in several instances, distress calls were answered and highways opened before railroad companies were able to open their lines. Some idea of the magnitude of the problem can be obtained by the following snow removal costs: for the winter 1933-34, snow re - moval cost was $12,690.48; for the winter 1934-35, $57,560.00; and lor the past winter the costs were $269,634.75. </seg>

The melting of snow and the frost action, due to the ground freezing to an unusual depth, caused graveled roads to break up badly which necessitated the addition of new gravel to a greater ex - tent than would normally be required. The -following expenditures,' above those required during normal years, were made necessary due to damages sustained by melting of ice and snow and to extremely low temperatures, causing an unusual .&lt;ubgrade condition: Extra gravel and repair of damaged grades. $200,000. Repair or replacement of 22 damaged bridges, $100,000. sk;xs The maintenance of signs as a "daily duty" of patrolmen has been continued as in the past in order that all signs may be properly and carefully placed and in good order at all times to direct the travel - ing public to its destination without inconvenience, and for their protection, -to warn them of all known hazards. The theory is, that if the highway is carefully marked and if tho highway user observes the directions and warnings given by the signs, there can be no ■lander from tie known hazards ahead. On November 7, 1935, the American Standards Association ap - proved, as an American standard, a uniform plan of traffic control devices and markings foi use on streets and highways in the United States. This i Ian has been approved by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads and is n accord with recommendations of national organiza - lions interested in the subject. The American Association of State Highway Officials and the National Conference on Street and High - way Safety are two of the cooperative organizations who took a lead - ing part in developing this plan. While the system used in the State of Nebraska compares very closely to the uniform plan, it is the intention to change over to the uniform system in every detail as rapidly as economic procedure will permit. All new signs purchased since January 1, 1936, have been de - signed lo conform with the standard and will replace all old signs as soon as they have deteriorated and become unfit for refinishlng and further use.

            <seg id="p108">REPORT OF THE STATE EXGINEEK Recommendations as to what part of the sign should be reflector - ized varies with respect to the intention. For example, on curve and turn signs the symbol is reflectorized; on stop signs and the "I!K" in railroad crossing signs, the word or letters are reflectorized; and on other slow type warning signs, the outline is reflectorized. While signs with reflectorized outlines may not appear adequate, it is felt the general use of such illumination will tend to make the motorists conscious of the meaning of the shapes and instinctively obedient to them. As an additional safety measure the department has placed five hundred, 25-button red reflector signs at the ends of narrow bridges or other structures and at points where the highway ends or makes a sharp turn. Due (o the frequent occurrences of accidents on hills and curves, five hundred special signs have'been placed at advantage - ous points with the notation "Do Not Pass on Hills and Curves". This, it is felt, will call to the motorist's attention the danger In - volved when attempting to overtake another vehicle under these con - ditions, and will help materially in eliminating accidents of this nature. The Statutes of this State provide that the department purchase all new standard metal signs from the State Board pf Conrol which has supervision over all State Institutions. All such signs are manu - factured at the State Reformatory for Men, near Lincoln' All other signs, both metal and wood, are made at the Department's sign shop located in the State Equipment shop in Lincoln. This same shop also refinishes all signs which are fit for reuse except for Ili«&gt; condi - tion of finish. During this biennium fil.SOS signs were refinlshecl and 8,569 new signs were made, consisting of both metal and wood, varying in size from 18"xl8" to 4'xfi'. During the biennium, special signs have been designed and con - structed and are being placed at the junctions of all highways. In - dicating to traffic the distance to the next town and other larger towns on the various routes intersecting at the junction. This sign replaces the high arrow and post type, and is designed and placed so as to be readable from the driver's seat, either by day or night, when approaching a junction. The signs are well constructed of California redwood and are made at the department's sign shop at Lincoln at a minimum cost Careful logging of the highways was necessary in order to provide correct driving distances. The single arrow type signs previously used at highway junctions were removed and are being remodeled for use at the intersection of main local routes leading to towns or points of interest which may </seg>

The arrows indicate the distance to and the name of the town, or give information with respect to the identity of the place in case a town is not nearby. The daily occurrence and constant increase In tne numDer of traffic accidents makes it apparent that the problem of proper high - way signing is of paramount importance, requiring diligent study and experimentation: Therefore, 'he department has consistantly endeav - ored to improve this function as rapidly as possible, giving considera - tion, of course, to funds available for this purpose.

After (considerable experimenting, a white paint has been developed which can be satisfactorily used on this type of surface. The work of placing it on all bituminous mat highways is well under way at this time and should be completed before the end of this year. KOAD MAGNETS There is no doubt that the use of road magnets operated over other than hard surfaced highways in order to pick up metallic sub - stances which would puncture a tire, has a material effect in prevent - ing accidents. Therefore, two of these units have been used during the past two years and we have been able to cover the entire system at least once during their effective season. The two machines were </seg>
            <seg id="p110">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER made in our Lincoln shop and consist of u motor and generator mounted on a two-ton truck. The generator produces the electricity for magnetizing the 'magnet suspended from the center of the truck chassis. The trucks are equipped with sleeping quarters for the operator who leaves the Lincoln headquarters early in the spring. He follows n designated route and rarely returns until fall. The equipment cannot be operated effectively in the winter when the ground is frozen. During the year 1935, the machines covered a total of -l,ti4S miles; picking up 20,22ti lbs. or 10.1 tons of metal, an average of 4 .:i 5 lbs. per mile. The heaviest pickup was made on Highway Xo. S2, between Wllber and Crete, where 1S9 pounds were picked up in a distance of 10 miles, or an average of 18.0 pounds per mile. Up to October 1, 1936, the two road magnets had covered a total of :;,fioS miles with a total pickup of 15,:!12 pounds or an average pickup of 4.2r&gt; pounds per mile. The heaviest pickup occurred be - tween Laurel and Hartington, on Highway No. 15, where 250 pounds of metal were picked up in a distance of 19 miles making an average pickup of V.1.2 pounds per mile.

The number of items of stock of material and supplies carried in the main supply base at Lincoln was materially increased where - this was found to be advantageous. Generally, stocks sufficient only for sixty to ninety days are carried on articles in current use but in some cases, due to rising prices, it has been advantageous to increase the stock sufficiently to provide for a year. Because of conditions imposed by the Code of the Petroleum Industry whereby deliveries of gasoline may not be made directly to the equipment or to cans, it has been necessary to install a gasoline distribution system. A complete system of tanks and transports for distribution is now in use. The State saved approximately $71,200.00 in 1935, by purchasing gasoline in tank car lots and distributing it to its own tanks. In normal times when patrols are working on a full time basis the gasoline consumption is about twenty-two per cent greater, therefore, in normal times the saving would be ap - proximately $90,000.00 per year. </seg>
            <seg id="p115">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OK MAPS AXI&gt; PLANS The preparation of plans for construction work, the calculation of quantities and costs on all State and Federal highway construction projects and other routine office work constitute the principal duties and objectives of this division. Incidental to this work, but neverthe - less forming aj part of the regular duties performed by this division, is the keeping, of records pertaining to the cost, mileage and condi - tion of the entire State highway system, keeping records of all ma - terial and man hours entering into certain Federal projects, keeping records of all tests made of materials entering into construction work and the preparation of all maps, charts and blue prints issued by this department or used otherwise in its wide field of activities. This division has also been called upon to prepare maps and blue prints for the Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage and the Division of Motor Vehicle Registration. In addition the procuring and distribution of all office supplies and field engineering equipment i.s a part of the duties performed by this division. During this biennium a large part of the money available for construction purposes has been in the form of Federal appropriations. The rules and regulations governing the selection and programming of the projects, the preparation of the plans, specifications and esti - mates and the advertising and award of the contracts are consider - ably different than any previous regulations governing the expendi - ture of Federal funds, and have added materially to duties performed by this division. The introduction of a specified number of manhours per dollar expended has not only added to the work of preparing the plans and estimates but has changed established practices of design. For instance, where it was advisable to previously use a pipe culvert for a drainage outlet, the new regulations require, by specifying the manhours to be provided, that a structure with more labor should br- used. The concrete box culvert, because it provided more labor was selected as the substitute for the pipe. This has necessitated new designs for this type of structure. Other regulations governing the expenditure of these funds have proportionately added to the duties and work performed by this division. Considerably more office space has been acquired by the division in order to take care of the rapid expansion. Two large rooms formerly used by the Division of Bridge Design have been taken over by this division and are being used in the checking of final plans and in the preparation of the final estimates and final Federal vouchers. These rooms are located on the east side of the quad - rangle court and are closely connected with the other rooms and of - fices of the department. </seg>
            <seg id="p116">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER For some time it has been felt that the artificial lights provided for the drafting rooms were inadequate and considering the minute nature of work performed, were detrimental to the eyesight. With the thought of helping the working conditions of the men and indi - rectly increasing the general efficiency of the department, it was de - cided to change the entire system of lighting. This was accomplished by the installation of large comfortable incandescent lights and re - flectors, wltich provided a soft comfortable light without shadow or glare, and are considered easier on the eyes of those who must use artificial light. When a certain section of highway has been designated for im - provement either through an approved Federal program or other in - strument, the first step is to have a preliminary survey made of that particular section. This consists of a continuous profile with cross sections taken at regular intervals or at points where the profile breaks, and a description of the various drainage structures in place with the size of the drainage area served. The essential data for this survey is recorded on loose leaf note book paper and is submitted to the Lincoln office for plotting. The tracing cloth plans are made from these notes usually to the horizontal scale of one inch equals one hundred feel and to the vertical scale of one inch equals tea feet. Three thousand feet of plan and profile are placed on one sheet of tracing cloth. These sheets also contain all Held informa - tion relative to drainage and soil conditions which will be encountered. A tentative grade line is shown on the cloth in pencil after which blue printed copies are made. These copies are given to 'the Con - struction Engineer who, usually in company with the District Engineer in whose district the construction work is proposed, makes what is termed a plan-in-hand inspection. This inspection consists of more definitely establishing the proposed grade line, structure recom - mendations for all drainage outlets and other recommendations which will be used in the preparation of the preliminary plans. The blue prints are again turned over to this division to be used in preparing the complete preliminary plans. All recommendations shown on these prints by the Construction Engineer are followed very closely in an endeavor to provide a set of working plans which will meet field conditions. After the tracing cloth has been corrected in conformity with the recommendations made by the Construction Engineer, blue prints are again made from the original tracing cloth. If the proposed construction does not involve Federal funds, the prints are usually taken to the field again by the Construction En - gineer and given a final check before the plans are completed. If the proposed construction involves the use of Federal funds theBe prints are sent to the District Office of the U. S. Bureau of </seg>
            <seg id="p117">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION Public Roads. A representative from that office makes a field in - spection of the proposed project, studying the recommendations shown on the blue prints, and cither concurs in or makes further recom - mendations of the various phases of the proposed construction. These blue prints are .then returned to the Department of Roads and Irriga - tion and to this division where the completed plans are prepared in harmony with the recommendations and suggestions made by the Federal Bureau. A preliminary estimate of all quantities involved in the proposed construction is made up and this together with prints of the finished plans are submitted to the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads for their approval. If the request for approval is granted in the case of projects Involving Federal funds, or when the plans are completed in the case of projects where no Federal funds are involved, the next step is the advertising for bids and the awarding of contracts. In most ciises bids are received in the Lincoln office of the Department of Roads and Irrigation and usually on the basis of unit prices. These bids are opened, read, tabulated and totals calculated by the per - sonnel of this division. The determination of the low bids is done by the State Engineer or one of his assistants. When bid: i are requested for proposed construction it is not the practice of this department to furnish each prospective bidder a complete net of plans of the work on which he proposes to submit a h'u\. While this is being done in several of the States, the bluu printing facilities of this department are limited to such an extent that i li « • arrangement cannot be adopted in this State. The depart - ment does have on display in the Lincoln office, however, a complete set of blue prints of all the proposed work and have provided the District Engineers in whose districts the proposed work occurs a complete set of plans of the proposed work in his district and the County Clerks of the counties in which the work is located with three sets of blue jvints of the proposed work in that county. Two copies of the County Clerk's plans may be loaned to the prospective bidder for his rse and guidance in formulating his bids. If the bids are satisfactory and the award of the contract has been made, the next step is the preparation of the detail estimate upon which the agreement or contract with the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads I is based. This estimate, insofar as possible, is based on actual contract unit prices and preliminary quantities, and shows the actual amount of Federal funds requested for each project. It is submitted to the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads and a formal request made that this estimate be made the basis of the "Project Agree - ment" or contract. If the estimate is accepted, the "Project Agree- </seg>

After the completion of construction, quantities of all work per - formed are measured by the engineer in charge of construction and usually the quantities upon which payment to the contractor is based are computed by the field engineer and his party. All measurements, notes and computations are then sent to the Lincoln office. In the event the quantities upon which the payment to the contractor is based are not computed by the field engineer, this work is done by the Division of Maps and Plans in this office. Regardless of whether the computations are made in the field or in the Lincoln office, they are thoroughly checked In this division after, which the final estimate is prepared and passed for payment to the contractor. The final plans, showing the project as constructed are then prepared and filed in one of the lire proof vaults provided for this purpose. . The project ledger books are kept in this division and it is from these and the final estimate that the final voucher to the United States Government for work performed on projects on which Federal funds are used, is prepared. Although a serious attempt has been made to hold overtime work to an absolute minimum, a small amount has been necessary. The same spirit of loyalty and zealousness has been expressed by tht* personnel of this division that characterized it during previous t&gt;i - enniums. </seg>
            <seg id="p119">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OF BRIDGE DESIGN During the years 1935 and 1936 there were 176 structures placed under contract up to November 1, 1936. These structures were high - way bridges and viaducts, exclusive of concrete box culverts and small arches, but inclusive of two subway structures under railroad tracks, one pedestrian subway and ten major remodeling and repair jobs. ■ Of the above mentioned group, there were 163 strictly new high - way bridges and viaducts. Of these 163 structures, 18 were skewed, niaking a ratio of 11 per cent compared to 14.3 per cent for the previous biennium. Of these 163 structures, about 85 per cent were bridges and 15 per cent were grade separations. The exact distribu - tion of design types was as follows: IH Concrete slabs _ „ 3O.C8% 45 Timber bridges ■.-■■■■■. 47.62% II Deck steel Birders : * " : "' ',*, .- ',. 25:12%" I Steel truss bridges _ 2.48% 21 Viaducts _ 14.74% i«a 100.00% In addition to the two subway structures, one pedestrian sub - way and the ten major remodeling jobs mentioned above which are not included in this summary of the 163 structures, designs were made for, and bridges were constructed by State forces in several districts or the State. Most of these structures were of major im - portance, such as the repair and extension of certain bridges dam - used by floods in May and June of 1935. Examples of such con - struction are the Franklin, McCook, and Bartley bridges on the Re - publican, and the Pleasanton bridge on the Loup river north of Kearney. This construction by State and force account work will be de - scribed more in detail elsewhere in this volume. A summary of the above text, including structures built by State forces or on a force account basis, shows that the Division of Bridge Design, designed, detailed, and drafted some 188 structures of major importance. This large volume of work was executed in an expediti - ous manner in spite of the fact that there was an unusually high per - centage of turn over in personnel, due to resignations of many trained designers and inspectors, who obtained employment with various other Public Works projects, both within this State and elsewhere. Twelve of these bridges were built with open steel pile trestle bents. This I trend toward gradually increasing the use of open steel pile construction is due to a more lenient attitude in the requirements of design on the secondary highway systems. </seg>
            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER With further reference to piles, it is interesting to note that during this bfennium a total of 114,200 lineal feet of piling was incorporated into the construction.

Federal funds for these activities were not made available until September, 1935. Consequently only about one-third of such work was done in 1935, and the remaining two-thirds was done in 1936. Fourteen grade separations were placed under contract in 1935. amounting to a total of $466,118.

            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER The Beatrice Viaduct. Among the first of these viaducts to be completed and opened to traffic was the Beatrice viaduct, which car - ries the traffic of Highway No. 77 over the Chicago, Burlington £ Quincy railroad in the south part of the city of Beatrice. This struc - ture is notable for its graceful conformation to the sharp horizontal and vertical curves in the roadway alignment and for the architec - tural treatment of the columns supporting the superstructure. During the design process, a small scale model of the viaduct was made under the supervision of the project engineer who subsequently su - perintended the actual construction. This model was made for the purpose of correcting certain optical illusions introduced in the rail and curb, due to an intricate transition of horizontal and vertical curves, combined with the superelevation of the roadway. This structure is 396 feet long and cost $:'.5,850. The contractor was the Jensen Construction Company. The North Platte Viaduct. This viaduct will probably serve the most utilitarian purpose of any of the group constructed during the biennium, since it separates the dense traffic common to Highway No. 30, combined with the heavy city traffic on Jeffers Street, from the main line of the Union I'acific Railroad. A further traffic con - gestion, due to the proximity of the North Platte Union Pacific passenger depot has obtained here, since all trains, both passenger and freight, stop at North Platte. This superstructure design i.~ unique in that the steel columns and girders are monolithic units, commonly known as the rigid, frame type of construction. This structure will be 643 feet long and will cost about S12S.23::. Th&lt;- Omaha Steel Works is the contractor. The Fremont Broad Street Viaduct. This structure is distinguished because it is the longest and most expensive of all the viaducts con - structed during this biennium. It serves the triple role of separating not only city traffic, but also the through traffic of Highway No. 77. from three different railroads. This structure is 14 lit! feet long and will cost about $206,359. C. F. Lytle of Sioux City. Iowa is the contractor. The Aurora Viaduct. This, is one of the most prominent rural viaducts in the program. It separates the rather dense highway traffic, which prevails on U. S. Highway No. 34. between Lincoln and Grand Island. A feature of this construction is the acute angle at which the highway crosses the railroad line. This angle is only 12 degrees and 50 minutes. The through steel girder central span is 125 feet 1% inches from center to center of columns. These long central spans are built up plate girders of the simple span type. This structure is 663 feet long and the contract price was $73,171. The Koehler Construction Company was the contractor. </seg>
            <seg id="p125">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION ■ FiUrbury West Viaduct. This is a typical example of rural viaduct construction of the concrete and steel type of design. It also Illus - trates the opportune advantage offered by certain sites for the most economic and judicious expendiure of funds alloted for such purposes. One viaduct is made to separate the highway traffic of the rather important Highway No. 3 from two different railroad lines at the same time. JThis structure is only 295 feet long and was built for the very nominal cost of $29,339. The Yant Construction Company was the contractor. .lansen viaduct. This structure separates the crossing of High - way No. 3 from the main line of the Rock Island railroad. The rail - road line is on a 1 degree and 40 minute curve and crosses under The highway at an angle of about 20 degrees. The overhead structure however, is built with square abutments with three span continuous plate girders over the railroad tracks. The two central supports of &lt;&gt;ach continuous span series are made up as simple columns, with • •ach pair spread sufficiently to permit lateral clearance for one rail - road track between. Provision is made for one future track. Columns are armored with heavy concrete collision walls. Railroad guard rails are also installed, over a 120-foot stretch of railroad track each way, from the intersection point of the crossing. This structure is ■121 feet long and will cost ?47,94 2. The Western Asphalt Paving Corporation is the contractor. The above structures are representative of the character of grade separation structures adopted by the State of Nebraska, and illustrate our conception of the requirements of rules and regulations prescribed in the National Works Program for Grade Separations. It may be noted that the principal features that distinguish city structures from rural structures are that the city structures generally provide sidewalks for pedestrian traffic and. in several instances, iron stairways are appended for the convenience of, and as a service to, adjoining business or residence property. It IV Kit BIUDGEK The report from the Division of Construction, found elsewhere in this volume, enumerates the various river bridges constructed dur - ing this biennium. These were, for the most part, financed from the Emergency Flood Relief Appropriation, made available some time after the great Republican river flood of May, 19 35. lied Cloud UridK&gt;'. While the flood of May and June, 1935, did not wash the old Red Cloud bridge away, it did change the banks of the river to such an extent that it was deemed most expedient to construct a new bridge with longer spans and at a changed location, so as to straighten the alignment of U. S. Highway No. 281. The </seg>
            <seg id="p126">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER old bridge had a narrow lti-foot roadway, which is now considered inadequate for a highway of such importance. The new structure consists of a three span continuous truss with a central span of 200 feet and end spans of KiO feet each. At each end of the truss proper is a 6 0-foot deck steel girder approach span. making a total length of G41 feet center to center of abutments. This new structure has a clear roadway width of 24 feet. The four main piers are composed of 7-and s-foot diameter steel tubes, sunk to the shale bed some 14 to 22 feet below low water elevation. Air View of It&lt;-&lt;1 Cloud Ilrlilu-c- These tubes are keyed into the shale rock foundation bed and filled with concrete. The tops of the tubes extend slightly above natural stream bed and are surmounted with pedestal type concrete piers, conforming in shape to the battleship split water cross section. An 18i-inch concrete diaphragm connects each pair of pedestals for each oier. The abutments are of the concrete encased si eel pilf- type.

Also, each main wall pile is braced by an additional battered steel pile, which acts as a buttress against the overturning effect of the ap - proach fill.

This raising or "floating" of the truss was done in order to adjust the height of the jvarious bearing points to the proper elevations, which would produce the ratio of reactions contemplated in the design assumptions. ■ This work was carried out with dispatch and without mishap of any kind. The actual reactions measured or obtained by this adjustment were strikingly close to the ones assumed in the design and were considered to be highly satisfactory. The Omaha Steel Works was the contractor for this entire job and their bid for the work amounted to $83,087.95. The McCook South Bridge. This original State-built structure withstood the 19o5 flood without any great damage or malalignment. Bridge im«t the Republican Ulv«r on Highway So. 1*3 South nf McConk Hnring the Hood nf 1033 tun the effect of the flood was to concentrate a larger volume of flood water towards the north bank, than the small bridge opening in the north approach fill could have been expected to handle. The entire fill between the two bridges was washed away. Therefore, the original south bridge, consisting of five fio-foot deck steel girder spans, was used in place with appropriate approaches filled in, and with the rebuilding and renewing of protection work at both ends. The original 22-foot span in the north fill, however, was recon - structed to form an interior span, the abutments being transformed into piers. Then a 25-foot north approach span was added to it, and three 65-foot deck steel girder spans were also added to the south end of it. Thus, a total net opening of 220 feet was added to the original waterway. The ends of this north bridge were also protected by the addition of both willow mattress and cast in place concrete riprap and steel sheet piling. All bids on this original plan were rejected and the work was done entirely by State forces at a saving of approximately $18,000. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER The Franklin Republican Itiver Bridge. This original State - built bridge seemed to have taken the brunt of the 1935 Republican river flood. It consisted of three 100-foot pony truss spans, with one 65-foot deck steel girder approach span to the south and two sim - ilar approach spans to the north. The 1935 flood rose to a heigEt of 4 to 5 feet above the floor of the bridge. This bridge, which was built in 1932, was founded on concrete pedestal piers, supported by clusters of 10-inch H steel foundation piles driven, through clay, to the shale bed approximately 30 feet below the stream bed. It is most interesting to note that the flood evidently scoured down to this Air View of the Franklin Bridge shale as is evidenced by comparing logs of borings made in IVA2 before the flood with those made in 1935 after the flood. This com - parison shows that the clay or silt was replaced by variegated strata of sands and gravels. Notwithstanding the sustained tremendous forces exerted on this old structure by the flood waters and debris, the major portion of it stood firm. However, the south abutment and the first south pier finally collapsed and the two south spans were swallowed by the flood. Subsequent borings and probings have definitely located the lost truss, but the 65-foot girder span has not been located to this day. Illustrations of the above description will be found in the .section on bridge borings, consisting of cuts and drawings, pages 137-139. The saving grace of this and other Republican river bridge de - signs was the observance of the principle of depressing roadway approach grades to elevations below low steel in order to provide some degree of free board. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION Since the May flood of 1935 demonstrated the fixed tendency of the river to spread northward, it was decided to simply replace the two missing spans at the south end with the addition of one 60-foot span, but to apply any further new extensions at the north end of the old bridge. Accordingly, the north abutment was transformed into a pier and three new 60-foot deck steel girder spans were added to the north end. Thus, the net lengthening amounted to four 60 - foot spans but the total work done comprised the construction of five new 60-foot spans and the one new 100-foot pony truss. In order to effect a completely satisfactory treatment for this vulnerable site, a rather extensive timber pile system of bank jetties was located above the north abutment, and - substantial willow mat armoring was in - stalled around the new south abutment. The old structure was 482 feet in length and the renewed struc - ture Is 726 feet in length. During the course of this reconstruction, including the prelim - inary explorations, many interesting features were brought to light. Space will permit of setting out, herein, only a few of these natural phenomena. I The most prominent one, as recited above, was the transformation of the soil substrata from the stream bed down to the shale bed. During the transformation of the old north abutment into a pier, it was necessary to remove the old wing walls which included the task of pulling several 10-inch H steel piles. It required the use of two 150-ton hydraulic jacks, combined with a very heavy struc - tural steel harness, forming the pulling apparatus, to dislodge these piles. Records of this performance show that more than a 100 ton force was necessary to loosen any one of them. Explorations revealed the location of the old 100-foot truss, which seems to have been swung down stream only a sufficient dis - tance to clear the roadway. It seems to be intact and in an upright position, though slightly warped and not quite level. The top of the "floor is from 15 to 18 feet below the stream bed and the floor beams probably rest on a substratum about 22 feet below the stream bed. The highest point of the two trusses is about 6 feet below the stream bed A professional diver was engaged to descend in both new tubes at the location of the washed out pier. These tubes fouled on ob - structions some 2 to 3 feet above the shale bed. He reported the obstructions to be steel piling lying prone under the lower edges of the tubes. These steel piling were conceded to be those from the old pier, but it could not be determined whether they were merely </seg>
            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER bent over, broken off or uprooted. Since these obstructions could not be removed by the diver, nor displaced by ramming or other prying methods applied, it was decided to reinforce the anchorage for the tube by driving interior vetrical steel piles within the tube and also a spider web system of exterior battered steel piles outside the tube, with tops projecting into the tubes and anchored to them both by welded connections and by surrounding with mass concrete filling. iThis entire work was done by State forces at an approximate saving of $10,000 below the lowest bid received. The expenditure for all the work was approximately $59,000. The Big Springs Bridge. This project consists of two separate structures over two branches of the South Platte river, on a county road south of Big Springs in Deuel county. The funds for this con - struction were obtained by taking advantage of a grant from PWA to Deuel county and an apportionment of the State's allotment of Works Progress Funds for secondary or feeder roads. The county furnished all right of way and such portion of the costs not covered in full from the above mentioned sources. Advantage was taken in the new construction to relocate the road on a more direct line south of Big Springs. The old structures abandoned were in very poor condition, and the flood of 1935 had caused considerable loss in the approach fills, to and between, the old bridges. The two new structures are 975 feet apart and are identical in appearance with the exception of the protection work at the abut - ments. Each superstructure consists of a series of deck steel girder, spans on open steel pile piers and with concrete encased steel pile abutments. The central span is 60 feet flanked by 50-and 45-foot spans respectively and symmetrically from the center, making an open waterway of 250 feet each, or a total opening of 500 feet. The contract price for this construction amounted to $43,275.60. The Inland Construction Company was the contractor for the bridges, grading and protection work. The Third City Sand and Gravel Com - pany furnished the guard raU. </seg>

            <seg id="p159">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OP TESTS ORGANIZATION The Division of Tests of the Department of Roads and Irrigation is located at the University of Nebraska. It operates as a subdivision of the Department of Engineering Mechanics of the College of En - gineering, and through an arrangement with the University of Ne - braska, the Materials Testing Laboratories of the Department of En - gineering Mechanics have been designated as the official Highway Testing Laboratory. Professor C. M. Duff, who supervises the Highway Testing La - boratory, has been designated by the Department of Roads and Irriga - tion as its Materials and Testing Engineer. During the school year in addition to handling the administration of the Division of Tests, Professor Duff also devotes part of his time to teaching in the De - partment of Engineering Mechanics. In the Division of Tests, there are four Assistant Testing En - gineers. Three of these Assistant Testing Engineers have each been assigned a group of materials. They pass upon the compliance of these materials with the requirements of the specifications, on the basis of the test results obtained in the laboratory. One of the Assistant Testing Engineers supervises the tests made in the labora - tory and directs the work of the laboratory assistants. He also writes some of the reports for special materials. Another assistant to the Testing Engineer is in charge of the stenographic force which types and mails the reports sent out by the Division of Tests. A chemist is also employed who makes chemical analyses where required and supervises the laboratory assistants in the bituminous laboratory. From thirty to forty laboratory and office assistants are em - ployed. This number varies by reason of the seasonal character of the work. During the school year over half of the employees' take some University work which will not permit their working full time. Employees of the Division of Tests, who are attending the Uni - versity as graduate or undergraduate students, earn part or all of their expenses. Many of the undergraduate students employed carry a full University schedule and only work during their spare time. This arrangement has proven satisfactory due to several reasons: First, the construction work is usually lighter during the school year and fewer tests are required. Second, the hours which the part - time assistants work in the laboratory can be so arranged that the laboratory equipment can be used to better advantage for class in - struction work and still be available for testing materials. Third, the students are given an opportunity to partially finance the cost </seg>

Fourth, it serves as a training school for engineers who upon graduation, due to their fundamental knowledge of testing, may be offered more remunerative positions in the construction and administrative work of the Department of Roads and Irrigation. The cooperative agreement between the University and the De - partment of Roads and Irrigation provides that the University furnish the necessary laboratory and office facilities, purchase the equip - ment and supplies required for making the tests, and pay the salaries and wages of the personnel employed in making laboratory tests and investigations and in making field- inspections of various materials and constructions. The Department of Roads and Irrigation furnishes all office supplies used in connection with the writing and sending out of reports but all office equipment is furnished by the University. As remuneration for this service, the Department of Roads and Irrigation pays the University in accordance with an agreed price schedule for the various tests made, and in addition pays a nominal monthly allowance and a per diem allowance for field Inspections. The men making the field Inspections are allowed traveling expenses the same as other employees of the Department of Roads and Irriga - tion, and this amount Is paid direct to the individual making the in - spection. The per test price schedule used is subject to a discount which varies with the number of tests made during each month. Although the larger portion of the testing of materials used in construction and maintenance work is done in the University labora - tories, the Division of Tests has found it desirable to maintain during the construction season, temporary laboratories at a number of cement mills and asphaltic oil refineries and other plants where materials are manufactured that can be advantageously tested prior to ship - ment. The primary reason for testing at the point of origin, rather than sampling at the destination and sending samples to the Uni - versity laboratory, is to permit the use of materials immediately upon delivery to the project. In some types of construction, field control is necessary, and to supply this need, temporary field laboratories are set up on the pro - ject. Such laboratories are maintained on most of the concrete paving, bituminous mat, and stabilized base course projects. Methods of mak - ing the necessary control tests have been devised so that the equip - ment required is not elaborate and is easily portable. In addition to these temporary laboratories located on the project, more perma - nent field laboratories are maintained at some of the larger gravel pits, and, In some cases, an inspector Is located at some central point </seg>
            <seg id="p161">» DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION and serves several pits. At other gravel pits, where the gravel ship - ments are intermittent or where gravel is being supplied for some large nearby project, a temporary laboratory equipped with a portable mechanical shaker is often set up so that the tests can be made at the pit. As a rule the field testing is under the supervision of the District Engineer in whose district the work is being done. Field testa made by the project engineers and inspectors are not reported through the Division of Tests and are not included in the summary of tests given in this report. A close control of the work done by the field labora - tories is made possible by the periodic submission of samples to the University laboratories for check tests or a more complete analysis. Most of the inspection of bridge piling and lumber is made by com - mercial testing laboratories which maintain inspectors at or near the source of production. Their reports are referred to the Division of Tests for review but are not included in the summary of tests in this report. The inspection of structural steel for bridges is usually made at the fabrication shop and is supervised by the Division of Bridge Design. FUNCTIONS The principal function of the Division of Tests is to inspect and make physical or chemical tests on all samples of material submitted in connection with the construction or' maintenance of highways and bridges, and to prepare reports showing the results obtained. Where definite requirements have been specified, recommendation is made for the acceptance or rejection of the material, depending on whether it does or does not conform to the specified requirements. If there are no definite requirements, tests are made which will give an index to the performance of the material in service. Another function is the testing of competitive materials or sup - plies as an aid to the selection of those which have the most merit and which are the most economical. New materials proposed for use in highway work are tested to aid in determining whether they might not be more satisfactory than materials already in use. During the past biennium, several materials, including ahatter proof safety, glass and truck flares, have been tested for compliance with State laws, which require that the material be approved before being used in this State. Other activities include the designing of new mixtures for con - crete, bituminous surfacing, or stabilized base course; the supervising of some experimental projects; and the writing and improving of specifications for materials. </seg>
            <seg id="p162">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Wherever possible, all physical tests and chemical analysis of materials are ; made in accordance with the methods adopted by the American Association of State Highway Officials or by the American Society of Testing Materials. In some instances, where no standard methods of test have been adopted by these organizations, it is neces - sary to utilize methods set up by other organizations or to improvise special tests in order to determine the suitability and acceptability of certain materials. SUMMARY OF TESTS The total number of laboratory tests made during the present biennium is slightly less than for the previous biennlum, but a great many more tests have been made in the field. A monthly summary of laboratory tests made during the past thirteen years is shown in tabular form in Table 27 and graphically in Figure No. 7. The seasonable variation in the number of tests performed each month, as shown in this graph, emphasizes the necessity of having a laboratory force of varying size to efficiently perform the number of tests shown by the peaks of the curve during the summer months without having unnecessary help during the winter months. Table 28 is a summary of the different materials tested and the number of tests made for each material. Figure Xo. 8 shows graphically the total number of tests made each biennium for the past fourteen years.

            <seg id="p165">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION GROWTH AND NEEDS . ■ j . Although this report does not show an increase in the number of tests made for the Department of Roads and Irrigation during the present biennium, it should not be assumed, from this fact that there has been no growth in the activities of the Highway Testing Labora - tory. The number of different materials submitted for test is con - stantly increasing. Tests are now made on most of the materials used by the Division of Maintenance. The services of the laboratory have been extended to the Board of Control and many of the supplies purchased by them are now bought on specifications and tested for compliance prior to use. Due to the overcrowded condition of the testing laboratory and the imperative need for more laboratory space, the University during the first half of his biennium allotted to the Highway Testing Labora - tory about one-third of the old boiler house, which was then being used as a garage. This space was converted into several laboratories, a moist storage room, a receiving and storage room for samples, locker room, shower, wash room, and toilet. One of these laboratories was equipped for testing bituminous aggregates which necessitated the installation of a blower fan and a complete hood system to eliminate the gases liberated by the ex - traction tests. Another laboratory is used for cement testing and is located adjacent to the moist storage room. The moist storage room is con - structed of hollow clay building tile and is equipped with sprays for maintaining high humidity. During the present year, on account of the overcrowded office accommodations and the still urgent need for additional laboratory space, the University allotted the remaining space in the old boiler house to the Highway Testing Laboratory. This space has now been built into separate rooms which are used for the chemical laboratory, bituminous laboratory, tool room, new receiving room, physical test - ing laboratory, and an office which Is used by the assistant testing engineer in charge of laboratory supervision. Several testing machines and other laboratory equipment have been moved to the new quarters, in order to provide additional office space in the Mechanic Arts Building. At the present time all the anticipated laboratory changes have not been I completed, but when they are, all available space In the old boiler house will have been used. Even at the present time the facilities for storing samples that may be required in connection with future construction, or that may be needed for research work, are * totally Inadequate, and the laboratory is constantly confronted with </seg>
            <seg id="p166">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER the problem of just what materials may safely be discarded. If the University is to continue this testing service it will be necessary to take some steps in the near future to provide more adequate quarters. EQUIPMENT During the present biennium a number of new machines and other testing equipment have been added to the laboratory in order to more satisfactorily test and analyze the various materials submitted. The following is a parial list and description of the principal additions: Henry L. Scott Motor-driven Tensile Testing Machine. This ma - chine has capacities from 0 to 100 pounds and from 0 to 400 pounds, with a 12-inch travel of the movable head and an automatic revers - ing lever which can be set to reverse the machine when the movable head reaches any desired position. The machine is equipped with a special gear box for producing testing speeds of 1, 2, 6, 12, and '20 inches per minte. The machine is used for testing subgrade paper and all types of fabric, rubber, yarns, and soft wires within its tensile capacity. Uraun Chipmunk Crusher and Braun Sample Grinder, both Motor Driven. The crusher is used for producing crushed rock samples and for pulverizing soil aggregations which are free from gravel or rocft particles. The grinder is used chiefly for reducing coal samples to the required fineness for testing. Page Motor-driven Cementation Testing Machine. This machine is equipped with a revolution counter and also with an automatic cut-off which operates immediately upon the failure of specimen. The machine is used for determining the cementation of clays and soils. Tag-Saybolt Thermostatically Controlled Visrosimeter. This ma - chine has a two-tube capacity and is of the same type as the one already in use in the laboratory. The increasing number of samples of asphaltic oil submitted for test necessitated the additional unjt. International Electric Centrifuge, Size Xo. 2. This machine is equipped with a rheostat for controlling speeds up to r&gt;000 R.P.M. and also with a number of interchangeable heads. It is being used regularly in soil testing for determining the centrifuge moisture equivalent, in paint testing for the separation of pigment and vehicle, and in testing Diesel fuels for determining water content and bottom settlings. Kaville-LeVally Lubricant Tester. This machine is used for measuring the film strength of lubricating oils and greases. It also measures, the torque developed during the test. </seg>
            <seg id="p167">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION Indiana Oxidation Test Bath. This apparatus is electrically heated and thermostatically controlled, and is an eight-unit type with a separate air-flow meter for each unit. It is used for determin - ing the tendency of lubricating oils to oxidize or sludge when air is passed through the hot oil. Soil Equipment. Several pieces of soil sampling and testing equipment have also been obtained for use in connection with soil testing. Southwark-Emery Universal Testing Machine, 100,000-pound Ca - pacity. At the present time this machine is being installed in the recently constructed laboratory in the old boiler house. The machine is of special design having a testing space of 42 inches between columns with a compression opening capable of testing a length" of GO inches. It is of the hydraulic type, equipped with a special weigh - ing cell which is entirely independent of the loading cylinder. The testing loads are shown on dial gauges, the machine being equipped with three dials of different capacities. The testing speed of the machine may be varied between zero and the maximum by simply opening or closing valves which control the supply of oil admitted to the loading cylinder. The machine will be used principally for testing reinforcing steel, making stability and density tests on soil and bituminous aggregate samples, and for testing sewer and culvert pipe which are less than 30 inches in diameter. RESEARCH No planned research program has been carried out under the present testing arrangements, as no special funds were made avail - able for research work. What little research work has been carried on has been done largely in connection with routine testing. This method of carrying on research does not always permit sufficient time being devoted to the research problem to carry it to a successful conclusion, or to compile the information obtained so that it may be passed on to others. Many of the investigations which have been undertaken were only carried far enough to obtain the actual in - formation desired and then interrupted or discontinued, due to the press of routine work or the lack of available funds for further re - search. This practice may result in the use of misleading data due to the investigation being discontinued before sufficient Information has been obtained. If funds were made available for a well organized research pro - gram, the information obtained would be of much value to the State and the benefits derived should far exceed the cost. Much of the research work which has been done by other States and by national organizations should be correlated to fit the peculiar!- </seg>

Nebraska has an abundance of certain kinds of road surfacing materials which need to be studied in order that they may be used to the greatest possible advantage. During the past year more attention and importance has been attached to the construction of road foundations for all types of sur - facing. It follows that with improved foundations it should be pos - pible to construct less expensive surfaces. This, however, will re - quire much research work and study both of subgrades already in service under existing surfaces and of the materials used in the con - struction of new grades and surfaces. This will require careful soil rulntlnc Kxpeiimrntal (ciiti'r Stripe on Bltnmlnous Pavpnu-nt analysis and the classification of soils as to type and also the deter - mination of the degree of compaction that can be obtained by varying the moisture content during construction. Little information is as yet available regarding the tendency of the various types of soil to swell and whether the amount of swell varies with the amount of compaction given the soil at the time it is placed in the embankment. More research is needed in connection with the construction of low cost roads such as the bituminous mats and the armor coated stabilized base. Several short sections of experimental roads have been built near Lincoln under the supervision of the testing laboratory. They include a stabilized surface course treated with calcium chloride and several </seg>
            <seg id="p169">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION bituminous mats using various types of asphalt and tar products. In most of this experimental work the gradation of the aggregate was varied in different sections in order to obtain more information con - cerning its effect upan the behavior of the surfacing. In an! effort to obtain a more satisfactory white center line strip - ing paint than was being offered under existing specifications, seven paint manufacturers were asked to supply products that they con - sidered most satisfactory for this purpose together with their specifi - cation which would insure the production of a product of equal quality on future orders. In addition to making laboratory tests on the various paints, field teBts were also made in cooperation with the Division of Maintenance. I ' ■ - In making the field tests, several projects of bituminous surfaces were selected in order to include the different types of aggregates and asphaltic products used in their construction. About eleven miles of center stripe was applied so that each paint would have about equal representation on each different type of bituminous surface. The field rating was based on the durability, visibility both during the day and at night, ease of application, and drying time. It might be of interest to note that some of the most satisfactory products were in the lower price group while one of the more expensive paints was the least durable. </seg>
            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER DIVISION OP RIGHT OF WAY The Division of Right of Way was originated in April, 1927, immediately following legislation permitting the Department of Public Works (now the Department of Roads and Irrigation) to condemn private property for public roads and road material. Prior to that time, the burden of acquiring right of way had been upon the county, with occasional financial assistance from the State. The right of way activities cover a large range, including the purchase of city property with comparatively high value, to farm property with lesser value, and also including purchases of materials for gravel and bituminous surfacing. Right of way for changing water courses, borrow dirt and clay surfacing are also obtained by the Division of Right of Way. The condemnation law is used only as a last resort. A repre - sentative of the Department of Roads and Irrigation always contacts the land owner in an effort to make a direct settlement, but if they are unable to agree as to the amount of damages the condemnation law is invoked. In direct settlements, payment is made direct to the land owner but if the property is acquired through condemnation payment is made through" the court. The Federal government does not participate in the purchase of right of way for State or Federal roads. All right of way records are kept in the Lincoln office of the Department of Roads and Irrigation and include contracts with the land owners or their representatives, railroad leases and right of way deeds. The expenditures for right of way during the 1935-1936 biennium total $656,081.89, and cover 3,247 separate transactions. The amount of money expended is slightly less than in the 1933-1934 biennium. hut the number of transactions is slightly larger.

            <seg id="p173">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION PAY-KOIili DIVISION The Emergency Relief and Construction Act of July 21, 1932, carried an appropriation providing for highway construction. The special provisions issued by the United States Bureau of Public Roada stipulated certain labor requirements that the contractor was called upon to observe in the performance of his contract. In order to as - certain that these requirements were fulfilled, the contractor was re - quired to submit to the Department of Roads and Irrigation at Lincoln a certified transcript of his labor payrolls. These transcripts were checked for labor violations before a copy was submitted to the United States Bureau of Public Roads. Under the National Recovery Acts of 1934 and 1935, appropria - tions were made to provide for construction of National Recovery Highway Projects, and the special provisions set up by the Federal Government, to govern such construction, carried similar requirements. The Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 allotted funds for the construction of public highways and elimination of hazards at railroad crossings. One of the chief objectives in financing these projects was to provide, to as great an extent as possible, employ - ment for employable persons on the relief rolls. The requirements in the special provisions on this program were of such a nature that the pay-roll division was !set up as a separate unit on September 1G, 19 35, occupying the east side of the sixth floor of the State Capitol Building at Lincoln. This program provided that one man year of employment, or the equivalent thereto, should be provided for each $1400 of money al - lotted. In the building of structures for the separation of highway and railroad grades, a relatively high proportion of the normal ex - penditure is for material and a relatively low proportion is for labor; therefore, the restrictions regarding labor were removed from that part of the appropriation apportioned to the elimination of hazards at railroad crossings. The special provisions under these funds stipulated the labor re - quirements that the contractor was to fulfill. Labor pay-roll transr cripts, signed by the contractor or his authorized representative, are submitted, along with necessary supporting data, to this office, where they are checked for labor violations. In addition, the special provisions of the contracts let for the construction of highways carried the stipulated number of man hours of labor, calculated on the $1400 per year per man basis, that the contractor must accumulate in the completion of his contract. It was then necessary for the pay-roll division to keep a record of the number of man-hours accumulated by the contractor as shown by his weekly pay-roll transcripts, and, at the completion of the job, furnish the total </seg>
            <seg id="p174">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER number of man-hours credited to the contractor, and if deficiencies in the" number of man-hours occurred, the proper deduction was made from the money due the contractor. The Bureau of Public Roads recognized that a higher type of construction work would result in certain types of work if the con - tractor did not have to meet the necessary man-hour requirements as calculated on the $1400 per man per year basis. To alter this condition, the Bureau of Public Roads made it possible for the De - partment of Roads and Irrigation to prepare an alternate plan agree - ment for the utilization of Works Program Highway funds, or a portion thereof. This agreement provided that the Department of Roads and Irrigation would submit and construct other projects, using State Construction funds, State Maintenance funds, regular Federal Aid funds, and Emergency Federal Aid funds, which, in aggregate, would take from the relief rolls and employ the State's full quota of individuals for the amount of Works Program Highway funds used as alternate plan, as determined by the $1400 per year man on the basis of 1440 man-hours per year. The Department of Roads and Irrigation must furnish certified copies of all pay rolls on which work relief labor is employed. With the alternate plan, the regular plan, the grade crossing projects, and on virtually all work undertaken by the Department of Roads and Irrigation, pay-roll transcripts are required. These pay-roll transcripts are submitted weekly to this office, where they are carefully checked for labor violations. If violations appear, an explanation must be submitted by the contractor before that transcript or any succeeding transcripts are accepted. The pay-roll transcripts are then summarized to show the number of per - sons, the number of hours of employment, and the money earned under the classifications of administrative, skilled, intermediate grade, and unskilled labor, and sub-divisions of relief, nonrelief, and all other labor under each of these groups. Accumulative totals are carried from each preceding weekly pay roll. One copy _ of the pay - roll transcript and summary is then placed on file in this office, and copies forwarded to the Bureau of Public Roads. From the summaries, ledgers are kept by projects, under the classifications of funds. From these ledgers statistical data is taken. Once each month a report is forwarded to the Bureau of Public Roads, showing in detail the man-hours of employment accumulated under the alternate plan agreement. This statement is checked and brought into agreement with the records of the Bureau of Public Roads and credit allowed the Department of Roads and Irrigation for the num - ber of man-hours of employment stated therein. ;..: Prior to August 1, 1936, 6223 pay-roll transcripts have been summarized and copies forwarded to the Bureau of Public Roads. </seg>
            <seg id="p175">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION and 2,561,27(5 man-hours of labor have been accumulated under the alternate plan agreement. On Works Program Highway Projects operating under the al - ternate plan.i the State was allowed to specify a minimum number of man-hours of employment to be given to persons directly employed on the contract, secured from the designated employment agency or certified for assignment to the work by such an emergency. The pur - pose of this provision was to afford a means of assuring the required amount of employment on Works Program Highway Projects, as well as to maintain a close check on their employment credit. For these projects requiring a minimum number of hours of employmnet, at the completion of the contract, an audit is made determining the number of man-hours credited to the contractor and, if deficiencies occur, the proper deduction is made from the money due the con - tractor. From data compiled in this office, data forms are made out on all Works Program Projects to accompany the Final Federal Voucher. These forms show the hours of employment furnished and the amount of wages paid on each project, and the quantity and cost of materials entering into the construction. All final estimates to contractors on projects or patrols that enter into the Works Program Funds pass through this division, and must receive its O.K. before final payment is made to the' contractor.

In licet rdance with the statutes passed in 1919, the Treasurers of the various counties were appointed by the Department of Public Works to act as agents of the department, for the purpose of regis - tering motor vehicles and for the collection of all automobile regis - tration fees in the counties. The Legislature provided that, while acting as agents for the Department of Public Works, the county treasurers should retain from the funds collected for automobile registrations five cents for each original motor vehicle registration, such money to be accounted for as other fees passing through their hands. After five cents was deducted the county treasurers should transmit to the State Treasurer, two and one-half per cent of all such funds collected by them. This two and one-half per cent was to be credited to the State general fund, and when appropriated was to be used by the Department of </seg>
            <seg id="p240">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER Public Works to pay the cost of administration of the .Motor Vehicle Law together with the cost of all automobile license plates, and the supervision of the maintenance of the State highways. The 1025 Legislature provided that after January 1. 1926, thirty' per cent of the balance remaining (after deduction of the five cents by the county treasurer for each registration and the two and one - half per cent for the state general fund) should' be transmitted by the county treasurers of the various counties to the State Treasurer and credited to the State highway fund out of which fund is allowed claims for the maintenance of the State highway system. In 1922 the State wenf from central distribution of automobile license plates to distribution directly by the county treasurers. In 1922 the Department of Public Works made a ruling thai motor vehicle license plates for each county be designated by a num - ber assigned according to the relative number of motor vehicles registered in each county at that time, as — Douglas 1-1 and up, Lan - caster 2-1 and up, Gage 3-1 and up, etc. Duplicates of all motor vehicle registration certificates are for - warded to the Department of Roads and Irrigation, where they are filed numerically by the registration number for each county, and alphabetically by the name of the applicant. Also, a record of each make or kind of car is filed according to the motor number witli a cross reference in each instance to the registration number assigned to such motor vehicle. The records are kept by card index and are open to the public during reasonable business hours. The new system of using two forms of receipts for motor vehicle registration, which requires but one writing of the receipt for renewals, was brought about by agitation on the part of several county treasurers ten year.-; ago, when they claimed the law did not require them to furnish more than one copy. As a result of this agitation, the department worked out a system that would meet with its demands and make possible a reduction of the work. This was the two forms of receipt which, for the greater majority of certificates written, requires bill one operation. There has been a growing enthusiasm for this new system on the part of the county treasurers ever since it was insti - tuted. Incidentally, it has greatly reduced the work in this office and makes it possible to keep the records in a much more up-to-date condition. It. also eliminates employing extra help for six or seven months each year. The following are some of the changes made in the laws in in::.",: The law was changed giving a semi-annual reduction only </seg>

The fee for Driller's additional number plates and certifi - cate of registration was changed to $3.00, with no reduction . during the year. The 'law was enacted requiring a fee of *Humi for every vehicle towed on the highways of Nebraska, together with a certificate of insurance covering vehicle towed. A law was enacted requiring motor busses, cars for hire having a capacity of over seven passengers, cars or trucks used ap wreckers or for towing purposes, and motor trucks or com - binations thereof operating on the highways during the period from one-half hour after sunset to one-half hour before sunrise to be at all times equipped with at least three portable flares. Between one-half hour after sunrise and one-half hour before sunset, all vehicles described above shall be equipped with red Hags. A law was passed requiring the use of power brakes, auxiliary brakes, or some standard booster brake equipment for trucks or busses having a gross weight of truck and load exceeding twelve thousand pounds. The signal law was amended to read as follows: . Left turn.- -Arm and hand extended horizontally. Right turn. — Hand and arm extended upward. Stop or decrease speed.- -Hand and arm extended down - ward. Th&lt;- Motor Vehicle Operator's License Law was enacted by the 1929 Legislature, effective September 1, 1929. All applications for license to operate a motor vehicle made by persons resident in a county are transmitted to the county treasurer of each county and a distinguishing number assigned to each license issued. The applica - tion is accompanied by a fee of seventy-five cents of which fifty cents i!-- retained by the county treasurer, who credits twenty-five cents to the county road fund, which is included in his report of fees as pro - vided by lew, and twenty-five cents is credited to the county general fund. jThf remaining twenty-five cents is remitted by the county treasurer to the State Treasurer and. credited by him to the motor vehicle operators' license fund, and the Department of Roads and Irrigation ts authorized to draw upon this fund for all expenses of printing, recording, and general operation of the law. Seven I hundred ten thousand four hundred seventeen operators' licenses have been issued from September 1, 1929 to October 1, 1936. The operator's license is for the period of the licensee's continuous legal residence in the State of Nebraska. </seg>

            <seg id="p251">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION HIGHWAY PLANNING SURVEY The Department of Roads and Irrigation in cooperation with the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, is now making a State-wide highway planning survey. The purpose of this survey is to gather a large quantity of detailed information and to compile and tabulate this in - formation in such shape as to make it available to the properly con - stituted authorities in forming a long range highway program, in - cluding both construction and maintenance. Funds were made available by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads by setting aside 1% per cent of the 1936 Federal-Aid, Works Pro - gram Highway and Works Program Grade Crossing funds. The State of Nebraska was required to match the 1% per cent portion of the 19 36 Federal Aid fund. A WPA project was approved to sup - plement the funds provided by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads and funds from this source were allotted about August 1, 1936. The planning survey to be carried out by the use of the above funds, is made up of a number of related studies, including a rural road inventory, a traffic survey, a study of soils used in the construc - tion of roads, and a motor vehicle accident study. The rural road inventory consists of gathering information about the physical characteristics of all rural roads as well as State high - ways in the entire State. Mileage of roads separated as to surface types, surface widths, and road systems is recorded. Information as to the number of types, of drainage structures as well as the physical condition of the material in the structures is obtained. All struc - tures and amusement or educational centers, that would have a bear - ing on traffic conditions, are located. Excessive curvature and heavy grades are measured and located. Detailed information is obtained at railroad grade crossings, showing sight distances and approach grades. The information gathered on the inventory will be transferred to county and state maps, giving a complete picture of the entire road system in the State. Desirable information from this inventory will also be compiled and tabulated to give a complete physical record of the investment in public roads throughout the State. The field work of the inventory started March 4, 1936 and will be completed about Nov. 15, 1936. The State and county maps being prepared for the rural road inventory are being constructed with the use of the Lambert con - formal conic projection system and use will be made of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulatlon system as a base outline and all other available sources of material, such as railroad alignment and highway plan and profile sheets are used in building an accurate </seg>
            <seg id="p252">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER skeleton map of each county. The detailed information is then added using the best sources available including. Geologic Survey quad - rangle maps, "soil maps and rural road inventory data. The mapping work will be carried on throughout the winter and will be completed about July 1, 1937. Another phase of this program, the traffic survey, will not only give the amount of traffic on State highways and rural roads but will also furnish valuable information as to the character and type of traffic. This includes origin and destination information, weights of vehicles, including wheel and axle loads, weight of the load and the kind of commodity carried, and outside dimensions of vehicles using the roads. To obtain the information required on the traffic survey, the amount of traffic is ascertained at various stations on both the State Highway System and rural roads. As a matter of economy there are no long continuous counts at any station, but instead a method of sampling is used, by which a small number of short counts taken at intervals throughout the year gives sufficient information to cal - culate the average daily traffic for the entire year at each station. The character and type of traffic is obtained by a party of men oper - ating portable weighing scales called loadometers. This party also records the detail as to the origin and destination, commodities carried and other information useful in analyzing the character and sourco of traffic on the highways. The traffic survey was started about April 1, 1936, and operates for a period of one year. Another phase of the planning survey that is interrelated with the traffic survey and the rural road inventory, but yet is of great importance in itself, is the motor vehicle accident study. The purpose of the accident study is four fold. First: All accidents of which the survey has record, will be lo - cated on a spot map and a record made as to their location and type. By this means, high-frequency accident locations can be spotted and a study of the surrounding physical conditions be made with a view to applying remedies for bad local situations. Second: Detailed analysis of the accident reports will be made to find interrelations between such items as drivers actions, sur - rounding physical conditions, mechanical properties of the automo - biles involved, time of day and type of accidents, from which con - clusions may be drawn and recommendations made for improving drivers laws, and other means of traffic control. Third: The study will furnish the proper organizations such as the safety councils and enforcement officials with statistical infor- </seg>
            <seg id="p253">DEPARTMENT OK ROADS AND IRRIGATION ■nation for educational purposes. This information will not only give the number of accidents with resulting injuries and deaths but will also give a detailed analysis as to the surrounding conditions and the apparent causes. Fourth: Still another purpose is to apply the results of the study of this accident information to the design of future highways and the improvement of the existing highways if found necessary. Each phase of the Highway Planning Survey, in itself, furnishes valuable information for some definite purpose or purposes, and because of the fact that all of the phases are being operated concur - rently, it will be possible to correlate much of the information from several different phases in a way that would be impossible if the phases were carried on separately. For instance, the mileage and road type information from the rural road inventory can be com - bined with the traffic density information from the traffic survey and give as a result the total mileage of roads tabulated by amount of vehicles operating over each mileage group per day. Up to and including Oct. 10. 1936, 127,451 man hours had been f-mployed on the planning survey of which 16,339 man hours were furnished by the WPA. </seg>

            <seg id="p255">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION STATE PLANNING BOARD As the emergency conditions of 1933 were instrumental in bring - ing about the State planning movement in Nebraska it seems ad - visable to review the development of the State Planning Board since that time, before reporting on the activities and accomplishments in State planning work during his biennium. The National Planning Board was established as an emergency within the Federal government as a part of the Public Works Ad - ministration by Presidential order on July 20, 1933 for the purpose or aiding in the outlining of policies of procedure and in developing nation-wide plans for the relief of the unemployment by means of public works construction and other projects of a public nature. Early in December, 1933, this board made the suggestion to the Gov - ernors of the various States that they establish State Planning Boards within their State governments for the purpose of cooperating with the National Planning Board in the development of the plans for their State. Coincident with this suggestion the Public Works Ad - ministration allotted funds to be used for the employment of planning consultants to be assigned by the National Planning Board to quali - fied planning agencies. The items entering into the "qualifications" were assurances from the Governor of each State that: 1. A State Planning Board would be appointed. The mem - bers to serve without compensation. 2. The Chairman of the State Planning Board would be ap - pointed as its representative on a Regional or Inter- State Planning Committee if such a committee was or - ganized. 3. A planning program would be developed. 4. Staff workers such as draftsmen and typists would be assigned from existing State agencies or would be pro - cured through the Civil Works Administration. 5. Legislation designed to place State planning on a con - tinuing basis would be sponsored by the Governor if the State Planning Board was established and placed in opera - tion. A large number of States, including Nebraska, received favorably the suggestion that State Planning Boards be established as it pre - sented an opportunity to take an active and effective part in the planning of developments within the State which would be of value from both the State and Federal viewpoints and in which the ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p256">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER penditure of funds by both agencies would aid in relieving the un - employment situation. The first Nebraska State Planning Board was appointed by Gov - ernor Charles W. Bryan on February 17, 1934. The membership of this board was: — W. H. Smith, State Tax Commissioner, Lincoln. Chairman; R. L. Cochran, State Engineer, Lincoln; J. IS. Douglas. State Game, Forestation and Parks Commission, Tecumseh; A. F. Buehler, Publisher, Grand Island; J. E. Davlson, Public Utilities Operator, Omaha, and Gene Huse, Publisher. Norfolk. This board was unable to become active as funds were not available for Its use, and therefore, it could not comply -with the requirements that had been designated as precedent to the assignment of a planning consultant to the board by the National Planning Board. On June 30. 1934, the President established the National Re - sources Board by executive order. This board replaced the National Planning Board and was directed to carry on the work of its pre - decessor. Mr. Harold L. Ickes, Secretary of the Interior was desig - nated as Chairman of the board, the other members were: — George H. Dern, Secretary of War; Henry A. Wallace, Secretary of Agricul - ture; Daniel C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce; Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor; Harry L. Hopkins, Federal Emergency Relief Administrator; Frederic A. Delano; Charles E. Merriam and Wesley C. Mitchell. The National Resources Board continued to encourage the de - velopment of State planning along the lines established by the Na - tional Planning Board. Although the Nebraska Planning Board had been unable to become active, the National Resources Board assigned Mr. Arthur Anderson of the Agricultural College of the University of Nebraska to the board as Land Planning Consultant in August 1934. Mr. Anderson prepared and submitted two reports on land use in Nebraska to the National Resources Board. The second State Planning Board, which was appointed by Gov - ernor R. L. Cochran in January, 1935, shortly after the beginning of the current biennium, was made up of the following persons :-• A. C. Tilley, State Engineer, Lincoln. Chairman; H. H. Tracy, City Engineer, Norfolk; Earl Mallery, City Manager, Alliance; F. E. Ziegenbein, Mayor, Nebraska City; A. F. Buehler, Publisher, Grand Island; John A. Rine, Attorney, Omaha; Henry G. Smith, Publisher, Hastings; G. E. Condra, Director of the Division of Conservation and Survey of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln: and W. W. Burr, Dean of the College of Agriculture of the University of Nebraska. Lincoln. The 1935 Legislature appropriated $15,000 for the use of the State Planning Board during the biennium. of which amount not </seg>
            <seg id="p257">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION over $7,500 was to be expended during one year. This appropriation made it possible for the board to become active to a limited degree. The first activity of the board was the compilation of a State - wide inventory of desirable pubiic works projects. This inventory was made in February, 1935 and was carried on as a cooperative ac - tivity with the Public Works Administration. Questionnaires were mailed to each governmental subdivision of the State by the l'ublic Works Administration. These questionnaires were returned to the Planning Hoard for classification in accordance with a code furnished by the 1'W'A. 1'ublic meetings were held in Lincoln, North Platte. Columbus and Hastings for the purpose of obtaining further in - formation from tiie sponsors of the projects listed on the question - naires so that the proper classifications could be made. The estimated cost of the projects proposed was about $81,500,000. No attempt was made to ascertain the relative desirability or feasibility of the proposed projects as it was necessary to forward the report to the L'ublic Works Administration by .March 1, in order to permit them to incorporate it in a nation-wide inventory. Although an accurate check has not been made, it is known that a considerable number of the projects listed in the inventory have subsequently been partially or completely constructed with the aid of Federal funds. It is believed that the inventory was of .ureat benefit to the State in procuring this federal aid and in directing the attention of the citizens of the State in tin' practical benefits of cooperative planning work. On June ~. 1935i the National Resources Hoard was superseded iy the National Resources Committee as a result of Presidential order. However, the membership and policies of the Committee were the same as those of the superseded Hoard. The functions and duties of tin" Committee were outlined in the executive order as follows: 1. "To collect, prepare and make available to the President, with recommendations, such plans, data and information as may be helpful to a planned development of the use of land, water and any other national resources, and such related subjects as may be referred to it by the President. l\ "To consult and cooperate with agencies of the Federal government, with the States and Municipalities or agencies thereof, and with any public or private planning or research agencies in carrying out any of its duties and functions. ". "To receive and record all proposed Federal projects in - volving the acquisition of land (including transfer of land jurisdiction i and land research projects, and in an ad- </seg>

Federal assistance for State planning in Nebraska was obtained from the National Resources Committee and the Works Progress Ad - ministration in January, 1936. This assistance resulted in the as - signment of a part-time planning: consultant to the State board by the National Resources Committee and the approval by the Works Progress Administration of a work project proposal which provided for the furnishing of a staff and necessary supplies to the State Plan - ning Board. The membership of the State Planning Board was changed by the resignations of Mr. Uuehler and Mr. Mallery and the appointment of Mr. Carl H. Swanson. Attorney. Culbertson, anil Mr. Archer L. Burnhani, Superintendent of Schools. Scottsbluff, early in January. 1036. These new members met with the board for the first time on February 14, 1936 at which time a program of studies was adopted. The selection and appointment of M. S. Dodd as Associate Consultant and Acting Director in charge of the activities of the staff furnished by the Works Progress Administration was also made at this meeting. Offices were obtained and opened on the sixth floor of the State Capitol. The planning program adopted at this meeting included tin - following subjects: I. Population and Social Trends. (a).

The work involved falls naturally into three distinct parts. The first step is the collection of all available factual information concerning our natural and human resources. The second step is the analyzation of the. factual data collected, to determine the nature of the problems presented and to determine current trends of changes affecting these problems. The third step is the actual planning — the development and suggestion of plans of procedure designed to bring about the cor - rection of any misuse of our resources that may exist, or to minimize the effects of adverse conditions which cannot he eliminated. The planning board staff has been continuously engaged in the Work involved in tne first step outlined above since the first assign - ment of workers was made by the Works Progress Administration early .in- February, 11936. A great amount of basic information has been collected concerning all of the subjects included in the program adopted by the board. This work has progressed farther on certain subjects than on others as there has been an immediate demand for information concerning them. Tin- water resources study has been given the most attention to date. The selection of this subject as the first study to be carried through the second and third phases of planning as outlined above wns due to two reasons. The first consideration being the fact that Nebraska has reached the point in its development where it is im - perative that improved methods of controlling and utilizing the avail - able water supply, .both surface and underground, be developed. The second consideration was the fact that the National Resources Com - mittee had inaugurated a similar study on a nation-wide basis and ujis 111 a position to furnish technical assistance in return for the privilege of carrying on their study in Nebraska through the plan - ning board. A State Water Resources Committee was appointed by the Chair - man of the board. The members of this committee are: R. H. Willis, Chief. Bureau of Irrigation. Water Power and Drainage, Bridgeport, Chairman; H. B. I-oper, District Engineer. United States Engineers office, Omaha; R. I. Meeker. Consulting Engineer, Denver, Colorado; Robert Follansbee, District Engineer, U. S. Geological Survey, Denver. Colorado; G. E. Condra. Director, Division of Conservation and Survey, University of Nebraska. Lincoln; C. E. Mickey, Chairman of Depart - ment of Civil Engineering. University of Nebraska, Lincoln. The Chairman of the Planning Board is a member of the Committee ex - officio. The Committee acts in an advisory capacity. </seg>
            <seg id="p268">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER The Water Resources study is very comprehensive. It gives con - sideration to topography, geology, climate, vegetative cover and human occupancy in the drainage basins; the origin, supply, quality, avail - ability, control and uses made of both surface water and ground water. The State was divided into ten major drainage basin districts for the purpose of carrying on the study. Due to the comparatively brief period of time that has elapsed since this study was started it has not been possible to make the studies of each of the basin districts equally exhaustive i&gt;r to entirely complete any one of them. However, a pre - liminary progress report has been prepared and made available to th&gt;* National Resources Committee for incorporation in their natlon-vlde report to the President on December 1. lOHC. This report is also available to the public. A State-wide study of the incidence of Tuberculosis has also been completed with the exception of t lie writing of the final report. Ques - tionnaires were mailed to every medical and osteopathic 'practitioner in the State, also to all hospitals, sanitariums, and other institution^ cominj: in contact with the tuberculous. This is the first time thai a survey of this type has been made in the State. It will be of great benefit to all agencies concerned with the prevention, control mid eradication of the disease. It will be especially Valuable to those agencies providing hospltalizatlon for the tuberculous as an aid in planning for their future needs. As mentioned previously, progress has also been made on the other studies included in the adopted program. Nearly a hundred special maps, graphs and charts have been prepared and will be ised in "future topical reports.

Water Supply The snowfall in the higher elevations of the North Platte River basin asj of April 1, was sixty-five per cent of normal in 1935, and eighty-seven per cent of normal in 193'i. The runoff above the Path - finder Reservoir for the year ending September 30, 1935, was 696,000 acre-feet, or fifty-two per cent of the twenty-six years mean (1911 - 1936 i ; and for the year ending September 30, 1936, the runoff was 1,045,000 acre-feet, or seventy-eight per cent of the twenty-six year mean. Approximately 512,000 acre-feet of water were impounded in the Pathfinder, Reservoir in 1935, which quantity is eighty-six per cent ot the twenty-six year mean (1911-1936); and approximately 482,000 acre-feet of water were impounded in 1936, which quantity is 81 per cent of the twenty-six year mean. In addition to the water im - pounded in the Pathfinder Reservoir, there were approximately 55,000 acre-feet impounded in the Guernsey Reservoir in 1935, and approxi - mately 124,000 acre-feet in 1936. The quantity of storage water passing the Wyoming-Nebraska Line in the North Platte River, as obtained from the records in the Guernsey office of the United State Reclamation Bureau, was 49,000 acre-feet in 1935, and 75,000 acre-feet in 1936. In 1935, the Platte River was dry at Overton from July 15 to August 27, and in 1936, it was dry after June 20 to the end of the water year. In 1935, the North Platte River was dry at Sutherland most of the time from July 15 to September 25, and in 1936, It was "(WQJg after June 20. to the end of the water year. </seg>
            <seg id="p274">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER The flow of the South Platte River at Nprth Platte for 193fi was 95 per cent of the nineteen year mean (1918-1936), and in 1936 it was eighteen per cent of the nineteen year mean. The South Platte River at Julesburg for the year 1935 was eighty-three per cent of the thirty-five year mean (1902-1936), and for the year 1936 it was twenty-four per cent of the thirty-five year mean. The Western Irrigation District diverts from the South Platte River just east of the Colorado-Nebraska Line, and the records show less water diverted by this project in 1935 and 1936 than in 193:; and 1934. The diversion by the Western Irrigation District was 1.77 acre-feet per acre in 1935, and 1.65 acre-feet per acre in 1936. A greater number of pumps were operated in the State during 1936 season than any other season. Pump installations lift water from both underground flow and stream flow. Many pumps were installed on the banks of drain ditches and used in 1936 under junior canals closed by the department. Since the character of drainage water is in dispute, the department has given no supervision to pump irrigation from drainage ditches.

The runoff above the Oliver Reservoir was 12,050 acre-feet in i935, and 9,400 acre-feet in 1936. The Whitney Reservoir is an off-channel reservoir on the White River, located about three miles west of Whitney. It has a capacity ot 10,000 acre-feet. In 1935, 9,440 acre-feet of water were impounded in the reservoir, and in 193ti, there were S.700 acre-feet impounded. The Bennett Reservoir is constructed astride Lodgepole Creek anil has a capacity of G70 acre-feet. The storage water is used as a supplemental supply for natural flow rights under Applications 691 and 1975. The department received no reports as to the quantity Of water stored during the biennium. I Crescent Lake is a natural sand hill reservoir. It depends on precipitation for its water supply. The precipitation has been con - siderably below normal the past two or three years, and the quantity of 'water in the reservoir has become less each year due to.evapora - tion and some diversions for irrigation. The department has issued an order denying further diversions from Crescent Lake by the Lake Water Carrying Company pending the construction of new headgates. Records of the quantity of water withdrawn from Crescent Lake are published elsewhere in this report. - The Kilpatrick Reservoir is an off-channel reservoir located on the Frenchman River. The water stored is used as a supplemental supply for laud covered by Docket 47. The department has not received satisfactory records of withdrawals from this reservoir. Water Distribution •# The available water supply of all streams in the state was below normal for the year 19 36. The greatest deficiency was in the Platte River basin. The distribution of the water supply In the Platte and North Platte basins for the biennium ending September 30, 1936, required closer supervision than usual. The first closing order of 1935 in the Platte River basin was on the 11th day of July, although the deficiency became acute about the 20th of June. In 1936, the deficiency began during the last few - days of April and continued throughout the growing season. Very litttle natural flow was received by water users in Nebraska having priorities subsequent to October 17, 1889, and senior to December </seg>
            <seg id="p276">REPORT OF THE STATE ENGINEER ■•:•'. '■ ■ ■ • ■ , 31, 1892. Priorities subsequent to 1892 were practically without water after May 1, except those projects having storage rights. Pour acting water commissioners were on duty every day, iu - cluding Sundays and holidays, in the Platte and North Platte River basin, from May 1 to September 30, 1935, and 1936, supervising] the distribution of the available water supply. One water commissioner was on duty from May 1 to 30, both years, in Kimball County; and one water commissioner on the Frenchman and Repub - lican during the growing seasons of both years. The Niobrara River. White River, Hat Creek, and tributaries, in the northwestern part of the State, were supervised by the water superintendent through 1 - the two years. No investigation of the water disposal was made for the years 1935 and 1936 on the South Platte River. During this biennium, the demands on our department were so great and the work was j in - creased to such an extent that our present organization was unable to take care of all of the demands. The work moat urgent was given attention first. Obviously it was necessary to leave soiuo work unfinished. Administration of the waters of the Big Blue. Little Blue, Elk - horn, and the Loup basins lias been somewhat neglected, although many demands were made. Hydrography The Department of Roads and Irrigation employs only one iy - drographer full time,_ and employs one man who is used half time as an hydrographer. Under the cooperative agreement between the State of Nebraska and the United States Geological Survey, two hy - drographers were furnished by the Survey during the biennium. One operated on the North Platte River between the Wyoming-Nebraska Line and Lisco, Nebraska, and the other operated in the east one - third of the State. Through the cooperative agreement, Nebraska has received the services of two hydrographers and clerical help in the Denver office of the United States Geological Survey. In addi - tion to this, thirty automatic recorder installations have been made in Nebraska by the Survey, costing approximately five hundred dol - lars each. The State, prior to this biennium, has furnished and in - stalled six automatic recorder equipments. Precipitation and Temperature For the biennium, the temperatures generally were above normal and the precipitation below normal, during the summer months. The </seg>

The hydraulic power and irrigation project of the Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District was the only important project developed by virtue of Senate File 310 started and practically com - pleted during the period covered by the present blenntutn. • The first contract for construction was awarded on August 115, 1934. and the project was sufficiently completed in early December, 19o5, to permit the diversion of water from the North I'Hute lor storage in the Sutherland Reservoir. The project Includes two ver - tical shaft AUis-Chalmers turbines of 18,. r )(K) horse power each, with two ]5,d00 KVA, 13.800 volt vertical generators. A concrete diversion clam extends across the channel of the North l'latte River about three miles west of Keystone, Nebraska. It iv nine feet high and 1200 feel long. A canal about 30 feel wide on the bottom extends about .;:; milts, from the diversion dam to the Sutherland Storage Reservoir. Th&lt; reservoir has a capacity of about IM'J'OO acre-feet with a ten foot free-board. The outlet canal extends easterly from the Sutherland Reservoir a distance of about 28 miles to the power house. A regu - lating reservoir is located along the outlet canal at a point about four miles .from the intake of the penstocks. The Loup River Pubblic Power District is Hearing completion, and when completed will have installed three turbines and generator-; _at Monroe, and three turbines and generators at Columbus. The Monroe turbines are :'.200 horse power and 27f&gt;n KVA each, and the Columbus turbines are IS. 000 horse power and 14.n00 KVA each. The canal has a capacity of 3000 second-feet and is thirty miles in length from the intake to the Columbus power house. I The Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District starlet work on the power canal and the Keystone diversion dam in th&lt; spring of l!&gt;:'.fi. Considerable work had been done when suits were brought in the State and Federal Courts causing partial suspension of work pending the decision of the Courts. Interstate Problems Since the suit of Nebraska v. Wyoming was started in September 1034. two hearings have been held in I-incoln, Nebraska, before Honorable M. J. Doherty, Master in Chancery, appointed by the United States Supreme Court to hear evidence. The State of Colorado was made a party to the suit by request of Wyoming early in 1935. </seg>

With the I'latte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District's de - mands for storing water during the storage season and the disposal o, ihV storage water during the growing season, an increase in the personnel of the Bureau of Irrigation should be a natural consequence. ' *„ aerial survey of the North Platte and Platte Rivers should be 5 made whenever funds are available.

            <seg id="p385">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION i WATER AND POWER DEVELOPMENT in the STATE OF NEBRASKA Financed by THE PUBLIC WORKS ADMINISTRATION (By Power Division of PWA) "The diorama" (which has been on exhibit in the State Capitol at Lincoln, cut of which appears on p. 387) "which this explanation is intended to accompany illustrates the comprehensive development or a large portion o£ the water resources of the State of Nebraska which is being financed by the Public Works Administration. The develop - ment includes irrigation works, hydroelectric generating systems and transmission lines necessary to transmit energy from the plants to load centers. Virtually all of the water in two important rivers will be put to work in this extensive utilization of one of Nebraska's natural resources. "The diorama shows the hydroelectric generating systems, the major high voltage transmission system and the irrigation works to be built. Power and irrigation districts, political subdivisions of the State of Nebraska, are constructing the various parts of the complete project shown. "The Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District (PWA Docket 3400-R) will build the portion depicted in green. Start - ing at the extreme west (left side of the model) is found the Keystone Reservoir. The Keystone dam will be an earth dam 160 feet high and approximately 1-% miles long. It will be the second largest earth clam in the world, being exceeded in size only by the Fort l'eck dam. The reservoir will impound 2,000,000 acre-feet of water on the North Platte River, giving a storage capacity sufficient to as - sure the necessary supply of water for power and irrigation during the driest period on record. "Passing eastward there is next seen a canal, reservoir and power house (red) included in the Platte Valley Power and Irrigation Dis - trict project and described below. Immediately below the junction of the North Platte and South Platte Rivers the diversion dam shown in green indicates the point at which water is diverted into the power canal of the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District. The canal passes along the hills. Water falls through' the Jeffrey Canyon power house (18,000 kw), enters a second portion of the canal, passes again along the hills and falls through the Johnson Canyon power house (36,000 kw). The water is then re- </seg>
            <seg id="p386">REPORT OP THE STATE ENGINEER turned to the Platte River. Immediately preceding each of the power houses there will be regulating reservoirs. "Some distance below the point at which water from the tail race of the Johnson plant enters the river, it is diverted by a dam into an irrigation canal to the south of the river. The area south of the Platte River shown shaded in green indicates land which is to be irrigated from this canal (220,000 acres). "The Tri-County project, as the project of the Central Nebraska is usually called, will also construct the transmission lines and sub - stations shown in green. These lines, with those of the other dis - tricts,' will form a high voltage (110 kv) transmission system which will transmit energy from the middle and western parts of the State to the load in the eastern part, in a reliable and efficient man - ner. A secondary transmission system of lower voltage (66 kv and 33 kv), which is to be constructed by the Trl-County project in the southern part of the State, is not shown. "Returning to the Western end of the diorama a diversion dam is seen in the North Platte River a few miles east of. the Keystone Bam. This diversion dam is the western end of the project of the Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District (PWA Docket 573) commonly known as the Sutherland project and shown in red on the diorama. Water is diverted by the dam into a canal, taken through a cut of 140 feet maximum depth (one of the deepest cuts in the United States), thence in a siphon under the South Platte River (the longest in the United States for a diameW of 17 feet), thence to the Sutherland storage reservoir (180, 000 1 acre-feet capa - city). From this reservoir water Is released as needed to the regulat - ing reservoir (8,000 acre-feet capacity) from which the water passes through the power house (25,000 kw) to the South! Platte River a short distance west of. the point where the North and South Platte Rivers meet to form the Platte River. The transmission lines shown in red are being constructed by the Sutherland project and, as in the case of the Tri-County project, form an integral patt of the ma.ior transmission system. "Water released from the Sutherland reservoir during the sum - mer months will pass through the power house and ! will be used to irrigate 100,000 acres of land on the north side of the Platte River (shown in green shading, outlined In red). "At the eastern end of the diorama is the project of the Loup River Public Power District (PWA Docket 665; shown in yellow) commonly known as the Columbus project. Water is diverted from the Loup River through a desilting basin and canal to the Monroe </seg>

From the reservoir water is released as needed to the Columbus power house (4 2,000 kw) after which it returns to the Platte River immediately below the junction of the Loup and the Platte. The transmission lines to be constructed by the Columbus project (also shown in yellow) are an essential part of the major high voltage grid system. In addition to these transmission lines, the Columbus project will construct an extensive secondary transmission network (66 kv and 33 kv) blanketing the eastern por - tion of the state. These secondary lines are not shown on the model. "About in the center of the model are seen two transmission lines, one shown in orange and one in blue, going northward from one of the transmission lines of the Tri-County project (green). The lines shown in orange are proposed construction of the Middle Loup Public Power and Irrigation District (I'WA Docket 5055), and the line shown in blue is proposed by the North Loup Public Power and Irrigation District (PWA Docket 1751). Areas shaded in light green, along the Middle Loup and North Loup Rivers, show the territories which are proposed to be irrigated by the irrigation works contem - plated in these two projects. "The three major projects will have an initial installed capacity of 125,000 kw and a firm output of 500,000,000 kwh. Ultimately the installed capacity will be increased to more than 200.000 kw. The transmission system which will serve the three projects jointly has been extensively tested for stability under fault conditions. The lines have been located to minimize storm hazards wherever possible." </seg>
