The. same shall be subject to lease at an annual rental of six (6) per cent on the appraised value. Provided, if two or more parties desire to lease the same land, the officer having control of the auction shall lease to the person who will pay the gTeater amount of cash bonus in addition to six (6) per cent on the appraised value as annual rental. Lease rentals are due in two installments, January 1st and July 1st of each year. If rentals are not paid within six months after due, the lease holders are. declared delinquent and notice is'sent them if their postoffice addresses are known. If unknown, advertisement is made in a newspaper. Ninety days after date of such notice lease contracts are declared forfeited and are subject to auction thereafter. (See Fees.) Delinquent lease holders are not permitted to bid at the sale of the lands they have forfeited, but at any time before the land is actually put on the auction block they may reinstate their leases by paying all back rentals and penalty fees. (See Fees.) All school lands under lease are subject to reappraisement at any time the Board of Educational Lands and Funds so elects. All leases expire twenty-five years from the first day of January next ensuing after the date of the lease. A lessee has the right at the expiration of his lease to apply to the county treasurer for a new lease and receive the same without competition, at the same time surrendering the old lease, paying rentals six months in advance, and a lease fee of fifty cents. This will do away with the public auction only in cases where the former lessee does not apply for new lease. In such cases the lands will be advertised and leased at public auction to the highest bidder, and all improvements on the land appraised by the county board. Improve - ments to be included in such appraisements shall be all buildings, fenc - ing, wells, windmills, pumps, tank's, irrigation improvements, and also costs for labor expended in breaking sod on said tract of land and re - ducing same to cultivation, and for alfalfa or other crops growing upon said land. The appraisement shall be made within thirty (30) days after the acceptance of the bid. ((See page 546, Laws of Nebraska, 1927.)

EDUCATIONAL LANDS MAY BE PURCHASED FROM THE STATE AS FOLLOWS: Lands known as isolated tracts, lands situated in the irrigation dis - tricts, and lands for the use of churches, cemeteries, schoolhouse sites county agricultural fairs, public roads, and for sewage disposal purposes! Any lessee of land situated within the areas irrigated, or to be irrigated, from irrigation works constructed or controlled or to be constructed or controlled by the United States, or its duly authorized agencies, or any lessee of any forty-acre tract or government sub - division, any. part of which is under irrigation, may purchase the same (See page 652, Laws of Nebraska, 1929.) The law also provides that if any forty (40) acre tract is adjacent to other school land which is wholly or partly under irrigation, and therefore subject to sale, such tract may be sold even though riot under irrigation if, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, it is expedient to sell the same. Any irrigation district in which there are or may be any educational lands belonging to the state which are or may hereafter become sites for reservoir purposes may purchase from the state for reservoir sites such educational lands or portions thereof. (See -page 6SS, Laws of Nebraska, 1929.) The law provides that the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings shall make a list of all isolated tracts of school lands con - taining less than forty (40) acres, all undivided interests in realty, and all city lots held by the state of Nebraska in trust for the permanent school fund, appraise same, and, upon the expiration of the leases or upon forfeiture of lease titles, offer the same for sale at public auction, to be sold by the county treasurer of the county in which the lands are located to the highest bidder for not less than ninety (90) per cent of the appraised value. The purchaser shall pay not less than twenty-five (25) per cent in cash on day of sale and the balance to be secured by sale contract running ten years at six (6) per cent annual interest, the purchaser having the right to pay all of the unpaid money, or any part of it, in multiples of five (S) per cent of the total purchase price at any interest payment date. In the event the purchaser, or the assignee, does not pay the an - nual interest upon the unpaid purchase price within six (6) months after interest becomes due, the land shall revert to the state. SALE CONTRACTS . The owner of a sale contract may at any time pay any portion of the purchase price thereof to the treasurer of the county in which the </seg>
            <seg id="p024">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT land is situated; provided, all interest at that time earned and due has first been paid. And when the principal is paid in full other than the first of the year, interest upon the obligation having been paid for the entire year, the county treasurer receiving such principal payment may refund to the payor out of any interest money then in his hands the interest so paid in advance in excess of the amount earned and due at the time said final payment is made. Refund receipts are fur - nished by the land commissioner for this purpose. All unpaid principal on sale contracts draws interest at five (5) per cent per annum, payable annually on Ja.nuary first of each year in advance. A sale contract holder making final payment to the county treasurer should also surrender his contract that it may be forwarded to the land commissioner with receipt showing full payment. NOTES No assignment of a school land lease or sale contract is valid until recorded in the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Build - ings, and an assignment will not be recorded if any interest or rental is due at the time it is offered for record. • The original sale or lease contract must be sent in with the assignment or the latter will not be recorded. Contracts will be returned with recorded assignments. When a subdivision of not less than forty acres in any contract is assigned, a new number is given the assigned portion on the ledger account and a certified copy of the original is given to the assignee. When assignment is made as above, the original contract must be re - duced and the interest or rentals, as the case may be, is adjusted to the new conditions. Whenever a lease or sale contract becomes lost or destroyed, a certified copy of the' same may be procured hy filing an affidavit of lost contract. Such copy may be used in lieu of the original for the purpose of passing title. When interest on a sale contract, or rental on a lease contract, is not paid when due, the county treasurers will collect- "penalty" interest at seven (7) per cent for the time, purchaser or lessee has been tardy in making such payments. Improvements on leased land and the owner's equity in land under sale contract are subject to taxation. County treasurers are requested to send in school land receipts at least once each week. Some times tardiness in this particular leads to considerable unnecessary correspondence and occasionally to de - .linquencies being charged against contract holders whjj are not in ar - rears, but whose receipts' have not been sent to the land commissioner's office. Lands escheating to the state under the alien act are appraised and leased in the same manner as educational lands. - ' </seg>

A resume of the law governing the care of these records and the duties of the state surveyor is as follows: . 'TThe statutes of 1903 defined the duties of the State Surveyor and Draughtsman, and placed in his direct charge, under the supervision of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, the field notes, and all other records of the Government surveys of Public Lands in the state, conduct the correspondence pretaining to the surveys, grievances or disputes growing out of conflicting surveys of lands and lots, to pre - pare, the advice or instructions and opinions and issue a circular of in - tructions to county surveyors of the state for their direction and guidance in the restoration and establishment of lines and preservation of corners, </seg>

"The law also provides for an appeal to the courts from the decisions of the State Surveyor in making such surveys by any person having an interest in the lands affected by such surveys." " "It also provides that the per diem of the surveyor for each days service while engaged in field work and necessary expenses shall be paid by the parties having the work done: The per diem of the State Surveyor is to be paid into the general fund of the state. The law was ammended in 1909, providing for the appointment of experienced and competent land surveyors as deputies. The law was also amended in 1919, which provided that when surveys were made by the State Survey - or in person, his per diem is to be $8.00 per day while engaged in the work, which per diem is to be paid into the general fund of the state; he is to receive the return of his necessary expenses. Deputies are also to receive $8.00 for each day spent in field work and their necessary expenses." In 1929, Section 2699 of the Compiled Statutes of 1922 were amended to read as follows: "Section 2699. It shall be the duty of the county surveyor of each county to perpetuate the existing corners of land surveys along the public highways where such corners are liable to destruction, either by public travel or construction and maintenance, he shall establish witness corners in at least two directions and record his work after the manner of other surveys. And the county surveyor shall be allowed the statutory compensa - tion | which with the cost of material and assistants, shall be allowed out of the general fund of the county. It shall be the duty of the Department of Public Works ,the high - way commissioners and every road overseer in the' construction and maintenance of the public highways where work is to be done that may cause the destruction of any corners of land surveys, to notify the county surveyor. . It is not intended, however, that the surveyor shall restore, any lost corners under this law unless so ordered by the county board in regular session."
