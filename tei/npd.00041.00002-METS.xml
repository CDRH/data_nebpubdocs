The armories are all rented and in most instances are in wooden buildings, inadequate for drill pur - poses and indoor rifle practice. The services of the enlisted men at their home stations during instruction periods are, as a rule, rendered for very small or no com - pensation. It is therefor most essential that a feeling of friendship and good will should exist between the members of organizations, and that armories be placed in a condition that will be inviting, offering the men small libraries, club rooms and drill halls that are adequate for athletic sports. These conditions will create an incentive for men to report more regularly at armories for instructions on nights desig - nated for organization drill. The National IKf.-ns,- Art, June 3, 1916 The National Defense Act governing the Regular Army, National Guard, Naval Militia and the Unorganized Militia, passed by Contra—. June 3. 1916. places the Nat'onal Guard on a different plane than has heretofore existed. There are several clauses in this Act that the National Guard are not in sympathy with, and several that it will be impossible to carry out, which will not be through fault of the Guard. but due to the present national spirit. Mat the intention of this Act is to make an efficient national fighting force, trained and equipped is appreciated by all military authorities of the National Guard and only actual application will serve to disqualify such clauses as are im - possible for the Guard to fulfill. Following are some of the main points that pertain to the National Guard and will be effective after their return to the States from the border: The Militia shall be divided into three classes, namely, the Nation- Guard. Naval Militia, and Unorganized Militia. The National Guard all consist of the regularly enlisted militia between the ages of [een and forty-five years, organized, armed and equipped as pro - i by War Department regulations, and the commissioned officers •e between twenty-two and sixty-four years. The organization National Guard shall be the same as prescribed for the Regular Army, subject in time of peace to such general exceptions as may be juthorized by the Secretary of War. No state shall maintain troops in time of peace other than as au - orized by the President. The number of enlisted men of the National lard to be organized under this Act within one year from its passage. shall be for eac'i State, in the proportion of two hundred such men for each Senator and Representative in Congress from such State. and this shall be increased each year thereafter in the proportion not less than M per centum until a total peace strength of not less than eight hundred enlisted men for each Senator and Representative in Congress shall have been readied.

The National Guard of this state has been in the past, very much •■lipped in that the armories have been rented and an insufficient jnt of funds appropriated by the Legislature for the rent and up- &gt; Newt buildings that will be adequate to meet the requirements new Defense Act. The National Guard now has a very substan- tial State Arsenal at the State Fair Grounds, Lincoln, Nebraska, but upon Mm return of the troops it will be necessary to construct a gun shed for the storage of machine guns, automobile trucks, escort wag - ons, et cetera. The plan of the War Department in connection -with the return of the troops as is now contemplated is to turn over to the States who have artillery, cavalry, and Signal Corps organizations, a certain num - ber of animals, and in this connection it is hoped that the next session of the Legislature will see fit to make the necessary appropriations to improve the State Rifle Range at Ashland, Nebraska, a large part of which has already been purchased by the Government, and the abstracts and titles for the remainder of the land are now in the hands of the War Department for their approval, in order that the range may be utilized for a place to keep such animals as will be turned over by the Federal Government and not just for a rifle range and camp ground for the State troops. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 LThe range consists of approximately nine hundred acres of land, permanent kitchens, water mains, bath houses, etc., have already been constructed for use of troops. This range will be available, not only to the National Guard of the State but to t ie Regular Army, Civilian Rifle Clubs, University Cadets, etc. It is estimated that the improvements necessary to finally complete this range wi " necessitate the expenditure of approximately ten thou - sand dollars. This will give t :e State a very desirable piece of property that will bring additional financial benefits to the people of our State. I y lirincinp Ftrocps from neighboring states into the community for competitive rifle practice, etc. Mobilization Few people have appreciated the seriousness and necessity of a well organized National Guard in past years. Uur nation has been at peace with the exception of labor troubles in some states in which file Governors were compelled to call on their National Guard to preserve order, to protect life and property. The fact that the National Guard has been utilized as a last resort in cases of riots, etc.. has caused organized labor to use its influence in the State Legislatures, creating an adverse opinion as to its value. In 1913 the people of Nebraska will remember the disastrous Omaha tornado, and on this occasion was proven the necessity of hav - ing a well trained National Guard, that placed at the disposal of the Governor of the State a large body of men especially equipped and trained for quick and efficient relief of th e sufferers. Up to the present the National Guardsmen of this state ha-e spent their spare time, vacations, and oftentimes sacrificed their busi - ness interests in order to attend the officers' camps of instructions and maneuver camps and during the winter have carried on correspondence courses that would keep them in trim. L Today nearly the whole world is at war which is testing every uice of those unfortunate nations participating. Man is a peculiar beinr. not unlike a nation, proud, full of passion and ambitious to mt - do hi? i:»ighbor. tempe-mental. and almost greedy at times, change - able to the extent of being heartless at one time and sympathetic the next. So far this nation has kept its temper and has taken the posi - tion of neutrality, which has certainlv been far-sightedness, for she is now rounding out a much needed trained fighting force for a first line of defense. TMs force 's serving both as a Totction to our border and training school to those who wer e patrotic enough to make the sacrifice. When the National Guard of this state was mobilized at Lincoln on June 22, 1916, pursuant tn the call of the President of June 18, 1916, there were many conditions which required officers trained in the art of handlinp men. It was nece«sarv to place the camp in a condition that would be healthy and would afford protection from the </seg>

The different departments of the Guard, as the Quarter - master General, Commissary General, Judge Advocate General and Chief Surgeon were called upon, and each in turn was held responsi - ble for its share of the work. The companies were allowed to remain at their home stations four or five days for the purpose of permitting the men to make such arrangements as were necessary in regard to their business affairs. This done, the companies were ordered to Lin - coln, and were mobilized at the State Fair Grounds, which was by this time in readiness for occupancy. A part of the Guardsmen had enlisted with the idea of preparing themselves for any emergency that might arise, and when the call to arms came, they realized the importance of their forethoug.it. Another part who had done the same did not stop to consider what it might mean to their families or their business affairs. There were threats and pleadings to secure the release of these men by dependent relatives and fond parents, but they were too proud and too strong to weaken at this late hour, and only a few were released, a majority of whom left with regret, eit.ier realizing that it would be criminal to leave their families, or that their physical condition would only make them a burden to their comrades in the field. The companies that were not fully equipped were supplied with the necessary equipment, the officers and men were physically exam- ined, and every man received his typhoid prophylaxis and small pox serum treatment, records were completed, muster rolls signed, and erything made in readiness for a long campaign. I'pon arrival at Llano Grande, Texas, where they are now sta - tioned, a new problem confronted them. They were required to clear land of dense thickets of mesquite, cactus, brush, and other rank vegetation. It was necessary to build canals, for a water supply, to build roads, and create a drainage system throughout the camp. For many weeks they toiled at this hard labor, making the jungle-like landscape presentable and inhabitable. Bath houses, messhalls, la- kitchens, etc., were constructed. The War Department soon realized that war was not imminent and that a large number of the men were making great sacrifices, conse- quently orders were issued releasing these men. The requests were so numerous that Congress devised a method of appropriating money for the dependent relatives in order to hold the men on the border. Many organizations were made up from colleges, and these men were released to complete their college education. Few people realise that these men on the border are battling with a condition that is harder than war. T ley are the few who are making the sacrifice, for in rase of war every able-bodied man would be serving with them and the sacrifice would b e mutual. There are many times their number of strong healthy men, daily enjoying the peace and prosperity of the nation in the States, little realizinz that should war be declared, their services would be more of a liability than an asset to the Government </seg>

It is hoped that the National Defense Act of June .'., 1H1B. will overcome this, and that the armories will be made adequate so that between the pay authorized under this Act for Guardsmen at their home stations and the induce - ment that the armories will afford, will cans-e every able-bodied young maninthisstateto become a member of the Guard and receive the proper training that will fit him to respond at any time to the call of the President or the Governor of the State, with honor and credit. On the call of the President of June 18. 1916, there were 2.212 officers and men of th e Nebraska National Guard responded. Of this number X.'! men were discharged previous to muster-in and I'To men were discharged for physical disability upon muster-in. Nebraska tendered to the President 114 officers and 1,76."&gt; enlisted men who entrained on July 7th and 9t i for the Mexican border. Recommendation^ r Considering the recent action of Congress in its attempt to create larger and more adequate defense, and in order that this State may meet the requirements of the Federal Act that will make the National Guard a part of the National Defense as well as a protection to the people of the State against riots and unforseen calamities, it is recom - mended that the following appropriations lie made by the next session of the legislature: It is recommended that an emergency fund be made available for the purpose of settling claims created by the use of the National Guard in riots, war, invasion, insurrection and unforseen calamities requir - ing the National Guard for th e protection and safety of life and public Salmi.-.

It is to be noted that t !ese diaries chronicle the events as each Battalion Commander saw them: and that they are "O.

The general conduct of the enlisted men, considering the sur- 1ings. was excellent. The interest displayed by officers and men was certainly commendable. The program as outlined by the mmanding Officer was substantially complied with. The results re eminently satisfactory. The Instructors, Col. R. I,. Hamilton. Uieuts. Stoll. Wrightson. el Hosfeld. manifested great interest in the work, and the tour of luty proved profitable to both officers and men alike. The Commanding Officer of the Regiment wishes to express his mp- tion of the presence and assistance of the Adjutant General and aff during the entire tour of duty, and the splendid arranee- its that he had made for the comfort and well-being of the com ity of Fremont, acting through its Commercial Organization, i is headed by Hon. Georg e Wolz. certainly accorded all visiting men a hearty welcome. Indeed, the hospitality extended both and men. was wholly unprecedented in the history of this ment. The Signal Corps tendered a ball to the officers and men of Regiment, and every evening was occupied by some scheduled ntertainment at which the men in uniform were not discriminated it given due welcome. On Sunday over 100 watermelons buted in Camp to the members of fiis Command by the nercial Club. Indeed, so delightful were these attractions that ■■M of surprise is not that, in serious work we did so little, but rather that we accomplished so much Chaplain Leidy's work is probably deserving of special mention. In addition to the duties of his office he provided at the Camp enter - tainments of a very attractive na'ure. The program embraced clean wholesome athletics, and moving pictures. Many of the Command. commissioned and enlisted, preferred t .ese entertainments to the more formal efforts of our splendid hosts in the City of Fremont, and re - mained in Camp during the evening. This had a tendency, at least, to promote discipline and soldierly conduct In this departure Chaplain Leidy is following a plan which has proven eminently satisfactory in the National Guard of Cinada. and we believe the results fully justify whatever expense may have been necessarily expended to secure the </seg>

The board will make a thorough physical examination of the officer being examined. In doubtful cases they will be guided by the following: "An incurable disease or injury, or disease or injury not curable within a reasonable time, either of which is of such a character as to disqualify an officer for duty on the active list, constitute incapacity for service. If, however, a disease or injury be curable wi'thin a rea- sonable time, the officer should be regarded as physically qualified for promotion. The question as to the curability of a disease or injury i's one for the board to' decide, but if unable to determine »uch question, it should be recommended that the officer be re-examined alter am h period as. in its opinion, may be necessary to permit a de- rmination to be reached.' When the board finds an officer incapacitated for active service by reason of physical disability, further examination will cease and the board will report its findings, statinp in full the cause of disability and whether or not it was contracted in the line of duty. If the board finds the officer physically fit to perform the duties of a medfcal officer in the Nebraska National Guard the examination in general ef - ficiency and professional fitness will follow. I'nder this head the board will consider ( 1 ) the use an officer has made of his opportunities i'n the Nebraska National Guard: (2) his ability to apply practically his professional knowledge; (3) his general trustworthiness and ability in performance of til's official duties, and i 4 ) his ability to handle and control men. To this end the ad - jutant general of the state wlil forward to the board all papers on file in his office relating to the officer's efficiency and these will b« considered by the boi»rd. In the absence of competent evidence to the contrary, an officer's fitness as to general efficiency will be presumed. t:\niiiinatiiin an to I'rofeisional Fitness. The examination of an officer is for the purpose of testing his knowledge of the duties that may devolve upon him when promoted. It will be in no sense scholastic, or such as to require hi'm to memor - ize data and statistic ordinarily found in reference tables. Practical exercises and problems will not be framed so as to require a knowl - edge or training greater than may be required of him when promoted to the next higher grade.

            <seg id="p395">387 AVIATION In the year 1915 aviation was first taken up In the Nebraska National Guard. Captain C. W. Schafter was made chief of aviation. He furnished his own aeroplane and a corps was organized with head - quarters at the State Fair Grounds, Lincoln, Nebraska. Nebraska being the first state to organize, the War Department was unable to prescribe any regulations to govern it or to authorize the expenditure of Federal funds for that branch of the service until Congress bad created laws governing such expenditure. ('apt. McMillen enlisted and was commissioned. He in turn furnished his aeroplane. Edgar W. Bagnell followed and was commis - sioned First Lieutenant. The final preparations governing the Corps and the question of how to raise funds for its existence was taken under consideration, the appropriation allotted the National Guard being so small as to necessitate very 'mall expenditures along this line and at the same time to do justice to the Infantry, Signal Corps and Medical Corps organizations. The matter was laid before the Governor and it was decided to have the aviators give exhibition flights at County Fairs, etc. Captain Shaffer met with repeated fail - ures in his attempts to fill dates due to the poor quality and con - dition of his plane. At Julesburg, Colorado, where he filled a county fair date, he succeeded in making one successful flight, but the second one was disastrous. Upon landing, the crowd had filled the quarter - stretch forcing him to land in rough ground caused by buffalo wal - lows which completely turned the plane over and destroyed a major portion of the wing sections. In the meantime Captain MrMillen filled many dates with very few accidents. At York, Nebraska he was forced to make a landing with a dead engine from over the center of the city but no damage - was done. The Aviation Corps participated at both the 4th and 5th Infantry - encampments in 1915. Captain McMillen succeeded in very success - fully working out bomb dropping and aero photography in conjunction with troop movements. He succeeded in making a successful cross country flight from Beaver Crossing. Nebraska to the Sth Infantry encampment at Crete a distance of twenty-five miles and the territory was unknown to him. His Information regarding the destination of the flight was transmitted to him by telephone before he started. Many interesting flights were made over the city of Lincoln and currounding country in which bomb dropping, aero photography, night flying, night signalling, etc., were successfully worked out. On Novem - ber 21st, 1915. he made a successful flight from Lincoln to Omaha, ■&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p396">388 distance of 50 miles conveying a message from Governor Morehead to Mayor Dahlman of Omaha. bin 191C, the Aero Club of America recognized our efforts in this nch of the service and donated $350.00 and free tuition for Captain Millen and Lieutenant Bagnell to attend the Curtiss Atlantic Coast Aviation school at Newport News, Virginia Captain McMillen success - fully handled the large tractors and all the experiments that were placed before him. He returned to the State of Nebraska in the course of a month to continue his exhibition flights for a livelihood as his mother was dependent upon him. Lieutenant Bagnell qualified and received his pilot's license. Soon after the President's call came for the troops to patrol the Mexican border, the Aero Company was ready but unequipped. After repeated attempts to secure recognition from the Federal Government, it was turned down for the reason that they had no additional equipment for the National Guard. Lieutenant Bagnell was appointed 2nd Lieu - tenant, Battalion Quartermaster by Major E. E. Sterricker, 5th Ne - braska Infantry and placed on detached service. He was sent to the Government Aviation Station at Mineola. New York, where he has been serving as a Federal lierl National Guard officer in the aero - nautical branch of the service. On September 2. 1916. Captain McMillen was killed at St. Fran - cis, Kansas during an exhibition flight. UMany of the members of the aviation corps enlisted in other ches of the service and went to the border. It is hoped that this branch of the service so successfully started can be continued and it certainly can if sufficient funds are appro - priated to furnish the necessary equipment for the members of the Corps to work with. The European War has brought out the significance of aviation and has proven it to be one of the most important branches of the •ervice. The last session of Congress appropriated $16,000,000 for aviation in t'.e National Guard and the War Department is now promulgating plans of procedure for the training and equiping of aeronautical units in the different states and territories. The following are two aerial problems worked out successfully by Captain Ralph McMillen. Problem 1 Aero 1. OFFICE CHIEF OF STAFF ADJUTANT GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT LINCOLN. NEBR.

            <seg id="p401">393 STATE Or NEBRASKA, Adjutant General's Department, Office of the Chief of Staff. Lincoln, Nebr., November 15 19H. From: Captain R. L. Hamilton, U. S. Army, Retired. To: The Adjutant General, State of Nebraska, Present Subject: Report for the year 1916. I submit herewith my observations of Guard affairs for the year ending December 31, 1916. The year has been one of unusual interest to the Guard In many respects. The year began quietly, with Guard affairs in their normal condition throughout the State. Governor John H. Morehead was and has been the Commander-in-Chief of the Guard during the year. His term of office will end with this year when he will be succeeded by Governor-elect Keith Neville who comes from North Platte, Nebraska. The first half of the year passed quietly — Guard affairs running their normal course and with the usual drill and instruction periods. The usual difficulties were encountered in keeping organizations up to their proper strength and in maintaining the proper standard of efficiency due largely to a lack of sufficient funds to procure suitable armory ac - commodations or else to provide sufficient inducement to have the men report for duty at the regular instruction periods. These are difficulties always encountered in Guard affairs and must be met in best way possible. The personality of the company commander his tact and enterprise are most important factors in dealing with these difficult questions. For that reason no effort should be spared to have the very best men available in the positions of organization «ommanderg. In addition such commanders should be given every proper aid and encouragement by the State and Regimental officers having a direct interest and control in matters affecting the organiza - tion. .It must be borne in mind that such services as are rendered by the enlisted men at their home stations during the instruction periods are as a rule rendered without any compensation for such and they must be judged accordingly. It is therefore most essential that a feeling of friendship and good will between the members of the or - ganization should be fostered in every proper manner so that In as far as it may be possible the members of the organizations will ap - pear at the armory on instruction nights more as a pleasure than ia a mere perfunctory performance of duty. When this feeling can once </seg>
            <seg id="p402">394 t engendered a long step has been taken towards placing the organiza - i on a proper and efficient footing. In such a case the members of the organization will appear in the proper spirit and will in such rbe much more ready and willing to receive and properly digest instruction given. With reference to the instruction no effort should be spared to make it interesting as well as instructive. When the interest and at - tention of the men are lost little good can result from further instruc - tion until the attention of the men can be regained. tin dealing with these questions tact, good judgment and ability most essential. It requires study and ability on the part of the cers to secure the respect, attention and Cheerful obedience of the men. A reserved, dignified demeanor is essential. This demeanor should be maintained at all times and undue familiarity between the officers and enlisted men should be discouraged. The older officers should Instill these ideas in the minds of new officers from the be - ginning of their commissioned service and should aid them by advice and corrective measures properly administered to overcome this de - fect. Officers should refrain at all times from discussing orders or matters of general policy affecting the organization except as to their application. In no case nor under any conditions should matters of policy affecting the organization be adversely criticized, or unfavorably discussed by officers with the enlisted men and f ; ie officers should so Eas may be practicable restrain the members of their organizations m so doing. Harmony, discipline, and esprit du corps are requisitf ilities in all organizations. All instruction imparted should be accurate, progressive, and sys - tematic; being designed to have each step lead to a higher one in the school of preparation for actual service and not be a continued repetition of the elementary instruction so as to have it become tire - some to the enlisted men and thereby cause them to lose interest. This feature requires careful thought on the part of the officers in so ar - ranging file schedule of instruction that it will be progressive and em - brace all the more important elements of the soldier's armory instruc - tion. The drill periods might at times be profitably divided between the ai-tual instruction of the men and talks on subjects relevant to the training and welfare of the men. These talks may well be extended to embrace matters in a soldier's life with reference to which practical instruction cannot well be given in the armory. Such subjects might well relate to interior and exterior guard duty, to outpost, to patrolling, to reconnaissance, to personal hygiene, to individual cooking, to the care and preservation of the ration, to the care of the feet, the care of arms and equipment, military courtesy, discipline and many other subjects relating to a soldier's life. It is largely due to a lack of proper instruction of the organiza - tions along these lines that when they first take the field upon being </seg>
            <seg id="p403">395 called into active service that their efficiency is greatly impaired and in few cases are they ready for immediate field service when the call comes for such. However it is fully recognized that the tim£ available for the instruction of the men while at their home stations render* an extensive course impracticable other than to give the soldiers the rudiments of the subjects with sufficient practical instruction to en - able them to go on with them without hesitation or delay when oc - casion demands. It should be borne in mind that the average guards - man is almost invariably intelligent, fairly well educated, and a clean and respected citizen of the locality in which he lives. The composi - tion of the organization lends itself to this idea. Few can or will r&gt;res«&gt;t himself as a candidate for membership in an organization with - out there being some one in such organization to vouch for him and for his good character. Organization commanders should not and as a rule do not accept candidates for enlistment until they have been properly vouched for. The procurement of suitable and proper armory facilities is often a matter of much difficulty. An armory to be suited for the pur - pose must have sufficient floor space for drill purposes otherwise it fails of its purpose in its most important particular. The greater part of the instruction imparted is given at night which renders outside in - struction impracticable. In consequence the armory space and Its facilities becomes most important. In some of the smaller towns which have a guard organization the armory facilities are poor but are the best available with the funds which may be used for the Guard in such purposes. In the larger towns and cities a similar difficulty is • mountered not due to a lack of suitable building available bat due to a prohibitive rental demanded by the owner. These are difficulties which will always have to be encountered until the State has provided sufficient funds for the construction of armories wherever needed. The most important military event of the year in this State was the mobilization, muster in, and forwarding of the State Troops which were mustered in and forwarded as Federalized Militia to the Mexican Border where they still remain. The mobilization was in compliance with War Department orders, dated June 18, 1916. It was begun on June 19th and continued until it was completed. The work of the mobilization was expedited as much as possible. The different organizations were inspected and mustered just as rapidly as they could be made ready and the necessary rolls could be prepared. The Mustering Officers were: Major Herschel Tupes, 1st V. 8. In - fantry; Captain S. M. Parker, U. S. Infantry; 1st Lieut. Philip G. Wrightson, U. S. Infantry: Captain E. R. Gentry, Medical Corps, U. S. Army; 1st Lieut. E. L. DeLanney, Medical Reserve Corps, U. S. Army; 1st Lieut. A. A. Fricke, Medical Reserve Corps, U. S. Army. All concerned worked diligently and earnestly to expedite the muster in. The Medical Officers administered the first injection of the typhoid prophylaxis to each officer and enlisted man accepted for </seg>
            <seg id="p404">396 muster. All were likewise vaccinated to immunize against smallpox. E Clothing was shipped from the St. Louis Depot and from other ts to equip the command. The only defect was found in the shoes ished which were not of a suitable and satisfactory type. Nine hundred pairs were accepted and issued. The remainder of those re - ceived were returned to the parties from whom obtained. In conse - quence the command moved with such shoes as they had worn to the mobilization camp or else such as they were able to purchase at their own expense from the local dealers. After the troops had left Lincoln for the Border the shoes were received and were forwarded to them it their camp on the Border. Even though there may develop no ac - tual need of the Federalized Militia on the Border there can be no question of the great instructional value to the Militia in the application of an object lesson of this kind where the defects of the old system were developed and made apparent. So long as the present officers retain their connection with the Guard the requirements which must be met in case of a call to the colors will be fresh in their memories and in consequence. I am convinced, all organizations will be found in a much more satisfactory condition for service, in all respects, when - ever another call of a similar nature may come. The earnest efforts of all the administrative officers of the Guard to assist the mustering officers and facilitate their work was apparent. In this connection I desire to commend the work of the Adjutant General (General P. L. Hall); of his assistant. Major A. K. Haysel; Major Allan D. Falconer. Q. M. Corps. Chief Quartermaster; and Major C. W. Waldon, Medical Corps, the Chief Surgeon. The senior mustering officer was at times impatient at delays in the transaction of some of the work required of them bv some officers of the Guard, but I am convinced that such delays were almost in - variably caused by a lack of experience in such matters on the part of the Guard officers concerned, and in very few cases due to indifference or inattention on their part. tThe spirit manifested by the enlisted men was good. In very few i did they seek to avoid service by seeking their discharge on excuse. I again reassert my belief that a mobilization of this character has great instructioral value for all concerned. It serves to develop and make pronounced any defects existing in organization or instruc - tion in the Guard and brings to the attention of those concerned a feeling of responsibility and the urgent necessity of taking the proper remedial measures for any defects that may become apparent. The troops in question are still in camp on the Mexican Border with no immediate prospects of their return. Reports indicate that these regiments have given a good account of themselves and it is ex - pected that they will continue so to do until relieved from such duty. During the absence of the troops Guard affairs in the State have been very quiet but the home organization of the Guard Headquarters has </seg>
            <seg id="p405">397 fm maintained so as to resume the former Guard status in so far as may be practicable immediately ui&gt;on the return of the State or - ganizations. It is 'noped that conditions on the Border may soon «o adjust themselves that the troops may be returned to the State. The conditions referred to in the foregoing have resulted in great instructional value for the Guard — instruction which will doubtless be retained for years to come and which must result in great good in the dissemination of proper military instruction along proper lines. Should these same men be again called into service they will be much better fitted for such service on account of their experience in the South and the lessons tliey have learned in the practical life of a* soldier. I believe all good citizens of the State should contemplate with satisfaction and pride the record made by our State Troops in as - sembling, organizing, and in their dispatch to the Border. Above all they should be proud of their services while at the Border. In view of these facts it is hoped that our State Legislature may fully appreciate the value of the military organizations of the State aa a positive asset and in consequence be willing to make adequate provisions for its financial support by the liberality of its appropria - tions. A lack of sufficient funds for the purpose ''ias been the great - est obstacle encountered in the efforts of those in charge towards building up and maintaining a satisfactory and efficient Guard or - ganization in this State. All good citizens of the State should have sufficient pride in the State to be willirg to take all proper measures toward insuring a good, efficient and sufficient military establishment within our State and it is hoped that the members of our State Legislature will be animated by this idea.

Subject: REPORT JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERALS DEPARTMENT for the year ending January 1, 1917. In compliance to order, 1 have the honor to submit the following report upon the operations of the Judge Advocate General's Depart - ment of the National Guard, of Nebraska, for the period January I, 1916. to January 1, 1917. Since my report for the period ending January 1, 1916, to which. I hereby refer, I have been in much better condition, and more fa - vorably situated to observe the workings of your department, and have become more familiar with the development of National Guard matters. I am frank to say that from iny observation and knowledge gained, that the efforts of yourself and your department under your immediate charge and supervision have been continuous and efficient in promoting the welfare and efficiency of the Guard in all practical lines: and the results of efforts have been and are self-evident and manifest. ASHLAND RIFI.E RANGE This department the past year has been steadily engaged in per - fecting the title of the premises purchased by the United States for use as a rifle range at Ashland, Nebraska. The questions that have arisen appertaining to the title to these lands have been very per - plexing and confusing, and of necessity this department has been compelled to carefully scrutinize the proceedings, and to assist in court proceedings at various times in the effort to perfect the various titles. The Laverty tract and part of Rose Estate were the main part where the proposed range is situated, has been fully approved by the United States, and the title to these lands has been approved by the war department and the attorney general of the United States. Deeds have been executed and duly recorded, and the United States is now the owner thereof. The Parmenter tract, also the Rose Estate, which have been acquired by option contract, has after a vexatious and long drawn out investigation, involving much time to questions af - fecting title, been finally approved by the War Department, and deeds ordered executed to the United States. The execution and delivery STATK OK XKBKASKA Jl'DtiK AI&gt;VO&lt; ATK (JKXKRAI/K DKI'AKTMKXT I.IXCXH.X </seg>
            <seg id="p413">ADJUTANT GENERALS REPORT 403 jf these deeds is now in process of completion, and this department is or the opinion that :he title to the Ashland Rifle Range will soon be secure in the United States. In concluding this subject, I wish to say that the subject of the title of this Rifle Range has for the past three and one-half years been engrossing the almost exclusive attention of this department, and it is with a feeling of great relief that this matter is finally closed. This department received from the Board of County Commissioners of Saunders County, Nebraska, in April, 1916, last, a resolution, whereby said Saunders County agreed to tirade, bridge and maintain necessary culverts and so forth on all roads connected with said Rifle Range, free of expense or charge either to the United States or the State of Nebraska. This was a great concession by the Honorable County Commissioners, and in mi: ■ ■ good permanent roads into and from said range. A bill has been introduced in Congress to create these roads leading to the Rifle Range, military roads, and to provide for proper and adequate paving of same. The citizens of Ashland have also agreed to grade and maintain a good load from the C. B. &amp; Q. Depot at Ashland to the intersection of the Rifle Range roads. This will insure a road sufficient to meet all the requirements of the service. The acquisi - tion of this Rifle Range for the use of the National Guard of this State for rifle practice and for other state purposes is most valuable to the state, and having thus procured same, it will become necessary for appropriations to be made by the Legislature at its forthcoming ses - sion to erect and maintain suitable buildings and other improvements to meet the requirement of the War Department of the United States, and to properly equip said range for state purposes. This is a most tant matter, and should have the earnest consideration of the Legislature of Nebraska. This range means much to Nebraska, be - cause it provides a place for the regular troops of the United States, tt- Guards of the State of Nebraska, and for any other troops that may be assigned to said range for rifle practice; it will also provide a permanent place for the housing and storing of government and state property; it will provide a place where troops may be en - camped, may be mobilized, and in course of time will become a place at military importance and a valuable asset for Nebraska. It will bring many visitors to our state, but to secure all this the United States requires Nebraska to meet its requirements as to buildings and improvements, and to provide the necessary means to pay for same. !-•■: me suggest, and emphasize the statement, that if the Legislature of Nebraska fails to appropriate sufficient funds to meet these re - i;i:irnments of the War Department that the benefits which the United are willing to grant Nebraska, in the acquisition of these lands, then the fault and responsibility will rest upon the refusal to provide suitable and proper means and funds to accomplish the object and in providing a valuable tract of land for use of a rifle range of magnificence and importance. When it is taken into consideration </seg>
            <seg id="p414">404 that the 1'nited States has already expended approximately $20,000 as purchase prii e for the land, that it has in the past four years s-piiropriated approximately $30.00ti to |4t.M4 for this maintenance of rifle pra&lt; tice in this state; and that it has appropriated two mil - lion dollars to be apportioned among the several states where rifle ranges are maintained, provided each state shall contribute its share in providing permanent buildings and improvements at small cost anil expense to the State, it would seem that Nebraska can not afford to lose the amount which the I'nited States has appropriated and will appropriate b&gt; its failure to do and perform its small part. This CriKt- can be utilized fir many purposes by this State: for instance, it n be used as an aviation field for aviation service. It is particu - larly fitted and suited for such purpose; in fact, in the judgment of this Department, it can not be excelled by any state. If aviation Eidquarters aie made at the Ashland Rifle Range it would be a Et valuable as.stt to the State; the amount of money necessary to intain same would be comparatively small cost to the State, and when it is understood all improvements made by the State on the range are permanent fixtures, then the advisability and necessity for an appropriation sufficient at this time to make everything appertaining to said range permanent in character, and it plaie- Ne - braska on the map as a station of great importance for military pur - pouot Nebraska can not afford to let the opportunity given it by the I'nited States go by, by a refusal to do its part and duty in the pTt-niinef. During the past three and one-half years I have been called upon to render divers and sundry opinions upon matters affecting the Guard. I have also prepared leases for armories, storage leaaea, rntracts of various descriptions, and other matters of importance. do not deem it necessary to enumerate any of these matters, nor do 1 think it necessary to further refer to them in this report. All information concerning them can be found by reference to the files in the office of the Adjutant General, to which I refer and make part of thi9 report. On June 20, 1916. I was ordered by Adjutant General Hall to report for duty as Judge Advocate General at the mobilization camp, Camp Moreheid. State Fair Grounds. Lincoln, Nebraska. I reported for duty and was assigned quarters at camp. Without going into details, I will give you a brief summary of business transacted by this department.

MOHEHEAD. Commander in Chief, (Official.) P. L. HALL, Jr Adjutant General. Chief of Staff This General Court was duly convened and in conjunction with Adjutant General Hall, and Colonel Eberly, and Paul, commanding the Fourth and Fifth Infantry, respectively, discussed the matters to be brought before this general court martial. General Hall, stronKly urged and advised, that in the handling and disposition of unruly mem - bers of the Guard, in refusing to take the new Federal Oath as re- Kthat instead of applying drastic methods to ill-advised and ded men, he advised that preliminary to trial of offenders, that tter rest in the discretion of this department, and that this de- </seg>
            <seg id="p419">ADJUTANT C.EXERAL'S REPORT 409 I jartment should exercise concilliatory methods, to use reason and harrh methods in all cases which might be t. The Court concurred in the General's views, referred to this department for action and tea t i port. This department caused all recalcitrants and other offenders •ciugiir before this department, and after strenuous efforts, and an- ) their patriotism, and loyalty, and showing them the ;tl rther disobedience, and disregard of duty, trouble of seri - reachinp effect was thereby avoided and the good welfare and discipline of the Guard was restored. I want to call attention to the fact that the disc ontent and dissatisfaction among the enlisted at the mobilization can-.p was largely due to ill advice given the by so called "Prairie Lawyers," who are alwa&gt;'3 a source of an- ance on all occasions, where they think they can get in the lime - t by their valuable (?) suggestions, but which always results In ilscord and discontent engendered. The officers in charge of the mobilization camp are to be congratulated, on the happy solution of apparent difficulty affecting the service by the exercise of sound retion and good horse sense. The Summary Courts appointed to y offenders of minor offenses, performed their duty in a creditable anner and restored good order and military discipline. While hi the nobilizaiion camp, this department was called upon office, and enlisted men. to render legal aid, and assistance to them, this department cheerfully complied with their request and prepared without cost or expense to either officers or men .one hun- Ired and sixty-three Wills, and Ninety-Seven Powers of Attorney, be - sides rendering other services. . I find that the duties and respon - sibilities of this office are rapidly increasing, and in the proper ad- ministration of affairs caused by the enactment of the National De - fense Act. more care, diligence and effort must be employed to suc- cessfully cope with the complex questions, which daily arise. I found the personnel of the enlisted men good, and their readiness and wil- lingness to perform their full duty as soldiers, most commendable. A Remedy Should Be It-nvided to Permit Soldiers and Sailors to Vote While in the Military Service of the United States. It is to be deplored that our brave boys who are now serving their country on the Mexican border, were deprived of their right of franchise at the last general election by reason of no provision of law having been enacted by this State, to authorize them to exercise the right of ballot. It is the opinion of this department that a bill should be pre - pared and presented to the Legislature, for their consideration, to remedy this defect, so that hereafter in case emergency arises, sol - diers and sailors who are serving their country, can have their con - stitutional rights guaranteed in this respect. I would suggest the following as a proposed bill: </seg>
            <seg id="p420">410 \ mil. A Bill for an Act providing for the Exercise of the Elective Franchise by Electors of this State who are in the Military Service ot the United States. Be it Enacted by the People of the State of Nebraska L Section 1. At the first general or special election after the sec- Monday in January, 1917, every elector in this state who is in the Military Service of the United States and, because of said service, is absent, on said day, from the city, village, town or voting precinct in which he is entitled to vote as an elector, shall have the same right to give, in the manner hereinafter provided, his ballot for candidates for all offices voted for at said election, and to have said ballot counted for all candidates for saio. cftices as he would have if present at the time of voting in said election in said city, village, town or voting precinct.

One from the party which polled the highest number of votes for governor at the last preceding general election for said office, and one from the party polling the next highest num - ber of votes for said office at said election, commissioners to receive the ballots of said soldiers pursuant to this act. Said commissioners shall be sworn to faithfully perform the duties of their appointment, and shall, in proper season to perform said duties, proceed to the sev - eral camps, fortresses, military posts, and other places, where Ne - braska military organizations or' units are then stationed or located, to receive the ballots of such soldiers as are electors of this state, which ballots shall be received by said commissioners not more than thirty nor less than ten days prior to the first Monday preceding and special or general election.

Whereas an emergency exists this act shall be in force from and after its passage and approval as required by law. I wish especially to call attention to the fact that this department is growing in important p. and involves large clerical work. It is al - most impossible for the Judge Advocate General to perform this &lt; ler- Ework with satisfaction and dispatch. There is no appropriation this department that allows the employment of a stenographer anil ist, and hence the duty devolves upon the Judge Advocate unless he pays for the service, out of his own pocket. A suitable appropriatic should be allowed this department to pay for the services of a steno rapher and typist when services arc required, also a sufficient of fun for necessary stationery and postage. All of which are absolutely r tired for the good of the service, and the dispatch of business of th part merit. I have but given a brief summary in this report of what I deem the salient questions. Records and files can supply any further in - formation required. I want to return my sincere thanks to the Com - mander-in-('hief, the Adjutant General and Staff, and to Colonels Eberly and Paul for their uniform courteous treatment and assistance rendered me, and my department.

Neb.. Jan From the Adjutant General To His Excellency, the Governor Commander-in-Chief Subject: Return of the Fourth Nebraska Infantry, Dec. 31, 19 1. Previous to the return of the 4th Nebraska Infantry from. Llano Grande, Texas, authority was obtained from the War Depaart - ment to utilize Fort Crook as ■ mustering out point. Fort Crook is especially adapted for mustering out troops, the reason that it was built was for the special purpose of garrisoning soldiers. It is located seven miles south of Oamha. Considering the fact that these men of the 4th Nebraska Infantry were not acclimated, the steam heated barracks, offices, etc., were of great advantage in the mustering out process. t2. Considerable grief was experienced by the commanding of - er of the post in placing the fort in readiness, as the barracks and ildings had not been utilized for four years. Water pipes, drains. etc., were in poor condition and necessitated considerable time and labor to render them fit for use. According to regulations, Captain Walter T. Bates, Captain J. W. Everington, Captain L. R. James. Major F. B. Krug retired. Captain Charles King of the regular army. and First Lieutenant E. L. Ualaney of the Reserve Corps, were assigned as mustering out officers. The following officers of the State Adminis - trative Staff, in accordance with the National Defense Act, were or - dered on duty at Fort Crook to report for the State and for the pur - pose of receiving and invoicing Government property to be turned over </seg>
            <seg id="p437">ADJUTANT GENERAL'S REPORT 427 to the State by the Federal Government, and to carry out the different duties that come under the several departments: Brigadier General P. L.

Corps. 3, The 4th Nebraska Infantry arrived on December 31, 1818. the first section arriving at 1:16 p. m., the second section at 4:00 p. m. Colonel Eberly, Commanding, reported 53 commissioned of - ficers, 66:'. enlisted men. Id men on furlough and one sick. The weather was cold and the snow added to retard the unloading. Prep - arations immediately commenced for the muster out. The date for muster out was set or fixed for January 15. The officers and men were inexcellent health and glad to return, but ready to go back to their duty if necessary, regardless of the fact that they had spent the past six months patrolling the Mexican border in the most southern section of the L'nited States under adverse conditions. 4. The property which was brought back with the regiment was in fair condition, having been put to a severe test on the border. The officers of the Q. M. Corps of the State Administrative Staff and the musterinK out officers immediately took steps to count all prop - erty, surveying that which was unserviceable and invoicing to the captains that which was servh able. The captains are required to be bonded and held to strict accountabilities for all property issued to them. Machine guns and machine ?un trucks, wagons, harness, etc.. were invoiced direct to the State and shipped to Lincoln to the State Arsenal for storage in order to relieve the company commanders of as much responsibility as possible. The fact that each commander is required to return to his company rendezvous with his command and the lease which previously covered the Armories having been can - celled, lie will be required to temporarily store such property which was invoiced to him until the State Legislature appropriates sufficient funds to properly house the equipment. For this reason, all camp equipment is being invoiced back to the State and shipped to the State Arsenal at Lincoln. 5. Due to the fact that many of the men in leaving th. com - pany rendezvous upon mobilization were required to expend their own personal funds in order to bring the organization to the required strength and the shortness of time did not allow State or Government to present the proper vouchers, etc.. and due to the fact that the State funds have been exhausted. The Adjutant General has recommended that sufficient funds be made available immediately for the purpoM Of settling all claims in connection with mustering in and mustering out </seg>
            <seg id="p438">428 tthe 4th Nebraska Infantry. 5th Nebraska Infantry. Nebraska Signal ■ps, and Nebraska Field Hospital. t6. You will note that the 4th Nebraska Infantry arrived on the day of the year and that the customs of the American people to give vent to their feelings in celebrating the arrival of the new year, and I desire to make special mention of the fact that on New Years there were in barracks at Fort Crook in the neighborhood of 800 men who had been away from their homes and dear ones for the past six months, and it is with pleasure that I can conscientiously report that not one complaint was received nor was It necessary to utilize any special precaution along this line. The conduct of the officers and men of the 4th Nebraska Infantry during the process of mustering out has been a happy climax to the splendid record which that organization has made while serving the President of the United States on the Mexican border. Another thing that is worthy of note is the comparison of the physical condition of the officers and men of the 4th Nebraska Infantry to that of the different regiments of Militia and volunteers that participated in the Spanish-American war. Out of approximately 2,000 Nebraska National Guardsmen who have been in the service six months in an unaccustomed climate subject to diseases and poisonous insects, the official record shows that only one man died and this was accidentally, due to drowning. Without any intent to criticise of reflect upon the record of the second Nebraska Infantry, during the Spanish-American War, the records show that 24 men died of disease and 4 from accidents. 7.

Having been one of the first organizations to arrive at Camp Llano Grande, its members have uncomplainingly and with soldierly spirit undergone the discomforts of the formative period of the camp's existence. Since then the conduct of its members has been admirable and it has met every demand made upon it. If it has been called into active service it would undoubtedly have given an excellent account of itself. The improvement of your regiment under instruction given it here has been most marked and gratifying. It now returns to State control with an excellent record and is an organization of which the State of Nebraska has every reason to be proud. 3. The best wishes of the undersigned for its future success accompany it, together with a lively appreciation of the services of the regiment while under his command. (Signed.) E. M. LEWIS, Brigadier General, Indiana, Commanding WAR UKPAKTMKNT. Washington. Dec. :M). 1916 The Commanding Off i&lt; er Fourth Infantry. Nebraska National Guard Sir: I wish to thank you and the officers and men of your organization who went to the border in response to the call of the President, for the valuable service which you have rendered to the country. When the National Guard was called into the service of the Federal Gov - ernment the lives of men, women and children along the frontier were in grave danger, owinu to the formidable bandit raids from the Mex - ican side of the boundary. It is not too much to say tnat had these raids continued there was danger of international war. From the time of the arrival of the units of the National Guard on the border, the raids ceased, and the tension between the two countries began to relax. It is the hope and belief of the Government that the presence of the units of the National Guard, together with the units of the Regular Army, on the border and in Mexico, and the presence in mob - ilization camps of the units of the National Guard in readiness for such service, has made possible a peaceful solution of a difficult and threatening problem. Very Respectfully. (Signed.) NEWTON D. BAKER, Secretary of War. </seg>
