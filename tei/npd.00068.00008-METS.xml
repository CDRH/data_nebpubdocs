Three two-story brick store buildings are located upon the ■city lots, and improvements, Buch as houses, barns, corn-cribs, etc., •are located upon the farm lands. When conditions are favorable, I am of the opinion the lots and lands should be sold. Under the present law, the lots can be sold at public auction, but it will be necessary to enact a law providing for the sale of the 320 acres of land, and I would recommend that such a law be passed.

The extension of sale contracts is a great convenience to the ■owners and an excellent investment for the school fund.

            <seg id="p021">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT • RULES AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO THE LEASING AND SALE OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS Lease Contracts The Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings may at least once In each year designate a day and an hour for offering in a public manner, at the office of the county treasurer in the respective coun - ties, lease contracts on all of the educational lands which may be subject to lease in that county at the time of such offering. The same shall be subject to lease at an annual rental of six (6) per cent on the appraised value. Provided, if two or more parties desire to lease the same land, the officer having control of the auction shall lease to the person who will pay the greater amount of cash bonus in addition to six (6) per cent on the appraised value as annual rental. Lease rentals are due in two installments, January 1st and July 1st of each year. If rentals are not paid within six months after due, the lease holders are declared delinquent and notice is sent them if their postoffice addresses are known. If unknown, advertisement is made in a newspaper. Ninety days after date of such notice lease contracts are declared forfeited and are subject to auction thereafter. (See Fees.) Delinquent lease holders are not permitted to bid at the sale of the lands they have forfeited, but at any time before the land is actually put on the auction block they may reinstate their leases by paying all back rentals and penalty fees. (See Fees.) All school lands under lease are subject to reappraisement at any time the Board of Educational Lands and Funds so elects. All leases expire twenty-five years from the first day of January next ensuing after the date of the lease. A lessee has the right at the expiration of his lease to apply to the county treasurer for a new lease and receive the same without competition, at the same time surrendering the old lease, paying rentals six. months in advance, and a lease fee of fifty cents. This will do away with the public auction only in cases where the former lessee does not apply for new lease. In such cases the lands will be advertised and leased at public auction to the highest bidder, and all improvements on the land appraised by the county board. Improvements to be included in such appraisements shall be all build - ings, fencing, wells, windmills, pumps, tanks, irrigation improvements, and also costs for labor expended in breaking sod on said tract of land and reducing same to cultivation, and for alfalfa or other crops growing upon said land. The appraisement shall be made within thirty (30) days after the acceptance of the bid. (See page 546., </seg>
            <seg id="p022">, LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT • Laws of Nebraska, 1927.) Where lands are forfeited on account of non-payment of rentals, the movable Improvements are sold under the direction of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. (See page 1655, Compiled Statutes, 1922.) The amount of school land authorized to be leased, direct or by renewal, to one person is limited to 640 acres. EDUCATIONAL LANDS MAY BE PURCHASED FROM THE STATE AS FOLLOWS: Lands known as isolated tracts, lands situated in the irrigation districts, and lands for the use of churches, cemeteries, schoolhouse sites, county agricultural fairs, public roads, and for sewage disposal purposes. Any lessee of land situated within the areas irrigated, or to be irrigated, from irrigation works constructed or .controlled, or to be constructed or controlled by the United States, or its duly authorized agencies, or any lessee of any forty-acre, tract or government sub - division, any part of which is under irrigation, may purchase the same. (See page 652, Laws of Nebraska, 1929.) The law also provides that if any forty (40) acre tract is adjacent to other school land which is wholly or partly under Irrigation, and therefore subject to sale, such tract may be sold even though not under irrigation if, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, it is expedient to sell the same. Any irrigation district in which there are or may be any educational lands belonging to the state which are or may hereafter become sites for reservoir purposes may purchase from the state for reservoir sites such educa - tional lands, or portions thereof. (See page 655, Laws of Nebraska, 1929.) The law provides that the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings shall make a list of all isolated tracts of school lands con - taining less than forty (40) acres, all undivided interests in realty, and all city lots held by the state of Nebraska in trust for the per - manent school fund, appraise same, and, upon the expiration of the leases or upon forfeiture of lease titles, offer the same for sale at public auction, to be sold by. the county treasurer of the county in which the lands are located to . the highest bidder for not less than ninety (90) per cent of the appraised value. The purchaser shall pay not less than twenty-five (25) per cent in cash on day of sale and the balance to be secured by sale contract running ten years at six (6) per cent annual interest, the purchaser having the right to pay all of the unpaid money, or any part of it, in multiples of five (5) per cent of the total purchase price at any interest payment date. In the event the purchaser, or the assignee, does not pay the annual interest upon the unpaid purchase price within six (6) months </seg>
            <seg id="p023">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT after interest becomes due, the land shall revert to the state. SALE CONTRACTS The owner of a sale contract may at any time pay any portion of the purchase price thereof to the treasurer of the county in which the land Is situated; provided, all interest at that time earned and due has first been paid. And when the principal is paid in full other than the first of the year, interest upon the obligation having been paid for the entire year, the county treasurer receiving such principal payment may refund to the payor out of any interest money then in his hands the interest so paid in advance in excess of the amount earned and due at the time said final payment is made. Refund receipts are furnished by the land commissioner for this purpose. All unpaid principal on sale contracts draws Interest at five (5) per cent per annum, payable annually on January first of each year in advance. A sale contract holder making final payment to the county treasurer should also surrender his contract that it may be forwarded to the land commissioner with receipt showing full payment. NOTES No assignment of a school land lease or sale contract is valid until recorded in the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Build - ings, and an assignment will not be recorded if any interest or rental is due at the time it is offered for record. The original sale or lease contract must be sent in with the assignment or the latter will not be recorded. Contracts will be returned with recorded assignments. When a subdivision of not less than forty acres in any contract is assigned, a new number is given the assigned portion on the ledger account and a certified copy of the original is given to the assignee. When assignment is made as above, the original contract must be re - duced and the interest or rentals, as the case may be, is adjusted to the new conditions. Whenever a lease or sale contract . becomes lost or destroyed, a certified copy of the same may be procured by filing an affidavit of lost contract. Such copy may be used in lieu of the original for the purpose of passing title. When interest on a sale contract, or rental on a lease contract, is not paid when due, the county treasurers will collect "penalty" interest at seven (7) per cent for the time purchaser or lessee has been tardy in making such payments. Improvements on leased land and the owner's equity in land under sale contract are subject to taxation. County treasurers are requested to send in school land receipts at least once each week. Some times tardiness in this particular leads </seg>
            <seg id="p024">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT to considerable unnecessary correspondence and occasionally to de - linquencies being charged against contract holders who are not in arrears, but whose receipts have not been sent to the land com - missioner's office.

Conroy, Ogallala Deputy Edward Johnson, Orleans , Deputy Cha8. Gardner, Sidney Deputy The original evidence of land surveys, consisting of more than, eight hundred hound books of field notes" and the official plats derived and made up therefrom, were transferred to the state, under the pro - visions of Sections 2218, 2219 and 2220, United States Revised Statutes, and are in the custody of this office. A resume of the law governing the care of these records and the duties of the state surveyor, as set forth by Mr. Robert Harvey in a previous Biennial Report, is as follows: "The statutes of 1903 defined the duties of the State Surveyor and Draughtsman, and placed in his direct charge, under the supervision of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildingc, the field notes, and all other records of the Government surveys of Public Lands in the state, conduct the correspondence pertaining to the surveys, grievances or disputes growing out of conflicting surveys of lands and lots to prepare the advice or instructions and opinions and issue a circular of instructions to county surveyors of the state for their di - rection and guidance in the restoration and establishment of lines and preservation of corners, In conformity with the laws, rules and regula - tions governing the surveys of the United States and establishing rules of surveying, and perform such other duties as may be required by the Commissioner; and in case of any disputes among land owners or by reason of any survey of boundaries of lands within the state or of disputes or disagreements between surveyors as to the survey of boundaries, when petitioned for, shall be referred to the State Sur - veyor, who is made the arbitrator to determine and settle such disputes by making the necessary examinations and surveys to settle the same, and whose decisions shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness thereof." "The law also provides for an appeal to the courts from decisions of the State Surveyor in making such surveys by any person having an interest in the lands affected by such surveys." "It also provides that the per diem of the surveyor for each day's service while engaged in field work and necessary expenses shall be paid by the parties having the work done. The per diem of the State Surveyor is to be paid Into the general fund of the state. The law was amended In 1909, providing for the appointment of experienced and competent land surveyors as deputies. The law was also amended </seg>
            <seg id="p026">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT in 1919, which provided that when surveys were made by the' State Surveyor in person, his per diem la to be $8.00 per day for each day while engaged in the work, which per diem is to be paid into the general fund of the state; he is to receive the return of his nec - essary expenses.

We, the undersigned land owners in section hereby petition for a survey of the following lines. Township No North, Range No West, East, in County, Nebraska, and request that the State Surveyor make an ex - amination and survey of said lines. We agree to make an advance deposit of such sum as may be requested by you to be applied in payment of the office fees for copy - ing the necessary field notes and maps for the surveyor's use, exam - ination of the surveyor's notes and maps . of survey, and of the sur - veyor's per diem and his necessary expenses. We further agree to pay such additional sum as may be necessary to complete the survey, for material necessary in making the corners of said survey and county surveyor's fee for recording. Respectfully, Witnesses: Names of Applicants: Note: One dollar filing fee must accompany each application 4 '. See Sections 4864 to 4870 inclusive, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska, 1922. "A resurvey must be initiated at some well-defined, identified and unquestioned starting point on the original surveys. It must terminate at some equally well-known and identified point." Hence it is often necessary to extend measurements beyond the lines required in the immediate survey in order to ascertain the correct - location of the corners required. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT t OFFICE OF COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC LANDS AND BUILDINGS DEPARTMENT OF SURVEYING Rulua of practice in making state surveys Before initiating a survey, an application containing a clear and comprehensive description of the lines proposed to be surveyed, and accompanied with a filing fee of one dollar, must be deposited with the state surveyor. Separate surveys must not be included in the same application. Blanks will be furnished when requested. Upon receipt of an application with the proper fee, the records are consulted and an estimate made of the probable cost, and an advance deposit to be applied in payment for copying field notes, the surveyor's per diem and expenses, and other costs incidental to the survey, is required. Extra help and material for marking corners are to be furnished by the applicant. We require a deposit to protect our deputies; and on the other hand to protect our applicants. No deputy is paid until his work is carefully examined and approved by the commissioner. Each application is given a serial number in the order of its filing and all records of surveys made under such application contain this number. The state surveyor or some deputy is assigned the task of making the required survey and furnishing complete field notes, maps etc., which are carefully examined and checked in this office. Finally, after approval by the commissioner, the complete maps, field notes and accompanying memoranda are made a part of the records of this office, and a certified copy is filed in the county sur - veyor's office in the county where the survey is made. After the work is completed, approved and properly placed on record any exqeas payment is refunded to the applicant. Neither the state surveyor nor any deputy has authority to make any state survey without special commission referring thereto. DAN SWANSON, Commissioner, By E. C. Simmons, State Surveyor.
