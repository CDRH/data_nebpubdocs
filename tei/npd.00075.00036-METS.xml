The machines studied were of four types, classified on the basis of mechan - ical construction. The types were dolly, gyrator, cylinder, and vacuum. Eight machines were studied, four of the gyrator type, two of the dolly type, one of the cylinder type, and one of the vacuum type. The material reported in this bulletin includes the. following: (1) cleans - ing action of various washing machines and relation of cleanness of fabric to length of washing period, temperature of water, and size of load; (2) wear on fabric; (3) heat retention; (4) constructional fea - tures adding to convenience of operation. .To study the. cleansing action of different machines, they were used to wash test specimens of fabric which had been soiled under uniform conditions. The machines were operated under uniform conditions of time, temperature and load, and amount and hardness of water and soap solution. The washed specimens were dried under uniform con - ditions and tested for whiteness or brightness by a photometric method.. The brightness, which was the measure of cleanness of the washed specimens, was determined by comparison with a new, unwashed speci - men of the same fabric, assumed to be 100 per cent clean. Results show that the maximum brightness of test specimens washed in the cylinder and vacuum machines was highest, and. from the dolly machines lowest. The difference in maximum brightness of specimens washed in the cylinder and vacuum machines as compared with those from the gyrators was slight. In general, specimens washed in the gyrator machines reached maxi - mum brightness in less time than in other types. Specimens washed in one dolly-type machine reached maximum brightness in less time than in the gyrator machines. Specimens washed in the cylinder and vacuum types required longest to reach maximum brightness. Speci - mens washed in one dolly machine required longer to reach maximum brightness than in the gyrator machines, but less than in the cylinder and vacuum types. Each machine appears to have an optimum washing period, which depends, upon the. character of the dirt used in soiling and is affected by temperature of the water. Washing clothing longer than the opti - mum period apparently results in redistributing the dirt "over the fabric. Medium temperatures (around 125° F.) gave best results in this study.. Higher temperatures tend to cook or "set" the dirt into the meshes of the cloth. There appears to be an optimum load for each machine. A decreased or increased load did not in general give as satisfactory results as did the optimum load. To determine comparative wear on fabric, strips of test material were washed under uniform conditions for the same length of time in the different machines. Samples, uniform in thread count, were cut from the test strips, conditioned as to moisture_ content, and tested for breaking strength by a Scott tester. Breaking strength of the washed samples was. compared with the breaking strength of samples of the new, unwashed material of the same thread count, conditioned in the same way. Results show that the gyrator machines caused less wear than other types and the dolly machines the most. Differences in wear were of slight significance except for one dolly machine, which produced relatively great wear. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">To determine the comparative heat retention of different machines, they were filled with water at the same, temperature and allowed to cool under uniform conditions of room temperature and draft. The temperature of the water was taken at ten-minute intervals for a period of one hour. The machines were kept closed except to insert the thermometer. Results show little difference in cooling rate for the different machines. The machine with the lowest cooling, rate was double walled and finished both inside and out in white porcelain enamel. The machine with the highest cooling rate was a cylinder type. The walls were copper plated inside and enameled outside. It had a. large opening in addition to the opening into the cylinder. The machines were also tested for heat retention under actual wash - ing conditions. The machine having the highest cooling rate was the cylinder type mentioned above, with large openings in both outside tub and inside cylinder. On the machine next highest in cooling rate, the opening was equal in area to the surface area of water, and the outside was corrugated. The machine was made of nickel-plated copper and was double walled with a steel jacket. Variation in cool - ing rate for other machines was slight. In no case was the cooling rate high enough to be of significance in the selection of a washing machine. No machines studied met all reasonable requirements for convenience in constructional features. There is room for improvement, especially in attachment of lids and height and placement of controls, regulation of tension between wringer rolls, and shape and control of drainboards on wringers. . •.' ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p005">A Study of Washing Machines By KDNA B. SNYDER, Dcixirtmcnt of Home Economics, and MORTON P. BUUNIG. Department of Agricultural Engineering } Manufacturers have made available washing machines of various types, materials, and finishes, which provide many features designed to promote comfort and ease in the launder - ing of clothing: There is a fairly wide price range to meet various incomes. Changes in washing machines have recently been rather rapid, leaving the pux*chaser in doubt as to the resulting increase in efficiency or rapidity of the washing pro - cess. The purpose of this investigation was to study the per - formance of various types of washing machines and the con - structional features which are factors in adapting them to family needs. Washing machines, to be of maximum service, should .fulfill several quite definite requirements. Such requh-ements are listed as follows: (1) thorough and rapid removal of dirt from fabric; (2) minimum wear on fabric; (3) construc - tional features which afford convenience, safety, ease in handling and cleaning, durability, and good heat-retention qualities; and (4) capacity sufficient to accommodate the clothing of an average family and at the same time require only a minimum of space. Results of this investigation are reported under the follow - ing headings: 1. Cleansing action of various types of washing machines and relation of cleanness of fabric to length of washing period, temperature of water, and size of load. 2. Wear upon fabric from various types of machines. 3. Retention of heat by different machines. 4. Constructional features of machines which add to con - venience in operation. • TYPES OF MACHINES STUDIED In general, washing machines are of four types, which may be classified upon the basis of the mechanical construction of the washer. The original intent was to choose for this study a certain number of machines of each type and to include a fairly wide range in price. Upon investigation, it was learned that the trend of manufacturers was toward one particular type, and that it was difficult to purchase locally some of the others desired. There arose the question of underlying reas - -1 The writers wish to acknowledge suggestions and constructive criticism on this project from Miss Mary Mason of the Division of Household Equipment and Miss Gladys Winegar of the Division of Cloth inn and Textiles.

            <seg id="p006">6 Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 56 ons for the popularity of the predominent type, and the justi - fication for discontinuing others. Instead of adhering to the original plan, it seemed more feasible to select several machines of the type most in evidence. There appeared to be more minor difference's among the various makes of this type than in others. Eight machines were selected and pur - chased. Two were of the dolly type, four of the gyrator type, one of the cylinder type, and one of the vacuum type. Table 1 lists the machines studied, giving type and descrip - tion.

            <seg id="p007">A Study of Washing Machines FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF WASHER IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF MACHINES A washing machine is constructed so that dirt is removed from clothing by one of three methods: (1) moving clothes through the water, (2) moving water through the clothes, (3) a combination, of the two methods. The mechanical action of the machine is combined with the chemical action of a soap solution in the cleansing process. Fig. 1.— Dolly type. The dolly type of machine (Figure 1) is perhaps the most familiar, since many of the older hand-power machines were of this type. The "dolly," which is made of wood, metal, or rubber prongs projecting downward from a solid, circular piece supported by a central vertical shaft, is usually attached to the lid of the machine. The clothes are washed by being moved through the water, first in one direction and then in the other. Often the tub is grooved to provide greater friction. The gyrator type (Figure 2) somewhat resembles the dolly, and is frequently spoken of as a modified dolly. The gyrator is supported in the bottom of the tub' and may have two or more blades or vanes, which differ considerably in shape, posi - tion, and material in different makes of machines. The gyrat - or oscillates in a horizontal plane about a vertical axis through an arc (usually about 180°), the driving force being directed against the water. </seg>

Such a procedure involves uniformity of materials and manipulation and should be of such a nature that the process may be duplicated. Variable factors must, insofar as possible, be eliminated. The soiling mixture must be uniform in content and application; fabric of one brand and construction must be used for test work; and the tem - perature and hardness of water, the quantity of soap, the load, and the length of washing period must be kept constant </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 56 Fig. 4. — Vacuum type. so that variations in results may reasonably be attributed to differences in the mechanical action of the machines. In order to obtain results of practical value the soiling mixture should, as nearly as possible, approximate actual "dirt" on clothing and household linens. Such "dirt" is complex in character, consisting in general of soot, earth, fats, oils, starchy substances, and proteins. Ordinary dirt comes from body secretions, from foods, and from outside sources, depend - ing upon the occupation of the wearer of the clothing. The various forms of dirt react differently to heat, and, as a result, methods of laundering are complicated. Different "standard" soiling mixtures which have been developed generally include lampblack, which is nearly in - soluble in water, as the dark constituent, with fats and oils dissolved in some volatile liquid. The solvent, by dissolving fats and oils, makes even soiling possible, leaving only the solid material in the soiled cloth. DIRT MIXTURES USED AND METHOD OF SOILING Preliminary to this study, experiments with dirt mixtures were carried on in the Agricultural Engineering Department, University of Nebraska. The problem was to devise a soiling mixture which could be applied uniformly to a very large number of test samples. Any volatile liquid having the neces - sary characteristics was prohibitive in cost, because of the </seg>
            <seg id="p011">A Study of Washing Machines quantity required. It was found that boneblack, which forms a" more stable suspension in water, gave better results than lampblack. To make the study comprehensive, and there - lore of practical value, two "dirts" differing in composition were used, designated herein as Dirt No. 1 and Dirt No. 2. The following constituents and method of soiling were adopted for Dirt No. 1. One hundred fifty grams of bone black and two hundred grams of flour were mixed dry. Enough water to form a thin paste was then slowly added. The mix - ture was poured into five gallons of water in a gyrator-type washer, and agitated by operation of the machine for three or four minutes. To this soiling mixture were added 64 test .specimens which had been separately crushed, after which they were bunched and pushed under the solution. The speci - mens consisted of 11-inch squares of white Indian Head mus - lin, woven with 52 warp threads and 46 filling threads per inch, and of a brand easily duplicated; 2 They were "washed" in the dirt solution for 20 minutes, put through the wringer flat, and hung in a dark room for 24 hours to "set," the dark room reducing the possibility of bleaching. The following constituents and method of soiling were adopted for Dirt No. 2. A mixture consisting of 1,000 grams of black loam, 150 grams of water, two grams of lampblack, and five cubic centimeters of heavy lubricating oil of a popular brand was selected as being satisfactory after various com - binations of these substances had been tried. Since the dirt in Solution No. 1 was pretty well "set" in the cloth, Dirt No. 2 was devised to represent a "mild" dirt. Enough moisture and oil were present to give the dirt the desired property of spreading over and adhering to the surface of the cloth, with - out the penetration between fibres as with Dirt No. 1. To provide even distribution of the dirt on the cloth, the mix - ture was rotated for 30 minutes in a mixing box with 50 specimens, like those used with Dirt No. 1, together with several small wooden blocks. The mixing box, Figure 5, was patterned after a Wheat Seed Treatment Device (No. 10.40122-1 Agricultural Engineering Blue Print). One side of the box was hinged to form a lid. A wooden grooved pulley wheel about nine inches in diameter was attached flat against one end of the box. Sections of three-quarter-inch pipe, attached to the center of each end of the box by means of plates, formed the axle of the mixer. A small motor belted to a reducing gear and from this to the grooved pulley on the end of the box gave a uniform rotation of 30 R.P.M. to the box, making a total of 900 revolutions for the soiling period. . - With sizing. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 56 The interior dimensions of the box were 15" x 15" x 30". It was fitted with four baffle boards %"x.l '/■&gt;"&gt; running full length of the box. These boards, together with flat sides and square corners, provided greater agitation and better mixing of the material than would a uniform cylinder. There was no evidence of bunching or twisting of specimens. The blocks of wood and dirt were always found well distributed throughout the box after rotation. Following soiling, the specimens were dried in the dark for 24 hours. Fig. 5. — Mixing box used to apply Dirt No. 2 to tent ppeoimens, </seg>
            <seg id="p013">A Study of Washing Machines CONDITIONS AND METHOD OF WASHING SOILED SPECIMENS Water of 16 degrees hardness was used for the washing. The water was softened by ordinary washing soda of a widely used brand. The washing soda was purchased in small sealed packages to prevent changes from evaporation. A popular soap was used. It was ground in a food chopper and made into solution. The machines were loaded with sheets and strips of sheeting. The. sheets were new, of standard size, nine-quarter double sheets, Weighing two pounds each. The strips, used for the purpose of providing articles of uneven size in the load, were of sheeting of the same width and brand, torn through the middle, and two and one-half yards in length. The soiled samples were distributed throughout the load before washing. The machines were operated, first, with 100 per cent load and amount of water as specified by the manufacturer; sec - ond, with less than the specified load, or 75 per cent load; and third, with more than, the specified load, or 125 per cent load. Machines having variable speeds were operated at maxi - mum speed. With each machine the samples were passed through a wringer except for Washer E, which was provided with a centrifugal dryer. Each wash or suds was followed by a three-minute rinse in the machine. The temperature was varied for both suds and rinse, and the washing periods were varied for the suds. For Dirt No. 1, the washing periods were 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. For Dirt No. 2, they were o, 5, 7, and 10 minutes. Temperatures with Dirt No. 1 were: suds 120° F. with rinse 65° F.; suds 120°F. with rinse 160° F. ; and suds 140°F. with rinse 65° F. Temperatures with Dirt No. 2 were: suds 120° F. with rinse 65° F. and suds ]20 F. with rinse 160° F. Time was checked by a stop watch. The proportion of soap and softener used was uniform throughout the study. With Dirt No. 1 no attempt was made to wash the test samples clean. The washed specimens were smoothed with a warm iron to prevent wrinkling, after which they were dried for 24 hours, and kept in a dark room. DETERMINATION OF CLEANNESS The determination of cleanness of a piece of cloth is a difficult process. The cloth might be weighed and a known amount of dirt added, after which it could be washed and weighed again. This method has been tried by other investi - gators, but the disadvantage lies in the fact that there is no assurance that the apparent loss of dirt is not also accom - panied by loss of weight caused by wear on material. The method which is now most commonly used, and which seems </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 56 to be most accurate, consists of the measurement of bright - ness or "whiteness" of a sample of white material which has been soiled and washed, as compared with a standard. The most simple process of determining whiteness is by visual comparison of the washed fabric with the original clean material. More accurate but also more complicated measure - ments involve the directing of a light of known intensity upon a sample and measuring the intensity of the reflected light. The latter, or photometric method, involves difficulties, with ordinary electric lights as a source, because of the wide voltage variation. These difficulties led to the design and construction of the apparatus shown irr Figure 6. (£_ /i&gt; • __.___!) L?LAMP P»PHOTOMETtQ 5=5CliEEN - . c« CURTAIN | Fig. 6. — Diagram of apparatus used for measuring relative brightness of washed specimens. In the diagram, S, and S. are screens upon which specimens to be compared are mounted. L is a light of any desired in - tensity. P is a simple Bunsen Photometer. A curtain, allow - ing light to pass freely from L to the screens, was suspended between P and L. The apparatus was used in a dark room, but it was found necessary to enclose all except a space in front with a dark curtain to eliminate wall reflection. The distance between the centers of the screens was 200 centi - meters. The screens were 11 inches square, black, and were - covered with a facing of black wall board which had circular openings 10 inches in diameter. The specimens were mounted on the screen,, the wall board serving as a frame and allow - ing the same area of each specimen to be exposed to the light. The light L was in a position which permitted its adjust - ment to throw equal amounts of light to the two screens Before the apparatus was used, two pieces of new material (white Indian Head muslin) were placed on the screens and the lamp was adjusted until the photometer balanced at a point half way between the screens. One new specimen was removed and replaced by a washed specimen. The washed </seg>
            <seg id="p015">A Study of Washing Machines specimen received the same light as the new specimen, but reflected less, because of the darker surface. It was possible to move the photometer toward the washed specimen until a point was reached where it received as much light from the latter as from the new specimen. At this point the photometer was said to be balanced. A set of tables was made so that scale readings could be converted into percentage readings. For example, if the photometer was balanced at a point 75 centimeters from one screen and 125 from the other, the percentage reading was 36, since 75 squared is 36 per cent of 125 squared. If the washed specimen reflected the same amount of light as the new, it .was considered 100 per cent clean. The new specimen was used as a standard of comparison because of the ease of duplication. In the opinion of the investigators, errors due to possible variation in whiteness of the new material were no greater than other errors. Readings were taken by two observers to insure accuracy. After some practice, the observers were able to read the speci - mens independently and obtain readings with a difference of less than one centimeter of variation. This gave a maximum error of less than three per cent for the part of the scale used. When readings failed to agree within- this limit, they were checked and new readings obtained. The same observer was able to repeat readings on different days on the same sample with results within this limit. The method used does not come within the accuracy possible by the use of higher-grade instruments, but does come within that for other phases of the study.

The base of the gyrator is square with rounded corners. The tub of the machine is round. For Washer A, Dirt No. 1, Schedule 1, the brightness of the washed specimens was at its peak for the 10-minute period, after which there was a decrease. For Schedule 2, the tem - perature of the rinse was changed to 160° F., other con - ditions remaining as in Schedule 1. With this schedule, the peak in brightness was reached with the 15-minute period. As a whole, results from Schedule 2, with the hot rinse, were lower than those from Schedule 1 with the cold rinse.

This schedule gave results quite similar to those of Schedule 2, and lower than those of Schedule 1. The peak in brightness was reached at 20 minutes. For Schedules ! and 5, 120° F. was used for suds and 65° F. for rinse, but the load was decreased for the 5- and 10-minute periods, and increased for the 15- and 20-minute. The difference between results from a 70 per cent load washed a short time and a 125 per cent load washed a longer time was not significant. The latter gave slightly higher results. A comparison of results from underloads and overloads with results from the normal lead shows that those from the latter were higher than from cither of the other two." Schedules 6 and 7, with Dirt No. 2, were used with normal loads, with suds at 120° F. and with the rinse varied from cold (65 F.) to hot (160° F.). For the different washing periods used, the difference in brightness was slight, less than that between periods with Dirt No. 1. There was very littlo difference between results from the cold rinse and the hot rinse. The peak in brightness was reached at 7 minutes in both schedules. In Tabje 3 are shown data on performance of Washer B, a gyrator type. The gyrator on this machine has four radial vanes, embedded in a circular base, which project directly ;it right angles to the bottom of the central shaft of the gyrat - or and curve upward at the outer end. The vanes are made of aluminum. The tub is square with rounded corners. Re - sults from Schedule 1, with Dirt No. 1, suds at 120° F., rinse ;it .65 F.'j and normal load, were highest, but the maximum brightness came at the 15-minute period. Results from . Schedule 2 were better than from Schedule 1 for the 5- and 10-minute periods, but lower for the longer periods. Results from Schedules 2 and 3 indicate that this machine reaches its maximum somewhat more quickly than is indicated by Sched - ule 1. There was little difference between results from under - loading with short washing periods and overloading with longer periods, and there seemed to be no advantage for either ■as compared with the normal load. With Dirt No. 2 the peak in brightness was reached at 7 minutes with Schedule 6, and in 5 minutes with Schedule 7. However, the difference in brightness was slight between the schedules with a cold and a hot rinse. In Table 4 are data on performance of Washer C, a gyrator type.

            <seg id="p029">A Study of Washing Machines results' with Dirt No. 1 provide a better comparison of the mechanical action of the machines than do those with Dirt No. 2. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS An analysis of. results from this study with reference to the comparative performance of the various machines shows some variation for different types as regards thoroughness and rapidity of dirt removal. There "are shown, also, for each machine, certain fairly definite relationships between such factors as length of washing period, load, temperature of water, and cleanness of fabric. These are of sufficient signifi - cance to offer suggestions of practical value. RELATION OF LENGTH OF WASHING PERIOD TO CLEANSING ACTION A consideration of results with regard to the relation of length of washing period to cleanness of fabric shows that for eaeh machine there appears to be an optimum washing period for any one set of conditions. This optimum may or may not be the "same for different machines of the same type. Oper - ating a machine beyond the optimum period results in a de - cline in brightness for the test samples. Apparently clothes washed longer than a certain period actually become dirtier. In general, the optimum washing period for gyrator machines is less than for other types. However, one dolly-type machine was more rapid than the gyrator types, but the brightness of the washed specimens at the optimum period was lower than for other machines. The optimum period for the cylinder - and vacuum-type machines was the same, and longer than for other machines. The brightness at their optimum was slightly higher than for either gyrator or dolly machines, but the differences were not great enough to be of significance. The optimum washing period for any machine seems to depend upon the character of the soiling mixture. The findings in this study in regard to relation of length of washing period to cleanness are in accordance with those of several other in - vestigators. Rhodes and Brainard, at Cornell University, in a study of the detergent action of soap, found the optimum results with their soiling mixture at a washing period of 7i/*» minutes, after which there was a decline."' A probable ex - planation (after elimination of several others possible), according to them, is that with washing periods longer than ■ - 1 Rhodes ami Brainard measured the deterccnt action of distilled water and com - pared it with that of a soap solution. With a comparatively short wn-hinjr perzoj i:"D minutes) distilled water showed about one-hiilf the determent action of soap. bill when length &gt;&gt;f washing period was increased to five hours the cleansing action oi the distilled water was increased, and that of the soap solution markedly de - crea-cd. They therefore concluded that the decline in brightness for short peHotfo was not ilue to deterioration of the soap solution. Industrial and Engineering Chcmixtry. Vol. 21. No. 1. .Ian.. 1020. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 56 the optimum period, equilibrium between soap solution and dirty cloth is reached, and that this is followed by some con - dition which displaces the apparent equilibrium, rendering the cleaning of the cloth more difficult. Such a condition is, they believe, brought about by continued agitation, the dirt becoming increasingly finely divided, so that it is adsorbed more firmly by the cloth and coats it more effectively. Lennox and Gilmore, Department of Research, American Institute of Laundering, found little increase in dirt suspen - sion after a washing period of 5 minutes, but state that extra time may be justified by considering that additional dirt is being prepared for suspension in a following suds." If the theory of Rhodes and Brainard is correct, the prac - tice of putting a whole family wash through the same water and soap solution, as is frequently done, is open to consider - able objection. Clothing should be washed for two or more short washing periods with change of soap and water. The method used by the better laundries, known as the "multiple suds" process, consists of several washing periods with change of soap and water. In general, single washing periods should not be longer than ten minutes. The purchaser is justified inspecting sufficient agitation of suds and clothing within this period to obtain maximum value from the suds. RELATION OF WATER TEMPERATURE TO CLEANNESS OF FABRIC A consideration of results with regard to the relation of water temperature to cleanness of fabric must take into account the character of the dirt used. Results in this study show that with Dirt No. 1 the relative brightness was uni - formly higher with Schedule 1 (suds 120 ; F., rinse 65° F.) than for the remaining sets of conditions.. While Dirt No. 2, Schedule 1, gave generally higher results, it will be observed that there were exceptions, and the differences between the hot (160° F.) and cold (65° F.) rinse were very slight. Dirt No. 1 contained flour, and therefore starch and protein both of which react unfavorably to the higher temperature. Dirt No. 2 contained oil, which is easily removed by the higher temperature. It should be kept in mind that there was no attempt to wash thoroughly the test samples which had been soiled with Dirt No. 1 and it is possible that the extrenielv hot rinse cooked" or "set" the dirt remaining in the meshes ot the cloth. Results in general for Schedule 2 (suds 1^0° F rinse 160° F.) were higher than for Schedule 3 (suds 140° F " rmse 65° F.) Probably because of the higher suds tempera- B^X^^TPr^^zr^ ffi^M* jar- s - tai </seg>
            <seg id="p031">A Study of Washing Machines ture (Schedule 3), more dirt was "set" in the fabric than with the medium suds (Schedule 2) and final hot rinse. It is generally believed that an extremely cold rinse, or one more than 20 F. below the suds, will cause the fabric of the cloth to contract, and hold the soap and dirt. -With the Dirt No. 1 used in this study the extremely hot rinse prob - ably produced more undesirable results than the extremely cold, and the hot suds (140° F.) applied to the dry fabric more undesirable results than either. Because of the com - plex character of dirt found on clothing, a suds temperature around 120° F., followed by a medium-hot rinse, or one below '140* F., is probably a safer combination, eliminating undesir - able effects from extremes of temperature. Much more de - tailed study would be necessary to establish absolutely cor - rect washing temperatures for different varieties of dirt. However, these results do indicate that high temperatures may be very detrimental. It is probable that, in general, washing temperatures used in common practice are too high. Some manufacturers recommend that they be not above 125° F. Good Housekeeping Institute and the Delineator Institute recommend temperatures around 120° F. unless the clothing has been previously soaked. Higher temperatures (160° F. to boiling) are recommended following soaking. 7 Soaking clothing previous to washing requires labor, which many feel might. as. well be performed by the machine, and prefer to omit it. Probably less labor is involved by washing clothing through a suds of medium temperature for a short period in the machine, and following this with another suds at a higher temperature. Current modes and customs determine to some extent the methods of laundering which are best adapted to clothing and linens used. With present fashions there is much less pure white clothing or linen used than formerly. Color and tint of fabric limit ranges of temperature. .Frequently excessively high temperatures are used for hygienic reasons, which fall outside the field of this study. When such procedure is neces - sary, the hot rinse could be a final rinse, since at this stage of the 'washing process there is no problem of dirt removal. The reason for a cold final rinse is largely to prevent streak - ing the clothing with bluing. With tinted or colored fabrics, there is no need for bluing. SIZE OF LOAD IN RELATION TO CLEANNESS OF FABRIC Results showing relation of cleanness of fabric to size of load indicate that there is one best load for every machine.

Care was taken to break the specimens immediately after removal from the oven, to prevent any regain in "moisture. Table 10 and Figure 8 show the breaking strength of both warp and filling as compared with the breaking strength of the new, unwashed fabric. These figures are averages of the results obtained from the ten specimens. There was considerable variation in breaking strength in both warp and iilling from specimens cut from any one strip. This is to be expected'; the friction would vary on different areas of the material washed, and agitation would vary with the position in the machine. It will be observed that the filling, in each case but one, was stronger after washing than was the" warp; and in some instances was very little below that v,i' the new sample. In the unwashed material the warp was considerably stronger than the filling. The shrinkage from washing seemed insufficient to explain the differences in resulting strength.

Specimens from Washer H showed a greater decrease in breaking .strength than those from other machines in the gyrator group, and were washed less clean. The gyrator in Washer H has one large and one small vane. Since this machine was pur - chased the manufacturer has discontinued the present gyrator and has replaced it with a tri-vane gyrator having vanes of equal size. While the brightness of specimens washed in the vacuum and cylinder machines was slightly higher than from the gyrators, the wear upon the fabric was also rather high. It is possible that the longer washing period required by these machines would result in considerable wear upon the clothing. Results show a relatively greater amount of wear by. the dolly machines (F showing most of all machines tested ) , and the maximum brightness of test specimens was not as high as for the other machines. Washer F, which required a longer time than the gyrators to reach maximum, might wear clothing excessively. It is interesting to note that this machine (See Table 1) is the most rapidly moving machine of all those studied ; that is, the dolly has the great- </seg>

Findings from this study fail to show any- essential relation between the thoroughness and rapidity of washing clothing and the wear of the machine upon the fabric. A washing machine which will wash clothing clean and rapidly without undue wear seems to be an engineering achievement entirely possible, and the purchaser is justified in expecting such per - formance. COMPARATIVE HEAT RETENTION OF DIFFERENT MACHINES Washing machines are usually constructed of metals. In some machines are combined several metals, either plated or pressed together. A few machines have double walls with an air space between, for the purpose of preventing loss of heat. The loss of heat from any machine would be expected to vary according to the kind of material, the shape and the surface area, and the finish. To _ learn the comparative heat retention of the various machines, the following tests were made. The machines were filled with water at 160" F. and covered. During the tests they were opened only sufficiently to insert a thermom - eter for temperature readings. The temperature was taken at 10-minute intervals for a period of one hour. Openings to the room were kept closed to reduce air currents. Room temperature during the test was 58° F. Table 12 and Figure 10 show the cooling rate for each machine. The material and finish, as well as the volume of water in the machines are included in the table. Results show that the cooling rate in the various machines is gradual. Except for Washers A and D, the total tempera - ture drop did not vary significantly. A is built with a double wall to provide air insulation, and is finished both inside and out with white porcelain enamel. The volume of water in the machine is less than for most of the others. . The material used in Washer D is plated copper. The openings, both in the tub and in the cylinder, are relatively large and it was necessary to release both in order to insert the thermometer ±or temperature readings. As a result, larger quantities of steam were allowed to escape. With other machines it was possible to insert the thermometer with less exposure While Washer A, with a double wall, showed the lowest cooling rate that for Washer E, also with a double wall, was relatively g u vl Ho J wever ' the outside wall of E is corrugated, a factor probably tending to increase radiation from this machine </seg>

It does not follow necessarily that a machine which retains heat well, under conditions as described above, would be superior in heat retention under actual washing conditions. The size of the lid and the nature of its contact with the machine are factors affecting loss of heat when the lid must be frequently removed. To compare the heat loss under prac - tical conditions the machines were filled with a normal load of clothes and water at a uniform temperature and were oper - ated as in ordinary washing. Three loads were washed for 10-minute periods in each machine, the machines being opened to pass the clothes through the wringer. The tem - perature was taken at the beginning and end of each washing period. Results are shown in Table 13 and Figm-e 10. In Table 13 is included the approximate surface area of the water in each machine, and that of the lid. The relative cool - ing rates for different machines are fairly consistent with those shown in Table 12 and Figure 10. Results from Washer H show a slighly lower rate than those from Washer A, the latter having the lowest rate in the preceding tests. The covers on Washers B and C have the least area in proportion to surface area of water, and therefore the least area of ex - posure. Of these two machines, the rate for C is relatively </seg>

B is made of aluminum, and C of nickel chromium plate on copper with a steel jacket Results show highest cooling rates for Washers D and E As was mentioned above, lids in both the cylinder and tub on Washer D provide large surface exposure. The cover on Washer E is as large as the surface area of the water. Washer F, with a relatively high cooling rate, also has a large cover m proportion to surface area of water. As a whole, the comparative loss of heat from the different machines, as shown in Tables 12 and 13, is of no consequence These results are only of significance in that they show the kind of material and finish with relation to heat retention are not important factors in the selection of a washing machine from those now available. Moreover, during an hour's time, the water would be saturated with dirt and should, in any case, be changed. CONSTRUCTIONAL FEATURES WHICH ADD CONVENIENCE AND SAFETY While operating the different machines, observations were made of the advantages and disadvantges of the various con - structional features of the eight machines studied. Table 14 shows a summary as recorded by different operators As was previously mentioned in this bulletin, the trend of manufacturers appears to be toward one particular type of machine. While this study does indicate somewhat superior performance of the gyrator type, its popularity is manifestly due, at least partially, to other factors than performance. It is probable that the gyrator supported in the bottom of the machine provides for greater rigidity and therefore fewer mechanical troubles. Appearance, including design, finish and size or compactness, and constructional features are all of considerable importance in selection. While appearance of a washing machine should perhaps be given only minor con - sideration, the modern purchaser is undoubtedly attracted toward a shiny metal or a porcelain enamel finish. He is more interested than formerly in good design. Many of the earlier power machines were bulky, clumsy, and difficult to move and operate. The gyrator types now so popular suggest lightness, and therefore ease of handling. While the material of which the machine is made and the nature of the castors determine its weight and the ease with which it is moved, the purchaser is likely to react unfavorably toward a machine which appears bulky eyen though it may actually weigh less than the more compact machine. Frequently storage space as well as space xor operating are factors in favor of the less bulky machine. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">A Study of Washing Machines Materials which are used in washing machines have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The relation of material to heat retention has been discussed. A machine made of aluminum is light in weight and reasonably durable. The disadvantage is that it does discolor from alkali and soap. The action of the alkali may affect its durability. If it is necessary to use hard water and therefore a water softener, |2 a , bya machine made of material other than aluminum would be preferable. Copper, nickel, steel, and cast iron are all heavier than aluminum. Nickel plated copper makes a Si S i» Z h 1S - fairl .y, ea8 y t0 keep bright.

To prevent such damage metal nms are provided by some manufacturers to protect the finish at points where exposure is greatest +^ f t - 1 i e f^ ht ma !: hi nes used in this study none, appeared IL i rl m 8 u £ r as instructional features were con - cerned. It may be that to provide certain convenient features others must frequently be sacrificed, but there could be found TL g °° d u easOn - s J 01 ' some of the features found. The machine with attached lid has several advantages There is no danger of misplacing or damaging the lid; an attached using the wringer. However, there is probably one most efficient procedure. In the opinion of persons operating the machines used in this study, there was least bodily strain when n a position facing the machines in a direction at right angles to the wringer. The discomfort from operating the wringer varies with the distance across the tub and the height and size of the operator. It should be possible to reach the gear control and all wringer controls, as weH as a switch without moving around the machine. On some of the machines studied the controls are so placed that the operator must stand facing the wringer, reach across the tub, o? move a u° U , nd u the , rnachine ' to manipulate them. The control should be.placed high enough so that a woman of average height can reach them without stooping. Machines IKS be built so that height may be adjusted to the he£h t of tit operator.

            <seg id="p042">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 56 vided with this adjustment. Switches on machines are a great convenience, but again were provided on only two of the machines used in this study. Repairs in case of a leak might possibly be complicated by the double walls used on some machines. ' This may not. be an important consideration, as a machine is not likely to need repairs for leakage before it is otherwise worn out. Table 14 Advantages Disadvantages 1. Little noise 1.

            <seg id="p043">A Study of Washing Machines Wringers differ considerably on different machines. They differ in the size and hardness of the rolls, in tension control, in ease of manipulating safety release, and in type of drain - board. Wringers which automatically control the tension are less likely to stall. . The large soft rolls seem to provide more even pressure and are a protection to buttons. The drain - boards on the wringer should be reversible and rounded sufficiently to prevent any possibility of catching and tearing clothing, but in this respect only two of the wringers used are satisfactory. While all are slightly rounded, they extend too far out from the wringer arid interfere with the passage of the clothes. The safety releases provided on the various wringers are in general quite satisfactory. In all cases the releases were instantaneous and easily manipulated. There is at the present time considerable effort to popular - ize the centrifugal dryer in preference to the wringer. Some manufacturers build their machines so that the purchaser may have a choice of either process of removing water from clothes. Only one of the machines used in this study was pro - vided with a centrifugal dryer. There are some advantages of a dryer as compared with a wringer and there are like - wise some disadvantages. By increasing the time the clothes are rotated in a dryer, it is possible to remove a greater amount of water. A dryer furnishes additional space for clothing, frequently, taking the place of a rinsing tub, and with some machines it is possible to rinse in the dryer. There is little chance for removing buttons from clothing, and no danger of catching fingers as with a wringer. On the other hand, the entire weight of the clothing must be lifted by the operator when transferring the clothe? from the machine to the dryer, while with a wringer, a part of the weight of the clothing is supported. If the water is extremely hot there is ;ikely to be danger of burning the fingers, because of handling a large bulk. With a heavy load it may be necessary to fill the dryer twice. The vibration is often unpleasant, especially if clothing is not properly packed, and may cause considerable wear on the machine. More floor space is required for a machine with a dryer. However, manufacturers are improv - ing the mechanics of the dryer and reducing the vibration. The time required to remove water from clothing with a dryer depends upon the ability of the operator to lift all of the clothing into the dryer at once, a qualification which few women are able to meet. If this is taken into consideration, the relative advanage compared with a wringer as regards use of time is of little significance. ' ■■ ■' </seg>
            <seg id="p044">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 56 In this study the one dryer was used for extracting water from heavy blankets. While it was difficult to lift the wet blankets into the dryer, they were left in a light and fluffy condition, which seemed preferable to results from the wringer. With cotton-filled comforts there is less danger of wadding the cotton. Only six of the machines studied provided complete protec - tion for the motor and moving parts. On two machines there was partial protection. The obvious danger to children from exposed mvoing parts on a washing machine needs no com - ment. There is danger from such construction to those oper - ating the machines. The driving mechanism on one machine used in this study is through a toothed bar placed in mesh with a gear-toothed wheel above the top of the lid. These parts are not fully covei'ed and protected. Such construction endangers the hands of the operator. . One such accident occurred in the laboratory during these studies. [5M] </seg>
