            <seg id="p002">December 1. 1934. TO HIS EXCELLENCY, CHARLES W. BRYAN, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA. MY DEAR GOVERNOR: The activities of the Department of Roads and Irrigation under your administration for the past two years were carried on by Mr. R. L. Cochran, State Engineer, up to and including July 7, 1934, at which time he resigned, and after that date by the writer. The continuance of loyalty that has been shown by all employees of this Depart - ment is an outstanding item m the activities of the past two years. Special efforts were made by the men m the divisions of maps and plans and bridge design to pre - pare plans quickly so that construction work could begin and thereby relieve unem - ployment. In the field work credit is due all employees both on construction and on maintenance work. Bureau of Roads and Bridges Relief of Unemployment. Emphasis was placed during this biennium on work to re - lieve unemployment by providing jobs for men on road work. The first reports from the Federal Reemployment Service m September, 1933, show 4,400 men at work by con - tract ami direct labor on the Federal and State highways. Thli number was steadily increased with a peak of 14,500 men during June, 1934. The ni raber of men at work m October, 1934, was 4,500. It is a conservative estimate that for every direct worker on highways that 1.4 other men are provided indirectly with jobs. Accordingly, it is estimated that during the past year a monthly average of 18,600 men were employed directly and indirectly on Federal and State highway work m Nebraska. CWA and FERA. In November, 1933, the Federal Government organized CWA work. The Nebraska CWA activities were started by this Department furnishing a con - siderable number of Engineers to help organize and start the work. Of the total Federal expenditure of $5,538,869 made on all CWA projects m Nebraska, 16.8% was spent on State Highway, CWA projects. In addition to the men employed on regular work mentioned m the first paragraph above, at the peak of the CWA program there were 36,517 persons employed on all CWA projects. The maximum number of men on State CWA projects was during the week of January 18, 1934, when 7,446 men were em - ployed the monthly average on State CWA projects was 6,065 men. Following the suspension of CWA on March 31, 1934, work divisions were organized by the FERA for persons eligible for relief. The average number of persons employed under the FERA on State highway projects has been about 1,000 per month. Highway Funds. At the time of the adjournment of the 1933 Legislature, State high - way funds had been reduced by the transfer of one-half cent of gas tax from the State to the Counties and by reduction of auto registration fees, and there had been no ap - propriation of Federal highway funds; however, on June 16, 1933, an appropriation was made by Section 204 of the National Industrial Recovery Act for improvement of the Federal Aid system and its municipal extensions and secondary or feeder roads m the amount of $400,000,000, of which Nebraska's share was $7,828,961, which did not have to be matched by State funds. This money was put under contract about a year ago and has now been almost entirely expended. On June 18, 1934, the Federal Government by the Hayden-Cartwright Act, approved June 18, 1934, appropriated a total of $200,000,000, to be apportioned similar to the appropriation under the National Recovery Act. Nebraska's share of this appropriation was $3,961,000, which did not have to be matched with State funds, and which will be practically all contracted by January 1, 1935, and the remainder will be contracted early m 1935. In addition to the above Federal funds, Congress m its appropriation of June 18, 1934, made a total appropriation of $125,000,000 for each of the next two years of which Nebraska's share will be $2,590,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1936, and a like amount for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1937. These funds are allocated to Nebraska under the original highway act for expenditure on the Federal' Highway system and must be matched by State funds. This law also provides that any State diverting any auto registration fees or gasoline tax set up for road work m excess of those provided </seg>
            <seg id="p003">by law as of June 18, 1934, shall be subject to the loss of one-third of the amount of Federal funds to which the State was entitled for the fiscal year for which the ap - portionment was made. Roads Built Not on State or Federal System wHh Above Fund*. There have been con - structed as a part of the Federal feeder roads a total of 129 miles of road work m 18 counties m Nebraska not on existing Federal or State highways, and not eligible for State maintenance. In all these counties, the county concerned has agreed m writing to maintain these roads after construction with NRA funds. Summary of Construction. Attention is directed to parts of this report showing the construction work by types obligated by this Department from January 1, 1933, to October 31, 1934, with the following totals: grading, 502 miles; regrading (including grading on paving jobs), 215 miles; paving, 165 miles; bituminous mat surfacing, 249 miles; gravel surfacing, 696 miles; gravel — 2nd course, 470 miles; number of bridges, 230; number of railroad viaducts, 3; number of railroad subways, 3; highway grade separations, 1. Maintenance. In general the structure of the maintenance organization has been the same as during the previous biennium m so far as general supervision and system of patrols is concerned. Due to having reduced patrol forces m most cases to a four - day week basis, with a few six-day week and a few three-day week patrols on the lightest traveled roads, and through help from CWA and FERA, maintenance costs have been kept to a low figure for the past two years, although it is expected that routine maintenance during 1935 will be considerably higher. Division of Tests. Reference should be made to the report of the Division of Tests which is handled under the supervision of the University of Nebraska. The number of tests of material made during the present biennium is about 25% larger than for the previous biennium, and about 130% larger than the biennium of 1929-1930. The increase alone m the number of tests m the present biennium as compared with the previous biennium is greater than the total number of tests during the biennium 1927-1925. The need of more adequate laboratory and office facilities for the Highway Testing laboratory has been set forth previously. The University has been unable to provide any addi - tional space for either laboratory or office work. As no additional quarters are now available m any of the existing buildings, the University recommends that a suitable building be constructed jointly for the Highway Testing Laboratory and Applied Mechanics Department of the University, and that it be erected similar to the Uni - versity Power House, which supplies the State Capitol with heat, light and power, as well as the University buildings. Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage. There was some water shortage m 1933, and a very pronounced shortage m 1934. The water users of the Platte River basin suffered to a very great extent, as did also some of the water users m other portions of the state. During the last two years, Wyoming appropriators diverted water under authority of the Wyoming State Engineer, disregarding Nebraska priorities. Conferences were held m Cheyenne between State officials of the two states for the purpose of having Nebraska priorities respected. The Wyoming officials finally gave notice that priorities m Nebraska would not be rec - ognized until a compact between the states was made, commanding recognition of Nebraska's rights. Hence, suit was initiated m the Federal Supreme Court m Sep - tember, 1934, by the State of Nebraska against the State of Wyoming, seeking an equitable portion of the water of the Platte River basin for Nebraska water users. It is recommended that sufficient appropriations be made for Nebraska's Attor - ney General to successfully prosecute this suit involving, as it does, the prosperity of a great part of the North Platte and the Platte Valley irrigated areas. It is further recommended m order to have more complete records that more Water Commissioners be employed to meet the demands of appropriators who should have their rights protected. In accordance with the requirements of Senate File 310 of the 1933 Legislature, this Department has had representatives attend and supervise the lettings of the Platte Valley Public Power and the Loup Valley Public Power districts. Respectfully submitted, A. T. LOBDELL, Acting State Engineer. </seg>

The No. of voters is the number of votes cast for Governor at the General Election 1932. The Mileages of Rural and Mail Routes were secured from the U. S. Post Office Department. Since the passage of the four cent gas tax law in 1929, funds subject to apportionment for construction work constitute a small percentage of the total funds available for construction, the reason being that the law provided that the revenue from one-half cent of gas tax shall be used to meet Federal Aid for pavement. In addition, revenues from an additional one-half cent of gas tax are to be used at the discretion of the Department of Roads and Irrigation (intended to close gaps and obtain continuity of construction in the main routes). These routes are generally Federal routes, and hence Federal Aid is for the most part used in their construction. The use of the above mentioned funds to meet Federal Aid absorbed most of the Federal Aid made available even during 1929 and 1930. During 1931 and 1932, there has been made available also what is known as Emergency Federal Aid. which is used to meet regular Federal Aid. This Emergency Federal Aid amounted to approximately four and one-quarter million dollars during 1931 and 1932. The result has been that there have not actually been any funds subject to apportionment during 1931 and 1932, and practically none during 1929 and 1930. In actual practice, however, expenditures have been made for road construction in each county, generally, greatly in excess of what apportionments have amounted to in previous years. Also a continuity of road construction has been made possible, closing up many unimproved gaps. </seg>

            <seg id="p027">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION 27 REPORTS OF THE DISTRICT ENGINEERS For efficient performance of the field duties incidental to the supervision and direction of the construction and maintenance of state highways, the state has been divided into eight districts. A District Engineer has charge of the work m each district. Permanent district headquarters are maintained at Lincoln, Norfolk, Grand Island, Bridgeport, McCook, North Platte, and Ainsworth. Each District Engineer supervises and directs all engineering, construction and maintenance work upon the state highways within his district, and attends to all other matters concerning state high - ways m that territory. He acts as the local representative of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges m dealings with contractors, with county and municipal officials, and with the public m general. He collects information for and makes recommendations to the Construction Engineer and Maintenance Engineer m those matters calling for field Information and intimate knowledge of local conditions. Contact between the District Engineers and the State Engineer, Chief of Bureau, and heads of the various divisions of the Bureau is maintained through conferences held m the Lincoln office every two or three months and by inspection trips into the districts. Following Is a brief description of the activities m each district for the past two years. DISTRICT NO. 1 District No. 1 is composed of twelve counties located m the south - east corner of the state. F. H. Klietsch has been District Engineer for about seven years, with headquarters at Lincoln. Soil conditions m this district are favorable for good roads, under normal weather conditions. During this biennium, weather conditions ■were quite favorable for road work with the exception of some heavy snow m the late winter of 1932-33, and exceptionally dry weather during the summer of 1934. In the fall and early winter of 1933, weather conditions were very favorable tor construction work and much of the contract work was completed sooner than would be or - dinarily expected. Considerable repair or other than routine maintenance work was accomplished, this being primarily due to the institution of the CWA program. Outstanding among these improvements was the construc - tion of three field equipment houses and yards at Geneva, Beatrice and Auburn. Each of these units provides a desirable place for hous - ing equipment and gives ample outside storage space enclosed by a substantial fence. The building also furnishes each of the field </seg>

CWA labor also made it possible to repair approximately fifty miles of earth shoulders along paved highways, repair and widen a number of bridges, and build several new ones. Painting of bridges and guard rail was accomplished quite extensively through CWA labor. Important new construction in this district included the following: Extension of pavement west on Highway No. 6, from the junction of No. 6 and No. 33, to Exeter. Viaduct over both the Burlington and Missouri Pacific tracks at Falls City and pavement from Falls City north on Highway No. 73 to its junction with No. 4, two miles east of Verdon. A third railroad grade crossing was eliminated on this project by relocation. Viaduct and pavement from Auburn north two miles on High - way No. 75 and 73. This construction closed a gap in the pavement on this road. Viaduct on Highway No. 6 west of Emeruld. The structure eliminated a hazardous conditon which (ixisted because the old viaduct was off center. Street car track removal, repairing with sheet asphalt and installation of ornamental street lights and traffic signals on "O" Street in Lincoln. Highway No. 6 is routed over "O" Street. Pavement and relocation of No. 6 from Lincoln west one mile. Pavement on Highway No. 24 from Eagle east to junction of No. 24 and No. 1. Quite a number of improvements were made on highways through municipalities, of which the improvement on "O" Street in Lincoln, mentioned above, was outstanding. During this biennitim considerable effort has been made to pro - vide employment and in this connection the construction of two pro - jects, Table Rock west and Barneston east, was I undertaken by di - rect labor methods. Through willing cooperation of the counties in furnishing part of the equipment, right of way, and some funds, these projects were successfully completed and the desired results in pro - viding employment were accomplished.

Approximately twenty-five miles of such detours have been graveled to provide a safe and convenient road for traffic. The counties through which the temporary roads pass have aided materially to provide a satisfactory road, generally doing the grading and necessary structure work prior to the placing of gravel by the state. DISTRICT NO. 2 The district is comprised of eleven countes in the east-central portion of the state. Edwin Olmstead, Lincoln, has been District Engineer for about seven years with headquarters at Lincoln. Due to the concentration of traffic adjacent to the large centers ot population, the construction funds in this district have been spent principally on higher type surfacing and railroad grade separations. It is anticipated that by July, 1935, all grade crossings of federal route highways and railroad main lines will be eliminated with the exception of three: namely, York, Fremont, and north of Millard. The principal construction projects during the past two years are: Pavement, bridges, and grade separation on Highway No. 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER from its junction with No. 15 two miles north of Milford, to Dorchester. Grade separation and pavement at Oreapolis which closed a two-mile gap between Omaha and Plattsmouth. Construction of a bridge across the Loup I River at Columbus replacing a bridge that had been in use for fifty years. Relocation and pavement on No. 8 from a point south of Winslow to Scribner, which shortens the distance between these points approximately four miles. Relocation and construction of No. 2 through Seward, which eliminated a number of bad turns and narrow bridges. Pavement on No. 73 between Blair and Herman. The construction of the Dodge Street Road from the center of Omaha to a point south of Waterloo. Of all the above projects, the Dodge Street iroject has been by far the most interesting. This consisted of widening the street from Thirtieth west to the city limits, making a fou r traffic-lane street between those points. Included in this project, Is a complete, mod - ern street lighting system, and interlocking traffic control signal system, two pedestrian subways, and a grade separation of Dodge Street and Saddle Creek Boulevard. Of minor interest in this work is the stone facing of the grade separation and the pedestrian sub - ways. The stone used was old natural stone curbing taken up during construction. The stone was cut aud cleaned !by CWA workers. Another item of interest is the fact that much of the street is sur - faced with the original brick taken off the old pavement. West of the city limits the surfacing narrows to forty-twcj feet iu width to a point south of Waterloo where it splits into a twenty-foot slab to the north and to the south, connecting with Highway No. 16 on the south, and No. 30S on the north. By relocaton a vsry hazardous turn known as "Dead Man" curve was eliminated and, vith a viaduct which Is now being constructed across the Union Pacific Railroad tracks near Elkhorn, one of the most dangerous grade crossings in the state will be eliminated. During the season of 1934, two bituminous mat surfacing pro - jects were constructed; one between David City jand Rising City on Highway No. 16 and one on No. 15 between its junctions with No. 2 and No. 6. These two projects are the first in this district to be constructed with bituminous mat surfaces and are among the first </seg>

This work included the construction of a bridge over the Elkhorn River consisting of one 160-foot steel truss central span, and two 70-foot approach spans. Another very important project which was completed, was the construction of an entirely new highway beginning at Decatur and traversing .northwest through Macy to Winnebago. This route passes through the Indian reservation in Thurston county. The relocation of Highway No. 8 east of Norfolk was also a major project in this district.

            <seg id="p033">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION involved the construction of a new bridge across the north fork of the Elkhorn River within the city limits of Norfolk. Other projects which were completed and which are of conse - quence to the state highway system are Willis to Ponca, Niobrara to Verdigre, Crofton south, Elgin west. Cedar Rapids west, and Meadow Grove south. A large percentage of this construction work was completed on a direct labor basis, which helped very materially in relieving the un - employment situation in the locality of the construction work. By the use of this method, work was started without any delay and im - mediate relief was obtained. During the second week of June, 1934, a very heavy rain fell in the northern tier of counties which completely blocked Highway No. 12 due to the washing out of three bridges. The residents be - lieved this to be the heaviest fall of rain which has been known in this vicinity. Outside of several unusually heavy rainfalls, the maintenance dur - ing this biennium has been normal, however, considerable trouble was experienced during the summer of 1934 in maintaining up to the usual standard when the entire state suffered a long period of drouth. Due to the use of CWA labor during the winter of 1933-34 many details of maintenance were corrected, the most important of which was the painting of all bridges with aluminum paint. There was also some new guard rail placed, and a large amount of the old was reset, cleaned, and painted, all of which added to the appearance of the high - ways and prolonged the life of the structures. DISTRICT NO. 4 District No. 4 is composed of twelve counties in the east half of the south-central part of Nebraska. This area consists of 6,600 square miles with a population of 160,000 and has 939 miles of state and fed - eral roads under maintenance. W. H. Bauman has been District Engin - eer for about two and one-half years with heidquarters at Grand Island. The area is largely level or gently rolling prairie with narrow wooded strips along the streams. Generally the soils are fertile loess or clay loam with a narrow alluvil plain along the Platte River and loose sandy soil in the north part of Greeley and Valley counties. There are numerous water sheds crossing this district from west to east. These streams are generally wide and shallow and with the exception of the Loup rivers, the flow fluctuates considerably during the year.

Pavements have been laid in Hastings, Aurora, and Ord. Numerous other bridges and grading projects have also been completed. Grading projects by direct labor under state supervision have been completed from Davenport west to Highway No. 4 in Nuckolls County, Lawrence west to Highway No. 281 in Webster County, Boelus east in Howard County, and Loup City north in Sherman and Valley counties. Under CWA, maintenance shops have been rebuilt and enlarged, some smaller structures built, roads graded and surfaced and guard - rail straightened und painted. Under FERA, considerable improve - ment has been made in clearing sight distance, regraveling surfaces and such projects which would lend themselves readily to a fluctuating crew both as to size and time. The extreme drouth of 1934 materially increased the difficulties encountered in the construction and maintenance of roads in this district but with all agencies fully cooperating, it is felt that com - mendable results were obtained. DISTRICT NO. 5 This district includes the following counties in the extreme western part of the state: Banner, Box Butte, Cheyenne, Dawes, Deuel, Garden, Kimball, Morrill, Scotts Bluff, Sheridan and Sioux. The population of District Five is approximately 110,000. T. C. Middle - swart has been District Engineer for seven and one-half years. The district office is located at Bridgeport m the state-owned building occupied by the Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage. The office was moved from Scottsbluff to Bridgeport on June 1. 1933. During the past two years the mileage of oiled roads in this dis - trict has increased from 59 miles to 210 miles. Oiled road projects have been constructed in all the counties of District Five, except Banner and Garden. On Highway No. 30 only one gap of 12 miles between Kimball and Bushnell remains a graveled road, all the other mileage being paved or surfaced with oiled gravel. The mileage of oiled roads in District Five is divided into two main classes or types, namely, oiled sand and oiled gravel. The 210 miles of oiled road con - sist of 25 miles of oiled sand and 185 miles of oiled gravel. Road construction other than projects surfaced with oiled sand or gravel, has consisted of grading, structures and paving. Major </seg>

This district in common with the rest of Nebraska, was visited j by the drouth of 1934. The dry weather makes maintenance of earth or graveled roads very difficult in this region because light Moils require con - siderable moisture to prevent corrugations and deterioration of sur - faces. Traffic has been unusually heavy, particularly on main high - ways, on account of the World's Fair at Chicago i during 1933 and 1934. The winter of 1933-34 was very mild and at no time did sufficient snow drift into the roads to require the use of snow remov - ing equipment. During the fall and winter of 1933 and in the sjiring of 1934 this distrct used a large number of CWA men on maintenance and con - struction work.

The Platte River skirts the district on the north, but only the run-oft from a part of the north tier of coun - ties goes into this stream. i -.•■-.-■ — '.' .- ' i ' ; Concrete-Lined Irrigation Ditch Carried at Top of Back Slope The two principal highways in this district are No. 6 and No. 3, both of which traverse the district from the east side to the Colorado line on the west. These highways converge at Oxford and are one until the junction west of Culbertson is reached, where they separate, crossing the state line 36 miles apart. The following are the most important improvements made in this district during this biennlum: On Highway No. 6, concrete pavement was completed between McCook and Indianola, and between Holdrege and Funk. Relocations were made, eliminating turns and shortening distance near Culbertson and between Cambridge and Hol - brook. Concrete bridges were constructed west of Beverly and east of Cambridge, replacing crooked and worn out structures. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER On Highway No. 3, new concrete bridges; were built over Massacre Canyon east of Trenton, and over Camp Creek east of Stratton, both replacing antiquated woodun structures. On Highway No. 10, a project was completed between Frank - lin and the state line. This project was 7 miles in length and included a new bridge across the Republican River. Under the CWA program during the winter of 1933-34, several im - portant improvements were made on the highways of this district, notable among these being the grading and structures on 6 miles of Highway No. 46 south of Oxford, 2 miles on No. 23J-N east of Curtis, 5 miles on No. 21 south of No. 89 in Furnas County. A large con - crete culvert replaced a narrow bridge west of Naponee. Bridges and practically all guard rail in the district were repaired and painted. Numerous maintenance jobs such as rebuilding pavement shoulders, cleaning ditches, opening up under bridges and culverts were per - formed. Also, all patrol houses were repaired and painted, and one new patrol house was built. Maintenance is carried on entirely with motor equipment and the purchase of new equipment during the past biennium has added greatly to the efficiency and economy of maintenance operations. All patrols have been operated on a part time basis, however, the stand - ards have been kept up and, in many cases, improved during the past two years. DISTRICT NO. 7 This district is composed of twelve counties in the central part of Nebraska. C. W. Eubank has been District Engineer for about seven years with headquarters on the second floor of the Court House at North Platte. The district shop and equipment yards are located on Highway No. 30 just beyond the West city limits of North Platte. During this biennium a marked change has been effected in the types of surfacing on the main traveled highways. The 36 miles of unpaved road east of North Platte was surfaced with concrete pave - ment and opened to traffic in July 1934. With the completion of this project a goal was reached that five years earlier had seemed almost an impossibility. The appropriation for highways in the National Recovery Act made it possible to speed up the letting of contracts, since it was not necessary for the state to match funds with the Fed - eral government, the entire cost being paid from federal funds. Bituminous mat and oiled sand surfacing are other types of pave - ment that have been adapted for use in this territory. These types are rapidly replacing graveled roads, particularly ih the western part </seg>
            <seg id="p039">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION of the district where traffic is lighter and the soil is sandy. The cost of constructing the bituminous pavements is low and the cost of maintaining them 1b reasonable. They are superior to gravel surfac - ing because they eliminate the dust nuisance and have riding qualities comparable to concrete pavement. In November 1933 the Federal government inaugurated the Civil Works Administration to help the unemployed in each community by giving them a job on some type of public works. During the first two months of the CWA it was administered through the state dis - trict engineers. This was done in order not to delay putting the men to work while an independent administrative organization could be set up. Many CWA projects were started in this district. Among the most important of these projects were the construction of two patrol houses, one at Broken Bow and one at Ogd. llala, the repairing and painting of all guard rail in the district, the reparing and painting of all bridges in the distrct, and the construction of approximately twenty miles of graded roads including the necessary bridges and drainage structures. In addition to the above there was a great deal of main - tenance work done with CWA men, such as repairing concrete pave - ment, loading and hauling gravel, seeding pavement shoulders, and other important work. Weather conditions during the 1933-34 biennium have been adverse to the construction and maintenance ot roads. Several grading pro - jects have been built without any rainfall during the period of con - struction. In some cases, these newly constructed earth roads were almost impassable, because of the dry, loose condition of the soil. Maintenance costs have increased appreciably because many of the sand-clay surfaces have broken up badly, making it necessary to re - place the clay on them. The sand hill trail roads were almost im - passable, due to the dry weather and high winds. DISTRICT NO. 8 This district is composed of nine counties in the north central part of Nebraska. Approximately ninety-five per cent of it lies in the sand-hill region of the state. R. F. Weller has been District Engineer for two and one-half years with headquarters at Ainsworth. The principal highway in this district is No. 20 which crosses the state from east to west, entering at Sioux City and leaving west of Harrison. Two hundred twenty-seven miles of No. 20 are in this district. With the completion, during the 1933-34 biennium, of the grading and oiled surfacing from Ainsworth to Johnstown and from Atkinson to Stuart the last gaps of unimproved road on this highway </seg>
            <seg id="p040">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER have been eliminated. Eighty-five miles of No. 20 within the dis - trict are surfaced with either pavement, bituminous mat, or oiled sand surfacing. Important construction projects completed dur ng the biennium also include the following: Grading Highway No. 53 across Wheeler and Antelope coun - ties from Cumminsville to Elgin connecting No. 281 and No. 14. Grading and graveling Highway No. 12 fron Naper to Jami - son, closing the last gap of unimproved road on this highway. Grading and graveling Highway No. 53 from Ericson to- Bartlett providing an all-weather road from Ericson to No. 281. Grading approaches to the Redbird and Parshall State-aid bridges. These bridges are across the Niobrara River be - tween Holt and Boyd counties. In 1934 concrete pavements were constructed on Highway No. 20 - -in O'Neill and Ainsworth, and on No. 183 through Valentine. The projects in O'Neill and Valentine were the first concrete pavementa to be built in Holt and Cherry counties. A severe drought was experienced ' over the dl strict during the biennium. Heavy losses of tbe light clay mat, with which most of the roads in the district are surfaced, resulted from a combination of the dry condition of the surfaces and unusually high winds. This con - dition has materially increased maintenance costs. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in the cost of surface maintenance as a result of the addition of improved equipment and the consolidation of patrols. State-owned patrol sheds and repair shops have been built at Ainsworth and O'Neill, eliminating the necessity of : renting buildings for housing and repairing equipment. A large part of the cost of these buildings was borne by the CWA. During the winter of 1933 - 3-34, this department cooperated with the Federal government in carry - ing out the civil works program. Eleven and one-half miles of new - grading, 8 bridges, and 6 miles of gravel surfacing were constructed as CWA projects. Other work consisting of slope and bank protec - tion, filling holes in clay surfaces, straightening back slopes, painting guard rail and bridges was also carried on under this program.

            <seg id="p043">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OF CONSTRUCTION The activities of this division have been generally in connection -with the carrying on of the construction work made possible by the funds provided by the Federal government in its National Recovery program, and also in the completion of the program undertaken in 1932 under the Federal Emergency Relief and Construction Act of July, 1932. The first allotment of National Recovery funds was made to the states in June 1933. Nebraska received $7,828,961. Unlike the usual Federal appropriations, this money was made available with - out the requirement that it be matched by a like amount of state funds. The funds provided by the Federal government, however, were sup - plemented by some state funds thus making a greater amount of work possible. Regulations prepared by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads provided for a distribution of this money to at least 75 per cent of the counties of the state also that not more than 50 per cent of the total amount of the allotment be expended on the Federal-aid highway system and that not more than twenty-five per cent he applied to secon - dary or feeder roads and that not less than 25 per cent be applied to projects on extensions of the Federal-aid highway system into and through municipalities. The second Federal appropriation made in connection with the National Recovery program was in July, 1934 of which Nebraska's share was $3,964,364. Federal regulations required that this fund be expended in at least 50 per cent of the counties of the state. Prac - tically the same requirements relative to the division of funds between Federal-aid, secondary or feeder routes and municipal projects were in effect. Inasmuch as those appropriations were made principally for the relief of unemployment, regulations were made by the Federal govern - ment relative to the hours of employment, classification of labor and minimum rate of pay. In the 1933 program no labor except those acting in supervisory or administrative capacities were permitted to work in excess of 30 hours per week. Minimum wages paid to common labor was 40 cents per hour and a minimum rate of 60 cents per hour was paid to skilled labor. In the 1934 program, the labor list was reclassified into three classifications, namely: common, semi - skilled and skilled. The minimum rates of pay established for these classes were 45 cents, 60 cents and 75 cents per hour respectively. It was required that all labor be selected insofar as possible from lists of available and qualified persons furnished the contractor by </seg>

Due to the short advance notice of the availability of the above appropriations, it has been necessary during the past two years to extend every effort to place the work under contract as soon as pos - sible and to care for the proper execution of the work when started. Very few plans were ready and in most cases it was necessary to start with the preliminary survey. Nebraska, however, has been ahead of most states in placing its program under contract. In order that work might be started as soon as possible the state was permitted to do the work prior to the preparation ot completed plans on a number of projects on a direct labor rather than a contract </seg>

These projects were handled in all respects directly by the state, by using such state- and county-owned equipment as was avail - able and employing labor directly through the National Re-employ - ment Service. Many of these projects were carried on through the winter in order to provide work during that period. Unit costs on some of these projects on which summaries have been prepared are as follows: AVERAGE COST OF LOCATION GRADING FEB CU. YD.

In general the increased costs were not unreasonable. In one instance near the beginning of the 1933 Federal program, bids on a certain project were received and rejected twice. The State then did the work on a direct labor basis without the awarding of contracts as originally contemplated. This project consisted of over 10.0 miles ot grading culverts and a number of bridges, one of which crossed the Elkhorn River and was approximately 303 feet in length. The total of the rejected low bids for all items on the project received at the second letting was $184,873.47. The total cost of the -work performed by the State in accordance with the plans, on a direct labor basis, was approximately $40,000.00 less than the bid price. Probably the most outstanding accomplishment during the bien - nium was the completion of the pavement on Highway No. 30, between Omaha and North Platte. The last gap was closed by the completion of pavement between Overton and Odessa in the summer of 1934. From North Platte to the Wyoming state line on Highway No. 30, the entire length is surfaced with the exception of three sections, namely Bushnell to Kimball, Big Springs to Brule and Paxton to North Platte. It is hoped that these may be completed during the construction season of 1936, thus affording a road hard-surfaced throughout its entire length across the state.

Where soil conditions and drainage are suitable, it is believed that the oil surfaced type of road is satisfactory. The most severe test which has been made on any particular road of this kind was on a newly constructed bituminous mat east of Min - atare on Highway No. 26 on which a considerable amount of beet hauling was done during the sugar beet hauling season of 1934. In order to make sure that a stable surface would result, a special ag - gregate was used which consisted of a combination of bank gravel and crushed rock and due to the use, of this material a very stable hard roadway resulted. The "beet" traffic which used teams and steel-tired wagons had no effect whatsoever on this type, showing that when the proper type of aggregates and oil are used that they will withstand any severe test given them. The tendency during the biennium has been to locate the oil projects in such a way that they will fit in with a scheme of con - nected surfaced highways.

The construction of paving projects is carried on under the direc - tion of the Paving Engineer through the district and project engineers. The engineering organization in direct charge of construction in the field, consists of a project engineer, one or more instrument men, rodmen, chainmen, grade inspectors, gravel inspectors, culvert and bridge inspectors, plant inspector, slab inspector, and helpers.

A large amount of investigation and research has been made to determine the best ways in which this material can be utilized. Until recently, sand gravel has been produced as a single, com - bined aggregate and has not been separated into two or more sizes. It is a comparatively fine aggregate with a maximum size of about 3-8 inch. By using a little more cement, concrete can be made with this aggregate which is equal in strength to concrete made with the conventional coarse-line aggregates. The density of concrete made with sand gravel is lower than when the ordinary coarse and fine ag - gregates are used. In 1933 some new concrete mixtures were de - signed calling for coarse and fine aggregates of special graduations. These aggregates can be produced by separating sand gravel into two parts, gravel and sand. Concrete having the same strength as that made with the combined sand gravel can be made from these materials with less cement and will have the added advantage of being some - what denser than the old mixtures.

            <seg id="p053">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION Concrete pavement design has been fairly well stabilized for the past two years and except in a few instances only minor changes have been made. On some municipal projects the thickness and other details have been changed to fit local conditions. The standard two - lane pavement is 20 feet wide with an edge thickness of 9 inches and a center thickness of 7 inches. A special study has been made of the cracks in concrete pavement. This was started in 1929 and a survey has been made once a year on each project except in 1934. It has been found that concrete made from sand gravel aggregate is subject to considerably more cracking than concrete made from sand and crushed limestone. The surveys show that at the age of 2 % years the average distance between trans - verse cracks in the pavement where sand gravel aggregate was used, is about 20 feet while the average distance between transverse cracks on the Havelock-Waverly pavement where crushed limestone was used is 93 feet. Expansion joints have been placed in concrete pavement during the past two years at 100-foot intervals except on the most recently constructed projects. The present pavement design includes 1-inch expansion joints at 90-foot spacing. Wherever wire mesh reinforce - ment is used throughout the slab, one contraction joint or plane of weakness is placed between each pair ot expansion joints, making the contraction joint interval 45 feet. Where wire mesh is not used these joints are placed at 30-foot intervals. In certain instances ex - pansion joints have been provided with drains consisting of small trenches excavated in the subgrade under the joints and backfilled with gravel. The drains are extended out to the edge of the shoulders. They are used where the subgrade soil is of such a nature that it might expand and raise the slab at expansion joints when saturated with water which seeps through the joints. In place of drains a subgrade treatment consisting of a layer of sand or gravel under the slab has been used on a few projects. On roads subject to heavy traffic or where good subgrade condi - tions cannot be obtained, experience has shown that reinforcement of the slab with wire mesh or bar mats will reduce the amount of cracking and thereby reduce the cost of maintenance and increase the life of the pavement. The tendency of sand gravel concrete pavements to crack at close intervals has made it necessary to reinforce such pavements throughout with wire mesh or bar mats. This kind of re - inforcement is not used when the concrete is made from the conven - tional coarse-fine aggregates. Alternate bids for concrete using sand gravel aggregate with wire mesh or bar mat reinforcement, were called for on all paving projects </seg>

At other locations in the state where coarse aggregate was not available, wire mesh or bar mat reinforcement was either required or omitted depending on the amount of traffic and the subgrade conditions. A special study is being made of the strength of concrete as de - termined by the compression tests of cores cut from pavements each year. About five cores are taken from each project, each being cut within a short distance from the original core. This experiment is being conducted on several projects and the tests show that in most cases the strength of the concrete is increasing progressively each year. MUNICIPAL PROJECTS Since the summer of 1933, seventy-six municipal projects have been constructed or placed under contract in Nebraska in accordance with the conditions of the grants of U. S. Publii Works funds for emergency highway construction. Twenty-five per cent of th|ese funds are required to be used on extensions of tho Federal-aid high - way system into and through municipalities. A municipal project is defined as a project located within the corporate limits of a mun - icipality. These projects are located in 55 cities and townn and Include many more details of construction than ordinary rural highway construc - tion projects. Each is a completed improvement including curbs and gutters, catch-basins, drop-inlets, storm water sewers, sewer appur - tenances, sidewalks, steps, retaining walls, adequate returns at In - tersecting streets, and necessary adjustments of existing facilities such as sewers, water mains, gas mains, and conduits. Pavement of an adequate width for moving traffic plus parking width is in - cluded in the majority of the projects. In two instances complete street lighting and traffic control systems have been installed. Because of the numerous details on each municipal project, much study and careful checking is necessary in the design of the im - provement and- preparation of the plans. The aim in design has been to provide a route into or through the town as direct as possible and on a satisfactory grade. At the same time ] efforts have been made to fit the improvement with the existing streets, intersecting grades, drainage structures, and other permanent features on or ad - jacent to the project. This must be done in order to provide good drainage, easy and safe grades on streets intersecting the highway, and to minimize the damages to abutting property. The cost of the right of way as well as damages to property within the towns has in most cases been borne by the municipalities them- </seg>

This is necessary because Federal funds cannot be nsea ior right of way and except in certain instances state expenditures for that purpose must be confined to rural highways. The largest municipal project constructed was the widening and reconstruction of Dodge Street in Omaha. The cost of the con - struction was more than $660,000 and the work included removal of existing pavement, adjustment of sewers, gas mains, and water mains, grading, repaving, construction of retaining walls and side - walks, construction of a grade separation structure, installation ot street lighting and traffic control systems, and landscaping.

From Turner Boulevard to 31st Avenue, the old, pavement which was 31 feet wide, was replaced with concrete pavement 57 feet wide. From 31st Avenue to 40th Street the existing 31-foot pavement -was replaced with a 57-foot asphalt pavement on a concrete base. The old brick pavement from 40th Street to Happy Hollow Boulevard, which was 40 to 41 feet wide, was rebuilt 57 feet wide as far -west as 62nd Street and 43 feet wide on the remainder of this section. A large number of the old paving brick were salvaged and relaid on the latter section. The work between 40th Street and 50th Street included the construction of a concrete base for street railway tracks and paving between the tracks. Two pedestrian subways were constructed, one at 33rd Street and the other at 51st Street. A grade separation structure was built to carry the Dodge Street traffic over Saddle Creek Road and two </seg>

The viaduct and both the pedestrian subways are faced with natural stone. A complete 2300-volt, ornamental street lighting system was in - stalled consisting of three lighting units on each side of the street per block, necessary transformers, cables, protective devices, and controllers. A complete, automatic traffic control system was pro - vided. Traffic control signals were installed at eight intersections and operate to permit traffic to move with efficiency. Another notable municipal project was located on "O" Street in Lincoln. The street railway tracks were removed from Bth Street east to about 37th Street and the area occupied by the tracks was then paved. Sheet asphalt was used on the section from Bth Street to 30th Street and brick was used on the remainder of the project. In addition to the pavement, an ornamental street lighting system was installed on "O" Street between 9th and 18th Streets and traffic control signals were placed at each intersection from 9th Street to 17th Street. In line with these improvements the City of Lincoln re - surfaced the pavement outside the street railway tracks from Bth Street to 16th Street. The completed work is ai decided improve - ment over the previous condition of the street and permits traffic to move with greater comfort, safety, and efficiency, j ROADSIDE IMPROVEMENT With the year 1934, Nebraska inaugurated its first participation in improvement of its state highway roadsides. Roadside improve - ments were carried on with state and federal funds and through the co-operation of local civic organizations. This kind of work is com - ing to be recognized as one of the necessary elements of highway construction in several states. During the spring, a roadside improvement campaign on the part of the American Legion resulted in a considerable amount, of planting of trees and shrubs near Auburn, Lincoln, and Seward, and In a number of minor improvements in the appearance of highways. At the same time civic organizations of Columbus, Aurora, Hastings, Superior and Alma made efforts toward roadside beautification on highways near these cities. The Department of Roads and Irriga - tion contributed consultation, layouts and plans on all of this work. Within the same season, the state did extensive planting of trees and shrubs over four miles of highway leading from Bayard north, between Kearney and Shelton, south from Crawford to Bryan Canyon, on Highway No. 6 east of McCook and on the approaches to the Bryan bridge south of Valentine. The state also purchased land and de- </seg>

Inspection shows that in spite of the unprecedented drouth this season, the planted trees and shrubs have survived in an unexpected way.

            <seg id="p059">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OF MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES In general the structure of the maintenance organization remains the same as during the previous biennium insofar as general super - vision and the system of patrols is concerned. The patrol forceß, which were put on a part-time basis during the last biennium due to decreased traffic and consequent decreased in - come, are for the most part still on a part-time basis although some increase in traffic and the difficulty to maintain proper riding sur - faces in the extreme drought conditions have required that working time be increased in some instances. At present the patrol forces are working, in most cases, on a four-day week basis with a few six-day week patrols on the main roads and a tew three-day week patrols on the lightest traveled highways. In general, our experimentation with part-time patrols has shown that, on an average, about two days work are required to overcome just the ordinary ravages of the elements and that additional days are required to overcome the effect of traffic bo that the total number of days work required on each patrol de - pends generally on the topography, soil, moisture condition, amount of wind and volume of traffic. The various patrols have, therefore, been laid out with these conditions in mind so that the system is de - signed to be as economical as possible and- yet produce satisfactory re - sults. The patrol lengths and the number of working days assigned for each patrol are so designed as to cover the handling of the rou - tine work. Seasonal and emergency problems that arise are handled by having part time patrolmen work extra days or by hiring extra labor, depending upon which method seems more desirable. During the previous biennium reshaping work, reconstruction work, and all other work that could be delayed without causing undue deterioration or unsatisfactory conditions was delayed. As a result it has been necessary, during the present biennium, to do a consider - able amount of this type of work although it has been held to the minimum consistent with good business practice for the protection of the original investment and for the safety, comfort and welfare of the highway user. CWA and FERA Through the use of CWA funds and CWA labor, in conjunction with some state funds, the Department was able to cooperate with the Federal Government in the program to provide work and, at the same time, accomplish many things that, under normal conditions, would not have been accomplished due to lack of funds. These accomplish - ments included ditch cleaning; clearing of the right of way; painting, </seg>

The total cost of the work accomplished through CWA in conjunc - tion with the maintenance organization was $655,492.39 of which $81,253.29 was state funds. Since the CWA was abandoned, much has been accomplished through the use of the FERA although the projects under the FERA have been smaller, generally, and for the most part of a nature as to require no great quantity of materials since no Federal funds for materials are provided.

SNOW REMOVAL, . No heavy snow storms have taken place during this biennium to date. However, the prevention of snow drifts and removal of snow has become one of the major problems of the maintenance organiza - tion. Highway users expect the highways to be kept clear for use at all times or, in case of extreme storms, they expect that drifted roads will be quickly opened. Therefore, since there is no way to predetermine whether there will be heavy snow storms or not, it Is necessary each year to erect several hundred miles of snow fence in order to insure insofar as practical the elimination of drifts at those points on the highways most subject to drifting. It is also necessary to maintain, in good order, trucks and tractors with snow plows at - tached in readiness to cope with the snow problem if It arises. During, the present biennium, snow fence was purchased in quan - tities sufficient to protect new highways that have been added to the system. Also seven powerful seven-ton trucks with plows were pur - chased. This type of snow equipment is quite effective in heavy drifts and is mobile so it can be quickly moved to the seat of trouble. The coming winter presents an unusual problem that is difficult to cope with. Due to extreme drought and the failure of the corn crop generally over the state, the highways are deprived of the pro - tection generally afforded by the hundreds of miles of standing corn </seg>
            <seg id="p064">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER siums which act as a snow fence. It is impractical to purchase suf - ficient snow fence to fill these gaps which total several hundred miles since in normal years the fence would not be required. It is likewise impractical to purchase sufficient trucks and plows in addition to those normally required in order to cope with this problem which may not exist again for many years. As a result, in the event of heavy, drifting snows, the maintenance department will be severely handicapped in its efforts to keep the highways open. SIGNS I The maintenance of signs as a "daily duty" of patrolmen has been continued as in the past in order that all signs may be properly and carefully placed and in good order at all times to direct the traveling public to its destination without inconvenience and to warn the traveling public of all known hazards for their protection. The theory is. that if the highway is carefully marked and if the highway user observes the directions and warnings given by the signs, there can be no danger from the known hazards ahead. During the biennium signs were designed, constructed and placed at each town on the highway system indicating to incoming traffic the name and population of the town and indicating to outgoing traffic the name of and mileage to the next town and one or more large towns farther ahead on the highway. The erection of these signs required the careful logging of all the highways for correct driving distances. The signs are well con - structed of California red wood and were made j at the Department's Sign Shop at Lincoln at a minimum of cost. Plans for the winter include the design and construction of signs to mark the "Nebraska State Line" to be erected on all state high - ways entering Nebraska. Plans also include the design and con - struction of signs to indicate the distance to towns located off the state highways and to be placed on the state highways where the main approach road to the town intersects the highway. Further plans include the design and construction of new junc - tion signs to be placed at intersections of two or more state highways to indicate to the traveler the name and distance of a town in each direction from the junction. These signs will be made readable at night through the use of reflector buttons and will be placed next summer. During the present biennium experimentation, with reflector but - ton hazard signs, such as turn signs, railroad signs, etc., has been carried on and the results appear to justify the extra cost. </seg>
            <seg id="p065">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION BITUMINOUS MATS The introduction of bituminous mat construction has made it necessary for the Maintenance Department to perfect an organization and to obtain equipment for the upkeep of this type of road. During the past two years many men have been trained in this new work and equipment especially adaptable to the work is being added as re - quired. An interesting live mile experimental stretch of bituminous mats has been laid on Highway No. 77 north of Havelock which will be carefully observed and It is expected that valuable information bear - ing on the best methods and mixtures for bituminous mat construc - tion will result. The five mile stretch consists of a number of sec - tions, each of which was built with a different type of asphaltic ma - terial, different mixtures of the aggregates and bitumen, different depths of mat. and each of which was laid by different methods. ROAD MAGNET The road magnet has been operated with good results over a considerable portion of the main highways. During 1933 this magnet covered 1450 miles picking up 7,643 pounds of nails, wire and other metal, a great portion of which would puncture a tire. The heaviest "pickup" was made on Highway No. 81 between Columbus and Nor - folk where 401 pounds of metal was picked up in a distance of 42 miles making an average "pickup" of 9% pounds per mile. In 1934 the magnet covered a distance of 2.005 miles with a total "pickup" of 8,569 pounds or an average "pickup" of 4 V* pounds per mile. The heaviest "pickup" occurred between Osceola and the oil pavement at Rising City where 180 pounds of metal were picked up in a distance of 14 miles making an average "pickup"' of 12 6/7 pounds per mile. The fine resu'ts, which have been obtained with the rojd magnet, justify the construction of additional road magnets so that all of the main traveled roads may be covered at least once each summer. TRAFFIC CENSUS The traffic flow map which appears on an accompanying page represents the last real traffic census taken. This was taken during 1929 and 1930. While it does not represent the correct amount of traffic for the present, it provides a comparative guide relative to the traffic flow on each highway. i Generally speaking, the daily traffic in 1934 was less than that shown on the map which was probably taken in the year of maximum traffic on Nebraska Highways. However, an increase in traffic in </seg>

Also _ lc „ individual traffic counts taken during the summer indicated that the Lincoln Highway traffic at a point west of North Platte reached its highest known peak in 1934 being somewhat higher than in 1933 and both 1933 and 1934 were higher than shown on the accompany - ing map. This was probably due to the unusual traffic to and from the World's Fair at Chicago and due to the improvement of the Lin - coln Highway which, no doubt, has attracted travelers to this route. Material increases in summer traffic were also noted during 1934 on other main east and west roads, notably U. S. No. 6 and U S No. 20.

The extreme dry Weather which adversely affected clay sur - faced roads and required major additions of clay. The increased surface maintenance on all roads due to dry weather. Because of funds spent on the CWA Program. Because of items of stage construction such as seal coating required on bituminous roads built during the previous three years.

The number of items of stock of material and supplies carried in the main supply base at Lincoln was materially increased where this was found to be advantageous. Generally, stocks sufficient only for sixty to ninety days are carried on articles in current use but in some -cases, due to rising prices, it has been advantageous to increase the stock sufficiently to provide for a year. This has been particularly true in the case of tires and grader blades and to a somewhat lesser extent on some other articles. Because of conditions imposed by the Code of the Petroleum In - dustry whereby deliveries of gasoline may not be made directly to the equipment or to cans, it has been necessary to install a gasoline distribution system. A complete system of tanks and transports for distributing has been purchased. Two-thirds of the system is now In operation and the remainder of the system will be complete in about ■thirty days. On the basis of experience with that portion now in use, </seg>

            <seg id="p076">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER it is estimated that the state will be able to save approximately $78, - -000.00 per year by purchasing in tank car lots and distributing the gas to its own tanks. In normal times when patrols are working on a full time basis the gasoline consumption is about twenty-two per cent greater, therefore, in normal times the saving would be approxi - mately $95,000.00 per year. HIGHWAY LAW ENFORCEMENT The enforcement of highway laws was conducted by three State Traffic Police Officers during 1933 and until August 1, 1934, at which time a fourth officer was added to the force. It is evident that with so small a force to patrol the entire state it is impossible to apprehend all offenders. However, very effective work has been accomplished during the present biennium. Up to November 1, 1934, a total of $78,659.11 has been received from licenses and fines as a result of the efforts of this police force. The policy of the Department has been to educate the driving public and to urge observance of the motor vehicle laws rather than to make arrests. Consequently, the amount collected for fines during the above period was only $1,233.10, which is a very small percentage of the total. The total amount of the appropriation set aside by the 1933 session of the legislature to cover a two-year period was $25,000.00. The amount which this small force caused to be collected over a period of twenty-two months is 315 per cent of the total amount appropriated for their operation. The amount actually expended for the operation of this force over a twenty-two month period was $21,697.49. In addition to the actual cash funds brought in, much has been accomplished in the matter of highway safety through the enforce - ment of the other motor vehicle laws. Considerable time is spent in checking front and rear lights, brakes, and other equipment on cars and in educating the public in the matter of careful driving and observation of warning signs. In addition, trucks are checked for length, width and height, clearance lights and rear vision mirrors. It is also necessary to weigh many trucks in order to determine whether or not they are carrying loads in excess of the licensed capacity. In view of the fact that, as shown above, this force is responsible for the collection of a sufficient number of fines and license fees to more than pay for the cost of operation, we may assume that this educational and safety work is actually being accomplished with no expense to the state. </seg>

Using the 1933 cost data, the following is developed. The cost of smoothing surface represents, in fact, just 25 per cent of the total maintenance expenditure. Replacement gravel is carried in our records as a maintenance charge. Many states do not include this item as a maintenance charge. The replacing of gravel represents 25 per cent of the total mainten - ance expenditure. Snow prevention and snow removal represent 5 per cent of the total expenditure. The cost of owning and keeping in repair suitable equipment for </seg>
            <seg id="p078">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER proper maintenance, including snow removal equipment represents 14 per cent of the total. ' The four above items represent 69 per cent or slightly over two - thirds of the total maintenance expenditure. The remaining 31 per cent, or approximate one-third, is expended for shoulder and ditch repair, structure repair, signs and markers, right *f way maintenance, temporary improvement such as raising fills, or light construction to make a satisfactory' roadbed pending further construction, maintenance of supply base, right of way pur - chases and leases, liability and compensation, office supplies and ad - ministration. An idea of the magnitude ot the labor and materials required to maintain Nebraska's System of Highways can best be shown by the following illustrations: In 1933 approximately 2,004,119 gallons of gasoline and 254,200 quarts of oil were consumed. Every year approximately 3,361,491 lineal feet or approximately 652 miles of snow fence are hauled out and erected and later taken down and hauled in. To do so requires the driving, and later tho pulling, ot approximately 233,344 posts. Incidentally this amount of fence would be sufficient to enclose an area 20% times the size of the State of Rhode Island. It repre - sents sufficient length of fence to enclose with one line a square con - taining 16,804,160 acres. rfff—B- — — - ?B_B_M| ; ■ -____! ..,,.—.

            <seg id="p079">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION' OK MAPS AND PLANS The principal duties of the Division of Maps and Plans consist of the preparation of plans and the calculation of quantities and costs of ail state and Federal highway construction work which is per - formed under the supervision of the Department of Roads and Ir - rigation. Minor functions of this division include keeping records of the cost of all state highway construction work, keeping records of all tests made of materials entering into construction work, the handling of all orders requesting approval of changes in the plans for construction work, the preparation of plans and estimates of a, part of the work performed under the supervision of the Division of Maintenance, preparing maps, charts, and blue prints which are required for use in connection with the work that is performed by the Bureau of Roads and Bridges together with part of those required for use in connection with the work that is performed by the Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage and the Division of Motor Vehicle Registration, procuring and distributing supplies and equip - ment for field parties, and the performance of other routine office work. Federal appropriations and the amount of state funds available for state highway construction were considerably less for this bien - nium than for the previous one. The volume of work performed by the Division of Maps and Plans during this biennium was, how - ever, only slightly less than that performed during the previous one. This was occasioned by the fact that one-fourth of the Federal money had to be expended on construction work located within incorporated municipalities. For the most part, the work so performed consisted of paving and a greater volume of detail work was required in tbe preparation of plans and estimates for this class of work than for the expenditure of an equal amount of money on ordinary rural highway construction work. In addition to the drafting rooms and office rooms on the ground floor ot the State Capitol, that this division has used for several years, the large room on the tenth floor of the tower has been used as a drafting room for the greater part of this biennium. This room is well lighted by large windows on all sides and except for the fact that it is not closely connected with the other rooms, serves quite satisfactorily. A large open space in the basement was converted into a fire proof vault in which is stored a greater part of the older records of the department. Space has also been provided for a store room for equipment and for a room to be used as a work shop. This work shop is equipped with a large lathe, drill press and other equipment necessary for the repairing and adjusting of the equipment used by </seg>

In the past it has been necessary to make use of mechanical equipment at the University of Nebraska and at times it has been necessary to return transits to the factories for repair or adjustment. It is expected that with the newly equipped shop, such instances will be kept at a minimum. After a portion of a road which is included in the State Highway System is designated for improvement, a preliminary survey of that part of the highway is made. The preliminary survey parties usually consist of three men, an engineer, a rodman and a chainman, although under unusual conditions these survey parties are Increased in size. The preliminary survey parties work under the direct supervision ot the District Engineer in whose territory the work is located. The survey notes are submitted to the office of the Division of Maps and Plans where the plans are plotted and tentative grade lines are indi - cated. Blue prints are then made and are given to the Construction Engineer who, usually in company with the District; Engineer affected and a representative of the Division of Bridge Design, when the con - struction of large drainage structures is involved, j makes a plan-in - hand inspection of the road. Studies are made to determine the sizes, types, and locations of the drainage structures which will be required, suggested changes in the channels ot streams or rivers are indicated and changes in the tentative grade lines and other features of the Im - provement are shown on the blue-prints. The blue prints are then returned to the office of this division and the recommended changes and other data shown on those blue prints are used in the prepar - ation of the plans for the proposed improvement. After the plans have been corrected in conformity with the recommendations made in the plan-in-hand inspection, they are checked in the field by the Construction Engineer. Any necessary changes in the plans, as well as the locations of all right of way which must be acquired, are in - dicated and all other pertinent data are shown and the information thus obtained is delivered to the office ot the Division ot Maps and Plans where it is incorporated in the finished plans for the project. If the project in question is a part of the Federal-aid Highway System and it is desired to obtain Federal-aid funds for use In pay - ment for the proposed construction work, a request is then made ol the United States Bureau ot Public Roads that such funds as may be available for such use be set aside for that purpose. | The plans, specifi - cations and an estimate of the cost of the proposed work must be submitted with that request. If the request is granted and the plans, specifications and estimate are approved, a contract, which is termed a "Project Agreement" and provides for the payment of Federal-aid funds is executed by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of Roads and Irrigation. </seg>
            <seg id="p081">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION The next step after the approval of the plans, specification*. ___ estimate by the United States Bureau of Public Roads or the comple - tion of the plans, if the proposed work is not a part of a Federal-aid project, is the advertising for bids and the awarding of contracts. Usually the bids ure received in the Lincoln office of the Department of Roads and Irrigation, and in most instances, unit price bids are re - ceived. The unit bids are tabulated and total bids are calculated by this division for use in determining the low bids for the proposed work. The highway departments of several of the other states furnish prospective bidders with prints of the general plans for their proposed construction work. Prints of such plans are generally sold or fur - nished upon payment of deposits which are remitted upon the return ot the prints. The blue printing facilities of this department are limited to such an extent that the possibility of our adopting either of these practices is precluded. Arrangements have been made, how - ever, to provide for furnishing the County Clerks of the counties in which the work is located, with three sets of prints of the general plans for all proposed construction work, and provisions are made for their lending two of such sets of prints of the plans for each project to prospective bidders, who may require the use of the plans in their investigations of the work which is contemplated. The field engineers in charge of the construction work measure all quantities of work performed under their supervision and usually com - pute the quantities upon which payments to the contractors are based. If such calculations are not made by the field engineers, they are prepared in the Division of Maps and Plans. All calculations ot quan - tities used in the preparation of the final estimates, upon which pay - ments to the contractors are based, whether made in the field or in this division, are checked thoroughly in this division. After the con - tractors' final estimates have been prepared and all quantities shown in those estimates have been checked, plans which show the project as constructed, are prepared. All final vouchers to the United States government for work per - formed in completed Federal-aid projects are checked in the Division ot Maps and Plans. There were several occasions during the past biennium when the volume of work performed in the Division of Maps and Plans was so great that overtime work was required of the entire personnel of this division. One of the most outstanding features of these periods was the fact that an exceedingly commendable spirit of zealousness was shown even though it was known that payment could not be made for overtime work as such, and that the only compensation which might be expected would consist ot possible increases in vacation privileges. </seg>

            <seg id="p084">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER DIVISION OF BRIDGE DESIGN During the years 19 33 and 1934 there were 24 2 structures placed under contract up to November 1, 1934. These structures are ex - clusive of concrete box culverts and arches and any repairs or main - tenance construction at existing bridge sites. Of these 242 bridges, 35 were skewed which is 14,5 per cent of the total. On the basis of comparative lineal feet of bridges this percentage would be about 23 per cent. Of these 242 bridges 3S per cent are concrete slabs on treated timber piling, 31 per cent are treated timber structures, 26 per cent are of the deck steel giruer type, 2.9 per cent are grade separation structures and the remaining 2.1 per cent include 5 miscellaneous special structures. There is an increase in the percentage of concrete slab overflow bridges used and a slight decrease in the percentage of deck steel girder types used during this biennium compared to the previous one. This would indicate that the concrete slabs may be used to just as good an advantage in certain locations where steel spans had to be used previous to the advent of the concrete slab type. '•■ ' - There is quite an increase in the percentage of treated timber structures used, which at first thought may seem somewhat surpris - ing. It should be observed, however, that more than 60 per cent of the treated timber structures are farm entrances or minor crossings of borrow pit ditches and not bridges on the highways. It may be noted that a number of bridges are designed with un - encased steel piles in the piers and abutments. Another development during this biennium is the design and use of battered steel pile abut - ments. This improvement should eliminate much of the trouble ex - perienced in the past due to the tendency of high bridge abutments to tip, as a result of earth pressure and the creeping effect of pavement slabs. It has been fairly demonstrated that bridge construction can be carried on throughout the cold winter months without an appreciable increase in unit prices.

            <seg id="p088">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER CITY BRIDGES Due to the conditions and regulations of the National Industrial Recovery Act under which Federal Funds were apportioned for high - way construction it was necessary to expend approximately 25 per cent of the Federal Highway funds fo'r the extention of roads through municipalities. This condition had its effect on certain bridges and grade separations and is the cause of certain {novations with respect to bridge design. It was required that such bridges should be given architectural treatment to the end that their appearance would be in harmony with the general scheme of beautification attempted by the average mid western city. &gt; These results are illustrated in the pictures shown elsewhere of such structures as the Saddle Creek underpass, the Tekamah city bridge, the Hastings subway, the Salt Creek bridge on West "O" Street, Lincoln, and the Sheridan Boulevard viaduct, Lincoln. Two of these structures, namely the Tekamah bridge and the Saddle Creek underpass should be given special mention. They are monolithic concrete structures of solid concrete without joints from the bottom of one footing, up and over the span, and down to the bottom of the other footing. This type is called the "rigid frame con - crete bridge." The feature of this type of design is that the slab or deck takes the form of a very flat arch with a comparatively thin slab at the crown. This feature promotes economy, and, being of a curved arched shape, it naturally lends itself to a beautifying archi - tectural treatment. This type of construction was introduced in an extensive manner by the Westchester County Park Commission in New York a few years ago. The designs were so pleasing that the first ones were given wide publicity. Leading engineers recognized the beauty and economy of these bridges and introduced them in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and other eastern states as well as in some of the pro - gressive southern states. Also, the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads constructed the Fourteenth Street bridge, which is a rigid frame con - crete structure, on the Mt. Vernon Memorial Highway, Washington, D. C. Rigid frame concrete bridges have been built for railroad structures by the Canadian National Railways and the London Mid - land and Scottish Railway Company. A notable feature of the Saddle Creek underpass is that the con - crete frame is faced with cut stone salvaged from curb stones taken from Dodge Street in Omaha. The stones were cut to fit and sand blasted by local stone masons under the CWA program in Douglas County. The two structures built in the suburbs of Lincoln show the effect </seg>
            <seg id="p089">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION of beautification efforts. They share in common a type of concrete handrail that enhances the beauty of the structures as a whole. The West "O" Street bridge over Salt creek has a clear roadway of 4 2 feet with a 5-foot sidewalk on each side and is supported by offset U-type abutments and by two battleship-prow, split-water type piers, all of which in combination with the concrete handrails and ornamental lamp posts produces a pleasing composite. The Sheridan Boulevard viaduct is in reality two superstructures built on a common continuous-abutment substructure with a wide gap in the center to accommodate a street car bridge between the two 20-foot one-way traffic lanes. This structure is built on a horizontal curve which emphasizes the effect of the concrete railings, sidewalks and the high safety curbs which separate the sidewalks from the roadway. It replaces an old type timber trestle span over the Rock Island Railroad where numerous accidents had occurred at frequent intervals. Another structure of note built within the limits of a prominent Nebraska city is the Hastings subway which carries both city and highway traffic under the main line of the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad within the business and industrial districts of the city. There are two features in this construction worthy of special men - tion. The first feature is that the superstructure is designed as an all-welded fabrication of structural steel. The second feature is with respect to the severe drainage condition which exists due to the low elevation of the roadway under the tracks in a locality where surface drainage of streets is difficult. This problem was solved by the in - stallation of a modern electrical pumping system which collects storm drainage in a sump built near the low dip in the subway grade, so devised as to keep the storm water below an established level by means of an electrical float control. This entire operation is mechan - ical and automatic which requires a minimum amount of maintenance. This structure enjoys the distinction of being the first all-welded highway structure in this state. It was specified that the welding should be done by the "electrical arc" process and each operator was required to pass a rigid examination before he was permitted to per - form any work on the structure. The steel superstructure was con - structed in 9 units weighing about 30 tons each, in the plant of the American Bridge Company under a very close Inspection of an expert welding superintendent furnished by the Burlington Railroad. An - other welding expert furnished by the Railroad Company also made careful inspections during the progress of field assembly and erection. It may be of interest to note that the Department employs the use of electrical arc welding extensively in the maintenance division </seg>

            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER on a large variety of repair and equipment work, under the direction of an experienced superintendent. The division of bridges recently sent a member of the designing force to a famous school of welding located in Cleveland where he completed with credit a course in both design and operation of welding details, operation and fabrication. RIVER BRIDGES I - '' The most notable of river bridges built during this biennium are: the Elkhorn River bridge, Douglas County; the Elkhorn River bridge, Madison County; the Hebron bridge, Thayer County; the Nemaha River bridge, Nemaha County; the Cairo Loup River bridge, Howard County; and the Roscoe and Brule State-Aid bridges over the South Platte River in Keith County. The Roscoe and Brule bridges were placed under contract late in .September of 1934 and are under con - struction at this time. The new Elkhorn River bridge in Douglas County is an example ot the unswerving loyalty to the principle of straight alignment required by modern super-highway design. This condition required that the bridge be constructed on a line forming an angle of about 44 degrees to the natural flow of the stream and entailed the use of skewed trusses, abutments and piers. This requirement is responsible for two rather unusual features: First, the central span consisting of a pair of 202-foot 6-inch high-trusses spaced 46 feet 6 inches apart on centers. Second, each approach span, consisting of la pair of 135-foot span pony trusses on the same spacing center to center, the entire assembly being built on a 44-degree skew. In the case of the central span, on account of the unusually wide roadway and the 44-degree angle of skew, the bearing of one truss had toj be set two panel lengths ahead of its companion truss. Thus the end of the. first floor beam coincided with the bearing point of the companion truss men - tioned while the other end of it was attached at the second panel point of the first truss. Thus one end of the floor beam would al - ways be fixed whereas the other end could deflect with the truss under i'i both dead and live loads. Other floor beams towards the center of the span would likewise be subject to unequal end deflections. On account of the wide roadway these floor beams had to be designed with considerable depth. It was apparent that if the conventional end connections were to be riveted to the trusses and If the deck was to be loaded, the rigidity of the floor beam connections would in - troduce possible dangerous indeterminate stresses both in the beams themselves and in the trusses. Therefore the long central span was so designed that certain ot these floor beam connections were pin con - nected to the trusses which would allow the truss to deflect freely when the deck was loaded. It was specified that these pin connections only should be made and allowed to function until after the entire </seg>
            <seg id="p093">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION concrete deck was placed, after which the connection angle holes vuum be drilled through the truss metal and the field rivets driven therein, thus completing the permanent attachment of the floor system to the trusses. While this refinement of design might be considered ex - cessive by some, it was insisted upon as a necessary correction ot the weakness imposed by alignment causing a skew bridge. The Elkhorn River bridge in Madison County consisting of a cen - tral truss of 160-foot span with one 70-foot deck steel girder approach at each end, is not unusual in design but is unusual in construction because it was built entirely by state forces. These features will be described more fully elsewhere in this report. The Hebron bridge is a fine example of the development of the deck steel-girder, canteliver-type of design. It provides an opening of 430 feet from abutment to abutment consisting of a central 100 - -foot span flanked on the north by a 75-foot and a 60-foot span and on the south by 75-foot, 69-foot 3-inch and 50-foot 9-inch spans re - spectively. The unsymmetrical arrangement of spans was due to a natural topographic feature requiring an extra span to the south of the main channel to accommodate probable extreme overflow conditions. History showed that this site had been the scene ot several near - catastrophic floods due to a combination of two critical situations. First, the course of the Little Blue River in the vicinity of and especial - ly at this site was quite sinuous which caused a rather sluggish dis - charge. Second, the bridge site selected was immediately below the confluence of Spring Creek with the Little Blue. Spring Creek drains a short fan-shaped water shed and as a result there is a very rapid run-off. Thus on rare occasions when Spring Creek and the Little Blue were in flood simultaneously, the Hebron site offered the first line of resistance to the flood and was subject to a surprising accumu - lation of flood water. The final design was based on the theory that the elimination of several sharp bends in the river course above the bridge site by the channel changes contemplated, would allow much more efficient dis - charge. The selection of long multiple spans with fewer piers to obstruct the flow was also considered to be a strong factor that would greatly relieve the more severe flood conditions. The wisdom of this feature alone is emphasized by comparing the new structure to the old one. The old structure consisted ot a series of short timber trestle spans placed at an angle to the natural flow of the stream so that each pier obstructed the flow materially and in addition collected debris which added to the damming effect of the old bridge trestle bents. The wide roadway, high safety curbs, and the long graceful spans </seg>
            <seg id="p094">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER oi the new bridge have combined to make a structure pleasing In appearance and at the same time commodious asjto traffic above as well as to the passage of huge volumes of water and bulks Of debris beneath. The main channel span in this structure at the time of construc - tion was the longest deck steel girder highway span in the State of Nebraska. The Loup River bridge north of Cairo, in Howard County, is an example ot further progress being made in the development of the {~ - %9 K s^'&amp;yjSlSmum\ T ~~: "-.■":" ~- ] .-_-.— -_..-, , &gt; ■ » » m, a] yV ■- i'i am m t ' '' -£_* * - : _fr\'' ? ■ J WaWm\^r^atalSW lk v*a9^Jm:a} im^ * * '"*-"■-- 4 j^^-'jJf^^^ I v* il s ; . t '.' _-*—____ ■ "* ' _i^^^^^^ M j__c— ________ _-_T- __ . _ i _ ■ ■ - i ■ ■ r~i^ pj-^^M -, ti i^ ■ .. _ i Two Views ol the Loup River Bridge Near Cairo This is a typical cantilever deck steel girder bridge. The central span is 115 feet. deck steel girder cantilever type of multiple span bridge. This struc - ture provides an opening 679 feet between abutments, divided into spans as follows: a 115-foot central span with a series of two 105 - -foot and one 72-toot spans on either side forming a symmetrical ar - rangement of spans. As far as we are able to determine this central span of 115 feet is the longest deck steel girder highway bridge span constructed of standard rolled beams, to be found in the United States. This example shows the adaptability of girder construction to long span construction. Up to a recent date the maximum span length obtainable for girders was 60 to 65 feet although the average length </seg>
            <seg id="p095">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION most generally used was in multiples of 50-foot spans. These longer span girder bridges offer less of an impediment to the discharge of flood water, ice flows, and debris. The cost of foundations and sub - structure is low because ot the elimination of certain piers. This bridge being on the "secondary system" was designed with a 22-foot roadway. It is pointed out that one of the potential advantages of the deck steel girder type of design lies in the fact that the width of the bridge could be increased with comparative ease without any great loss of material already in place and use. The Nemaha River bridge north of Auburn, Nemaha County on Highway No. 75 consists of one 100-foot span pony truss and a 60-foot deck steel girder approach span at each end which replaces an old 120-foot high-truss and a 35-foot I-Beam and a 21-foot timber span both on the south end of the old truss. It was evident that originally the bridge consisted solely of the 120-foot truss and that the approach spans had been added later. The old bridge had a roadway 16-feet wide compared to the new roadway of 24 feet. The new bridge is 44 feet longer than the old bridge. This bridge in conjunction with several concrete slab overflow bridges south of it together with the recently constructed viaduct which effectively spans Longs Branch combines in providing a very much needed improvement in Highway No. 75 north of Auburn. The entire valley had been flooded from time to time causing great inconvenience to the heavy traffic ot this important highway. STATE AID BRIDGES Two State-Aid bridges over the South Platte River are now under construction in Keith County. The one is at Roscoe the other at Brule. The estimated cost of these two bridges was $98,000.00. A PWA grant of $28,600.00 was approved and obtained from the Federal Government, 50 per cent, or about $50,000.00 is available from the State-Aid Bridge fund and the County had funds to make up the bal - ance of the total cost or about $20,000.00. The bridge spans proper will be identical for each site but the road approaches, dikes, jetties and protection work will vary accord - ing to the requirements of the topography of each individual site. Each bridge will provide 500 feet of waterway between abutments and will consist of a central 85-foot span and a series of two 75-foot and one 57-foot 6-inch spans on either side of it. Each of these bridges was raised to a clear distance of one foot above highwater. Dike, jetties and channels were placed so as to converge the river to flow under the bridges in a manner and by river training methods which are becoming conventional on all Platte River work. These bridges will mark a distinct advance in State-Aid bridge </seg>
            <seg id="p096">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER übbibu on the South Platte river. Several recent bridges built prior to these consist of series of 50-foot transverse joist girder spans. A feature of construction required by these contracts is the short time allowed the contractor for completing them. The proposals were received September 28, 1934 and the contract required that the Roscoe bridge be completed by February 28, 1935 and the Brule bridge by April 30, 1935. This requirement will force the contractor to full time winter work on the Roscoe bridge. GRADE SEPARATIONS During' this biennium plans were made for seven grade separ - ation structures. Five of these were overhead crossings of railroads, one was a subway under crossing and the other was a highway grade separation. Two of the viaducts were replacements of existing structures but all of the others were grade crossing eliminations. The Hastings and the Saddle Creek subways and the Sheridan Boulevard structures have been described elsewhere. The Auburn viaduct which serves the dual purpose of eliminating a grade crossing of Highway No. 75 and the Missouri Pacific Railroad and of bridging Long's Branch Creek consists of a creosoted timber trestle 492 feet 6 inches in length. i The span crossing the railroad and also the one crossing the creek is of structural steel deck girder construction oh concrete pedestal and steel tower substructure while the remainder of the bridge is pre - framed creosoted timber stringers and caps supported by creosoted timber piling bents on 19-foot centers. The entire deck and curb is of concrete with steel handrails. The contract price for this struc - ture was $27,128.91. The Oreapolis viaduct carries a relocated section of Highway No. 75 over the Burlington Railroad between Plattsmouth and the Platte River bridge. It consists of deck steel girders, multiple span con - struction, 281 feet in length, 24-foot roadway, with concrete floor and curbs, and with steel handrails. The substructure is composed of open steel frame bents and towers supported on concrete pedestals. The concrete pedestals and concrete stub abutments are supported by treated timber piles. This construction and relocation eliminates three sharp turns in the road and saves considerable distance between the Platte River </seg>

The Emerald viaduct between Lincoln and Milford on Highway No. 6 over the Burlington Railroad replaced a structure built during the World war. This old structure was of timber construction and was on a very poor alignment with very short clear sight distances. The new structure is ot the deck steel cantilever type with 24-foot roadway, concrete floor and curbs, and with steel handrails. The structure is 210 feet 9 inches long. The contract price tor this con - struction was $19,080.28. ■ The viaduct crossing the Union Pacific Railroad one mile south and three miles east of i Elkhorn on West Dodge Street consists of multiple cantilever deck steel girder spans 162 feet 3 inches in total length, with concrete floor and curbs, and steel handrails. A feature of this structure is that it is on a 36 degree, 41 minute skew and has a roadway width of 44 feet. The substructure consists of steel frame bents and concrete stub abutments. The bents are supplied by con - crete pedestals on creosoted timber piles. The contract price for this structure amounts to $27,079.00. </seg>

All Federal-aid road moneys received dur - ing the biennium ending June 30. 1935, together With any unexpended balance on hand June 30, 1933. * The appropriations for these items were for all receipts. The figures shown were estimated. The estimate for Code No. 189 was based on the assumption that the State would receive the revenue from 2'j cents per gallon gas tax. The gas tax law provides that . the State shall receive H of the 4 cents per gallon gas tax, or the revenue from 2J4 cents per gallon. The estimates shown for Code Nos. 181 and 182 were based on the percentage of the estimated gas tax receipts. The appropriation bill provided that the percentage sliould apply to all money received for construction. Due to the fact that the actual gas tax receipts are greater than the estimated receipts and that the percentage applies also to the amount of Federal money used for construction, the actual amount of the appropriations are considerably in excess of the estimated amounts. The Division of Clerical and Records makes ]up monthly and quarterly estimates, estimating the amounts necessary for salaries and wages, supplies, expenses, parts and repairs, equipment and public improvements; the amount of quarterly estimates for each appropri - ation being limited to one-eighth of the appropriation tor the biennium.

All stenographic work and the filing of all records with reference to construction work on roads and bridges are handled by this division. The typing ot all detail estimates, cost analyses, special provisions, notice to contractors, and the mailing out of notice to contractors pre - vious to the letting of contracts for construction and maintenance work, is handled by this division. It also makes up all contracts, five to nine copies being made of each contract and sent to the proper parties, handles the certified checks filed with bids, and writes the minutes of meeting at which the contracts are awarded. Estimates on construction work are made up by the engineers in the field, and approved by the proper District Engineer, as well as final estimates checked by the engineers in the field and approved by the District Engineer are each checked by the Clerical and Records Division, and vouchers issued to the contractors on the proper funds. This division makes up vouchers to the Federal government for its share of the construction work; also, the billing of counties and other participating agencies for their share of the cost of any particu - lar project, and handles the deposits to the State Treasurer of all such collections. In the past two years, the Department has constructed, in the same capacity as a contractor, several miles of grading and incidental work. All clerical work connected with such construction, such as the handling of pay rolls and purchasing of materials, has been handled by the Clerical and Records Division. Considerable portion of the construction work in the last year has been paid for from Federal funds and in order to expedite the payment to contractors. Federal funds in the amount of two million dollars were advanced to the state. This fund is kept entirely sep - arate from all other funds and as money is received from the Federal government for work actually performed by the contractor, it is de - posited into this fund, thus providing a revolving fund sufficient to take care of all payments due contractors promptly after filing of the vouchers. This fund and all estimates and vouchers paid from such fund are checked by Federal auditors at least once each month. Except in a few Instances the Department of Roads and Irrigation pays its own workmen's compensation and medical claims of employees injured in the performance of their duties.

            <seg id="p125">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OF TESTS ORGANIZATION The activities of the Division of Tests of the Department of Roads and Irrigation are conducted at the University of Nebraska. Through a cooperative arrangement between the Department of Roads and Irrigation and the State University, the Materials Testing Laboratories of the Department of Applied Mechanics of the College of Engineering have been designated as the official Highway Testing Laboratory for the state and Professor C. M. Duff of the Department of Applied Mechanics has been designated by the Department of Roads and Irri - gation as its Materials and Testing Engineer in charge of the Division of Tests. Professor Duff also devotes part time to teaching during the school-year. In the Division of Tests, there are five assistant testing engineers under Professor Duff's supervision. Three of these assistant engin - eers pass on the acceptability of the materials tested and assist in other office work. The other two assistant engineers have charge of testa in the laboratories, directing the work of laboratory assistants who make the various physical tests and chemical analyses. From 20 to 35 laboratory and office assistants are employed, the number vary - ing by reason of the seasonal character of the test work. During the school-year about one-half of the laboratory and office assistants work part time only, thus permitting them to continue as students in the University. This arrangement has proven very satisfactory for the test work as less help is usually required during the school-year. Also, due to crowded conditions of the laboratory during class periods, much of the highway testing must necessarily be done before and after classes. From the standpoint of the University, this arrangement not only affords an opportunity for the part-time assistants to earn part of their expenses while attending the University, but it also gives them valuable practical experience. The cooperative arrangement provides that the University furnish the necessary laboratory and office facilities, buy the equipment and supplies required for making tests on highway materials, and pay the salaries and wages of the personnel employed in making laboratory tests and investigations and in making field inspections of various materials and constructions. To cover the cost of this service, the Department of Roads and Irrigation makes payments to the Univer - sity, such payments being based upon a nominal monthly allowance in addition to a per diem charge for field inspections and a schedule of prices for the various tests. The latter is subject to a discount which varies with the amount ot testing done each month. While most of the testing is done in the laboratories of the De- </seg>
            <seg id="p126">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER panment of Applied Mechanics at the University, it has been found desirable by the Division of Tests to maintain during the construction - season, temporary laboratories at a number of cement mills and oil refineries and other plants where materials are manufactured that can be advantageously tested prior to shipment. I For some types of construction where field control of certain ma - terials is I found desirable or necessary, temporary field laboratories are maintained. Such laboratories are maintained at most of the gravel pits and on projects where concrete pavements and oiled roads are under; construction. Only such equipment as is needed in making the required tests is supplied to these field laboratories. Thus, the work of the field laboratories is confined chiefly to the testing of aggre - gate for grading, determining unit weight of concrete, making mois - ture determinations, making transverse tests on j concrete beams, de - termining soil density and determining oil content! of oiled aggregates. Due to the increasing need of accurate control of the gradation of aggregate used in the construction of both concrete and oiled roads, most of the field laboratories have been supplied with portable mechanical sieve shakers which are operated either by electric motors or by small gasoline engines where electric current is not available. Generally, the field testing is under the direct supervision of the Paving, Construction, Maintenance, or District Engineer and field tests made by the project engineer or the inspector are not reported to the Division of Tests or included in its summary of tests. At fre - quent intervals, however, samples of materials are sent to the labora - tory at the University for making check tests or for more complete analyses. Several commercial testing laboratories are employed by the De - partment of Roads and Irrigation to inspect such materials as treated timber and piling, structural steel, etc., at the place of manufacture. FUNCTIONS The chief functions of the Division of Tests are to determine the physical properties, analyze the chemical composition or otherwise inspect all samples of materials submitted in connection with the con - struction and maintenance of highways and to prepare reports there - on setting forth the information obtained, together with a recom - mendation relative to the acceptability of the material and the ad - visability of its use. Other activities of the Division include investigating new sources of materials, checking new designs for concrete and oiled aggregates, determining the merits of new materials offered for use in construe- </seg>
            <seg id="p127">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION tion, and determining the relative merits of various competitive products. As far as possible, all physical tests and chemical analyses of ma - terials are made in accordance with standard methods. In general, the method used in sampling and testing materials are those out - lined in the American Association of State Highway Officials' publi - cation known as the A. A. S. H. O. bulletin, "Tentative Standard Methods of Sampling and Testing," or the "Standards and Tentative Standards of the American Society for Testing Materials." Special methods of testing which have been adopted by various organizations are utilized for certain materials. Where no standard methods ot testing are available, it becomes necessary to improvise special tests in order to determine the suitability and acceptability of certain materials. SAMPLING. Most of the samples ot material tested at the Highway Testing Laboratory are submitted by field engineers and inspectors from sup - plies received on the job. Since proper sampling of material is just as important as laboratory procedure in testing the samples, cooper - ation of the entire field organization is essential to secure reliable re - sults. The importance of careful, accurate and intelligent sampling cannot be overemphasized, as no amount of care and accuracy in the laboratory . can produce a report that correctly represents the accepta - bility of the material sampled unless the sample itself is representa - tive of the material. It is very necessary that certain materials submitted for test be sent to the laboratory in containers which will insure the samples reaching the laboratory in a representative condition. For example, sand and gravel cannot be delivered satisfactorily in burlap bags as part of the fine material will sift out through the loosely woven fab - ric. All samples should be carefully marked for identification and ac - companied by complete and accurate information covering the pro - ject number, the source of supply, the Intended use, the date, by whom sampled, the quantity represented and any other information that will assist the laboratory in properly classifying the material. After samples have been received at the laboratory, they are given, a laboratory number for reference during the process of testing and later when filed. All samples are retained for a limited period of time. It has been found desirable to retain samples of certain ma - terials for a period of years. When samples are submitted to determine whether the materials comply with the requirements of specifications, the reports thereon </seg>
            <seg id="p128">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER 7 ■ . ■ • ■ in addition to showing the test results obtained, usually carry the notification "Accepted" or "Rejected." Where samples of competitive products or preliminary materials are submitted from different sources, the test results are summarized and compared in the report. Recommendations are then made on the basis of quality, economy and the service that may be expected of the materials. Test reports show only the quality or properties of the particular samples tested. Unless the samples submitted are representative of the materials supplied or used, the reports are of no value as far as indicating whether the materials would be satisfactory. Test reports, in addition to being supplied to the Department of Roads and Irrigation, are also furnished to the various engineers in charge of the work, to the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads and to the - contractor, jobber, or manufacturer concerned. The Division ot Tests has received numerous expressions of appreciation from contractors, jobbers and manufacturers for this service. \ GROWTH AND NEEDS* Considering that millions of dollars are expended annually in the construction and maintenance of highways in Nebraska, it is evident that any lack of fitness of the material employed would be costly to the State. In the purchase ot such materials, rigid specifications must be prepared covering the physical, chemical and other properties ot the materials for the specific uses to which they are to be applied. It is only through the impartial testing of materials that the State can be assured of receiving only such materials that meet the specification requirements. Through experience and research, the construction and maintenance of highways is being based to a greater and greater ex - tent upon rigid scientific requirements. This development has in - creased the importance of testing and of the work of the Highway Testing Laboratory. The amount of material submitted for test during the past two years is much larger than during any preceding biennium. The num - ber of tests made during the present biennium, 1933-34, is about twenty-five per cent larger than for the biennium 1931-32, and about one hundred thirty per cent larger than for the biennium 1929-30. The increase alone in the number of tests in the present biennium as compared with the preceding biennium is greater than the total num - ber of tests made during the biennium 1927-28 and is almost equal to the number of tests made during the two biennial periods from 1923 to 1926. The growth in the amount of testing work is shown in tabular form </seg>

The need of more adequate laboratory and office facilities for the Highway Testing Laboratory has been set forth in the two previous biennial reports. Efficient operation of the Division of Tests is seri - ously affected by the existing inadequate quarters. During the past two years the University has been unable to prpvide any additional space for either laboratory or office use to alleviate the congested con - ditions. Due to inadequate facilities for making extraction tests on oiled gravel, it is impossible at the present time to test the field samples as fast as they are received. Also, in connection with the extraction work it has been found necessary to move part of the equip - ment outside of the building to prevent the accumulation and spread - ing of unhealthy gases through the laboratory. Additional facilities must be provided for cement testing in order to comply with the re - quirements of the cement reference laboratory of the U. S. Bureau of Standards. Our present arrangement does not provide for satis - factory moist storage or constant temperature baths as required for cement and concrete testing.

            <seg id="p132">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER tlonal office space is also urgently needed to relieve the congested conditions. If the Division of Tests is to continue under the supervision of the University more adequate quarters must be provided for the work. As such quarters are not now available in any of the existing Univer - sity buildings, it is recommended that a new building be constructed for the purpose. If the State Legislature would : make the necessary appropriation for the construction of a suitable building to be used jointly for the Highway Testing Laboratory and the Applied Mechanics Department of the University, such a building might be erected on University property in a manner similar to the University power house which supplies the State Capitol with heat, light and power as well as the University buildings. This building could be three stories high with basement, which would provide adequate facilities for making all tests required by the Department of Roads and Irrigation as well as provide the necessary class rooms, drawing rooms, and laboratories for the Department of Applied Mechanics. The University could provide a suitable location for tills building which would be convenient for a railroad siding to one of the main railroads entering Lincoln. Both railroad and truck - ing facilities are necessary for adequate handling of material sub - mitted for test and for their disposal after the tests have been com - pleted. The continuation of the present cooperative arrangement between the University and the Department of Roads and Irrigation would be more economical than an unnecessary duplication of testing equip - ment which would result if the Department of Roads and Irrigation were to construct and equip a laboratory for testing materials inde - pendent of the materials testing laboratory ot the University of Nebraska. EQUIPMENT During the present biennium the University has purchased a num - ber of new pieces of testing equipment which include the following: A Baldwln-Southwark universal testing machine of the pendulum type. This machine has five ranges of capacities which are obtained by changing the weights on the pendulums. The lowest range is from zero to five hundred pounds while the maximum capacity range is from zero to ten thousand pounds. The other three ranges are from zero to one thousand pounds, zero to two thousand pounds, and from zero to five thousand pounds. The machine is also equipped with a brinell hardness tool. The loads are indicated on a dial by a hand which is operated by the swing of the pendulum. The machine Is </seg>
            <seg id="p133">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION used principally for making tensile tests on the wires of mesu rein - forcing or other materials where the maximum load required is less than ten thousand pounds, and for determining brinell hardness. A one-hundred pound capacity hand-operated Anthor tensile test - ing machine, for use in testing subgrade paper. A Scholer cold-bend testing machine for use in checking the cold - bend test requirements of questionable steel. A Wagner turbidimeter for measuring surface area of cement and similar products by the use ot the photo-electric cell. A corometer for obtaining the average length of cores by a single operation. The principle on which this core-measuring device operates is the displacement of a liquid volume by a series of sys - tematically arranged small rods or pistons which contact the end surface of the cores. The displacement of liquid is read on a gradu - ated tube and shows the average length for all points contacted. A Shore durometer and elastometer for determining the hardness and elasticity of rubber products. A number of other devices have been constructed for use in con - nection with special tests and many changes have been made to im - prove the facilities for testing. RESEARCH Since no special fund has been established for research the ac - tivities along this line have been somewhat limited and most of it has been done in connection with routine testing. Research work has not been given the attention that its importance demands and if funds could be made available for research fellowships at the University many needed investigations could be undertaken that would be of great value to the State. Continued research is needed in connection with the construction of oiled gravel and oiled sand roads. This applies not only to the preparation and gradation of the aggregate but also to the type of oil best suited for a given location. While a marked improvement has been made in this type of construction there is still much room for improvement. With the many methods and constantly changing processes used in refining petroleum oils it is very necessary that ade - quate physical or chemical tests be developed to insure uniform and satisfactory bituminous products. More attention than ever before is being given to the proper con - struction of foundations for all types of surfacing. This involves a very careful study of the subgrade material used and if the best results </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER a&gt;c iu be obtained additional research is very necessary. Some re - search work has been done during the present biennium in analyzing and classifying the various soil types, and in determining the density to which they should be compacted. Soil tests are now being used to control the density of fill material and to determine the moisture limits 'for satisfactory compaction. There is great need and a broad field for research in connection with the stabilization of subgrades through the use of calcium and sodium chlorides and carbonates. Many of our soils, which are soft and friable and readily affected by water, when treated with sodium carbonate become hard and dense and are only very slightly affected by water. If permanent subgrade stabilization could be obtained by this method it would prove valuable to highway j construction. To date no field tests have been made which involve the use of such materials but their use in experimental sections is being planned for the coming season. ] Several sections of concrete pavement in which special types of construction and kinds of material have been used are being studied and analyzed but no information is available at this time. A study is also being made of the strength and density of cores taken from the finished pavements where the different classes of concrete have been used. Test racks for paint panels have recently been erected on one of the buildings at the maintenance yards in Lincoln for the purpose of studying the serviceability of paints when subjected to weathering action. Samples of laminated safety-glass will also be placed on test racks to determine what deterioration may result from exposure to the weather. The use of reflector buttons in highway signs and markers has necessitated considerable research relative to the most economical size, type and quality of button to use as well as the best size, type and spacing of letters or symbols. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION DIVISION OP RIGHT OF WAY The State Legislature in 1927 enacted legislation which authorizes and empowers the Department of Roads and Irrigation to purchase right of way direct from the land owner, or if unable to agree with him on the matter of price, to have the land appraised in the same manner as counties are authorized to condemn property for county purposes. This procedure is outlined in Section 26-709 to 26-715 in - clusive, and Section 39-1403, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929. The right of way activities cover a large range including city prop - erty with relatively high value to farm property with a lesser value, and also include special purchases of materials for gravel and bitu - minous surfacing. Right of way for changing water courses, borrow dirt, and clay surfacing may also be obtained in this manner. It is the policy of the Department of Hoads and Irrigation however, to avail itself of the condemnation feature of the law only as a last resort and but com - paratively few cases have been instituted. Occasionally, the De - partment of Roads and Irrigation is requested by administrators of estates, guardians of minors, etc., to use this method of purchase in order to protect themselves from criticism, and this also gives the Department of Hoads and Irrigation title to the property where other - wise the title might be difficult to secure. Many public spirited citizens have donated land for right of way and have cooperated very satisfactorily in the purchase of right of way. However, there is a tendency in many cases to hold the value of land for right of way at an excessive figure. The Federal government does not participate in the purchase of the right of way for state or federal highways. Frequently, the securing of right of way is the last step in the preparatory work of highway construction and often in the rush of emergency construction projects, negotiations have to be made hur - riedly and often after the contractors are at work on the project. In negotiating for right of way or road materials it is usual for a representative of the Department of Roads and Irrigation and the land owner to enter into a contract for the sale and purchase of the land or material required. Where possible the requirements are specifically stated in the contract and the full purchase price agreed upon, but in cases of borrow dirt or clay surfacing it is not unusual to contract by the acre, and payment 1b made on the actual acreage used. After the amount has been determined, a voucher is prepared </seg>
            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER oy me Department ot Roads and Irrigation and presented or mailed to the claimant for his signature and acknowledgment. After this has been done and the voucher returned, it is approved by the proper Dis - trict Engineer, the Right of Way Engineer, and the State Engineer, following which it is passed to the Department of Finance. In ap - praisal ot condemnation cases, the county judge signs the voucher instead of the land owner and Includes all costs of the appraisal, which are always borne by the Department of Roads and Irrigation, and disbursements are made through the county judge's office. All right of way records are kept in the Lincoln office of the De - partment of Roads and Irrigation and include contracts with the land owners or their representative, railroad leases, and right of way deeds. The expenditures for right of way during the 1933-1934 biennium total $706,607.76, and cover 3,127 separate transactions. The pre - ceding biennium (1931-1932) covered an expenditure of $851,946.32 The following table shows the total amount spent for right of way on the state highway system in each county, and includes all road materials and channel changes, beginning November 6, 1932 and end - ing October 31, 1934, both dates inclusive, and includes all purchases for which vouchers have been approved. The table covers all right of way expenditures including amounts advanced to several counties and municipalities which amounts are to be repaid according to agree - ments. It does not include right of way for "feeder" roads not on the state highway system, such right of way having been secured and paid for by the counties and municipalities affected. </seg>

In accordance with the statutes passed in 1919 the treasurers of the various counties were appointed by the Department of Public Works to act as agents of the Department, for the purpose of regis - tering motor vehicles and in the collection of all automobile registra - tion fees in the counties. The Legislature provided that while acting as agents for the De - partment of Public Works, the county treasurers should retain trom the funds collected for automobile registrations five cents for each original motor vehicle registration, such . money to be accounted for as other fees passing through their hands. After five cents was de - ducted the county treasurers transmitted to the State Treasurer, </seg>
            <seg id="p184">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER | two and one-half per cent of all such funds" collected by them. This two and one-half per cent to be credited to the State general fund, and when appropriated to be used by the Department of Public Works to pay the cost of administration of the Motor Vehicle Law together with the cost of all automobile license plates, und the supervision of the maintenance of the state highways. The 1925 Legislature provided that after January 1, 1926, thirty per cent of the balance remaining (after deduction of the five cents by the county treasurer for each registration and the two and one - half per cent for the State general fund) should be transmitted by the county treasurers of the various counties to the State Treasurer and credited to the State highway fund out of which fund is allowed claims for the maintenance of the state highway system! In 1922 the state went from central distribution of automobile license plates to distribution directly by the county treasurers. All applications for motor vehicle registration are forwarded to the Department of Roads and Irrigation where they are filed numeri - cally by registration number for each county and alphabetically by name of applicant, also, a record of each make or kind of car is filed according to motor number with cross references in each instance to the registration number assigned to such motor vehicle. The records are kept by card index and are open to the public during reasonable business hours. The new system of using two forms of receipts for motor vehicle registration which required but one writing ot the re - ceipt for renewals was brought about by agitation on the part of quite a few county treasurers teii years ago, In which some of them claimed that the law did not require the county treasurers to furnish more than one copy. As a result of this agitation, the Department worked out a system that would meet with its demands and make possible a reduction of the work for which they were asking. The result of this was the two forms of receipt which, for the greater majority of certificates written, requires but one! operation. There has been a growing enthusiasm on the part of the county treasurers ever since this was instituted, in favor of this new system. Inci - dentally, it has greatly reduced the work In this office and makes it possible to keep the records in a much more up-to-date condition. It also eliminates employing extra help for six or seven months each year. The Motor Vehicle Operators' License Law was enacted by the 1929 Legislature effective September 1, 1929. All applications for license to operate a motor vehicle made by persons resident in a county are, transmitted to the county treasurer of each county and a distinguishing number assigned to each license Issued. The appll- </seg>

The remaining twenty-flve cents Is remitted by the county treasurer to the state treasurer and credited by him to the motor vehicle operators' license fund, and the Department of Roads and Irrigation is authorized to draw upon the said fund in the hands of the State Treasurer for all expenses of printing, recording and gen - eral operation of the law. Six hundred forty-eight thousand nine hundred sixty-three oper - ators' licenses have been issued from September 1, 1929 to October 1, 1934. The operators' license is for the period of the licensee's con - tinuous legal residence in the State of Nebraska. The Financial Responsibility Law went into effect August 3, 1931, and provides that for certain offenses, the motor vehicle operators' license and all of his registration certificates shall be suspended until proof of his ability to respond in damages is established as provided In the act. </seg>

            <seg id="p195">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT UNDER THE FEDERAL WORK RELIEF PROGRAM INTRODUCTION Federal funds for relief were allotted to Nebraska late In July ot 1933. A definite work relief program was not carried on until No - vember, although many of the recipients of relief recompensed the government by doing odd jobs, which consisted largely of wood cutting and general clean-up work. » On November 12, 1933, Mr. R. L. Cochran, State Engineer, was notified by Mr. Thos. H. MacDonald, Chief of the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, that ih the federal work relief program about to be launched, highway improvement was expected to provide a substan - tial number of jobs. The following are excerpts from Mr. MacDonald's telegram to Mr. Cochran: "The Administration contemplates an intensive work relief program to provide employment - for the millions of unem - ployed and partly employed now on relief rolls. Road work under proper direction offers an opportunity of absorbing large amounts of this class of labor. With your regular con - struction organization now heavily loaded, the obvious way in which immediate employment in all sections of the United States on this class of work can be undertaken, with reason - able assurance that some value will be uniformly created by this labor, is to utilize the far flung maintenance organiza - tions ot the state highway departments, intelligently, to select locations of work and exercise general supervision over work performed. This is a patriotic duty which the state highway departments cannot avoid." " the re - sourcefulness of the state highway departments should enable employment progressively to be given to hundreds of thou - sands of men before the end ot the present month." "This is a big order but on the other hand the state highway departments are the outstanding agencies of government controlling closely knit and disciplined organizations suf - ficiently dispersed to insure reasonable success of this emer - gency effort. It Is an opportunity for constructive effort that must be carried through to successful completion." CIVIL WORKS ADMINISTRATION The Civil Works Administration was then organized and the civil works policy formed. The rules called for a 30-hour week except in executive, administrative, and supervisory positions. The kinds of </seg>

All civil works projects were re - quired to be done by day labor and not by contract. The wages to be paid on highway work in this state were fixed at 40 cents per hour for unskilled labor and 60 cents per hour for skilled labor. A program of road projects in Nebraska was immediately formed and upon telegraphic advice from Washington, D. C. 2,600 men were put to work by the 20th of November on state highways in Nebraska. According to Mr. Rowland Haynes, Federal Relief Administrator for Nebraska, the CWA " had two purposes — one to put to work at regular wages a certain number of people from the relief rolls, and a certain number from the unemployment rolls who had not gotten on relief. Its second purpose was to do worthwhile public projects ot value to the neighborhoods and communities concerned." The number of persons employed on CWA projects on the state highway system increased to 5,521 during the week ending November 30th, and to 6,249 during the week ending December 7th. The maxi - mum was reached during the week ending January 18th when 7,446 were employed on highway projects. Beginning February 22 the num - ber of men on each project was gradually decreased in accordance with tlie general reduction in all CWA forces. The last pay rolls on March 31 carried the names of 1,999 men. CIVIL WORKS PROJECTS A total of 1!)S CWA projects were carried on under the supervision of the Department of Roads and Irrigation. Of this number, 93 were "General Repair" projects. A "General Repair" project was set up in each county to include general highway repair work on all state highways in the county. These projects and 34 special maintenance projects were supervised by resident engineers and chief patrolmen. The other 71 were construction projects, each with a competent en - gineer in charge. The state highway CWA projects included almost every kind of highway work. The following is a list of the types of work that were undertaken: 1. Construction of new earth roads. 2. Widening of cuts and fills. 3. Producing and placing gravel surfacing. 4. Placing clay surfacing. 5. Construction of new bridges and other drainage struc - tures. 6. Widening bridges, lengthening culverts. </seg>

Among the notable pieces of work accomplished under the CWA program were the construction of 10 new patrol houses and equipment yards having an average value of approximately $4,500 each; the extension and improvement of the state shop and equipment yards at Lincoln; the construction of 3 reinforced concrete deck bridges, 1 treated timber trestle bridge, and 1 Bteel truss bridge; the construc - tion of 78.6 miles of earth roads including minor drainage structures; correcting and redrafting a map of each county in Nebraska; con - structing and equipping a five-room fireproof vault for filing depart - mental records. The general repair work that was completed included resetting or straightening, and painting 390,000 lineal feet ot guard rail; reconstructing 625 miles of earth shoulders; miscellaneous earth - work aggregating about 150,000 cubic yards; and a large amount of other miscellaneous repair work. All of this work was done in accordance with the standards for highway construction of the Department of Roads and Irrigation. Hand labor methods were employed on it in so far as possible. Hand labor was used In order to effect an immediate distribution of the CWA funds directly to those who were in need of help. FINANCE In order to insure the payment of as much of the CWA funds as possible directly to labor, the State CWA Committee rigidly restricted the amount to be used for purchasing materials and renting teams or equipment.

The purpose of this organization was to provide a work program for persons eligible tor relief. Projects were required to be of a public character and of much the same nature as those carried on under the CWA. Many civil works highway projects that were not completed on April 1, 1934, were simply transferred to the work divisions ot the FERA and con - tinued as work relief projects. Persons employed on work relief projects are permitted to earn up to the amount of their budgets each month. The budgets are fixed by the relief workers in each county. The wages are fixed at the prevailing rates for the occupation and the locality where the work is done. No grants are made by the FERA for purchases ot materials. Team hire, however, is paid to team owners who are on relief. </seg>

Lobdell, Acting State Engineer, Department ot Roads and Irrigation, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Pursuant to an established custom, I have the privilege of report - ing to you the official transactions of the Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power, and Drainage for the biennium ending September 30, 1934. AVater Supply There was a slight water shortage in 1933, and a very pronounced shortage in 1934. The water users of the Platte River basin suffered to a greater extent than did some of the water users of the other im - portant basins of the State. - .j ■ . The annual water supply of the Platte River basin from the head - waters to Overton, Nebraska, was 67 per cent of the ten year mean (1923-1932), for 1933, and 33 per cent for 1934. The water avail - able for seven months (October to April inclusive) was 62 per cent for 1933, and 58 per cent for 1934. For the irrigation season, (May to September inclusive), the available supply was 67 per cent for 1933, and 9 per cent for 1934. The total Pathfinder Storage available for the 1934 season was 330,000 acre-feet, being 37 per cent of the 24 year mean (1911 to 1934 inclusive). The quantity Impounded between October 19, 1933, and May 16, 1934, was 228,000 acre-feet, equivalent to 38 per cent of the 24 year mean. The 1934 inflow above the Pathfinder Reservoir was 27 per cent of the 31 year mean (1904 to 1934 inclusive), which is the lowest ot record. There was some available storage In the Guernsey Reservoir in addition to the Pathfinder Storage, amounting to 23,000 acre-feet in 1933, and 44,000 acre-feet In 1934, which was withdrawn and used on lands haying storage rights. The flow of the South Platte River during the biennium was ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p210">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER iremeiy low, however, the Western Irrigation District succeeded in diverting 2.44 acre-feet per acre in 1933, and 2.02 ( acre-feet per acre in 1934. This is fairly good, in view of the fact that many ot the streams in the State were entirely dry during the summer of 1934. The water available in the Hat Creek and White River basins was much below normal during the biennium. In fact, during a portion of the 1934 irrigation season, the supply was barely sufficient for domestic purposes. I '■ ' '.■■•'■'.' Water Administration The administration of the available water supply In the Platte River basin for the 1933 season was not particularly difficult. There was sufficient water throughout the season for appropriations ante - dating December 28, 1894. Appropriations subsequent to December 2S, 1594, were permitted to divert water intermittently during July, August, and September. For the 1934 season, much difficulty was experienced from May 110 to the end of the season, particularly in the Platte River basin. An effort was made to conduct water down the river to supply the two oldest priorities in the Platte River basin, namely Kearney and the 'Platte Valley projects. All projects having priorities' subsequent to - | January 20, 1592, were intermittently kept closed up to July 10, on which date canals having rights subsequent to December 19, 1889, were ! closed and denied water until July 17, with the intention of bene - fitting the Platte Valley Irrigation District, which has a priority of , May 31, ISB4. On July 6, all the water in the river at the headgate of the Platte Valley canal, amounting to 196 second-feet, was flow - ' ing into the canal. This quantity diminished daily until on the 16th, 21 second-feet were flowing. Notwithstanding that these canals con - tinued closed for fourteen days, the flow of wa ;er Into the Platte Valley canal ceased entirely on July 21. After July 21, the available water was administered in the order of priority on a higher water duty, excluding the Kearney and Platte* Valley canals. Approprlators having priorities subsequent to Decem - ber 19, IS B9, were allowed to divert from one-third to one-half ot their respective appropriations. This arrangement permitted the use of water to a greater number of projects, but necessitated closer super - vision of the water by the individual user. Water began to flow into the Platte Valley i canal again on Sep - i tember 9. Forty-seven second-feet were flowing on the 10th, and near the end of September, 99 second-feet were, diverted. This waa </seg>
            <seg id="p211">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION all the management cared to divert, because of a leak In the aam caused by beavers. Many demands for administration of the available water supply were made on the Department throughout the 1934 season, by appro - priators on nearly every stream in the State, except the Loups and the Niobrara River. Among those streams demanding water commis - sioner services were Clear Creek, Turkey Creek, the Blue Rivers, Gor - don, Boardman, Bear, Beaver, and Buffalo creeks. There were no water commissioners available for those streams, causing some criti - cism of the department, although some service was rendered by shunt - ing a hydrographer from remote points, where he was already employed, to these streams. Appropriators on these streams believe they are entitled to water commissioner services. To have priorities and not have them enforced makes those rights almost worthless. The appro - priators on the Frenchman River, Republican River, Hat Creek, White River, and the upper part of the Niobrara River, should have more service from water commissioners than they have been getting. There have been several complaints from water users on the South Platte River in Nebraska against the Colorado water users. Reports tome to the Department that conditions of the Colorado-Nebraska River Compact have been violated. No investigation is made because water commissioners and hydrographers employed have many more de - mands on their time and services than they can take care of. . Administration of the available water supply of several streams of the State has become an all year around requirement. The Hat Creek basin, White River, Snake Creek, Lodgepole Creek, Frenchman River, and the North Platte River require patrolling 365 -days of the year, because of storage and water power appropriators. ■\\\. Because of drouth conditions and low water supply, a large number of pumps were placed in operation under many projects, pumping water from drainage canals and using it on farms adjacent to the drainage ditch; notwithstanding that some ot these projects, having junior rights, were taking water that otherwise would flow by gravity to appropriators having senior rights. Nothing was done by the De - partment to police pumping from drainage canals, because the owner - ship of the drainage water is still debatable. ' '..-■•' I- Precipitation The annual precipitation in the irrigated section was normal, or above normal, in 1933 at Oshkosh, North Platte, Lexington, Culbertson, and Fort Robinson, and eighty-five and seventy-one per cent of nor - mal at Mitchell and Bridgeport respectively. </seg>
            <seg id="p212">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER in 1934, the precipitation at the same stations was from fifty per cent to seventy-five per cent of normal. The greatest deficiency was at Bridgeport and Lexington. The precipitation over the upper North Platte River basin was eighty-three and sixty-five per cent for 1933 and 1934 respectively. There were fifteen inches of snow in the higher elevations of the Platte River basin in Wyoming in 1934, as compared with fifty-five inches in 1933. Hydrography Under a cooperative agreement between the United States Geo - logical Survey and the Department, stream measurements for the biennium were made on all the streams of the State. However, fewer measurements were made because a fewer number of water com - missioners were employed, and hydrographers were taken from their regular duties to supplement the work of the water commissioners. The total number of actual measurements made by hydrographers of canals and streams was 7,136 for the biennium, as compared with 10,675 for the previous biennium. Seventy-seven daily discharge data have been compiled on streams other than the Platte. North Platte, and South Platte Rivers, which data are published in this report. Water Commissioners Two water commissioners were employed on the North Platte River and tributaries, two on Lodgepole Creek, one on the Frenchman and Republican Rivers, and one on the White River, Niobrara River, and Hat Creek, including tributaries. This number of water commis - sioners was not sufficient to meet the demands of water users. Two hydrographers were taken from their regular duties to assist the water commissioners. It was impossible to render satisfactory ser - vice to all the water users having appropriations on the many streams In the State. The demand for service exists every year on streams west of a north and south line through Kearney, but this line was moved east during this biennium to about Wahoo. Observers - The number of observers employed were reduced from about forty in 1931 to two in 1934. Water commissioners and hydrographers took over the work of the observers. These, together with thirty-two automatic recorders in operation in 1934, eliminated a part of the observers formerly employed. </seg>
            <seg id="p213">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION Interstate Problems During the biennium, Wyoming appropriators diverted water under authority of the Wyoming State Engineer, disregarding Nebraska priorities. Conferences were held in Cheyenne among State officials ot the two States, for the purpose of having Nebraska priorities respected. The Wyoming officials finally gave notice that priorities in Nebraska would not be recognized until a compact between the states was made, or until a' court order was issued commanding recognition of Ne - braska's rights. Hence, suit was Initiated in the Federal Supreme Court in the latter part of September, 1934, by Nebraska against Wyoming, seeking an equitable portion of the water of the Platte River basin for Nebraska water users.

            <seg id="p347">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION INCREASE IN FLOW OF IHE NORTH PLATTE AND PLVTTE RIVERS FROM WHALES DAM, WYOMING, TO OVERTON, NEBRASKA By F. F. _Ge Fever Assistant Engineer, V. S. Geological Survey Introduction Results of the study of increase in flow of the North Platte and Platte Rivers throughout the irrigated area in eastern Wyoming and Nebraska during the water years ending September 30, 1932, 1933 and 1934 are presented in the following report. The investigations having been conducted on a similar basis to those during the water year ending September 30, 1931.' and comparisons are made with the data for that year. The scope of the work was extended in 1932 to include the sec - tion of the Platte River between North Platte and Overton As the latter station is at practically the lower end of the area Irrigated by surface water in the Platte Valley, the territory covered by this report includes essentially the entire irrigated area below Whalen Dam. Division of Work The work was carried on under a cooperative agreement between the State engineer of Nebraska and the United States Geological Sur - vey. Most of the field work between the Wyoming-Nebraska line and Lisco was performed by the writer. All other field work in Nebraska was carried on by A. W. Hall, A. E. Johnston, and F. B. Shaffer assistants of R. H. Willis, Chief Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power,' and Drainage. Field work at the station on the North Platte at the Wyoming-Nebraska line was performed by Floyd M. Roush In 1932, Earl Lloyd In 1933, and Carl A. Gaensslen in 1934, engineers of Wy - oming, and by A. W. Hall, A. E. Johnston, and the writer. Field work in Wyoming was performed by the Wyoming engineers men - tioned previously. The Bureau ot Reclamation furnished the records at Whalen Dam, including the diversions by the Interstate and Fort Laramie canals. 'Department of Public Works: Nineteenth Biennial Report, pp. 300-310. </seg>
            <seg id="p348">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER Records for the river stations, except at the Whalen Dam, were computed by the district office of the United States Geological Sur - vey in Denver, those for most of the tributary streams between the State line and Overton, by the writer, and those for the diversions In Nebraska, by A. W. Hall, assistant engineer, and fJ B. Shaffer, office engineer, State of Nebraska. The report was prepared by the writer under the direction of Robert Follansbee, district engineer of the Geological Survey. Acknowledgements are due the Bureau of Reclamation for dis - charge records at Guernsey and Whalen Dam, officials of the Path - finder and Goshen Irrigation Districts for records of operation, and the Wyoming State Engineer's office for records of diversions be - tween Whalen Dam and the State line. Irrigated Area Based chiefly on the acreages reported by the various irrigation projects, the total area irrigated between Whalen Dam and Overton varied from 691,000 acres in 1932 to 663,400 acres in 1934. For the purpose of this report it is convenient to use the three natural divi - sions, (1) Whalen Dam to Lisco, (2) Lisco to North Platte, and (3) North Platte to Overton, into which the irrigated area is divided by the topography of the valley. In making studies of the 1931 water year it was necessary to divide the upper section at Bridgeport, as there was no gaging station at Lisco at that time. Method of Investigation In general the data for the last three years were obtained by simi - lar field methods to those used in 1931. It is believed that the base data have been improved in accuracy each year, due chiefly to the installation of water-stage recorders at Torrington, Minatare, and Lisco in 1932, at Oshkosh in 1933, and at Martin in 1934. The stretch of river studied during the past three years, 305 miles in length, was divided into 9 sections in 1934 by 10 river gaging stations all equipped with water stage recorders. In addition, water stage recorders were installed on several of the tributary streams in 1934. Division of Report This report is divided into four sections as follows: Section I — a study of the actual Increase in the river, both visible and invisible, from all sources; Section II — a study of the return flow trom irriga - tion; Section lll — comparisons by years of results and of factors af - fecting them; Section IV — conclusions. </seg>
            <seg id="p349">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION SECTION l-ACTUAL INCREASE FROM ALL SOURCES Visible Inflow was measured directly at stations maintained on all tributaries near the mouth, and below all diversions. Invisible inflow in this part of the report, for any section of the river, is the difference between the actual river discharge at the lower end of the section and the theoretical flow at that point computed by adding to the river discharge at the upper end of the section the visible inflow In the section and subtracting the diversions. If the actual discharge at the lower end of the section is greater than the computed discharge an invisible inflow is indicated. If the reverse is true a loss is indicated, and this loss is shown in the following tables as a negative invisible inflow. The net pickup contributed by any section is the algebraic sum of the visible and invisible inflow in the section. Evaporation losses are not considered in this part of the report which is concerned with the actual increase in the river, and not the total increase which is lessened by the evaporation losses. These are considered in Section 11, where they are added to the Invisible increase, to determine the total or gross invisible increase. The scattered negative values for invisible inflow In the upper sections of the river are probably due in part to inaccuracies in the river records at the stations involved. A relatively small error in one or both of the monthly river records may result in a relatively large error in the invisible inflow based upon those records, owing to the greater amount of water involved in the river discharges. Changes in channel storage during the month, for the river section involved, cause some of the negative values and in some instances, gains which appear too large. In section II of the report correction to the 1933 and 1934 Invisible gains for the change in channel storage has been made. The total Invisible gain for the year, or irrigation season, deter - mined by adding the monthly values algebraically is believed by the writer to be nearer the actual figure than the total obtained by adding only the positive values, as by the former method, the errors in in - dividual monthly values due to the inaccuracies described, tend to compensate. However, the invisible increase for the year, based on the total of the positive monthly values only, and neglecting the nega - tive values is also shown. Increase In Flow of the River The increase in flow, both visible and invisible, from all sources is shown in the following tables by months for each section of the river: </seg>

            <seg id="p357">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION It will be noted with reference to the foregoing tables that in the upper division (Whalen Dam to Lisco), the invisible increase amounted to from 25 to 39 per cent of the total increase for the full years, and from 28 to 48 per cent of the total increase, for the irrigation seasons. In the middle division (Lisco to North Platte), invisible increase amounted to from 26 to 38 per cent of the total for the full years while for the irrigation seasons there was a variation from a loss in 1934 to 39 per cent of the total increase in 1933. In the lower division the figures for total invisible gains for the years and for the irrigation seasons were all negative indicating losses. SECTION lI— RETURN FLOW FROM IRRIGATION Method of Determining Return Flow from Irrigation In correcting the preceding tabulations for inflow from sources other than return from irrigation, the methods used In the 1931 re - port were followed. Corrections added to the invisible gain during the 3 years covered by this report for evaporation losses, are generally higher than the corresponding corrections in the 1931 report, as a slightly greater average width of river channel was used in the former computations. The amounts deducted for increase in the flow of tributaries which were apparently due to precipitation, were larger in 1932 and 1933 than in 1931 and 1934 because in general, precipitation was greater over the area during the former years. Records of waste, or unused water returned to the river, by the various canals were incomplete, particularly on the smaller canals. It is believed that the unused water comprises a relatively small por - tion of the total amount diverted, especially in irrigation seasons like those here considered when the water supply was limited and pre - cipitation was normal or below normal. Therefore, no attempt was made to compile figures for the waste water returned in each section, and the figures for modified visible and invisible Increase in flow in - clude unused water, as well as return flow which reached the river after having percolated through the soil. Modified Record of Increase in Flow The following tallies show the visible and invisible increase in flow ot the river after deductions for flow from all known sources other than irrigation, and additions for evaporation losses and return flow from irrigation diverted by canals before reaching the river have been made. Invisible gains in the following tables for 1933 and 1934 were corrected for change in channel storage: </seg>

            <seg id="p365">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION As compared to the invisible increases based on the unmouinea records, the invisible Increases in the preceding tables comprise a larger percentage of the total gain. This is due to the elimination of visible flow from sources other than return from irrigation, and addition to the invisible gain for evaporation. As a result, even the lower division North Platte to Overton shows an invisible gain for each year, except 1934. The great invisible gain in the lower division in 1933 is due to precipitation which found its way directly to the river and was not deducted from the visible inflow. SECTION 111-COMPARISONS OF RESULTS AND OF FACTORS AFFECTING THEM The following tables show the annual increase by sections, both visible and invisible, modified or corrected, as described in section 11, arranged for comparison of the results by years. The first table shows the yearly Increase and the second shows the Increase during the irri - gation season only, while the lower half of each table shows the accu - mulative gains by sections. For example, the figure 715,900 in the column headed "Oshkosh-North Platte" in the last half of the first table, Is the total visible gain between Whalen and North Platte and the figure to the right is the total invisible gain. In general the visible and invisible increases in the various sections were greatest in 1933, the year in which river discharge was the greatest and precipitation approximately normal. In 1934 the in - creases were usually less than in any of the other three years. As shown by tables of comparison later in the report, the precipitation during the year and the growing season was below normal and the water supply for irrigation extremely low. </seg>

            <seg id="p371">-.. DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION September 15. Although the eff eft on the discharge at the moutn ol these streams was very pronouncpA in some instances during this short period, no corrections have beeb made in any of the tables. Increase in flow, and especially that portion of the increase which Is return from irrigation, is dependent upon the conditions of supply and demand of water which exist not only during the year for which the study is being made, but also upon those existing during a period of years preceding. Throughout the four years during which this co - operative investigation has been conducted, climatic conditions have been abnormal over the irrigated area, causing greater demands and greater evaporation losses, while climatic conditions over the drainage basin above the irrigated area, have resulted in subnormal supply. Definite conclusions based on 4 year's record only, covering the present dry cycle, would no doubt be altered or proven incorrect by subsequent results. Many factors affecting the increase in flow of the North Platte River will not be well understood and appreciated until after the investigations have been carried through a period of years which includes normal conditions and also a wet cycle. Results of the investigation thus far indicate that the greatest re - turn flow per mile occurs in the sections between the State line and Bridgeport. A loss in addition to that of evaporation takes place in the section between North Platte and Overton, apparently, at least in extreme years like 1934. The gain in this section in 1933 was prob - ably due to precipitation which was slightly above normal during the growing season. The gains between Lisco and North Platte have in - variably been greater than the amount of water diverted in that di - vision which suggests foreign groundwater from the sand hill region on the north of the valley. </seg>

E. ii MEYER, Judge IN THE DISTRICT COURT OP SCOTTS BLUFF COUNTY, NEBRASKA •The State of Nebraska ex rel C. A. Sorensen, Attorney General, Plaintiff, vs. The Mitchell Irrigation __ FINDINGS OF THE COURT District. Defendant, Farmers Irrigation District, Intervener and Cross- Petitioner. This case presents two controversies, one between the plaintiff and defendant, and the other between intervener and defendant. The first is an action by the State of Nebraska to place defendant under the jurisdiction and control of the department of irrigation. There is in my judgment no plausible and reasonable defense to this action. The only defense urged is that the waters for the Mitchell Irrigation District are taken out of the North Piatte river in {the state of Wy - oming about a half mile west of the boundary line between the two states. No Wyoming lauds are irrigated by this water. Defendant argues from this circumstance that Wyoming authorities only have jurisdiction: that immediately on defendant taking possession of the waters at the head gate in Wyoming they become the private prop - erty of the district; furthermore that Wyoming authorities have full control of the head gate and that Nebraska courts can not give Nebraska authorities' the right or power to go across the state line to </seg>
            <seg id="p377">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION regulate the head gate and that if Nebraska authorities cannot regu - late the head gate it can do nothing. If these waters were like wild catfish in the river, ferae naturae, there would be much in defendant's contention. Or if we had in mind the case of a man going down to the river and capturing a bucket full of water for domestic use de - fendant might be right in its contentions. In the first case if the fish was caught even a yard over the Nebraska line in Wyoming il would be a matter exclusively for the Wyoming courts and it would be necessary for the disciple of Izaak Walton to have a Wyoming license; his Nebraska license would not protect him and the fact that he was a resident of Nebraska and brought the fish over the line for use in Nebraska would not make him emenable to Nebraska's fishing laws. Wyoming laws as to the number of the catch and all other regulatory provisions of the Wyoming law would govern. And if there were any regulations in regard to taking water for domestic use the laws of Wyoming would likewise control because as soon as the man referred to got his bucket of water it would be his private property. I do not apprehend that any of these circumstances are applicable to the running water of the North Platte river even though it was deflected out of its natural bed into defendant's canal. It Is still public water for use by the public. Art. 63, Ch. 81, C. S. 1929. The minute it comes across the boundary line whether in the bed of the stream or in defendant's canal it comes under the jurisdiction of Nebraska authorities. As was well said by counsel Wyoming was through with these waters and they were on their way out of the state when defendant took possession of them not for any Wyoming use, such as would have been the case if a power plant had been erected at the same point to furnish power to Wyoming mills and to light Wyoming cities, but defendant took possession of them for the sole purpose of conveying them to Nebraska to be used In irrigating Ne - braska farms. Wyoming authorities may of course regulate the head gate. Presumably it will do so for the benefit of the Wyoming users above the Mitchell head gate. If in doing so it trespasses upon the right of Nebraska users there are courts which have jurisdiction of the controversy that may arise. A suit has already been filed in the Supreme Court of the United States for that purpose. But the acci - dental circumstances that these waters are diverted out of the North Platte river in Wyoming should not and does not prevent the Ne - braska authorities from exercising the same jurisdiction and control over the Mitchell District that it exercises over other districts. It is of course fundamental law that in doing so it cannot cross over the state line. It does not seem necessary for It to do so. Defendant is a Nebraska corporation: and the res, the waters, have entered the state. Nebraska can take control of them when they enter the state and divert them back Into the bed of the river if such course is </seg>
            <seg id="p378">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER necessary. It can also act in personam on defendant district and its officers. It can also go into the courts of Wyoming where under the rules of comity this decree can be enforced. Tlie finding on this branch of the case is for the plaintiff and a decree may be drawn as comprehensive as necessary, granting the prayer of plaintiff's petition and putting this district completely under the jurisdiction of the state and giving the state authorities plenary powers to the full extent given by the statute. The controversy between the defendant and the intervener pre - sents a more difficult and of course a much more important problem. Undoubtedly especially in dry years a priority of water rights is of tremendous importance. One cannot help but approach the solution ot this question with a deep sense of responsibility and with a feeling of trepidation. It is one of those cases where one, is thankful that there is a Supreme Court to review and correct any mistake the Dis - trict Court may make. One who has himself heen I brought up on a farm and who went through the drought years of 1593 and 1594 when whole communities were praying for rain and stood helplessly by whKe their crops which was their life sustenance Ishriveled up and were destroyed cannot render a decision which may deprive thou - sands of acres and hundreds of farms of an adequate supply of water without the most serious feelings. However the law commits that duty to the courts. It has already been established that priority in time is priority in right. The fact that vast interests are at stake, that thousands may be disastrously affected does not change the legal principles which govern. A case involving small interests and com - paratively unimportant may present legal questions of more difficulty. Yet when large property interests and the fate of many rest on the out - come the courts naturally preceed with much greater caution and ex - amine into tlie laws with much greater care. I do not subscribe to the doctrine that the District Court of Scotts Bluff County does not have jurisdiction of this controversy. This case in its simplest form is nothing more than a controversy between de - fendant and intervener concerning which has the prior right to the water. Defendant emphasized the difficulty of enforcing a decree if one is rendered hut I do not believe there will be very much diffi - culty along this line. While it is true as said above that Nebraska authorities cannot regulate the head gate, yet if a decree is entered in favor of intervener and establishing that it has the prior right such decree can be enforced either in personam or by taking direct possession of the waters. Defendant adverted to disadvantages that would accrue to it with reference to appropriators above the river from it. Ido not doubt that the suit now pending before the Supreme Court of the United States will eliminate most of these difficulties. </seg>
            <seg id="p379">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION That suit will establish the proportionate amount of water eacn state is entitled to. The fact that all the users of water from the North Platte valley are not before the court cannot deprive the court of the right to decide between the two who are before the court. Therefore I feel and hold that the court has jurisdiction. The claim that the suit in the United States Supreme Court supersedes the District Court of Scotts Bluff county in this case is, in my judgment, without merit. An examination of the bill in that case discloses that while it asks the court to determine priorities, such will be done as was said by counsel during the oral argument, simply for the purpose of totaling all priorities in Wyoming against the totals in Nebraska for administrative purposes by the irrigation departments in the two states. Tlie states themselves and not the respective parties are before the court in that case. I doubt if the Supreme Court of the United States in that case will decide between the conflicting claims of de - fendant and intervener or even permit them to intervene in that case. It seems to me more likely that if they ask to intervene that the Su - preme Court would direct defendant and intervener to settle their rights in a suit between themselves especially in view of the fact that these waters are Nebraska waters being waters that are on their way out of Wyoming, not claimed by Wyoming, and not considered in the suit before tlie United States Supreme Court as Wyoming but as Nebraska waters. We then come to the very important question as to the prior right to these waters. The first important question presented in this con - nection relates to the plea of res judicata on account of the case of Enterprise Irrigation District v. Tri-State Land Company, reported in 92 Nebr. 121, 13S N. W. 171. This plea and the various arguments and claims made pertaining to it require a careful and critical exam - ination of the pleadings, decree, briefs, opinion and mandate in the Enterprise case. Let me say before taking up a discussion of that case that if the matter were presented now as an original proposition one might feel pretty strongly that Judge Hobart's decision was right especially In view of the second point in the syllabus in Kearney etc. Co. v. Alfalfa Irr. Dist.. 97 Nebr. 139. 149, N. W. 363. However, Judge Hobart's decision was reversed in the Enterprise case and if that case is res judicata of the present case or if the principle of stare decisis is applicable then the courts and parties are alike bound and the rights of the parties having been determined by the former adjudication remain as so fixed. Turning now to an examination of the Enterprise case. Judge Letton says at the very beginning of his long opinion that "When the issues were finally made up, it appeared that plaintiff and each of </seg>
            <seg id="p380">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER the defendants except the Tri-State Land Company and the Farmers Mutual Canal Company were interested in having the prayer of the petition granted, and that practically the same relief is sought by each of them against the two defendants named Through - out the opinion, therefore, for convenience, the two latter named com - panies will be designated as defendants and all the other parties as plaintiffs." There was therefore in the Supreme Court a direct controversy between the defendant and cross-petitioner in that case, Mitchell Irri - gation District and defendant Tri-State Land Company, the predecessor of intervener. Simplifying the matter by eliminating all the other parties we have a case in which Mitchell Irrigation District was-plain - tiff and Tri-State Land Company defendant, in which plaintiff after a statement of tlie facts upon which it relied sought the following relief as appears from the prayer of its cross-petition, to-wit: "WHEREFORE this cross petitioner prays: Ist : That a decree be entered herein determining and adjudicating tlie respective amounts of water that the parties to this action have acquired a right to appropriate from said river and the relative rights of appropriation. 2nd: That it he adjudged and decreed that this cross petitioner has acquired a right of appropriation from the North Platte River to the extent of 240 cubic feet of water per second of time continuously flowing during each and every irrigation season with a priority dat - ing from the 20th day of June, 1S90; that said right is prior to the right of appropriation of the Farmers Mutual Canal Company and its grantors with the exception of 2S cubic feet of water per second of time, and that the title to said right of appropriation of this cross petitioner he quited and confirmed in this cross petitioner as against all the parties to this action and to each of them, and that the cloud cast on this cross-petitioner's title by reason of the opinion of the Secretary of the State Board of Irrigation and the resolution of said Board confirming said opinion be removed." The defendant in the same case did not file a cross-petition or pray for any relief. The trial court dismissed the cross-petition of the Mitchell Irriga - tion District on the ground that it did not have jurisdiction of the sub - ject matter because the head gate of its canal was in Wyoming and also found against the contentions of the Tri-State Land Company ex - cept as to the 28 second feet of water and enjoined all the parties in - cluding the Mitchell Irrigation District from interfering with its. right to that much water. Following the course of the caise in the Supreme Court: The Tri-State Land Company appealed to the Supreme Court </seg>
            <seg id="p381">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION and the Mitchell Irrigation District (and many others) were taken to the Supreme Court as appellees. The Mitchell Irrigation District at - tempted to take a cross-appeal and in my judgment did so. No ques - tion was ever raised at the time as to the validity of its cross-appeal. It was designated both as appellee and as cross-appellant in the Supreme Court. Ido not believe that the failure of appellee to file Its praecipe in the time designated by the rules was jurisdictional or fatal to its appeal. In any event it was before the court as an appellee. Furthermore it seems to me that it is estopped at this time and after appearing in the Supreme Court in the capacity of cross-appellant and demanding relief as a cross-appellant to now say that the court never acquired jurisdiction to determine it's cross-appeal. We then have these two parties before the Supreme Court, the appellant Tri-State Land Company and the appellee and cross-appel - lant demanding the relief quoted above from the prayer of its answer and cross-petition. The Supreme Court without discussing the correct - ness of Judge Hobart's holding that the court did not have jurisdiction of the subject matter of cross-appellant's cross-petition and without dismissing the cross-appeal in so many words, sustained the appeal and contentions of the Tri-State Land Company, found that it was entitled to 1142 second feet instead of 28 only with priority dating from September 16. 1887. This in my judgment amounted to a dis - missal with prejudice of the cross-petition of the Mitchell Irrigation District and a finding that even as against it the Tri-State Land Com - pany had priority to 1142 second feet. If we stopped here we could not escape I believe from the conclusion that the rights of the Mitchell District and Tri-State Land Company were finally adjudicated in the Enterprise case and that the priority of the latter company was for - ever established. This was evidently the opinion of the plaintiff and cross-petitioner also as appears from an examination of their motion and brief for re-hearing and by the fact that they applied for a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States. That court also indicates that the decision and opinion of the State Supreme Court was final adjudication of the respective rights of the parties. See Enterprise Irrigation District vs. Farmers Mutual Canal Company, 243 U. S. 157, 37 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318. However the statement in the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States that "all parties to this suit, or their predecessors in interest appeared before the secretary of the board, at the times and places indicated in the notice, and presented such evidence as they deemed appropriate in support of their respec - tive claims" does not apply to the Mitchell District since it did not appear before the secretary. Furthermore the Supreme Court of the United States dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that two questions were presented, one Federal and the other, the estoppel, non-Federal, that the non-Federal question, the estoppel. </seg>
            <seg id="p382">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER was sufficient alone to sustain the action of the Nebraska Supreme Court, that it could not examine the correctness of the holding on that question since It presented no Federal question that there was there - fore no occasion to examine the Federal question since sustaining plaintiffs in error's contentions with reference thereto would not affect the result. It therefore held that it did not have jurisdiction of the controversy and dismissed the writ of error. Turning again to our examination of the case in our own Supreme Court it appears that defendant complained in its cross-appeal to the Enterprise case that the effect of the decree in the District Court taken as a whole was to deny that the Mitchell Irrigation District had any - right of appropriation at all as against any of the other parties to the action since it decreed a distribution of all of the water of the stream to the other parties to the action and enjoined the Mitchell Dis - trict from doing any act or thing to interfere with such order of dis - tribution although it was admitted throughout the case that its rights were senior to several of its co-defendants. The District Court how - ever did find that the Mitchell District did post notice at the point of diversion on June 20, 1890, and found the other facts pertaining to the Mitchell District. The Supreme Court makes no mention In its opinion or mandate of the cross-appeal of the Mitchell District and evidently did not determine directly the point raised by it. The court seems to have become completely engrossed in its examination ot the claim of the Tri-State Land Company that its fight was 1142 second feet instead ot 28 second feet. I would take the decision of the Supreme Court to establish that the Tri-State had the right to 1142 second feet as against all the other parties in the case. The claim of the Mitchell District in its cross-appeal that its priority was never de - termined and that it was enjoined in favor of appropriators with junior rights seems to have escaped the attention of the court in its - examination of the other questions involved. But inasmuch as the Supreme Court reversed the case as to the defendant Tri-State Land Company which was not a cross-petitioner and dismissed the action the effect was to wipe out the entire decree of the District Court and to establish but one thing in my judgment, viz: that the Tri-State Land Company had a priority to 1142 second feet ot water dating from September 16, 1887, as against all the other parties to the action. The Supreme Court refused to determine the controversy as between plain - tiff and the various cross-petitioners but dismissed without prejudice as to such controversies if any existed. Therefore although the cross - appeal of the Mitchell District was not directly determined the ob - noxious injunction about which it complained in Its brief in the Supreme Court was dissolved. And as I understand it its priority as of June 20, 1890, has never been questioned, nor its relation to any of the other appropriators except only the claim made In this suit by </seg>
            <seg id="p383">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION intervener to the effect that Intervener has an appropriation of 1142 second feet dating from September 16, 1887. It would seem that in a matter of such vital importance specific mention would have been made either in the opinion, the mandate or in the judgment entered in the District Court pursuant to the mandate. Furthermore there is language in Judge Letton's opinion in the Enterprise case which does not apply to the Mitchell Company and which might indicate that the rights of Mitchell Company were not considered by the Supreme Court. In view of such language one might hesitate to find that the conflicting rights of the defendant and intervener were finally de - termined in the Enterprise case. However, in spite of these state - ments in the opinion it seems almost certain that the claims of the Mitchell Irrigation District were considered by the Supreme Court and that the Supreme Court placed it in the same category with ref - erence to intervener's claim as the plaintiff and other cross-petitioners. It seems almost certain that if it did not do so it would have so stated some place in tlie course of the opinion or would have dismissed the Mitchell District's cross-appeal without prejudice or if it did not consider that it had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action in so far as it pertained to the Mitchell District's cross-petition that it would have so stated and dismissed its cross-appeal and cross - petition on that ground. If it intended to place the Mitchell Irriga - tion District in a different category on account of its claim never having been adjudicated by the state board of irrigation it certainly would have said so especially on the filing of the motion for re-hearlng. In such case it seems certain that none of the costs would have been taxed against the Mitchell District whereas the fact is that the costs in the Supreme Court were taxed against all of the parties referred to by Judge Letton as plaintiffs. But even if one might hesitate to hold on this record that the priorities between defendant and intervener were not finally deter - mined in the Enterprise case there is another principle, that of stare decisis, which it seems to me, determines the case against defendant. "Stare decisis" is a name given to the doctrine that, when the court has once laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle, and apply It to all future cases where the facts are substantially the same." Moore v. City ol Albany, 98 N. Y. 396, 410; Hart v. Metropolitan St. Ry. Co., 72 N. Y. Supp. 797, 65 App. Div. 493." The advancement of a new argument not presented or considered in the original case does not prevent application of the principal of stare decisis unless the original decision was legally indefensible and palpably wrong.

            <seg id="p386">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER ' it was held that: "A judicial interpretation of the words in a railroad charter permitting the corporation to 'farm out' tlie right of trans - portation is stare decisis, and binding in a subsequent case, although the latter is between different parties." "The rule of 'stare decisis' applies with special force to an opinion prescribing rules for the location of survey lines, handed down several years ago. as it must be presumed that since it was delivered, many surveys have been made, grants issued, and title confirmed under its authority and it has thus become a part of the practical construction of many thousands of grants and conveyances." Morgan v. Renfro 99 S. W. 311. 314, 124 Ky. 314. "Res Adjudicata binds parties and privies; while stare decisis governs the decision of tlie same question in the same way in an action between strangers to the record." Marguerita Coal Co. v. Meadow River Lumber Co., 127 S. E. 644, 98 W. Vs. 898.' A case more illustrative as to facts is City of Buffalo v. Erie R. Co., 144 N. Y. S. 578, S3 Misc. Rep. 144, wherein it was said: "In a city's action against a railroad to enjoin its exclusive use of a strip of land intersecting a number of streets, and to establish a public right of crossing, where the controlling facts were the same as in a previous action in respect to only one of such streets, wherein it was determined that the city had no right of crossing, the doctrine of stare decisis applied, and the defendant was entitled to its benefit; the doctrine being that, when a court had once laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases where the facts are substan - tially the same, as making for the certainty and stability of the law." I see no reason why the principle is not decisive of the case before me. In most cases the principle of stare decisis is applied to controversies where the parties to the former adjudication are different than in the case then before the court and where the facts are similar but not identical. Here the exact facts with regard to intervener's claimed priority were before the Supreme Court in Farmers Irr. Dist. v. Frank. 72 Nebr. 136. 100 N. W. 286 and in Enterprise Irr. Dist. v. Tri-State Land Company, 92 Nebr. 121, 138 N. W. 170. In the Frank case the controversy was between William Frank who had at - tempted to perfect an appropriation and establish an irrigation district covering a part of intervener's present district. The facts upon which intervener now relies were before the court in that case and fully sustained by the court and intervener's priority established as of September 16, ISS7. In the Enterprise case intervener's claims were again before the court and in an opinion covering many pages were sustained by the court. It is true that in the Frank case a situation similar to that occupied by the Mitchell District was not before the </seg>
            <seg id="p387">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION court but the court did hold that the long delay in the prosecution of intervener's works did not divest it of its priority. The same facts were before the court that are now relied upon by the Mitchell District to divest defendant in this case of its priority as against the Mitchell District. And if the Supreme Court held that such facts did not destroy its rights as against Frank how could it hold that they destroyed its rights as to the Mitchell District? In the Enter - prise case tlie same parties or their privies were before the court as are here before the court. Even if it should be held that tlie Mitchell District was not bound by the adjudication by reason of the principle of res judicata yet tlie same claims were then urged to destroy inter - vener's priority that are here urged and that were urged in the Frank case. Nevertheless tlie court held that intervener had a priority dating from September 16, 1887, for 1142 second feet of water. There is nothing in my judgment which places tlie Mitchell District in a better situation than that of the plaintiff and various cross - petitioners in tlie Enterprise case. It is true that it had not come be - fore the state board of irrigation and sought to establish its claim. This fact is not in my judgment of any importance. If it had appeared and if its claim had been established in accordance with its present contentions as it probably would have been it would still date only from June 20, IS9O. Intervener's priority Would still date from September 16. 1887. It is the date of priority of intervener's appro - priation which was established by the State Board, the Frank case, and the Enterprise case. Such date of priority stood in face of the facts urged against it in the two former opinions referred to. If the Mitchell District claimed an earlier appropriation than September 16, ISB7, there would be something before the court that has not been determined but since intervener's appropriation stands as of that date and has stood as against two prior assaults and since the Mitchell District does not claim an earlier but a later date it would seem futile for me to try to override the Supreme Court by holding that regardless of the holdings in the Frank case and the Enterprise case, neverthe - less the long delay in completing its works, destroyed intervener's priority so that it is not valid as to the Mitchell District. I will now refer to several other contentions made by defendant. It contends that the rights of the parties were fixed when the 1889 law was passed, that intervener lost any advantages accruing prior to the 1889 law by failing to proceed unless interrupted by "snow or rain." That it was required to proceed under the 1889 law within 90 days which it failed to do. The answer to these contentions is that all these matters were involved in the Enterprise case and settled adversely to defendant. In regard to defendant's contention that there was no controversy between the defendant and intervener in the Supreme Court in the </seg>
            <seg id="p388">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER I Enterprise case I think that a reference to the prayer of defendant's cross-petition above quoted disposes of that contention. It is true as counsel slated that if the Supreme Court held that the findings of the state board were valid then the injunction about which defendant was complaining in the Enterprise case had to be vacated and counsel go on to say that there was therefore no necessity for any finding as to the Mitchell District and that there was no reference to the cross - appeal in the opinion and it was not considered. It is true that there was no reference to the cross-appeal in the opinion, but it does not seem possible that the Supreme Court found that intervener had a priority to 1142 second feet dating from September 16, ISB7, with - out finding against the contentions of the Mitchell District one of which was that although it had posted its notices several years later, viz: one, June 20, 1890. nevertheless it was- prior to intervener on account of intervener's delay, non-user and other facts set forth in its cross-petition, which were discussed by the Supreme Court and held not to destroy the priority of intervener, at least as to the plain - tiff and other cross-petitioners who were making the same claim. While the Supreme Court does not refer specifically to the Mitchell District's claim it established intervener's priority to 1142 second feet of water as of September 16, 1887, and it could hardly have done so without disposing of defendant's contention in the Enterprise case that al - though defendant had made its postings on June 20, 1890, and had a priority from that date only, yet It was "prior to the rights of appro - priation of the Farmers Mutual Canal Company and its grantors with the exception of 28 cubic feet of water per second of time,'* because of the facts referred to in its cross-petition in the Enterprise case and discussed at great length in Judge Letton's opinion. Defendant criticizes the doctrine ot estoppel as announced in the Enterprise case and it seems to me that such criticism is well taken but that does not prevent it trom being the law of the case. Courts are not perfect and opinions are rendered from time to time that seem on further consideration to be illogical and even unjust but that is a weakness that is inherent in the administration of all human affairs. Defendant further contends that It has acquired rights by prescription since the decision in the Enterprise case. It does not seem to me that the evidence established that such is the case. A similar contention and based on similar facts was made in Masterson vs. Kennard, 12 Pac. (2nd) 560. However the Oregon court held that there was no adverse user and a careful reading of the opinion convinces me that as to this point the Oregon court was right, and I believe the case establishes a precedent that should be and will be followed in Nebraska. Counsel calls attention to the provision in paragraph 11 of the Warren Contract to the effect that intervener accepts the storage </seg>
            <seg id="p389">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION water "in full satisfaction ot all its rights to the water of the North Platte River, both natural flow and surplus storage." As suggested by counsel for Intervener defendant is not a party to the Warren Contract and cannot therefore take advantage of it, and he makes the further suggestion that it has never been construed between the parties to it as binding intervener to take the storage waters in lieu, or in full of natural flow. Other contentions were of course made in the long and able argu - ments but I think the answer to them is contained in what has already - been said or at least are disposed of by what has been said. In any event it has been my purpose to consider all the arguments made by defendant and I do not believe there are any of importance that I have failed to consider although it may be that I have failed to mention them. It therefore seems necessary for me to find and hold generally in favor of intervener and a decree may be drawn to that effect. Counsel having announced in open court that a decree establishing intervener's priority to 905 second feet including storage water will be satisfactory the decree may limit its priority to that amount. In my judgment separate decrees should be drawn, one in the controversy between plaintiff and defendant, and one in the controversy between intervener and defendant.

            <seg id="p397">DEPARTMENT OF ROADS AND IRRIGATION Bridgeport, Nebrasna, November 21, 1934. Mr. R. H. Willis, Chief. Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage. Department of Roads and Irrigation, Bridgeport, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Willis: Your question as to whether the Bureau of Irrigation, Water Power and Drainage of the State of Nebraska is authorized and empowered by law to administer the waters of the state with reference to the rights of riparian owners presents one of the most vexatious questions that arises in connection with the administration of water. There are many who contend that it is one of the functions and duties of the Bureau to police riparian rights and to protect riparian owners in their use of the water of the several streams of the state. If this is the law, it would mean that the Bureau would have a police force scattered throughout the state. It would further mean that the priorities of riparian owners on the several streams within the state would have to be adjudicated, or at least it would require an investigation on each complaint as to priority. In the case of Crawford Company vs. Hathaway, et al., 67 Neb. 325, 93 N. W. 781, the court held that the board created under the irrigation act of 1895 was possessed of powers of administrative character, and that the courts were in no way ousted out of their juris - diction over actual controversy. Also that — "The courts have judicial powers, and, while the board may make all needful preliminary determinations to enable it to regulate the distribution of water, and may determine whether or not proposed appropriations shall be allowed, and in what order, in pursuance of the provision of the statute subject to the right of appeal, whenever a controversy arises over the substance of the rights of various parties making use of a stream, such controversies are proper for the courts to take judicial cognizance of. The courts cannot administer the statute, nor regulate the use of the stream, hut they can and should adjudicate disputes based on the rights of the parties acquired under the statutes." Paragraph two of the syllabus is as follows: "The common law rule with respect to the rights of private riparian proprietors has been a part of the laws of the state ever since the organization of a state government." While I think it was contemplated that the Bureau should, in a measure, have some jurisdiction over the use of the waters of our </seg>
            <seg id="p398">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER streams flowing within the State of Nebraska, yet I cannot conceive where It was ever contemplated that it was incumbent on the Bureau to police the rights of the various riparian owners. 'If a riparian owner should complain that his rights are being interfered with, he has recourse to our courts, who have ample power to protect him. In the body of the opinion of the Crawford Company vs. Hathaway case, the court says: "But there the board has made no determination, and a large number of persons are claiming the right to divert and use the water of a stream, some by appropriation under the statute, and some under prior acts, some by prescription, and others as riparian owners whose rights have accrued prior to the statute, and have not been divested, we know of no sound reason why a suit in equity to determine and adjust such rights and enjoin interference of those rights by others under a claim of right may not be maintained. Such suits are permitted everywhere where the system of appropriation adopted by our statute obtains. In some states they have been provided by statute, but, in the absence of statutes, they have been upheld under general principles of equity jurisdiction." It has always been my opinion that the Department of Roads and Irrigation should adjudicate priorities, and, further, that It has ad - judicated priorities of appropriations for irrigation purposes, and further, that it has authority to close down headgates in order of priority to protect prior appropriators when there is a deficiency In the flow of any stream, but to say that a riparian owner whose rights have not been determined, either by statute or adjudication, has the right to call upon the Department to protect him in the use of water flowing through or adjacent to his land would be to invite trouble. I am therefore of the opinion that in a dispute of this kind that the Bureau is without authority to attempt to adjudicate rights of riparian owners on the several streams within the State of Nebraska. Respectfully, PAUL F. GOOD, Attorney General. By C. G. [Perry, Special ! Assistant. </seg>
