            <seg id="p003">A Manual for Hog Raisers WM. J. LOEFFEL 1 THE HOG BUSINESS Hogs are one of Nebraska's principal sources of agricul - tural wealth. According to the Nebraska and the United States Departments of Agriculture, the average Nebraska farm income for the nine years from 1921 to 1929 was: Per cent of Value total income Hogs $110,223,447 27.37 Beef cattle 111,554,660 27.71 Sheep 12,464,783 3.10 Dairy products 26,663,497 6.62 Poultry and egg5........ 24,042,300 5.97 Crops sold 117,6.80,164 29.23 $402,608,851 100.00 The income from hogs fluctuates with the price of hogs and that of other commodities. The percentage of the Nebraska farm income derived from hogs varied from 24.47 in 1922 to 30.30 in 1926. The average for the nine years for which the figures are available is 27.37 per cent, as indicated. The popularity of the pig is doubtless due largely to his efficiency as a meat, producer. He uses less feed to make a given gain than either the steer or the sheep. On being slaughtei-ed, the pig dresses out a higher percentage of meat than either of the other two meat animals. Since pork is generally fatter than beef or lamb, it has a higher energy value. The hog is generally adaptable. It is difficult to imagine a farm situation into which he will not fit efficiently. Hogs may be handled in small units or large ones, a condition which is not always true of other meat-producing animals. Much of the popularity of the pig is due to his adaptability to the wide range of conditions found on American farms. In modern business, two well accepted principles are "quick turnover" and "mass production". The brood sow exemplifies both of these, j The gestation period of the sow is 112 to 115 days, .which is materially less than that of any other meat - producing animal. The Nebraska Pig Crop Contest has demonstrated the possibility of producing marketable pigs weighing in excess of 200 pounds at six months of age. The sow produces not single individuals, but litters of five to eight or more. When necessary, two litters can be produced in one year. 1 The author wishes to acknowledge aid in the preparation of this circular from Dr. L. Van Es, Prof. A. D. Weber.

            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 While these qualities are estimable ones in the brood sow they also are undesirable ones from the standpoint that they - accentuate periods, of overproduction, with attendant low prices.

However, the pre-eminent position of the feed cost, being twice as great as all other charges combined, challenges the attention of every thinking hog man who strives for economical produc - tion. The possibilities for economies in production are cer - tainly greater here than in any of the other items. This justifies our consideration of feeds and feeding as one of the primary factors in pork production. NUTRITIVE NEEDS OF THE PIG The nutritive requirements of swine are relatively simple. They consist of a need for a certain amount of energy-pro - ducing material, an adequate supply of protein of good quality, and a sufficiency of mineral substances together with certain vitamins which are recognized as essential for the growth and well-being of animals. </seg>

            <seg id="p007">• A Manual for Hog Raisers to its nutritive qualities, protein has a marked stimulating effect upon the appetite as well as upon digestion. The lack of protein is perhaps the limiting factor of growth in more pig rations- in the Corn Belt than any other single factor. A mechanic might have enough engine parts to build ten engines, yet if he has bolts enough to put together only five, he can make only five engines. In other words, the bolts become the limiting factor in engine building. There are many pigs with inherent ability to gain 1.35 pounds a day that gain only .75 pound because of a lack of suitable protein in the ration offered. Fig. 3. — Filth breeds disease. Clean pastures aid in preventing it. In the past we have been inclined to look upon protein simply as protein without regard to quality. Today we recog - nize that some proteins are more nutritious than others. As a general rule proteins of animal origin are regarded as having a higher feeding value than vegetable proteins. According to our present belief, proteins are built up of amino acids which are sometimes designated as building stones. About 20 amino acids are recognized today. The amino acids are frequently compared to the letters of the alphabet, and the proteins to words. Certain amino acids are essential for life. A protein which lacks these acids is said to be incomplete and would, therefore, have a lower feed - ing value than a complete protein. Zein, one of the principal proteins of corn, is a typical incomplete protein. A complete protein, is one that contains all of the essential amino acids. MINERAL MATTER Mineral matter plays an important role in animal nutrition. It regulates many of the life processes aside from furnishing </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 structural material for the growth of tissues. Bones and teeth, for example, are composed mainly of mineral matter, chiefly lime salts. Those animals which have a high, protein requirement, such as growing animals, pregnant sows, and those suckling litters, also have a need for abundant mineral matter. . Of the common domestic animals, perhaps none suffers so frequently from lack of mineral matter as the pig. Pigs are fed largely, and in some cases exclusively, upon rations of cereal grains which are relatively low in mineral matter, par - ticularly in calcium or lime. The skeleton of the pig supports a greater weight in proportion to its size than that of any other of our domestic animals. Pigs are practically all marketed before they are mature ; therefore, their bones lack the strength that comes with maturity. As a result, a larger percentage of crippled hogs is received at the central markets than of all other kinds of stock combined. What stockman has not seen a sow "go down in the back" lafter suckling a large litter, or a paralyzed pig dragging himself from place to place? All of these are usually manifestations of lack of mineral matter in the ration. . v , •' . ■- . ... ■ : ' - : •.■:.• Fig. 4. — Shade is necessary in summer. A deficiency of hog rations in mineral matter is usually confined to a lack of lime or phosphorus. Common salt also may be lacking at times altho it is well recognized that a pig does not require as much of this substance as the steer, sheep, or horse. In certain localities the lack of iodine in the soil and water may cause goitre. This generally manifests itself in the form of the "hairless pig" trouble, which causes heavy mortality. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">A Manual for Hog Raisers This condition is not prevalent in Nebraska and where it does occur may be controlled by the feeding of minute quantities of iodides (usually potassium) during the. gestation period. While the cereal grains are admittedly low in mineral salts, nature, fortunately, has provided a number of feeds which contain an abundance of mineral matter. These feeds are the dairy by-products, skimmilk arid buttermilk, and the packing house by-products such as tankage. Legume forages and roughages also aid materially in supplying the pig's require - ments of lime and other mineral salts. As a general rule, it can be said that where a ration is balanced with proteins of animal origin, particularly where these feeds are used in connection with r legume pasture or in conjunction with legume hay, the pig's mineral needs are ade - quately supplied. Where such protein feeds are not used, minerals may be supplied economically by the use of steamed bone meal or ground limestone. THE VITAMINS Much has been said and written regarding the importance of the vitamins in nutrition. One who reviews the literature on these substances cannot help but be impressed with the fact that niuch remains to be learned concerning them. The exact chemical nature of the vitamins with one exception is not as yet understood. They are recognized by their effect rather than by their properties. Studies indicate that the vitamins are more generally distributed than was once be - lieved. Lack of certain vitamins in the ration brings about the so-called "deficiency diseases". Vitamin A is essential for growth. Therefore, the presence of this substance is important in the rations of young ani - mals. It is fat-soluble and is found in more or less abundance in cod-liver oil, butterfat under certain conditions, and in the green leaves of plants. Yellow corn is richer in Vitamin A than white corn, and is, therefore, superior for young pigs under dry-lot conditions. A deficiency of Vitamin A not only causes poor growth, but in certain animals may cause de - fective vision and eye disturbances. Vitamin B is water-soluble. Recent investigational work indicates that the factor which has been called Vitamin B really has several functions. There is some evidence to show that Vitamin B influences growth. It stimulates the appetite. From the standpoint of pig feeding, we are interested in Vitamin B because its presence in the ration prevents serious nerve disturbances, known as polyneuritis. Vitamin B is abundant in green forage, yeast, and in the embryo of cereal grains. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 Vitamin C prevents scurvy. It is generally found in con - junction with Vitamin B in green forage. It does not appear to be essential in the ration of pigs since pigs are not sus - ceptible to scurvy. Vitamin D is involved in the prevention of rickets a dis - ease of growing bone. This is essentially a disease of young animals causing deformities of the bones and joints, stiff stilted movement, and general unthriftiness. Pigs which are being liberally fed are particularly susceptible to this disease Vitamin D is abundant in the better grades of cod-liver oil Within recent years, a close relation has been shown be - tween the action of Vitamin D and direct sunshine In fact today it is recognized that where an animal is exposed to direct sunshine its body builds up its own Vitamin D. During cloudy spells or in the case of winter pigs, cod-liver oil prob - ably should be fed to supply an adequate quantity of Vitamin U. The effective rays of sunshine are screened out in passing thru common window glass. There are kinds of glass and glass substitutes on the market Which permit the effective rays to pass thru. Vitamin E is one of the more recent discoveries in the field This substance prevents sterility. Its presence has been demonstrated in wheat germs and in sprouted oats, and it is doubtless present in other feeds commonly fed to hogs Vitamin G, which has been proposed, is a fraction of vitamin B. WATER With water making up more than half the weight of the body, its importance" can well be appreciated. In fact it is well recognized that an animal can survive longer without ieed than without water.

Maintenance yields no material product or profit. About one-half of the ration of the liberally fed pig is required for this purpose. It is only that portion of the ration fed above the main - tenance requirement which can be used for growth and fat-r tening. F.or efficient production, therefore, it is desirable to feed as much as possible above maintenance. By way of illustration, the factory operating day and night can manu - facture at a lower overhead cost per unit of product than the same factory running only eight hours a day.

A balanced ration is one which provides sufficient carbo - hydrates, protein, and fats to nourish a given animal for one day without an excess of any nutrient. In order to know how to calculate a balanced ration, it is necessary to know the re - quirements of the animal under consideration. Various in - vestigators have given much study to this matter. One of the most recent feeding standards was devolped by Morrison This standard is adapted from that published in "F^eds and deeding" by Henry and Morrison. As has been frequently pointed out, animal feeding is not only a science, but an art as well. A feeding standard like that given above, is designed merely to serve as an approx - imate guide. Individual pigs may vary from the requirements set forth, and in such a case it will be necessary for the feeder to use his judgment in adjusting rations to the needs Variations from the feed requirements set forth niav be due to the type of pig. A 150-pound pig may vary from a well-finished small-type pig to a long-legged, unfinished, rapidly growing, big type. It is obvious that the latter would require a higher percentage of growth-promoting proteins and mineral matter. . The pig on a limited feed needs a smaller percentagee of protein than one being full fed Pasture-fed pigs need less protein than similar pigs fed in dry lot because some protein is furnished by the forage crop Ljast, but not least, is the matter of individual variation Certain pigs are more efficient than others. Coupled with these variations are the differences in feed proteins, some being more complete and therefore more valuable than others Ihe apparent wide ranges which are given in the feeding standard quoted are provided to meet these variations The feeding standard suggested gives the needs of pigs according to weight. A 50-pound pig, for example, would re - quire about 2 pounds of dry matter. Dry matter is all that </seg>
            <seg id="p013">A Manual for Hog Raisers remains of a feed after the moisture is driven off. This same pig would require .3 to .4 pound of digestible crude protein daily and about 2- pounds of total digestible nutrients. The term "total digestible nutrients" represents the total of all digestible material, the fat having been multiplied by 2.25 on account of its greater energy value. NUTRITIVE RATIO The nutritive ratio is a simple and effective method of ex - pressing the relation between the digestible protein and the digestible energy-producing material or nonproteins. Thus the nutritive ratio of 1:4.5 indicates that for every unit by weight the digestible crude protein there would be 4.5 units of nonproteins, the fats again being credited for their higher energy value. The nutritive ratio can be computed for any ration by adding the nutrients contained in the various feeds. The digestible crude protein is subtracted from the total digestible nutrients. The remainder is divided by the digestible crude protein. The resultant figure is the second term of the pro - portion indicating the nutritive ratio. . COMPUTING RATIONS To compute rations, it is necessary to know the amount of digestible nutrients contained in the various feeds. Such figures are presented in an appendix table in this circular. These tables are adapted ffom those suggested by Henry and Morrison in "Feeds and Feeding". The method commonly used in calculating a ration has been designated as the "cut and try" method. Suppose we have some 75-pound pigs and want to feed shelled corn and tankage. According to the tables in the appendix, the two feeds contain: Total dry Digestible nutrients in 100 pounds matter ; in 100 Crude Carbo- Nutritive pounds protein hydrates Fat Total ratio L~bT. libs. 1 Lbs.

For , example let us use 3 pounds of corn and .25 pound of tankage. For our calculations we shall concern ourselves with dry matter, digestible crude protein, and total digestible nutrients only. By calculation, we learn that our ration con - tains the following: </seg>

The 75-pound pig then should have 3 pounds of dry matter, .44 pound of digestible crude protein, and 2.65 pounds of total digestible nutrients. Ration No. 1 when compared with this standard will be found deficient in dry matter and lacking in protein and total digestible material.. Let us make a second trial ration in which we increase the tankage to .40 pound. Ration No. 2 Digestible ' irotaldigestible I Dr y matter Crude protein j nutrients Pounds Pound I Poui\jlz 3 pounds corn.... | 2.51 .21 2.40 .40 pound tankage...;... .37 • .22 29 Total | 2.88 | . .43 2^69 The second ration coincides as closely with the standard as can be expected under practical conditions. To calculate the nutritive ratio of ration No. 2, we subtract the digestible protein (.43) from the total digestible nutrients (2.69), leav - ing 2.26. This is divided by the amount of digestible crude protein (.43), giving 5.2. In other words, we have in this ration 5.2 pounds or parts by weight of energy-producing material (carbohydrates and fats) to every pound or part by weight of digestible crude protein. Comparatively little use is made of feeding standards in the practical formulation of rations, except in checking up on rations to see how closely they are meeting accepted nutrient requirements. Evvard (1929), in Iowa Experiment Station Research Bul - letin 118, sets forth a new pig-feeding standard which recom - mends substantially higher protein allowances than preceding standards. With this in mind, it is probably a good plan to calculate protein allowances in the upper range provided by Morrison. The engineer has long since learned the importance </seg>
            <seg id="p015">A Manual for Hog Raisers of the "factor of safety". In construction he always builds a little stronger than is needed to support the greatest load anticipated. Since the protein requirements of pigs are not completely understood and since proteins differ in feeding value, it would seem the part of wisdom to apply the "factor of safety" to the protein allowance in the hog ration. Surplus protein can do no harm, except to increase the cost, and we recognize that it does stimulate the appetite and the digestion. In considering the feeding standard it is well to point out that it does not concern itself with mineral matter nor vitamins. The physiological effect of the feed, whether lax - ative or costive, also must be recognized by the feeder. One of the very important factors is that of palatability. With the force-feeding methods in common use today, it is essential that rations be palatable. Where pigs are self-fed free choice, the feeding standard may be dismissed from consideration, except from the stand - point of checking up on the feed intake of the pigs. Self - feeding free choice permits the pig to adjust its ration to its needs and experiments show that in many cases the pig can do so strikingly well. Where certain feeds are either es - pecially palatable or unpalatable or where free choice self - feeding is not followed, the pig cannot adjust his ration to his needs. The daily feed intake of a pig will vary from 2.5 to 5 per cent of the pig's weight, light pigs taking a higher percentage than heavy. Fifty-pound pigs may consume 2.5 pounds or more of feed a day when on full feed. On thfe basis of 100 pounds of live weight, this would approximate 5 per cent. On the other hand, 250-pound pigs will eat about 7 pounds of feed a day, or, on a percentage basis, about 2.75 per cent of their live weight. Pigs on forage require less concentrated feed, since certain of their feed requirements are supplied by the green feed. NEBRASKA HOG FEEDS Feeds are roughly classified into the Foughages or bulky feeds and the concentrates. The limited digestive capacity of the pig makes it necessary to practically eliminate the rough - ages from consideration with the exception of alfalfa hay and forage crops. The concentrates may be further divided into those relatively low and high in protein. The low-protein feeds are composed chiefly of the cereal grains which can be grown cheaply and abundantly on Nebraska farms. The high - protein feeds are largely commercial by-products. As a rule, such feeds are used in order to utilize the cereal grains efficiently. </seg>

            <seg id="p017">A Manual for Hog Raisers WHEAT Wheat is generally too high in price to feed to hogs. Thru various combinations of circumstances such as high-priced corn and cheap wheat, its use for hog feed may become de - sirable at times. Wheat too low in grade for milling pur - poses, may frequently be fed advantageously. Like corn, wheat is lacking in protein and mineral matter, altho not to so marked a degree as corn. However, for efficient utiliza - tion, wheat should be fed with a high-protein supplement. Because wheat is small and hard it is generally recom - mended that it be coarsely ground. Wheat appears to be more palatable than corn. According to experimental results, pigs receiving wheat in place of corn make larger and more eco - nomical gains. Ground wheat appears to vary in feeding value from equality with corn, pound for pound, to 8 per cent -greater efficiency than corn. See Nebr. Exp. Sta. Bui. 261 Wheat for Fattening Hogs. - OATS In Nebraska, oats rank next to corn and wheat in import - ance. The decreasing horse population of the country has been an important factor in diverting this feed to hogs. Oats contain the largest percentage of crude protein of the common cereal grains. The protein of oats is also higher in feeding value than that. of other grains. The ash or mineral content of oats is higher than that of most grains. Oats con - tain about 11 per cent of fibre which, of course, is objection - able from the standpoint of hog fattening. Altho no experimental work has been done with this feed at the Nebraska Station, a number of tests have been carried on at other stations. The tests indicate that the usefulness of oats in the fattening ration is limited. As a matter of fact, whenever they comprise more than one-fourth of the ration, they retard the rate of gain. In the tests reviewed, whole oats ranged from 67 to 88 per cent as valuable as corn per unit of weight. In other words, 100 pounds of whole oats was the equivalent of from 67 to 88 pounds of shelled corn Because of their high protein and ash content, oats are es - pecially desirable in the rations of growing or breeding hogs The fibre content serves as a filler to satisfy the appetite vet prevents the animal from becoming excessively fat. It is admitted that this is quite a wide variation in feeding value and probably can be explained only by the size of pigs used, the length of the feeding period, and the test weight of the oats fed. Oats vary widely, in test weight per bushel depending upon the climatic and soil conditions under which </seg>
            <seg id="p018">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 they were produced. Light oats are "qhaffy", that is, they contain a high percentage of fibre, which makes them less de - sirable for hog feed than plump heavy oats. Not only are differences found in oats produced in different states, but also with oats produced in different sections of the same state. Within the same region, the oats produced one year may differ materially in composition and therefore in feeding value from those produced in other years. ._, , . ._ _ ,.- - . ...... ■•--,,- ,:.r.-- i- .- ■• - •• - • •-• .- ■ ■ shut - -f~ - i ;.-.■•.; ".■ &lt;33§F*» 5 ' ■ 4-H J ■*''-■) ■ Fig. 8. — Pigs save huskers' wages. Several stations agree that it is desirable to grind oats, particularly for fattening hogs. The limited amount of work done with hulled oats has been unfavorable to the use of this feed because of its high cost. BARLEY The introduction of the new "smooth" varieties of barley, together with the more general use of the combine, has been an important factor in greatly increasing barley production in Nebraska. Barley is higher in protein and crude fibre, but lower in fat than corn. While barley comes a little nearer being "bal - anced" than corn, the addition of a high-protein supplement to a barley ration is generally necessary for economical gains. Barley, .like oats, fluctuates in test weight per bushel. Doubtless some of the apparent discrepancies in feeding value are due to this fact. Plump, well-filled, heavy barley is obviously more nutritious than light-weight samples. As a rule, pigs fed barley consume slightly more feed than similar pigs fed corn. Ground barley, when fed with a high- </seg>
            <seg id="p019">A Manual for Hog Raisers protein supplement, has proved to be worth 83 to 88 per cent as much as shelled corn. By this it is meant that 100 pounds of ground barley were equal to from 83 to 88 pounds of shelled corn. A few northern and western stations have reported higher values for barley. It is quite possible that under their conditions, barley was superior, to that produced in eastern J Nebraska and the corn somewhat inferior, causing the two feeds to approach equality more nearly. Whether or not to grind barley must be determined by the price of barley and the cost of grinding. In Nebraska tests, whole barley proved 80 per cent as valuable as corn, whereas ground barley was 84 per cent as efficient. The work of several stations indicates that soaking whole barley is a poor substitute for grinding. Soaking ground barley has slightly increased its efficiency, altho not enough to cover the cost of the additional labor. Some attention has been directed recently to a fungus scab (Gibberella saubinetti, Mont., Sacc), which affects barley, wheat, rye, and oats. During recent years this disease has caused heavy losses thru reduced yields in the eastern Corn Belt. Scabby barley grain which is slightly pink in color was said to be causing sickness and death among pigs to which it was fed. Numerous feeding tests were carried on by eastern Corn Belt experiment stations as well as by the United States Department of Agriculture and to date it appears that barley which is very scabby is so unpalatable to pigs that they will not eat it. Studies thus far indicate that scabby barley should be fed to sheep or cattle rather than to pigs. Scab requires humid conditions to develop and for this reason prob - , ably will not prove a serious handicap to barley production and feeding in Nebraska. RYE Of the cereal grains grown in Nebraska, rye is the least important. Frequently the farmer producing rye in a limited way is forced to feed it as the only means of marketing his crop. Rye resembles wheat closely in composition. Because of its small size and hardness, rye should be ground for hog feed. Like other grains, it lacks protein, hence should be fed with a high-protein supplement. Rye lacks palatability and therefore should be fed with some other more palatable grain. The Minnesota Station, which probably has done more work with rye than any other station, has never succeeded in finishing a lot of pigs on rye, tankage, and mineral in dry lot. Where pigs were fed rye, as the only grain, they began to scour and lose weight after 90 to 120 days of feeding. The only satisfactory ration where rye comprised the only grain was that of ground rye and butter- </seg>
            <seg id="p020">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 milk, equal parts. Better results are secured with rye on pas - ture than in dry lot. . . &lt;■ The fungus ergot is frequently found growing on rye. Rye which is badly affected with ergot should never be fed to pregnant sows because of the likelihood of causing abortion. On the basis of the experimental evidence now available, rye should be sold on the market wherever possible. When it becomes necessary or desirable to feed rye, it should be ground and fed with a high-protein supplement. Better results may be expected if it is mixed with a more palatable grain. On pasture, rations containing rye show to better advantage than in dry lot. PROSO OR HOC MILLET Some interest has been manifested by western Nebraska hog men in the recent Colorado trials with proso, hog millet, or hershey, as it is variously called. Two tests were carried on in which corn was compared with ground millet. A protein feed was fed in each case. In one trial the millet-fed pigs gained more rapidly, than the corn-fed, altho a second trial revealed little difference in rate of gain. In one trial ground millet proved equal to corn in feeding value and in the other trial 95 per cent as valuable as corn. It should be pointed out that these values are both higher than those determined by the South Dakota Station. '■ ? *■'; - --- ■ . - - J Fig. 9. — The Nebraska "pig cafeteria".

            <seg id="p021">:■■■■. A Manual for Hog Raisers HOMINY FEED Hominy feed or meal is a by-product of corn milling by the dry method. This feed consists of the corn bran together with the germs and some of the starchy materials. In some instances the oil may have been extracted from the germs. Ordinarily this feed is absorbed by commercial feed mixers, altho during periods of corn shortage it is of interest to feed - ers as a corn substitute. i Trials at the Purdue Experiment Station are in accord with similar trials at Nebraska where it was found that pigs fed hominy feed and a protein supplement ate less feed and made materially smaller gains than pigs fed corn and a supplement. On a replacement basis, hominy feed ranged from 95 to 100 per cent as valuable per unit of weight as corn. Where hominy feed replaced only a part of the corn, that is, where it was fed with corn, more satisfactory results were obtained. MOLASSES Molasses is used in only a very limited way in hog rations. It is a constituent of some commercially mixed hog feeds. The Pennsylvania Station, in two trials, replaced one-third of the corn of a corn-and-tankage ration with blackstrap molasses. The molasses was not relished by the pigs. Gains were reduced and costs increased. The fat produced was of inferior quality. POTATOES During periods of low prices, potatoes may frequently be fed to livestock advantageously. Low-grade or cull potatoes are commonly used for this purpose. American and Euro - pean experiment stations report many experiments in which potatoes have been fed. As a general rule, potatoes give best results when cooked. According to some of the early experiments, cooking increases their feeding value for pigs 50 per cent, altho more recent trials show an even higher value for cooking. Cooked potatoes are one-fourth as valuable per unit of weight as shelled corn for hog feed. Because of their bulk, due to the high water content, potatoes should not. form the entire ration for fatten - ing hogs. Some grain should be fed with potatoes. The Oregon Station secured best results where one pound of grain was fed to every four pounds of potatoes. Potatoes, like the cereal grains, are deficient in proteins; consequently such feeds as tankage, dairy by-products, or alfalfa forage or hay should be included in the ration to supply the protein needs. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 HIGH-PROTEIN FEEDS .. The protein-rich feeds for the most part are by-products from the manufacture of human food. Thus, we have pack - ing-house, dairy, mill, oil mill, and starch-factory by-products all of which occupy places of more or less importance in ho^ feeding. THE PACKING-HOUSE BY-PRODUCTS TANKAGE Tankage is made, from meat products not suitable for human food. This material is cooked by steam under pres - sure, the grease is removed, and the residue dried and ground and is variously known as meat meal,' tankage, or digester tankage. The better grades contain 60 per cent crude protein Tankage generally contains considerable bone, which is avail - able to the pig as bone-forming material. Tankage stimulates the appetite. For example, pigs fed corn and tankage consume more feed than those fed corn alone. As a rule, pigs receiving tankage make larger gains than those getting nothing but corn. One of the chief ad - vantages from the use of tankage is the saving of grain effected in producing a given gain. In a series of Nebraska tests on alfalfa pasture using 60-pound pigs, a pound of tank - age saved or replaced 4 pounds of corn. In other words whenever a pound of tankage costs less than 4 pounds of corn, 100 pounds of gain can be produced more cleaply with tankage than without it. With young pigs, tankage has a higher replacement value than with heavier hogs. In dry lot, tankage is more valuable than under pasture conditions Tankage may be self-fed free choice with the grain Where this method of feeding is followed, pigs generally take the proper allowance of tankage. In the early stages of the feed - ing period, pigs which are protein starved frequently overeat as far as the tankage is concerned. This, of course', does no harm except to increase the expense. Over a feeding period of any length, pigs consume on the average one part of tank - age to 10 of corn. However, in the early stages of fattening pigs may eat one part of tankage to seven or eight of corn while later, one part of tankage will be consumed with 12 or 15 parts of corn. The feeder then who hand-feeds tankage at the rate of one to 10 parts of grain is likely to cut his pigs short on protein early in the feeding period and provide a surplus later when the need is not so great. J&amp; rn i 1 u nc i tanka « e are two feeds so nearly equal in palat - abihty that the pig may be permitted to balance his own ration. Where a less palatable grain is used or a supplement more palatable than tankage is fed, the consumption of sup- </seg>
            <seg id="p023">A Manual for Hog Raisers plement would be increased so that self-feeding free choice would be neither economical nor desirable. It can safely be said that the supplement should never be self-fed unless the grain is self-fed. A more desirable practice where hand-feeding is to be re - sorted to is to feed one-fourth to one-third of a pound of tankage per head daily. The changing amounts of corn taken and the increasing live weight tend to adjust the tankage allowance to body needs. MEAT AND BONE MEAL Many packers are now using the dry melting method to re - duce material inedible as human food instead of the tanking process just described. The resultant product is known as meat and bone meal or "odorless tankage". This product usually contains 50 per cent protein, and also 20 per cent bone, which assures adequate mineral constituents. i Fig. 10. — A simple method of watering pigs on pasture. The Nebraska Station carried on some of the pioneer work with this supplement. Meat and bone meal proved to be more palatable than tankage and stimulated the consumption of both grain and supplement. Probably due to increased feed intake, the gains were larger than where tankage was fed. In practically all cases less feed was required to produce 100 pounds of gain in the lots receiving meat and bone meal. It appears then that meat and bone meal that contains 50 per cent protein is fully equal to 60 per cent protein tankage. The by-product from dry melting, because of its freedom from unpleasant odors, is eagerly sought after by commercial </seg>
            <seg id="p024">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 feed mixers; therefore, the amount of this by-product reach - ing the hands of feeders has been small. The price of meat and bone meal is about the same as that of tankage. FISH MEAL While not strictly speaking, one of the packing-house by - products, fish meal, because of its composition and feeding value, may be classed along with them. Fish meal may re - sult from the manufacture of fish oil. This type of fish meal is commonly known as Menhaden because it is made from a small herring by that name. Menhaden fish meal contains about 55 per cent crude protein. The recent development of the frozen boneless fish fillets has resulted in large accumula - tions of refuse material at the packing points. This material when processed results in. white or lean fish meal which mav run upwards of 60 per cent protein. Numerous feeding tests have demonstrated that fish meal not only- is equal to tankage as a protein supplement, but may actually excel it. Larger gains from less feed have generally resulted where fish meal has been fed. The amount of fish meal sold to Nebraska feeders at this time is negligible, altho it is being used to some extent in commercial feed mixtures. It is not amiss to point out here that fish meal made from sea fish is rich in iodine. Its use therefore, m regions where hairlessness of pigs is prevalent should serve a double. purpose, that of supplying protein and iodine. BLOOD MEAL Blood meal, another packing-house I by-product, contains up - wards of 80 per cent crude protein, is higher than that of any other feed. It is quite unpalatable, and is distinctly lower in feeding value than the other packing-house by - products. Its lack of payability, low feeding value, and high price make it a feed of little importance in hog rations Blood meal is sometimes used in feed mixtures to bolster up the protein content. It is a valuable corrective, being effective in stopping scours caused by digestive disturbances. A few nandfuls of blood meal fed to a suckling sow is usually effective in stopping scours in her litter. BONE MEAL • Bone meal from some standpoints can hardly be classed in the same category as the preceding feeds. It is a mineral supplement rich in calcium or lime and phosphates, which are essential constituents for bone formation. Two types of bone meal . are available, the steamed bone meal from which all protein has been removed by cooking </seg>
            <seg id="p025">■ A Manual for Hog Raisers and the raw bone meal. Raw bone meal contains about 48 per cent of bone phosphate of lime, while steamed bone meal contains 65 per cent. For the person desiring to purchase calcium and phosphorus, the steamed bone meal is preferable. THE DAIRY BY-PRODUCTS Whole milk is the food designed by nature for young mam - mals. , It contains all of the constituents needed for growth except possibly iron. The value of the butterfat generally precludes the use of whole milk for pig feed except under unusual circumstances. SKIMMILK Skimmilk is undoubtedly the best "farm grown" protein supplement for pig feeding. It supplies an abundance of protein of excellent quality, together with ample quantities of minerals for growth and development. Skimmilk is de - ficient in the fat-soluble vitamins and care should be exercised to secure a supply thru one of the other feeds used. The money value of skimmilk naturally varies with the price of other feeds, the price of hogs, and the amount of milk fed. It is more valuable for young pigs than for pigs in the last stages of fattening. Purebred breeders can afford to pay more for skimmilk than market hog men. An old rule, generally given, is, that for supplementing corn, 100 pounds of skimmilk is worth one-half the price of corn per bushel. This rule probably errs oh the side of conservatism. Under most conditions the man who can buy skimmilk within the limits set by this rule is undervaluing rather than overvaluing the milk. From the standpoint of providing protein, two gallons of milk are equivalent to one pound of tankage. Where the problem is to dispose of skimmilk, market hogs may be allowed all they can drink, altho unlimited skimmilk makes pigs paunchy, which is, of course, undesirable. Where the skimmilk has considerable money value, it can be fed most efficiently at the rate of one-half gallon to one gallon per head daily for pigs in dry lot. Less milk need be fed on pasture. A question frequently asked is, "Should milk be fed sweet or sour?" Souring does not materially change the feeding value of skimmilk. Milk should be fed consistently sweet or sour. There is reason to believe that sour milk is quite valu - able in controlling certain intestinal disturbances of pigs. On account of their high water content, skimmilk and butter - milk should not be diluted. The chief difficulties with milk are its perishability and bulk. The pig feeder should assure himself that the milk is </seg>
            <seg id="p026">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 from disease-free cattle or else that it has been pasteurized. Milk is an excellent medium for the growth of bacteria and may sometimes be responsible for spreading disease. BUTTERMILK Some Nebraska hog feeders are so situated that they can secure creamery buttermilk for a nominal price. Buttermilk may be considered equal in feeding value to skimmilk and interchangeable with it in the hog ration. SEM1SOLID BUTTERMILK Some creameries have attempted to preserve surplus but - termilk by condensing it. The water is evaporated and the milk condensed to about one-seventh of its volume. The re - sultant pasty substance is called condensed or semisolid buttermilk, a product containing about 13 per cent crude pro - tein. It may be kept for long periods without deterioration. It is mixed with water for feeding. A number of experiment stations, including the Nebraska Station, have conducted feeding tests to compare semisolid buttermilk with tankage as a supplement for corn. Where semisolid buttermilk comprised the sole protein supplement, it was found to be approximately one-third as valuable, pound for pound, as tankage. In pasture tests, semisolid buttermilk proved only one-fourth as valuable as tankage. Pigs receiv - ing semisolid buttermilk without exception gained more rapidly than those receiving tankage as a supplement. At the Nebraska Station several tests were carried on in which pigs were self-fed corn and tankage, and in addition a small daily allowance (.40 pound) of semisolid buttermilk was hand-fed. The rate of gain was increased over that secured with corn and tankage and a much higher return was made for the semisolid buttermilk fed. Some investigators claim that where only limited amounts of semisolid buttermilk are used its replacement value is two-thirds that of tankage. Semisolid buttermilk is an excellent feed. It is palatable and stimulates gains. For most efficiency, it should be used more as an appetizer, relying upon some cheaper soux*ce of protein to supply the major portion of that constituent. Semi - solid buttermilk is particularly desirable for young pigs. It contains considerable lactic acid, which is of value in con - trolling the kind of organisms which inhabit the digestive tract. DRIED MILK Dried buttermilk and skimmilk are among the more re - cent feeds available to hog feeders. These'f eeds may be pre - pared by various processes. Because of the demand for these </seg>
            <seg id="p027">A Manual for Hog Raisers ■ products for human use, the price has been high. Only limited amounts have been available to hog feeders. They contain about 35 per cent crude protein. The Minnesota Station has carried on several tests com - paring dried buttermilk with tankage as a supplement to corn and red dog flour. In these tests the pigs receiving the milk gained more rapidly. Dried buttermilk proved almost equal to tankage on rape pasture. ■ WHEY With the increasing, number of cheese factories in Ne - braska, it is quite likely that whey will become increasingly important as a hog feed. The Nebraska Station and other stations have shown that whey is about one-half as valuable as skimmilk as a protein supplement to corn. Whey runs so low in protein that for young animals some additional high-pro - tein feed such as tankage should be provided. 1 MILLING BY-PRODUCTS Bran and shorts are the principal by-products of Nebraska flour mills, altho in some instances other by-products may be produced. However, for practical consideration; we may limit our discussion to these feeds. BRAN Bran is so bulky, because of its crude fibre content, as to practically eliminate it from the list of feeds suitable for either fattening or rapidly growing pigs. If bran is to be used in hog rations, its place should be in the rations of pregnant and suckling sows. Bran contains considerable pro - tein and some mineral matter and is laxative in action. It should be said, however, that the mineral matter of bran is low in lime or calcium. Wherever wheat by-products make up any considerable portion of the ration, other feeds rich in minerals should be included in order that the calcium needs of the pigs may be supplied. SHORTS Inside the bran coat are several layers which are removed in milling. Immediately beneath the bran, the brown mid - dlings or shorts are secured. Brown shorts contain some of the finer bran particles which give the feed its characteristic color. The bran particles increase the fibre content and lower the feeding value of the brown shorts as compared with the gray shorts or middlings which are the more floury particles beneath' the layer of brown shorts. Large mills frequently make both white and brown shorts and in addition a low - grade, feeding flour known as red dog. Most country mills, </seg>
            <seg id="p028">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 however, do not find a sufficient demand for the various by - products, so mix them all together and sell the product as standard wheat shorts. Shorts or middlings rank among the most commonly used pig feeds. As a portion of the feed of suckling and weanling pigs, shorts are held in high esteem. Investigators are well agreed that the use of shorts to balance the corn ration is not desirable nor economical, except perhaps on good legume pas - ture. The addition of shorts to a corn-and-tankage ration results in increased gains, with a saving of both corn and tankage. On the basis of replacement value, shorts may be considered slightly less valuable than corn, pound for pound. THE OILMEALS LINSEED MEAL Linseed meal of good quality- contains approximately 30 per cent protein. It is quite palatable, rather laxative in nature, and is said to produce a glossy coat on the animals to which it is fed. As a sole protein supplement fed to pigs in dry lot, linseed meal has proved rather disappointing. Pigs receiving linseed meal have made smaller gains and required more feed per weight unit of gain than similar pigs receiving tankage as a protein supplement. On legume pasture, fed to heavier pigs, linseed meal has appeared to better advantage as a corn sup - plement. ; •; -..■.'■ Where linseed meal has been fed in conjunction with tank - age, the feed consumption and the rate of gain have been in - creased. It appears that the chief benefits of adding linseed meal to tankage have been to increase feed consumption and rate of gain, rather than to reduce the amount of feed. needed for a given gain. COTTONSEED MEAL Cottonseed meal has long been looked upon as a question - able feed for hogs. Fatalities were reported in early hog - feeding trials, which were attributed to a poisonous alkaloid, "gossypol". Recent feeding trials, however, at numerous ex - periment stations have indicated that where cottonseed meal is intelligently fed it may be used in the hog ration without bad results. The cottonseed meal here referred to is choice - grade meal, containing 41 to 43 per cent protein. Work at the North Platte (Nebraska) Substation, and other stations, indicates' that the usefulness of cottonseed meal as the sole protein supplement with corn is quite limited. Pigs fed cottonseed meal and corn do not gain so rapidly as </seg>
            <seg id="p029">A Manual for Hog Raisers similar pigs fed corn and tankage. More feed is required per unit of gain than where tankage is fed. The Texas Station recommends that cottonseed meal should not exceed 9 per cent of the ration, altho this percentage has been exceeded without bad results in Nebraska tests. Until the effect of cottonseed meal is better understood, the Texas recommendations should be followed. Nine per cent meal does not permit a pig to meet his protein requirements ade - quately ; therefore, some other high-protein supplement should be fed along with the cottonseed meal. Numerous tests at the North. Platte and the Nebraska Sta - tion have indicated that combinations of cottonseed meal and tankage are superior to straight tankage for balancing a corn ration. These combinations have proved more desirable under dry-lot conditions than on pasture. A mixture of cot - tonseed meal and tankage, equal parts, has proved as satis - factory as any combination used in the Nebraska tests. There are indications that where cottonseed meal com - prises any considerable portion of the ration, mineral de - ficiencies may be encountered. Some reports of good results from the supplying of steamed bone meal or ground lime - stone with rations containing cottonseed meal are available. Cottonseed meal is very palatable to pigs. In every case where cottonseed meal has been fed at the Nebraska Station a considerable increase in feed consumption has been noted. SOY-BEAN OILMEAL Soy-bean oilmeal is not commonly fed in Nebraska rations. It is sometimes contained in commercial supplementary mix - tures. The many tests conducted by eastern Corn Belt sta - tions indicate that soy-bean oilmeal is one of the most valu - able tankage substitutes available. Where this feed has been supplemented with ground limestone, steamed bone meal, or other lime supplements, soy-bean oilmeal has frequently proved almost equal to tankage. Soy-bean oilmeal varies somewhat in pa'atability and feeding value, depending upon the method of manufacture. Soy-bean oilmeal is more palatable and a more valuable protein supplement than ground soy beans. Ground soy beans have the further disadvantage of produqing "soft pork" when fed in considerable quantities to pigs. Soy-bean oil - meal is not open to this objection. CORN-OIL CAKE MEAL Corn-oil cake meal, or germ oilmeal as it is sometimes called, is the remainder of the corn germs after the oil has been pressed out. Since the proteins of this feed would have </seg>

            <seg id="p031">A Manual for Hog Raisers be worth the cost of 67| pounds of tankage minus the cost of 106 pounds of corn. Hay is frequently fed along with other supplements and is an effective means of reducing the consumption of the more costly purchased feeds. Alfalfa meal, if of good quality, is an excellent constituent of hog feeds. Meal made from low-grade stemmy hay is of little value for hogs. Aside from its nutritive qualities, it is frequently used as a filler in mixtures in order to prevent excessive consumption of the feed. In a rather exhaustive series of studies at the North Platte Substation it has been found that under ordinary conditions, alfalfa hay may be fed most profitably in a rack. Unless some specific purpose is contemplated such as mixing with other feed, grinding is unnecessary. Soaking and stewing fall intc the same category. PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTARY MIXTURES Perhaps the reader has been impressed in the foregoinj: discussion with the frequency of the statement that where a given supplement was combined with tankage or some other - feed, a higher feeding value was obtained. Investigators have long noticed this fact and for some years have given study to protein supplementary mixtures. Many proteins, particularly those of vegetable origin, are incomplete, that is, they lack certain essential amino acids or building stones. By bringing together proteins from dif - ferent sources there is a likelihood that deficiencies of one feed are offset by surpluses from another. As a result, mix - tures have frequently proved more efficient than single sup - plements. One of the earliest and best of the simple mixtures is the "trinity" mixture developed by the Wisconsin Station. This mixture is commonly used thruout the hog-producing section. As originally suggested, this mixture was composed of two parts tankage, one part linseed meal, and one part alfalfa meal. The Nebraska Station has proposed the modification of substituting cottonseed meal for linseed meal. Equal parts of cottonseed meal and tankage have proved very satisfactory in Nebraska tests. For other simple mixtures see Nebraska Bulletin 243, Por k Production at the North Platte Substation. In some instances very elaborate formulae have been sug - gested, many of them too complex for home mixing. Some mixtures are very palatable, probably due to the variety con - tained. It must.be admitted that the chief value of some mix - tures appears to be to stimulate the appetite and increase the rate of gain, rather than to make more efficient gains. Of </seg>
            <seg id="p032">Nebraska. Experiment Station Circular 40 . course, rapidity of gain is important when many pigs go to market weighing over 200 pounds at six months of age. Hog growers who mix their own feeds are sometimes in - clined to "cut corners" in their efforts to reduce the costs of their feed mixtures. Frequently the more valuable consti - tuents are left out, particularly if they happen to be the more costly ingredients. The home mixer, before making a sub - stitution in a feed formula, should assure himself that the feeding value of his mixture is being maintained. COMMERCIAL PIG FEEDS Within recent years, much attention has been given to the subject of commercially mixed feeds. As has been stated, practically all cereal grains are deficient in protein and the hog raiser is interested in securing his protein where he can purchase it most economically. Conditions vary so much that it is impossible to say that any one feed is more desirable than another under all conditions. So far as is known the protein supplementary feeds manufactured by reliable manu - facturers are satisfactory. Experimental work with those brands used at the Experiment Station has indicated slightlv larger gains where the mixed feeds were used than where corn and tankage were fed. With price conditions prevailing at the time the experiments were carried on, it was found that cheaper gains could be produced with corn and tankage than with the mixed feeds. There is nothing about the mixing of feeds that is beyond the capability of the intelligent feeder or farmer Manv feeders, however, feel .that they do not have the time or equipment to prepare their mixtures and, as a result are will - ing to pay commercial mixers for their services. Commercial mixers have distinct advantages over home mixers in that they can buy large quantities, taking advantage of market situations and, above all, have means of controlling "the qualitv of the by-products entering their feeds and the quality of the feed produced. The farmer, on the other hand, usually buys his by-products in small quantities, paying comparatively high prices for them, and the higher local freight charges ine tarmer has no opportunity to analyze the feeds which he uses in compounding a feed. The commercial feed mixer has many advantages m his favor so long as he does not charge a prohibitive price for mixing and merchandising It would seem that the most valuable place for mixed feeds would be in the production of purebred pigs, or for the re! 1Z6 - d ? eder who .P^uces pigs for the* early Market In these instances, maximum gains and timeliness of market- </seg>

EVALUATING FEEDS In deciding between two protein supplements, the feeder! should rely upon feeding values as determined by feeding 1 tests where such information is available. For such com - parisons some feed must be used as a standard. In this dis - cussion, tankage has been so used because of its uniformity and ready availability. The progressive hog feeder will have many occasions to refer to results of hog-feeding tests conducted at various agricultural experiment stations. Many find difficulty in in - terpreting these results and therefore the following data are presented for discussion. They represent a 110-day trial on alfalfa pasture in which Lot 1 was self -fed corn and tankage, while Lot 2 received corn only. j Lot! Lot 2 . 10 head 10 head Average daily ration, pounds per head : j '' Shelled corn i ; 4.86 3.43 Tankage ; .' .39 Average initial weight (pounds) 61.83 61.50 Average final weight (pcncnds) 209.89 i 141.58 Average gain (pounds) 148.06 | 80.08 Average daily gain (pounds) 1.35 | .73 Feed required per 100 pounds of gain: Shelled corn 361.00 471.00 Tankage '. 29.00 Financial data, such as costs and profit or loss, are in - fluenced by market conditions; hence they are likely to fluc - tuate widely. Knowing the amount of feed required to pro - duce 100 pounds of gain, a man can compute the cost for any price conditions. In the data presented, it will be noted that the consumption of .39 pound of tankage increased the daily corn consumption 1.5 pounds. In producing 100 pounds of gain, 29 pounds of tankage saved the difference between 471 and 361 pounds of corn, or 110 pounds. Twenty-nine pounds of tankage was equivalent to 110 pounds of corn or one pound of tankage was worth almost 4 pounds of corn. Whenever one pound of tankage can be purchased for less than the cost of 4 pounds of corn, gains can be produced more cheaply with corn and tankage than with corn alone. This is spoken of as the re - placement value and is of interest to everyone interested in economical production. The replacement value does not take into consideration the rapidity of gain, which may be ma- </seg>
            <seg id="p034">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 I ' terially greater with one ration than with another. In the trial cited, the pigs fed tankage weighed 210 pounds after 110 days' feeding and could have been marketed, while the pigs, receiving no tankage weighed only 142 pounds and needed further feeding. Under most conditions, the 210 - pound pig would be worth more per hundred pounds than the 142-pound pig, altho the replacement value gives tankage no credit for this advantage. Replacement values may be calculated for any experi - mental lots in which there is only one variable. One of the lots must represent the exact method of feeding contemplated. The replacement value calculated for tankage here is only applicable where pigs are fed free choice on alfalfa pasture. If the amount of tankage were limited, or if it were fed in dry lot, substantially different replacement values might be found. Where experimental tests are not available on a particular feed, the digestible nutrients may be used as an index of feeding value. Where a protein supplement is under con - sideration, the cost per pound of digestible protein may be made the basis of comparison. Such a comparison is based upon the presumption that all proteins are equal in value, which, as has been pointed out, is not true. In the case -where a grain feed or a complete ration is contemplated, the total digestible nutrients may be used as a guide to feeding value. In the case of commercial mixed feeds, digestible nutrients cannot be determined without knowing the kind and amount of the various constituents. With feeds of unknown com - position, the chemical analysis, that is, the percentage of crude protein, nitrogen-free extract, and the fat, must be re - lied upon altho this is less reliable even than the digestible nutrients. Such feeds may be compared in composition with feeds of known feeding value such as shorts, linseed meal or tankage. A FEW GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS It is not intended that the list of feeds here given be com - plete. There are many other excellent pig feeds which, in localities, may overshadow in importance those enumerated. The object is to discuss here only those feeds, which are most important under Nebraska conditions generally. Of the protein supplements, those of "animal", origin, such as milk and tankage, are considered more efficient than those more directly of vegetable origin. A study of various protein supplements indicates that those of lower protein quality are more efficient on pasture than in dry lot. Perhaps the pas - ture supplies something which is lacking in the supplement. </seg>
            <seg id="p035">A Manual for Hog Raisers It is admitted, of course, that the need for a protein supple - ment is not so great on forage, particularly on legume forage, as in dry lot because of the high-protein content of the legume. It appears that in feeding a protein supplement, the law of diminishing returns is operative. The first unit of protein is more valuable than any succeeding increment. The first ounce of protein fed to a pig is more valuable than the second, the second is more valuable than the third, and so on. Finally, if we fed a pig on nothing but protein, the last unit or ounce of protein would be no. more valuable than a similar weight of carbohydrates. Where protein supplements are fed in limited amounts, they -generally show larger returns per unit than where fed in unlimited quantities. Few feeders realize that by feeding a protein supplement they may increase the fertility of their soil, provided reason - able care is taken of the manure. Protein supplements are rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, of which 75 to 90 per cent is excreted by the animal as manure. EFFECT OF FEED UPON PORK QUALITY Numerous investigations have shown that a relation exists between the feed supplied to an animal and the quality of meat produced. It is well recognized that feeds affect the character of fat; certain feeds, notably peanuts, soy beans, and rice-polish produce soft or even oily pork. The majority of feeds used in Nebraska produce firm pork of good quality. The effect of specific feeds upon the palatability of pork is not as yet sufficiently well understood to permit generalization at this time. Investigations now under way should give more light on this subject. . i FORAGE AND PASTURE CROPS Pasture crops play an important part in modern pork pro - duction. Perhaps the most important function of pasture is the reduction in the amount of concentrated feed required to produce a given gain. Secondly might be mentioned the sav - ing of labor. Pasturing eliminates the labor of harvesting the crop and generally simplifies the labor of caring for the ani - mals pastured. As a rule, pigs on pasture are in better health due to the exercise provided and the protective accessory sub - stances, proteins and minerals, contained in the forage. With as great a range of rainfall and growing conditions as exists in Nebraska, it can readily be seen that it is difficult to make definite forage recommendations which would be applicable over the state. In fact, due to seasonal variation, recommendations for one year are not necessarily applicable the following year. </seg>

            <seg id="p037">A Manual for Hog Raisers Where adapted, the legumes are preferable to the non - legumes. They are soil improvers, more permanent, and richer in protein and mineral matter than the grasses. As a general rule, the legumes furnish a longer grazing season. The cost of seed is generally a larger item with the legumes, but considering their greater permanency, this item can be discounted to some extent. Permanent pastures have their drawbacks in that they are frequently used too long, becoming an excellent medium for the spread of disease and parasites. There is no question but that the frequent plowing of hog lots for annual crops. is an excellent "means of holding disease and parasites in check. Pigs on pasture receive more ex - posure to sunshine, which adds to their well-being. Pasture has a stimulating effect upon the milk flow of the nursing sow. • . ALFALFA ■ . Where it can be grown, alfalfa is Nebraska's outstanding forage crop. Mature hogs may be maintained on good alfalfa pasture without loss of weight. Young pigs should receive some concentrated feed on pasture. Where the pigs are merely to be gro\jlrn out for future finishing, the 2.5 per cent grain ration or 2.5 pounds of grain per 100 pounds of live weight is very satisfactory. For 50 to 60-pound pigs, this constitutes about a half ration. Under this system of limited feeding, maximum use is made of forage and concentrated feed. Limited feeding calls for a greater area of pasture, and also results. in slower gains. At Lincoln, where pigs were full fed on pasture, 20 pigs were pastured per acre. Where the 2.5 per cent grain ration was fed, only half as many pigs could be pastured per acre. One successful Nebraska hog man suggested that 500 pounds of pigs might be grazed per acre of alfalfa. This does not pasture the alfalfa to capacity and permits the regular cuttings of hay to be made. In alfalfa pasture tests at Lincoln, it appeared desirable to feed a protein supplement (tankage) to 61-pound pigs where a full feed of grain was fed. The amount of tankage con - sumed was only a fourth of a pound a day, altho the pigs had free access to it. Similar pigs in dry lot ate .6 of a pound of tankage a day; Tankage-fed pigs on alfalfa gained twice as rapidly as similar pigs fed corn only. Every pound of tank - age saved 4.5 pounds of corn. The pigs which had received tankage weighed 210 pounds after 115 days' feeding, while those receiving no tankage weighed only 140 pounds. Where no tankage was' fed, the pigs rooted the alfalfa very badly, apparently in search of something lacking in their ration. Where the pigs were fed tankage the alfalfa remained in good condition. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 At the North Platte Station similar comparisons did not show so much advantage for tankage. It is difficult to ac - count for the difference between the two groups of tests un - less the soil and climatic conditions produce differences in the nutritive value of the forage crop. CLOVER Red clover, particularly in eastern Nebraska, is commonly considered to be more or less interchangeable with alfalfa. No experiments have been conducted under Nebraska condi - tions to compare clover and alfalfa. Clover and alfalfa are so similar in composition that one may safely conclude that the two forages are practically of equal value. , . Ill 1 Fig. 12. — Banked up for early farrowing. SWEET CLOVER Several tests have been conducted with first-year sweet clover (both yellow and white) at the Nebraska Station. In these tests just as large and as economical gains have been secured as on alfalfa pasture. Sweet clover must be given an opportunity to get started in the spring and therefore pro - vides a shorter grazing season than alfalfa. The white-blossom clover comes on earlier than the yellow - blossom and makes a more woody growth. No work has been attempted with second-year sweet clover. Because of its rank growth, second-year sweet clover is not as desirable a </seg>
            <seg id="p039">A Manual for&lt; Hog Raisers hog forage as the first year's growth. Furthermore, second - year, sweet clover dies down and provides little or no forage after midsummer. See Extension Cir. 134. FALL RYE Rye seeded in the fall produces earlier spring pasture than any other forage crop. For the early litter, rye pasture is unexcelled. Under Nebraska conditions, June 1 marks the final limit of usefulness for rye pasture, for it heads out and becomes unpalatable. Heavy grazing prolongs its usefulness. When rye becomes unpalatable, it may be permitted to mature as a grain crop Or it may be plowed under and the land put into sudan grass or corn to hog down. SUDAN GRASS One of the most satisfactory of the annual pasture crops is sudan grass. It is strictly a hot-weather crop and should not be seeded until warm weather is' assured. It is available for grazing at Lincoln about the last of June and may be pastured until the latter part of September when killing frosts usually occur. It is admitted that the grazing season of sudan grass is short, but where it has had sufficient mois - ture to become established, there is perhaps no crop which has a greater carrying capacity. In several tests conducted at Lincoln, pigs on sudan grass made as large and as economical gains as pigs on alfalfa. In tests conducted at North Platte, alfalfa excelled sudan grass. In the tests at Lincoln the desirability of feeding corn and tankage on sudan grass was strikingly -demonstrated. The tankage-fed pigs averaged 210 pounds, while pigs receiving corn alone weighed only 140 pounds. When moisture conditions are favorable, sudan grass may be used to follow fall rye, thereby furnishing a succession of forage. Unless chinch bugs are a serious factor, sudan grass does well where used in this manner. Heavy grazing pro - motes abundant tender leaf growth and improves the quality of sudan grass for hog feed. In some instances, clipping must be resorted to to keep it in the best condition for pigs. OATS AND BARLEY Where rye and sudan grass are used as succession crops, an interval of a few weeks occurs when no forage is avail - able. At the Nebraska Station a plan has been followed of seeding half the hog lots to a mixture of oats and barley. This generally is available about the time the rye becomes un - . palatable and carries the pigs until the sudan grass is ready. After the usefulness of this pasture is over, it may be plowed and permitted to lie fallow until. fall rains make possible the </seg>
            <seg id="p040">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 seeding of fall rye. A two-year rotation is thus provided which furnishes a maximum of forage and permits the fre - quent stirring of the soil, a desirable hygienic practice By having half the lots in rye and the other half in oats and barley, a continuous succession of forage is produced As an alternative to the production of sUdan grass, early-matur - ing varieties of corn may be planted to hog down. BLUE GRASS No experimental work has been carried on at the Nebraska Station with blue grass pasture, altho this grass is commonly used, particularly in eastern Nebraska. Work at other sta - tions reveals that this grass is lower in value than alfalfa or clover. However, the hog feeder should bear in mind that any kind of pasture is better than no pasture at all. RAPE Dwarf Essex Rape is a popular hog forage crop in the eastern Corn Belt. In the eastern part of Nebraska, rape is used to some extent, altho it -does not enjoy as great a pop - ularity as some of the other crops discussed. The hot dry weather of midsummer frequently retards the growth of rape to the extent that it becomes unpalatable. While rape has a longer pasture season than some of the other annual pasture crops, it does not have the midsummer' carrying capacity of sudan grass or alfalfa. In northeastern Nebraska rape is sometimes planted in corn particularly where the corn is to be hogged down. SOY BEANS Soy beans are adapted to the extreme eastern counties of Nebraska where they are used to a limited extent as a forage crop for hogs. Soy beans are sometimes planted in corn to be hogged down, with the thought that the pigs are provided with a home-grown protein supplement along with the corn Under eastern Corn Belt conditions, this system is frequently productive of good -results. With the more limited rainfall of Nebraska, this practice hardly seems desirable since the growth of beans will usually reduce the yield of corn pro - portionately. It is generally recommended under Nebraska conditions to grow the beans in separate blocks from the corn, thereby giving both crops better opportunities. For hogging off, the- light-colored, early-maturing varieties of beans should be used. Pigs should be given access to the beans before they are fully ripe in order to secure the maxi - mum benefits from them. I . </seg>
            <seg id="p041">A Manual for Hog Raisers HOGGING DOWN CORN The practice of hogging down corn has received much at - tention in the last ten or fifteen years. The Nebraska Station has done very little investigational work on this problem. If we accept the evidence of the many tests conducted at other stations, hogging down corn is an economical method of fat - tening pigs. As a rule, pigs make more efficient use of corn in the field than if the same corn were husked and fed in dry lot, to say nothing of saving the labor of husking the corn. It should be said that the success of hogging down corn will depend largely upon the weight of pigs used, the season, the character of the soil, and possibly other factors. Well - grown pigs in average flesh weighing about 125 pounds ap - pear to be best adapted to hogging down corn. Fleshy pigs should never be turned in the corn field. The practice is generally more successful during seasons when the weather is reasonably dry. Rainy weather and muddy corn fields reduce returns thru loss of grain and in some cases pneumonia in the pigs. Pigs do best if they are accustomed to corn-field conditions by being turned first into a small patch of sweet or squaw corn or one of the Jearly-maturing varieties which ripen be - fore the field corn is ready. A considerable saying of feed is generally effected by turning the pigs into such a (portion of the field as they are likely to clean up in 10 to 14 days. Woven wire and steel posts offer a simple means of restrict - ing the range of the pigs. Pigs in the corn field should be observed closely. The last few bushels of corn disappear, surprisingly fast. It is not a good plan to expect pigs to clean up the corn field too closely. After the fattening hogs are removed, brood sows or stock pigs will glean any grain overlooked. by the fattening pigs. Pigs in the corn field should be regarded as being upon a full feed of corn and therefore they need some protein sup - plement. This need may be sharply reduced, however, if the pigs can be given access to an adjacent alfalfa or clover field while they are in the corn. After hogs have been fed in thej corn field, it is a good practice to full feed them in dry lot for a week or two. Very economical gains are generally made where a good ration is fed for a short time. The hogging down of small grain is regarded as an unsatis - factory practice unless it becomes a matter of salvaging a crop that has been damaged by hail or wind. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 mineral mixtures A certain amount of mineral matter is necessary for hogsT to develop and grow normally. The two minerals most needed by animals are calcium or lime and phosphorus, which are used to build up bone, muscle, nerves, and milk. Unfor - tunately, these elements are lacking in grain. Hogs are fed largely upon grain feeds and all of the cereal grains and practically all the grain by-products are deficient in ash or mineral matter. There are feeds, however, which are rich in these bone-building substances, provided the soil itself is not deficient in either lime or phosphorus. Chief among these may be mentioned the legume pastures and hays. Milk and tankage also contain ample amounts of these bone-building substances. Where hogs have access to alfalfa or clover pas - ture, or where they are being fed milk or tankage, the prob - ability is that they are receiving sufficient! mineral matter. The feeding of a good quality of leafy alfalfa hay to hogs during the winter is an excellent practice for this reason. Experiments have shown that sows fed grain and alfalfa hay farrow larger litters of larger and stronger pigs than sows fed grain alone. Where hogs are confined to a dry lot, &lt;3r where they are limited to a strictly grain ration, there may| be a need for a mineral mixture to supply mineral matter-. In supplying a mineral mixture, however, we must recognize that mineral matter in an inorganic form, such as ground limestone, is less valuable than organic mineral matter such as exists in the legumes, milk, or tankage. Too many farmers feel that a mineral mixture acts as a "tonic" to stimulate growth or fattening. This is not the case unless the lack of mineral matter is the limiting factor in the ration and hogs are actually suffering for it. Neither should a mineral mixture be regarded as a "curd-all" for all real and imagined ailments of hogs. Frequently a visit from a com - petent veterinarian will be more helpful. Where there is a deficiency of calcium and phosphorus in the ration, bone meal, which may be purchased from the packing houses, will probably come ias near meeting the needs as any other substance. Air-slacked lime, marble dust, ground limestone, or ground oyster shell may be used to correct a deficiency of lime in the ration. The United States Depart - ment of Agriculture recommends feeding a mixture made up of one bushel of wood or cob ashes, 5 pounds of salt, and 8 pounds of air-slacked lime. Another mixture which is fre - quently suggested is 40 pounds of steamed bone meal, 40 pounds of ground limestone, and 20 pounds of salt. If mix - tures such as these are kept before hogs where wind- and rain </seg>
            <seg id="p043">A Manual for Hog Raisers ; ../ cannot get at them, they will probably meet the needs of a pig for mineral matter, at least as well as many of the more costly mixtures upon the market. Much has been said concerning the value of certain mix - tures as worm expellers or worm preventives. As a matter of fact, if a mineral mixture contained enough of a drug sufficiently powerful to expel worms, it would be a dangerous and unnecessary feed to use constantly. Salt is usually found in all mixtures. While hogs do not need as much salt as some of the other "domestic animals, nevertheless a certain amount should be fed. Block salt may be conveniently fed to hogs. If hogs are unaccustomed to salt, it is dangerous to give them all the salt they will eat. There are many cases on record where too much salt has caused death. Charcoal and slack coal are not digestible and are therefore entirely without value to a .hog. Lye is very irritating to the intestines and may cause death if fed in quantities.' As a worm expeller it is worthless. Copperas or iron sulfate is often fed in a mixture as a vermifuge but as such it is useless. Sal soda and sodium bicarbonate are purgatives. Phy - sicians recognize that the constant use of a physic is a bad practice. There is no more excuse for constantly doping a hog than a man. If hogs become constipated, the ration should be corrected' by including green feed, bran, or linseed meal, or by allowing more water and more exercise. In individual cases, it may be necessary to resort to drugs, but they should not be included in a mixture to be kept before hogs at all times. Sulfur is another .of the ingredients generally found in a mineral mixture. Sulfur is not soluble nor is there any digestive juice to make it soluble in the digestive tract. Hence it is of no value in a mineral mixture. Potassium iodide is sometimes recommended to be fed in limited quantities in a mixture, since it prevents goitre or hairless pigs, a serious problem in some states. This condi - tion is not common in Nebraska so this drug need not be fed unless specific conditions warrant. Mineral matter withthe exception of salt can best be sup - plied by pasture, especially legumes, and feeds like legume hays, milk, and tankage. Where there is a possible lack of bone-building substances, the use of bone meal, crushed lime - stone, air-slacked lime, or other forms of lime may be de - sirable. ., </seg>
            <seg id="p044">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 self-feeders To none of the domestic animals is the practice of self - feeding as well adapted as to pigs. With a simple stomach of limited size, the pig eats small amounts of feed at a time but will eat frequently if given the opportunity. Where pigs are permitted access to a self-feeder some will be found eat - ing at all hours of the day and night. Summarizing a large number of tests carried on at the Ne - braska and other stations, we find that self-fed pigs consume more feed than similar pigs hand-fed the same rations. Pigs on a self-feeder make larger gains than pigs fed by hand. There appears to be some disagreement as to the economy of gain. In many cases the pigs self-fed required less feed than those fed by hand. However, there have been enough instances where the opposite was true, to demonstrate that intelligent hand-feeding is just as efficient as self-feeding. One of the chief values of the self-feeder is the saving in labor effected. This is a factor only where the self-feeder is of sufficient size to hold several days' supply of feed. The principal value of the self-feeder lies in the fattening of pigs, where it may be used in dry lot or on pasture. Where pigs are merely to be grown out, the self-feeder is not par - ticularly well adapted since self-fed pigs are inclined to fatten rather than to grow. Self-fed pigs on pasture do not make extensive or efficient use of pasture, since the self-feeder encourages the use of concentrates rather' than the maximum use of forages. Where it is desired to use the self-feeder for growing pigs, it is necessary to incorporate considerable fibre into the ration by means of alfalfa meal, bran, oats, or similar feeds. The self-feeder may be used for sucking pigs. In sonie instances it is used in a creep to which only the pigs have access, while in other instances sows and litters alike are given free access to the mixed feed after two or three weeks of working the sow up to a full feed by hand. The United States Department of Agriculture (Farmer's Bulletin 1504) reports very favorably on the self-feeding of brood sows and litters. ; . " I Two methods of using the self-feeder are available. First, there is the method of mixing a ration, combining various constituents in definite proportions. This method is used most extensively in feeding young pigs or breeding stock. By this plan the animal is forced to consume a definite percentage of protein or fibre, which is useful to prevent pigs from be - coming too fat. The more common use of the self-feeder is for the free-choice or "cafeteria" plan, whereby the carbo- </seg>
            <seg id="p045">A Manual for Hog Raisers hydrate feed is fed separately from the protein feed, the pig being permitted to take what he desires. This method is used primarily. for fattening hogs where maximum gains are the object. Where both feeds are reasonably palatable pigs show an uncanny ability to adjust the protein intake to their require - ments. ■; Thus 'with corn and tankage, pigs will consume a greater proportion of tankage in the early stages of fattening and later will reduce their tankage intake as their protein needs become reduced. For this reason pigs fed free choice generally make more efficient gains than those fed a definite percentage of tankage during the entire feeding period. There are sufficient data available to indicate that where intelligent feed adjustments are made to approximate the needs such as are set forth in the standard on page 12, hand-fed pigs will gain just as efficiently as pigs self -fed. ] Where either the grain .feed or supplement is particularly palatable or unpalatable, the pig does not adjust his protein intake to his needs. Certain mixtures, particularly those containing cottonseed meal, are exceptionally palatable and in those cases there is little doubt but that the pigs actually consume greater amounts of protein 1 than they require, there - by increasing the cost of gain. SELF-WATERING In a rather extensive series of tests at the North Platte Station, self -water ing increased the rate of gain and reduced the feed required to produce a given gain. The Minnesota Station found that self -watered pigs drank 27 per cent more water than similar pigs hand- watered. No differences were noted in either rate or economy of gain. If these results have no other significance, they should! at least force us to a realiza - tion of the importance of an abundant and regular supply of water for hogs of all kinds. GRINDING THE FEED Much attention has been directed within the past few years to the subject of grinding. Claims of larger and more eco - nomical gains are frequently, made by those who manufacture grinding equipment. The literature on this; subject is not so extensive as might be desired, yet. is of sufficient volume to permit reasonably accurate conclusions. Within the weight limits that pigs are usually fed, that is, up to 225 to 250 pounds, the grinding of corn is not advantageous. Above those weights, grinding appears to be -more justifiable. Grind - ing of the small grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye, is generally desirable. </seg>
            <seg id="p046">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 • Very finely ground feeds are less palatable than feeds coarsely ground. It is believed that where feeds are too finely ground they tend to. form a pasty mass in the mouth and as a result the consumption is reduced. Where a mixture of various feeds is to be made, it is generally necessary to grind them all to a uniform fineness in order that a uniform mix - ture may be secured. Because ground feeds become rancid they should be freshly ground. Soaking feed appears to be an unsatisfactory substitute for grinding. By slop feeding, animals may sometimes be induced to consume a little more feed. Unless some special objectis at hand, slop feeding does not pay for the additional labor required. In the past cooking was highly regarded as a method of preparing feeds. Today it is recognized that most feeds are actually lowered in feeding value by cooking, with the excep - tion of potatoes. HANDLING THE HERD SELECTION OF A BREED It is not the intent to enter into an extensive discussion here as to the relative merits of various breeds nor to.discuss the desirability of purebreds as compared with grade hogs. There is considerable evidence to indicate that greater dif - ferences exist between individuals of a breed than between breeds. This should impress upon the beginner the need of securing the best individuals within his means. The word "best" should not be construed as meaning the most expensive. As has frequently been said, the vast majority of hogs must find as their ultimate purpose, the "pork barrel". With this point in mind, most farmers should produce market hogs as their primary aim. The hog business should form a regular part of the farm business. A definite number of sows should be maintained subject only to such slight fluctuation as may seem warranted by crop or economic conditions. There is a field for a limited number of progressive and intelligent breeders to produce purebred stock for "seed" purposes. In addition to a knowledge of animal types and intelligent feeding, the purebred business requires ability in salesmanship. There is no established market for purebred breeding stock, and the producer is dependent upon his own resources and ingenuity to dispose of them above market prices. It should be emphasized that the rapid rate of reproduction makes it possible for the hog producer to purchase one regis - tered bred sow and from her offspring to establish a purebred </seg>
            <seg id="p047">A Manual for Hog Raisers herd in a short time. It would seem the part of wisdom to use nothing but purebred boars. In this way any outstanding individual might be disposed of for breeding purposes, but the great bulk of the pigs sold on the market. In selecting animals for the breeding herd, not only should conformation be taken into consideration, but also prolificacy, rate of gain, and feeding quality. Such a system of selecting breeding animals is in operation iri Denmark and Great Britain. A start in this direction has been made in the United States by means of the record-of-performance plan that is being developed by the United States Department of Agricul - ture and the experiment stations of several states. EQUIPMENT The equipment for swine production need not be expensive or extensive. Hog housing systems have been of two g'eneral types, the centralized house and the colony or portable house. For the large part, the advantages of one type are the disad - vantages of the other. The central house is convenient and impressive with a low upkeep cost. Since it is fixed in loca - tion, the immediate premises become so contaminated with parasite eggs and disease germs that the production of healthy pigs becomes almost an impossibility. Well-built centralized houses with concrete floors may be cleaned and scalded so that pigs may be farrowed there to be moved out to clean premises. However, the marked tendency at the present time is towards the use of the colony house whereby pigs are produced on pastures on which there have been no pigs for at least two previous years. For details of disease preven - tion, see Nebraska Circular 39, Swine Sanitation, by Van Es. Nebraska Extension Circular 230 describes a single mov - able house. Portable houses are economical and efficient. They may b£ increased to meet the expanding production of the small operator. Since they are movable, they are adapted to the renter. It is not to be denied that these houses are less convenient and that caring for pigs is more laborious, particularly during inclement weather. The upkeep cost on ' portable houses is greater proportionately than for a central house. .;■",'• CARE OF THE BRED SOW To a large degree the success or failure of any year's pig crop is dependent upon the treatment given the brood sow. Proper feed is one of the primary considerations. Eward, at the Iowa Station, has found that the addition of a protein supplement such as alfalfa hay or tankage to a corn ration </seg>
            <seg id="p048">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 increased the size of the litter, the average birth weight of the pigs, and also the percentage of strong pigs. The unborn litter is growing rapidly ; therefore a balanced ration is necessary for the bred sow. If the sow is immature, i.e., a gilt, the need for protein becomes doubly important, since it is needed not only for the growth of the litter but also for the growth of the gilt as well. Many hog men are prejudiced against the use of corn for breeding hogs. In Nebraska, corn is generally the cheapest source of energy for the hog ration and, where it is intelli - gently supplemented, may be used with good results. No definite rules can be given as to the amount of corn to feed to a brood sow. This will depend upon the age of the sow and the amount of flesh she. is carrying. Young sows must be fed more liberally than mature ones and sows suckled down thin require more feed than sows in good flesh. A good rule is to have the sow increasing in weight during the gestation period but not excessively fat at farrowing time. When pasture is available, bred sows should have access to it. Legume pasture like alfalfa is particularly valuable in providing protein, minerals, vitamins, and exercise for the well-being of the brood sow. During the winter season, green leafy alfalfa hay is valuable for the same reason. Alfalfa hay may be provided in a rack, or the hay may be coarsely ground or chopped in an ensilage cutter and mixed with grain and fed in a self-feeder. At the North Platte Station, satisfactory growth was secured with bred gilts on a mixture of 1,00*0 pounds of chopped alfalfa, 1,000 pounds of ground corn, 500 pounds of shorts, and 100 pounds of tankage. The alfalfa hay was cut with a silage cutter. As a general rule, it is a good plan to feed a small quantity of high-protein concentrate even where alfalfa hay is fed. Milk, tankage, or any good protein supplement may be used. From one-third to one-half of a pound of tankage may be fed daily or an equivalent amount of protein in the form of some other supplement. Equally as important as the matter of proper feeding is that of exercise. Particularly in cold weather, sows are inclined to remain close to their quarters, calling the ingenuity of the herdsman into play to force them to move about. . Some give the sows the run of a corn field after the corn has. been picked. Others feed at a distance from the sleeping quarters when weather permits. Sows that have had ample exercise during the gestation period generally have less difficulty at farrowing and produce larger, stronger pigs. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">• A Manual for Hog Raiseks THE GESTATION PERIOD The gestation period of the sow is 112 to 115 days, or, an easy way to remember it, 3 months, 3 weeks, and 3 days. Some individual variations will occur. It is better to under - estimate the gestation period in order to be certain that proper preparations are made. One hundred and twelve days, if anything, errs on the side of safety. CARE AT FARROWING TIME Three or four days prior to farrowing the sow should be isolated from the herd. She should be thoroughly scrubbed to remove the dust and dirt from the body. This dirt from the old hog lots frequently contains enough parasite eggs and disease germs to doom a goodly percentage of the unborn litter. The sow should then be placed in a pen which has been thoroughly scalded with lye water or taken to a clean portable house on ground where there have been no pigs for at least two years. The sow must be kept in these quarters. To let her go back, to the old hog lot for feed or exercise is to de - feat the precautions taken thus far. When a sow is confined to a small farrowing pen, she may become constipated, particularly if she has been accustomed to exercising freely. Therefore it is essential to restrict the amount of her ration. Laxative feeds such as alfalfa hay or meal, bran, and linseed meal are particularly helpful at this time. Too much bedding in the farrowing pen is a more common difficulty than too little. About a bushel of straw, preferably cut straw, is sufficient. When indications point to the likelihood of the sow farrowing within 24 hours, all feed should be withheld. The sow should be given ample quantities of water and in severe weather this should be warmed slightly. AT FARROWING. TIME Some feel that it is essential to attend a sow at farrowing time. Occasionally difficulties arise which can be overcome by intelligent assistance. Fortunately, in the vast majority of cases, everything goes normally if nature is permitted to run its course. Too many beginners are overly anxious to assist a sow and frequently do more harm than good. A nervous sow is often made more irritable by someone being around at farrowing time. It is always desirable, of course, to have sows gjentle and accustomed to being handled. This obviously cannot all be accomplished in a day or two prior to farrowing. The sow farrowing in a portable house can be given little if any assistance due to lack of room. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 I A guard rail around the farrowing pen is an effective means of reducing the loss of young pigs by crushing. The guard rail may be constructed of 2 x 6s or 2x 8s nailed on edge around the pen 7 or 8 inches above the floor. In extremely cold weather or with a very nervous sow it is sometimes desirable to remove pigs as farrowed, placing them in a',cloth-lined basket or box to prevent chilling until farrow - ing is completed. When it is very cold, a jug of hot water may'be placed in the box or basket to provide warmth. The newly-farrowed pig should be dried off. Breathing may; sometimes be started in a pig apparently born dead by pumping his sides with the hands. A chilled pig can fre - quently be revived by immersing him up to his nose in water as hot as can be tolerated by!the elbow. Some advocate that the navel cord of newly-farrowed pigs be tied off with com - mon i string an inch from the body and the end cut off. The remaining end may be touched with a little tincture of iodine to prevent the possibility of infection. Immediately after farrowing is a good time to clip off the needle" or "wolf teeth". Two of these teeth will be found in each corner of the mouth, making eight in all. A side - cutting jeweler's pliers is the most satisfactory instrument for this purpose. Care should be exercised not 'to break the skin of the gum, for this may provide an opening for the germs that cause bull nose or canker sore fnouth to enter. If these teeth are not removed pigs are likely to skin up eacli others noses in fighting. These abrasions may furnish an opportunity for infection. Pigs whose teeth are' not removed may worry a sow, particularly if the sow's udder is tender. Farrowing time is the best time to mark the pigs. Some record should be kept even where grade hogs are produced if gilts are to be selected from the larger and more efficient litters. Marking usually consists of notching the ears with a special tool or by taking out half circles from the edge of the ear with a harness punch. The first litter may have one notch m the right ear, the second two in the right as follows : 1- VR 5. VRVL 9 VVVR 2- VVR 6. VVRVL 10. VVVRVL 3- VL T 7. VRWL 11. VWRVVL 4. WL 8. VVRVVL 12. VVVRVVVL 50 </seg>
            <seg id="p051">A Manual for Hog Raisers Another common method is to arbitrarily assign values to notches in different positions. By adding these values to - gether a variety of numbers may be made, thus: . Litter number: L/^ 1, Base of left ear . P^. -^X- J 2. Middle of left ear 3* "^S. f r 3. Top of left ear v^ ?y J 4.

The unlimited numbers. marking system should be simple, and, particularly with purebreds, the key should also be in the hands of more than one individual. The incapacitation or accidental death of the owner has sacrificed more than one good purebred herd be - cause no one knew the identity of the individual animals. After the sow has farrowed, the pen has been cleaned, and fresh bedding supplied, the pigs should be returned to the sow for feeding. No food need be given for 24 hours after farrowing, altho the sow should be provided with an abund - ance of drinking water. On the second day a light feed of bran or shorts may be fed. Gradually the "heavier" feeds should be introduced into the ration and the ration increased in amount. The milk flow of the sow is influenced by the amount of feed consumed. The flow of milk should be stimu - lated by increasing the feed as rapidly as the pigs can handle the milk. Too rapid stimulation of the milk flow usually re - sults in indigestion in the pigs, followed by scours. Consider - able variation will be found in sows as in dairy cows, some producing milk more readily than others. The condition of , the pigs is undoubtedly the best index for feeding the sow. Provide all the feed the sow will consume without scouring the pigs. At the first appearance of scours, reduce the sow's feed and in severe cases skip a feed entirely. A few handfuls of bloodmeal fed to a sow is usually effective in stopping scours in her litter' Scours are usually caused by too much feed, spoiled feed, or a sudden change of feed. Another type of scours is due to bacteria, and correcting the ration will prove of little benefit. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 Several investigators have recently called the attention of hog men to the possibility of anemia causing serious death losses in suckling pigs. The deficiency of iron in milk is well recognized. While the young pig is entirely dependent on his mother s milk, there is a likelihood of his not getting sufficient iron.' This trouble is more likely to occur when pigs are con - fined in concrete pens. To overcome this difficulty, pigs should be encouraged to eat as soon as possible after farrow - ing. Some have suggested that a piece of sod from uncon - taminated ground will provide all necessary minerals to suck - ling pigs. In most cases, about two weeks will be required to work a sow up to a full feed after farrowing. A ration successfully used at the Nebraska Agricultural College for young pigs and brood sows as well is: Ground corn , 200 pounds Ground oats 200 pounds Shorts : 200 pounds Tankage 20 pounds Linseed meal ' 15 pounds Steamed bone meal 6 pounds SaJ t •••• . 6 pounds When pasture is not available, sows receiving this ration should be fed leafy alfalfa hay of a good green color. Many other rations may be used for brood sows. The mixture need not be so complicated as the one just given. The essential Fig. 14. — Good sows are necessary for efficient production. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">A Manual for Hog Raisers thing in the brood sow's ration should be an ample supply of protein and mineral substance in order that she may produce milk efficiently. After the sow has been established on a full feed, self-feeding may be resorted to. (See U. S. D. A. Farmer's Bulletin 1504.) ORPHAN PIGS . Occasionally the hog man will have a litter of orphan pigs on his hands as a result of the death of a sow or the failure of a sow to produce enough milk to suckle her litter. If a number of sows are bred to farrow at the same time, it is generally possible to "switch" pigs, dividing surplus pigs among the smaller litters. This practice is far more satis - factory than attempting to raise orphans by hand. Infinite patience and absolute cleanliness are necessary where orphan pigs are to be raised successfully. The Iowa Experiment Station has carried on extensive ex - periments in raising orphan pigs. They offer the following suggestions: That pigs be permitted to secure some of the colostrum or first milk if possible. That flat pans be used and .that bottles and nipples be dis - pensed with entirely. Pigs may be taught to drink with little effort. The pans can be cleaned and sterilized more readily than bottles and nipples. That young pigs be fed five or six times daily during the first few weeks, after which three times daily are sufficient. That orphans should not be overcrowded. That a quart of whole milk to each pig is most satisfactory. Where whole milk is not available, skimmilk, buttermilk, or condensed buttermilk may be used. Modifications of whole milk by adding cream or sugar proved undesirable. . That yellow shelled corn, tankage, and a salt mixture should be provided free choice. The addition of one raw egg daily for each pig proved beneficial. v CREEP FEEDING During the suckling period, pigs make the most economical gains of their lives. It is well to take advantage of this growth impulse by providing pigs with some feed in addition to the mother's milk. At about two weeks of age, pigs will begin to eat. Young pigs will take shelled corn more readily than any other feed. Where the sow and litter are not to be self-fed, additional feed may be provided in a creep. Since the milk contains ample protein, the use of a highly carbon - aceous feed like shelled corn is satisfactory. As the milk flow declines, a better balanced ration should be fed such as previously suggested for the sow, corn and tankage, or corn, shorts, and tankage. </seg>

            <seg id="p055">A Manual' for Hog Raisers Fig. 16. — Portable equipment simplifies disease prevention. At weaning time, the feed to the sow should be sharply re - duced, thus reducing milk flow. If the sows have been run - ning to self-feeders, a hurdle built around them so as to ex - clude the- sows but to admit the pigs accomplishes the same purpose. Such feeds as shelled corn or oats tend to dry up the sows. It is a better plan to' move the sows from the pigs than to move the pigs to strange quarters. The pigs are ac - customed to their lot and are less upset by weaning if no change is made. Sometimes it is necessary to return a sow to the pigs after a day in order that the udder may be milked out. If this is not done, the udder is apt to "cake" and a portion be lost. Weaning time is a critical time for a pig and therefore no radical changes in feeding should be made at this time. • . VACCINATION Hog cholera is one of the principal causes of loss to Ne - braska hog men. Hog lot sanitation is of no avail in con - trolling this disease, vaccination being the only preventive. A complete disqussion of this disease will be found in Ne - braska Extension Circular 223 or U. S. D. A. Farmers' Bul - letin 834. FEEDING AFTER WEANING After weaning time two methods of feeding are open to the producer. First, he may full feed or self -feed, hurrying the pigs to an early market ; or second, he may grow them out on pasture with a light feed of grain with the expectation of fattening later upon new corn, hogging down corn, or putting them in the feed lot behind cattle. It is well recognized that hogs are marketed seasonally. Most pigs are farrowed in the spring, grown on grass, fattened in the fall, and are marketed the following winter. Market receipts of hogs de - i </seg>
            <seg id="p056">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 cline until April first when the marketing of fall pigs in - creases receipts again until June first. Summer receipts are the lightest of the entire year. For the most part, the price curve is the opposite of the receipt curve. In other words, when hogs are plentiful, prices are low and vice versa. For a more complete discussion of hog prices see Nebraska Bul - letin 208, Hog Prices, by H. C. Filley. The marketing of hogs at certain seasons is due to definite seasonal crop production. Whenever production is carried on at other seasons than the normal, greater costs are en - countered. The normal time for reproduction of hogs doubt- Fig. 17. — The self-feeder shortens the road to market. less is the late spring season. Whenever it is moved up to the early spring months, greater mortality may be expected. Where pigs are full fed' for the early fall. market, which, in - cidentally, has been the highest market of the year, the feed for those pigs must have. been carried over from the pre - ceding crop season. As a result of storage expenses, shrink - age, and interest, the cost of this feed is normally higher than it would have been the preceding fall and winter. Where the practice of full feeding is followed, it is to be ex - pected that production costs will run higher. Where pigs are full fed, they cannot utilize pasture as efficiently as pigs which are carried on a lower grain allow - ance. Pigs that are getting only a limited amount of grain will eat more grass, and since pasture is ordinarily a low - priced feed, cheaper gains can be expected where this practice of feeding is followed. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that thrifty pigs in - telligently fed will weigh in excess of 200 pounds at six months of age. This means that early spring pigs full fed from birth should reach market soon after September first, </seg>
            <seg id="p057">A Manual for Hog Raisers and basing our opinion upon the past, this market is gen - erally the high market of the year. It should be said, how - ever, that many hog men are taking advantage of this situa^ tion and as a result the increased number of early-marketed pigs is having the effect of reducing the price and lowering the returns from this method of production. It is obvious that it would not be so desirable to full feed late pigs for the reason that they would compete with pigs produced on a limited grain ration and therefore lower production cost. .1 Pigs fed a light feed of grain during the summer season can be produced for a lower price than full fed pigs. They use pasture more efficiently. They are in a position to make efficient gains on cheap new corn in the fall. Of course, it is true that they generally sell for lower prices in the late fall or early winter. Full feeding does have the advantage of quick turnover, thereby effectively reducing risk and interest charges. Pull feeding enables one to dispose of his spring pig crop in time to make available the equipment and full attention of the operator for fall pig production. FULL. FEEDING Where full feeding is to be practiced it is evident that a liberal allowance of a well-balanced, highly palatable ration must be fed. Self-feeding j is generally to be recommended, practically speaking, from birth. Corn in most cases should form the major portion of the ration, altho in its place such feeds as ground barley might be used. Only a limited amount of bulky feeds such as oats should be used, possibly not over 25 per cent of the grain ration. The use of a high-protein supplement of some sort isj absolutely necessary to the rapid gains which are essential for early marketing. Milk, tank - age, or a mixture of high-protein feeds may be confidently expected to make good returns. Protein supplementary mix - tures will not show up as advantageously on pasture as in dry lot. Palatable forage crops occupy an exceedingly im - portant place in rushing thG full-fed pig to market. GROWING PIGS Pasture and forage crops, must play a leading part in pro - ducing the cheap gains generally expected with limited rations. It is not advisable; to restrict the ration of the pig until well after the weaning period. After the pigs are weaned, a limited grain ration may be fed. Some feel that no grain at all should be fed on pasture during the growing period. Extensive tests at the Nebraska Station have indi - cated that some grain is essential for satisfactory growth on pasture. A 2.5 per cent grain ration, that is, 2.5 pounds of </seg>

FATTENING HOGS For fattening, the self-feeder assumes an important place. Coin again holds the center of the stage as the principal feed, altho under certain price conditions the corn may be replaced with ground barley or ground wheat. Ground rye or hominy feed may be partially substituted for eorn. Dry-lot feeding makes the use of a protein supplement imperative. Even for pasture feeding a protein supplement is justified from the standpoint of increased gains and efficient production Under dry-lot conditions, the protein mixturea have shown up to best advantage, particularly from the standpoint of increas - ing the rate of gain. When pasture is not available, it is desirable to supply alfalfa hay in a rack. DEVELOPING BREEDING HOGS Pigs to be used for breeding purposes should be carried on a reasonably high plane of nutrition. Forage and balanced rations are important. The more extensive use of such bulky feeds as oats and shorts is desirable. , Where pigs are of the big type, no serious objections can attach to the practice of permitting the gilts to run with the fattening hogs until they weigh 200 or 225 pounds! Gilts of the big type generally do not become too fat even where self - fed to those weights. ONE OR TWO LITTERS? Probably not more than one-fourth to one-fifth as many fall pigs are produced as spring pigs. It is true that fall pies are produced at a season when conditions for growth are less favorable. Fall frgs do not have the abundant forage avail - able for spring pigs The weather is inclement. On the other hand feed is generally more plentiful and lower in price dur - viV™ T. er . m ° nths hen fal1 P J es are being produced. Farm work is less pressing, and therefore the unfavorable weather may be largely offset by the farmer's giving his pigs better care than he can ordinarily give spring pigs. Perhaps the deciding factor is the fact that fall pigs generally bring a higher average price than spring pigs, for they reach market during a season of fairly limited hog marketing. </seg>
            <seg id="p059">A Manual for Hog Raisers . Work at the Minnesota Experiment Station agrees with the results at the Nebraska Station (Bulletin 243) that fall pigs are just as efficient in the utilization of their feed as spring pigs. Because of the lower price of grain feeds during the winter' season, the gains are frequently lower in cost for the fall pigs. The mortality of fall pigs averages higher than for spring pigs. More equipment is necessary for the pro - duction of fall pigs. If two- litters of pigs are to be raised per year, the major part. of the herd must be made up of mature sows, or fall gilts must be held over. It; is asking too much to expect a yearling sow to produce two litters. Producing two litters a year from a mature sow reduces the birth cost of each pig, that is, for the same investment the production is twice as great. The saving, in fact, is not so great as it appears, for a sow producing two litters a year must be fed more liberally than when only one is produced. Where two litters are pro - duced, spring litters must be farrowed a little earlier and fall pigs a little later than may appear to be desirable, and it is necessary to wean pigs younger. GILTS VS. MATURE SOWS No experiment station hss carried on any more extensive tests comparing mature sows with gilts than the North Platte Substation. By averaging four years' work in which approx - imately 20 gilts were compared annually with an equal num - ber of sows, the following conclusions were reached. Mature sows require less feed during the winter but more after farrowing than gilts. For this reason, the cost of wintering a mature sow is jless than that of a gilt. Over a four-year average, the old pows farrowed about three more pigs per sow than gilts and raised a slightly larger number (6.55 as compared with 6.2)'. The pigs farrowed by old sows weighed more at birth (214 pounds against 2.31 pounds). Those produced by mature jsows gained more rapidly, reach - ing the 50-pound average weight in 89 days as compared with 99 days for the pigs produced by gilts. The gilt, of course, grew in size and therefore increased in value while producing a litter and this was sufficient to offset the greater efficiency of the mature sow as a mother. As a result, the pigs from the gilts averaged slightly lower in cost at 50-pound average weight than pigs produced by old sows. The greater pro - lificacy of mature sows can probably be explained because they represent a selected group, the sows which were poor mothers having previously been culled out. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">Nebraska Experiment Station Circular 40 AGE TO BREED Gilts are generally bred at about eight months of age, which means that they will farrow at about one year of age. It has been commonly believed that early breeding stunts an animal, but recent work at the Missouri Station indicates that lactation rather than reproduction retards growth. It is not to be denied that the gilts, to be suitable for breeding at eight months, must have been liberally fed and that this feed - ing policy must be continued after breeding. The practice of "flushing" sows two weeks prior to breed - ing is considered a good one. A fresh succulent pasture and liberal feeding generally assure large litters. The sow should be gaining in weight at breeding time. THE HERD BOAR Too frequently the herd boar is looked upon as a necessary evil. We have the old statement that the sire is half the herd, altho as a usual thing he does not receive his propor - tionate share of attention. He is often confined in a small pen or dark stall and fed in anything but an intelligent man - ner. No male meat-producing animal has the potential power of siring as many pounds of meat in the course of a year as a herd boar. To a large extent,- the success or failure of the year's operations depends upon him. The boar, particularly if a young one, needs an abundant supply of protein and mineral matter in his ration. He should have green feed, sunshine, and exercise. If he be - comes restless, a barrow or a bred sow placed in his pen is an effective means of quieting him. Confining the boar and limiting breeding to single services are to be recommended where this practice can be followed. A young boar should not be used more than once daily, altho mature boars are sometimes used twice a day. THE WEIGHT AT MARKETING 8 The market has expressed in no uncertain terms its pref - erence for the. pig weighing 185 to 225 pounds. A study of hog prices generally indicates that a pig actually depreciates in value after reaching 250 pounds in weight. The market demand for the lighter- weight pigs has been brought about by consumer preference for small pork cuts and also by the unfavorable price situation of lard. Pork producers have an effective means of reducing or expanding pork production by the lowering or increasing of the average weight of hogs marketed. Increases in live weight beyond a . certain point represent increases in the production of lard rather than of meat. </seg>
            <seg id="p061">61 A Manual for Hog Raisers A study of experimental feeding tests shows that young pigs require less feed per weight unit of gain than older ones. Henry and Morrison in "Feeds and Feeding" by a very ex - tensive compilation of experimental data show that the aver - age daily gain of pigs increases up to 300 pounds, after which it declines. However, careful study reveals that the gains of lighter pigs are actually larger in proportion to their live weight than those of the heavy pigs. With the market frequently penalizing pigs weighing over 250 pounds and with numerous feeding tests indicating that gains become smaller and more costly, it would seem desirable to market pigs at weights below 250 pounds under most con - ditions. Frequently it is a problem of marketing corn. The points made are admitted, Vet the marketing of corn thru the pig is sufficiently profitable that the feeder prefers that channel rather than selling it on the market. Hog-marketing figures indicate that when corn is cheap in price, the average weight of hogs marketed is greater than when the opposite conditions prevail. MEASURING FEEDS The average feeder relies upon measurements rather than weight in estimating rations.
