            <seg id="p007">PART I GENERAL REVIEW ORGANIZATION The Nebraska State Railway Commission is at present organised as follows: Henry T. Clarke, Jr., Chairman; Thomas L. Hall and H. G. Taylor, Commissioners; A. B. Allen, Secretary; U. G. Powell, rate expert and accountant; O. D. Boyer, assistant rate clerk; W. L. Gregory and C. W. Spears, clerks; Violet M. Martin, filing clerk and stenogra - pher; Delpha M. Taylor, assistant reporter and stenographer; Mary E. Sheehan, recording clerk and stenographer; Emma J. Hedges, re - porter; Jennie M. Hitchcock, typist; Leanor Statler, comptometer operator; C. A. Ross, tariff clerk. The Commission frequently finds it necessary to make special studies and investigations of pending cases, and at such times additional help is often required. Such extra help is employed as occasion demands. The personnel of the engineering department, having charge of matters pertaining to physical valuation and "Blue Sky" applications, is as follows: B. E. Forbes, chief engineer; Guy Barnes, assistant engineer; Emma A. Todd, stenographer. LEGISLATION OP 1915 BEARING UPON THE WORK OF THE RAILWAY COMMISSION The legislature of 1915 passed a number of laws adding to the duties of the Commission, brief mention of the more important of which follows: Senate File No. 192. — Relieves from necessity of making annual repo r t to the Commission all rural telephone companies not operating Switchboards and Farmers Mutual companies with a capitalization of $5,000 or less. Senate File No. 65 — Provides for the regulation of the construc - tion, operation and maintenance of electric transmission, telephone and telegraph lines in this state and fixes penalties for the violation of the regulations as adopted. The law recites that all lines of the character mentioned, which are constructed for the transmission of electric current, including telephone and telegraph lines, on the public highways or any other places in the state, with Stated excep - tions, shall provide sufficient clearance between such lines and lines already in existence, so that the reasonable safety, operation and ef - ficiency of existing lines shall not be interfered with. In all cases where the voltage of proposed lines exceeds 700 volts application must </seg>

In the event that applicant files wit the Commission agreements with all adverse parties, covering metho and plan of construction, the law provides that tile Commission ma issue necessary permit without the formality of a hearing. 1 pn visions of the act do not apply to any line or lines which it posed to construct within the limits of an&gt; incorporated city c metropolitan, first or second class A number of applications have been filed with ttu- Coiutt under this act and have received due consideration.

These warehou h mission commensurate with the amount of crair storage, increasing such bonds from time to time in harmony wit Increasing amount and value of stored grata. It is probable that Ing the coming &gt;ear many mop levator the privileges provided by the law and will take out It is Lelieved that the law is of marked benefit of grain who do not wish to sell on current market and who * hold for an anticipated advance, paying in the meanwhile a n&lt; price for storing privilege. However, much better results wo secured if provision were made for state inspection of grain wl facilities for official grading, dockage and shrinkage. To effectually carry out the suggestion would necessitate a considerable force of in spectors, and an appropriation equal to the increased expense. Western Freight and Passenger Advance Rate Cases Among the more important matters which have occupied the at tention of the Commission during the past year should he mentione* the Western Freight and Passenger Advance Rate Cases. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 9 The freight case was predicated on the action of carriers operating in Western Trunk Line and Trans-Missouri territory in filing with e Interstate Commerce Commission schedules of rates providing for he movement of various commodities. The pro- am d especially to coke and coal from Illinois points ain products from the Twin Cities and Missouri Chicago, to live stock from all points In Minnesota, Iowa Missouri. Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, south Dakota and North Dakota to points on ana east of the Mississippi river, to packing house (1 fresh meat from St. Paul, Minneapolis. Missouri river points in Oklahoma and Texas to Mississippi river and hroom corn from all points west of Missouri river to points ■otton piece goods from stations on and east of Mississippi 1'dints west, and to fruit and vegetables from southwestern to Chicago. ng the rules of procedure before the Interstate Commerce nl&gt;- necessary for carriers to file their proposed hi tariffs, to become effective on a specified date. If no filed, the tariff changes become effective on the date i without the formality of a hearing or the entering of a set In the case at point, the Railroad Commissions of the various ffected, Nebraska included, immediately filed with the Inter- Commerce Commission vigorous protests against the proposed in - ps as filed by carriers. Accordingly the Interstate Commerce nission suspended the date on which the increases were to be- ective and pave notice that all parties interested would be pie opportunity to present their evidence and arguments both inst the granting of permission to put the proposed rates The case was named I. &amp; S. Docket No. 555. On March he case came on for "hearing at Chicago before Commissioner Daniels and Special Examiner Watkins. Preliminary to the hearing the Nebraska Commission, in conjunction with Commissions of other ates affected, had done an immense amount of work in connection with the analysis of the carriers' contentions, the investigation of the i for the proposed increase and the setting up of statistical tables ng upon practically every phase of the subject in hand. This -eliminary work had occupied a number of months and had been cod acted at an expense of many thousands of Qollars. The hearing, previously mentioned as beginning March 4. 1915, continued for a number of weeks. All the railroads were represented by their best legal talent and the resisting states were represented by their various Commissions and rate experts. The Nebraska Commission had a very important part in the work and without disparaging the ef - forts of others it is only fair to state that no Commission put up a stronger defense against the proposed rates or offered more pertinent evidence, either in quality or quantity, than did this body. The case </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT was finally decided on July 30, 1915, and the decision was a substantial victory for the states. Nearly every point contended for was won and in only a few minor particulars were the railroads granted any increases whatever. Many of the exhibits as prepared by this Commission's rate expert, Mr. U. G. Powell, were included in the decision and were made the basis of the ultimate conclusion denying the carriers' petition. It is perhaps needless to add that the winning of this case was most important from the standpoint of Nebraska shippers. Only a few months ago the carriers were successful in securing an advance of numerous freight rates in eastern territory. The success of the eastern roads undoubtedly influenced the carriers in Western Trunk Line and Trans-Missouri territory to make a similar effort and the fact that that effort was checkmated by western Commissions is a circumstance worthy of note. It is estimated that if carriers has been successful in advancing western rates in accordance with schedules filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, such advance would have amounted to an approximate additional freight burden of $18, - 000,000 per year to the states affected, of which additional burden Nebraska's annual share would have been about $3,000,000. The expense of conducting the defense, which expense was shared by the several Commissions, was in round numbers $66,00", Nebraska paying about $17,000 as its proportionate share. A part of this ex - pense money was provided by a special appropriation of $3,(hmi made by the 1915 legislature, a part was paid from the Attorney General's fund "for prosecution in state eases," and the remainder was paid from the Commission's general maintenance fund The Western Passenger Advance Rate Case was the r« the action of carriers in Western Trunk Line and Trans-Misso X&gt;'T ritory seeking to increase their passenger rates on interstate business from two cents to three cents per mile in territory south of the Mis souri river and the Union Pacific main line from Kansas City to the Colorado state line, and from 2 cents to 2 hi cents per mile in territory north of the line above described. The case was docketed as I. &amp; S. Docket No. 600 and a bearing was held in Chicago before Special Ex - aminer Thurtell of the Interstate Commerce Commission beginning July 30, 1915. As in the freight rate case, this Commission had a very im - portant part in the defense of the passenger rate case and devoted much time and money in research work, in preparation for defense and in presenting evidence and argument at the time of hearing, which hear - ing extended over a number of weeks. A decision had not been reached in this case at the end of the fiscal year for which this report is made, namely, November 30, 1915. FREIGHT CLASSIFICATION The Commission holds hearings from time to time, usually two each year, for the purpose of considering applications for correction </seg>
            <seg id="p011">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 11 and readjustment of Nebraska Classification. These bearings are necessary in order tnat the Classification may be kept up to date and serviceable for the convenience of shippers and carriers. PHYSICAL VALUATION The annual report of the Commission's physical valuation and engineering department will be found in this volume under Part VI. The department is in charge of Chief Engineer B. E. Forbes. Dur - ing the past year the principal work has been In connection with ap - plications before the Commission which necessitated field work in the matter of securing needed estimates of costs of various utilities seek - ing to modify their rates or to issue additional securities. The val - uation of the properties of the various carriers made in 1909 has been corrected in harmony with new construction and extensions, it being the intention to keep the Commission's records covering such valua - tion complete from year to year. CASES BEFORE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION I. £ S. Docket No. 443, bringing in question the rates on carload shipments of live poultry from Western Trunk Line territory to Central Freight Association and Atlantic Seaboard territory, was submitted to the Commission last year. Since that time an opinion has been handed down, wherein the Interstate Commerce Commission found that the carriers had justified the third class rate on carload shipments of poultry. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket 6988, which was re - ported in last year's report, brought in question the rates on apples, carloads, from stations in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska to points in Central Freight Association territory. The case was briefed and submitted to the Commission in January, 1916. As yet no opinion has been handed down in this case. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket 6989 brought in ques - tion the reasonableness of carload rates on shipments of apples from points in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska to points in Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. This case was briefed and submitted to the Commission in January, 1915, and as yet no opinion has been handed down. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket 6987 brought In review before the Interstate Commission the reasonableness of the rates on carload shipment.; of apples from points in Kansas, Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska to points in the southeast. This case was briefed and submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission in January, 1915, and no opinion has been handed down. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT Interstate Commerce Commission Docket 7117 brought in ques- tion the reasonableness of the rates on carload shipments of live stock from stations on the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad Company's line, Holdre to Holyoke, when shipped to St. Joseph, Missouri. This case was briefed and submitted to the Commission in April, 191"5, and in Junt an opinion was handed down, wherein tue Commission found that th« rate adjustment as between Omaha and St. Joseph on shipments of stock from the above mentioned territory was not unreasonable. Interstate Commerce Commission Dockets 7311, on behal the Sioux City Commercial Club, 7352, on behalf »{ the St. Joseph Commercial club, 7447, on behalf of the Atchison Commercial Club 7461, on behalf of the Council Bluffs Commercial club, and behalf of the Chamber of Commerce of Kansas City, were against the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company. Chi Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company. Union Pacific Railroad Company. St. Jo &amp;. Grand Island Railway Company and Missouri Pacific Railway ( the reasonableness of the rate adjustment on carload shipments of wheat and corn from Union Pacific stations in Nebraska to St. Joseph and Kansas City, Missouri, as compared with nearby stations located on the C. B. &amp; Q. railroad to the same points of destination. This case was submitted to the Commission on briets in June, 1915. In August an opinion was handed down, wherein the Interstate Com - mission found that the complainants had not established the unreason - ableness of the rates established by the carriers on the above mentioned commodities to the points of destination. I. &amp; S. Docket No. 555 is a case wherein the Nebraska State Railway Commission appears as protestant against the rates proposed to be increased by forty-one railroad companies operating in the central western part of the United States, in connection with some six - teen other state railway or public utility commissions. Hearings in the above mentioned case commenced March 4, 1915, and continued pan} , charging that the rates aataMlafced by the Nebraska State I lei way Commission in its (leneral Order No. 19 caused discriniini between jobbing points in Nebraska and those cities repres ntec the complainants in the rases above mentioned. The Nebraska I Railway Commission appeared as interwnor and friend of the c in the above mentioned cases. Numerous hearings were had thro out the year. The Nebraska Commission appeared before Special aminer Dow in June, 1915, and presented for the information of federal Cc.umission all, or a large portion, of the data suhniitte the Nebraska Commission at the time the question of class rates before it for consideration. The matter was briefed and submitte the Interstate Commerce Commission on October 26, 1915. As no opinion has been handed down in the above mentioned c. Interstate Commerce Commission Docket 72;;u brought in re </seg>
            <seg id="p013">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 13 uninterruptedly until May 17. 1915. The case was briefed and sub - mitted to the Interstate Commission in August, 1915, and on Septem- ber 30th an opinion was handed down by the federal Commission in which they found that the carriers had not sustained the burden plated upon them t&gt;y the law in their seeking to advance the rates on carload shipments of grain, grain products, live stock, and packing house products, but did find that they had sustained the burden on shipments of coal from Illinois mines to points in Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota, and on carload shipments of vegetables from southeast- points to Central Freight Association territory, and on shipments otton piece goods from southeastern territory to Western Trunk Line and Trans-Missouri territory. The carriers asked for a rehearing in this case in October as to all of the commodities originally men- i in the suspended tariffs. The Interstate Commerce Commission ed a rehearing on all of the commodities except as to live stock king house products. The rates on the above mentioned com - 3 are now under consideration by the Interstate Commerce mission I. &amp; S. Dotket No. 600 is a case wherein the Nebraska Commission, g jointly with some sixteen other state railway or public utility nissions, joined in filing protest against the increase in passenger &gt; filed by some fort\-six railroad companies operating in the ter - y west of the Missouri river to the Rocky Mountains and between of Mexico and Canada, wherein the carriers sought to advance nuer fares ironi two cents to three cents in the territory lying ith of the Missouri river, St. Joseph to Kansas City, and the line the fnion Pacific, Kansas City to the Colorado state line. In all ritory lying north of the above-mentioned line the carriers increase tae rates from two cents to two and one-half cents per passenger mile. Hearings commenced July 6, 1915, and continued until the second week in August. Briefs were filed and the case was submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission October 7, 1915. At the time of making this report no opinion has been handed down. OTHKK LITIGATION Other cases in which the Commission is concerned, and which are pending in various courts, are as follows: O. A.

            <seg id="p096">96 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT opinion in Application No. 1799, it does not appear necessary to repeat what was said then or amplify the reasons therein presented. It is in - teresting to note in this connection, however, that since the preparation of the opinion in that case the Supreme Court of the United States has again spoken (Wyandotte County Gas Company vs. State of Kansas, on Relation of John Marshall. Attorney for the Public Utilities Com - mission of the State of Kansas, 231 U. S. 625), sustaining the con - clusion that a rate fixed by city ordinance is not a contract that can - not be annulled or modified by the state itself, except where the muni - cipality has been empowered in specific terms to make a contract. The real issue to be determined, therefore, is as to whether the revenue earned by the company in the past has been sufficient to pay the operating expenses, maintain the property and provide a reasonable return upon the money invested, and if not, to determine whether the increase granted is more than is required for the purpose. The prop - erty of defendant consists of exchanges at Osceola and Stromsburg with farm lines covering practically all of Polk county. While the company has a number of subscribers in the town of Polk and there are several farm lines radiating from that point, it does not own a switchboard there, but pays the Bradsbaw Telephone Company for per forming switching service. There are at the present tim&lt; amount of stock outstanding and the manner in which the proceeds from its sale have been expended. It has been possible, therefore, to arrive at a very close approximation of the amount of money that has actually been required to produce the property that is now devoted to the public use. The construction of the plant was first started by the Golden Rod Telephone Company in 19U3, but the portion that had been completed by Ma\, 1904, was pur - chased by Messrs, E. E. Stanton. O. E. Mickey, H. D. Skelton and A. F. Nuquist, who, on June 28, 19"4, organized the Polk County Telephone Company. While the bill of sale conveying the property from the Golden Rod Telephone Company to the four gentlemen above named states that the consideration was $16,000, it is clear that that was not the price paid. While there is some controversy as to what the actual scribers on the system. K-ri Valuation In view of the fact that there is no serious disagreement be tween complainant and the Commission's accountant, Mr. Powell, wit] reference to the actual amount of money that has beeu invested in thi property, it does not seem necessary to enter into an exhaustive analy sis of the history of the company.

The exact number of subscribers' stations in service ■ time of the purchase is not revealed by the books, but on June &gt;4, there ttcic 276. On the basis of that number the value per union would have been a trifle over $47.00, which is under the verage for plants of that character. As a matter of fact, the record flicates that the investment of the Golden Rod Company may have • ii i onsiderably more than $13,000, and that the purchasers secured ho property at a very reasonable figure. The amount of stock out- tanding on June 30, 1913, the date to which this investigation has icen brought, was $74,625.00. According to the report of Mr. Powell, Inch is substantiated by the testimony, all of this represents actual ish investment, with the exception of $1,000 which was issued to the jur original incorporators in payment for services rendered in the roinotioii of the companj. As no salaries were paid during the first ear by the new company, and as a considerable portion of the time the four men to whom the stock was issued was devoted to the motion, construction and operation of the plant during that period. asonable to assume that the services thus performed were fully north the amount allowed. Stock to the amount of $4,683.18 was issued in lieu of cash dividends during the period from October, 1904, o June, 1905. but the money which it represents was actually used in he construction of the plant, so that it is proper to recognize it as a &gt;art of the investment, provided due allowance is made for it when nsidoration is Riven to the amount of dividends received by the ttickholders during the life of the company. The question of these lividends will be considered later. To the outstanding stock of $74,625 hould be added $1,500 of borrowed money, which obligation was in - ■urre'1 at the time of the purchase of the property of the Lincoln Tele - &gt;hone &amp; Telegraph Company, and which must, of course, later be uidated from the proceeds of the sale of stock. The sum of these terns, $76.1 25. includes nothing for working capital. The Commission las previously found five per cent of the capital obligations to be a reas - inable allowance for this purpose and does not regard that amount as pxcessive in this rase. Maintenance and reconstruction work in a plant of this size require the keeping on hand of from $1,000 to $1,500 worth of material, while the bills receivable and the current expendi- tures incident to the conduct of the business demand the carrying of a fund of ready cash. Adopting round figures, the allowance then for this purpose is $3,800, which, added to the capital obligations, gives the figure of $79,925. This the Commission believes to be the measure of the sacrifice made by the stockholders to produce the present prop - erty now in use. That the conclusion embodied in this figure is reas - onable and fair to all parties at interest is manifest.

C. A. Prouty. tor of the Division of Valuation, emphasized the difficulties at - nu the ascertainment of "original cost to date." and declared his ction that "the work we have done upon original cost to date in [(■counting department is a practical nullity." The discussion is ■ly too long for incorporation in this opinion, but the following pts run be said to fairly summarise it: •The statute requires us to show original cost to date with pect to each item of property None of us knew exactly what that meant, but it seemed at the outset that we would select cer - tain railroads and do as best we could that which the act required We haw selected a single road in each engineering district for valuation, and our accountants took the same road for account - ing purpose* Well, we had not proceeded a great while before I made up my mind that we were squandering a great deal of money, and our accountants were instructed to discontinue a cer - tain part of this original cost to date work in every place but two The Texas Midland road. II] miles long, was one of the roads which had been selected. The New Orleans, Texas &amp; Mexico road. 17", miles long, was another road which had been selected in the central district and we concluded, in the case of those two little roads, to carry the thing through to a conclusion and see exactly where we landed, and exactly what it cost us. Cntil very recently I had never known what the definition of the California Commis - sion of original cost to date was, but I had, rather against my own first impression, reached a conclusion exactly in accordance with that definition as I understand it. If we could go back to the beginning and rewrite the books of account of a railroad company according to the rules of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the </seg>
            <seg id="p100">100 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT property account — the investment account — as shown by that oper - ation, would be, 1 think, original cost to date, and that was pre - cisely what we attempted to do in the case of these two railroads. We went back to the beginning, and we endeavored to rewrite the accounts of that company and to show what a correct investment account would be to date, to take out of that account everything which had improperly gone into it, and to put into that account everything which had been improperly left out. Now, you see that that is a tremendous undertaking. It is a tremendous under - taking with respect to a little railroad like the Texas Midland. You have got to handle every item. You have to examine it, analyze it and assign it. That was done, with the conclusion that when your investment account had been rewritten it was good for nothing. In the first place it is absolutely impossible today, as the books of account of the railroads in this country have been kept, to correct errors which may have been made in the original dis - tribution of those items. Take a voucher for a pay roll and a voucher for supplies. Here is a bill for timber. You cannot pass upon the question whether it was used for an addition and a betterment of that property, or whether it was used for a renewal which should properly be charged to operation. But worse than that, there is no way in which you can tell what retirement has been made, and what retirement should therefore be taken out of that investment account. So that we felt that the investment account when rewritten was not much better than it was before we attacked it, and it is my own feeling that if you were to treat the books of every carrier in the country in that wa&gt; . while you might detect and would detect many instances of mistakes, the general result would add very little to the knowledge which you now have, and it might be a source of misinformation rather than of more accurate information. It is the duty of this Commission under this act w inal cost to date. Now if you can show it from the books of th* - company, show it in that way. If you cannot show it from the books of the company, show what you can from the books and estimate the balance. • • My own conviction is that all this work Involved on the Texas Midland as to the original cost to date is absolutely thrown away. ♦ ♦ The expenditure in connection with doing that cost to date work has been something frightful. W« have only worked this out on two short lines. The Texas Midland is a road 112 miles long. Its books began 21 years ago. It cost $133 a mile to do the accounting work on the Texas Midland. The New Orleans, Texas &amp; Mexico road is 175 miles long. Its books go back only ten years. It cost us $90 a mile to do the work on that road. If you were to apply these same figures to all the railroads In the United States, it would cost somewhere from $50. - 000,000 to $100,000,000 to do this accounting work." The obstacles confronting the national valuation body are common to every piece of valuation work. Facts, of course, should always be used where they are available and they are to be preferred above theory or speculation. In the instant case enough facts are ascertainable to make it possible to reach a reasonably accurate approximation of the Investment in the property, and they are used in preference to the physical valuation for that reason. A rigid adherence to the "original cost" or "cost of construction" theory Involves the recognition of expenditures that might otherwise </seg>
            <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 101 be disallowed. In building the plant of a public utility it is sometimes impossible to foresee all the conditions that may have to be met, and expenditures are incurred that subsequently form the basis for serious controversy when considered in connection with the valuation of the property. Mr. Prouty, in an address delivered at Washington before the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America on February 1914, offers an illustration in point, which is as follows: "The first railroad the Commission is proceeding to survey in what is known as the Pacific District is the San Pedro, Los An - geles &amp; Salt Lake, extending from San Pedro, California, to Salt Lake City, Utah, some eight hundred miles. Most of this road has been built in comparatively recent times, and the circumstances and cost of construction are fairly well known. The course of the road is for the most part through an arid desert. A certain section of it, when built, was located where no man thought it ever could be disturbed by floods, yet shortly after it was opened for operation the floods came and carried out this portion. It was at once reconstructed upon a new location supposed to be beyond all possible danger from a recurrence of the previous disaster, nevertheless the waters again came and washed away this same section; whereupon it was rebuilt upon a third Itxation, beyond all possible reach of future trouble from this s.ource. Considering the nature of the road and the people who were interested in its construction, it seems possible that due caution was exercised in the original location; that is, that a reasonably prudent man building this railroad as those men did, to be oper - ated by them as a railroad, would have located it as it was located. It is undoubtedly true that the second location was made with great care, and was believed to be beyond possible danger. It has cost a large sum more to rebuild this road than it would have originally cost to construct it where it is todaj . Now, in deter - mining the value of this property what if any allowance is to be made for this experimental outlay? If the government Itself had constructed this railroad it probably would have had the same experience and would have expended the same amount of money which the owners actually did. This illustration puts the question in a very striking form, but the same idea enters more or less into the valuation of most of the railroads of this country. There has of necessity been a certain amount of experiment before hitting on the right and proper thing. Does this development expense constitute an ele - ment of value which may be recognized today, or must the owners of these public utilities stand the loss of their mistakes in the same way that the owner of a private enterprise would? Vast sums of money are involved in the answer to that very simple question." An application of the cost of construction formula to the case cited by Mr. Prouty would necessarily Involve the recognition of the added expenditures caused by the destruction of the property. It might be argued that a certain amount of the extra cost should be amortized, but to do that would involve the exercise of judgment as to how much, and the result would necessarily have to be an estimate. Other cases might be cited where the sudden and unexpected develop- </seg>

This conclusion in supported by the report of the Commis - sion's engineer, by a personal inspection of a portion of the plant by two of the members of the Commission and by testimony of patrons with respect to the kind of service rendered. The physical condition of the property is below standard requirements and considerable re - construction is necessary. This condition, however, is not due entirely to the lack of revenue, as consideration must be given to the amount of money distributed to the stockholders in the way of dividends. It is apparent that a greater amount has been taken from the earnings for this purpose than was warranted by the requirements for a reason - able return. The practice of the company has been to close the ac - counts every three months, at which time the board of directors met and declared such dividends as they thought proper. From October, 1904, to March, 1907, the rate of return exceeded two per cent per quar - ter, running from 3.3 per cent to as high as 7 per cent. Following that date, however, the rate never exceeded 2 per cent.

            <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 105 counsel for complainant in his brief it is necessary to explain how it is arrived at. The figure of 10.8 per cent, as computed by Accountant Powell while on the witness stand in response to a suggestion from counsel and as later used by counsel as a basis for certain conclusions, is arrived at by averaging the percentages for the thirty-six quarterly periods involved. Tnis method does not reflect the actual facts, how- ever, for the reason that the capital stock was constantly changing, being different for twenty-three out of the thirty-six quarters. Ap - plying the average annual percentage of 10.8 to the capital stock at the end of each year results in a figure of $63,536.40, which should represent, if the percentage was correct, the dividends that had been paid during the life of the company, whereas reference to the above summary shows that the actual return to the stockholders was $50, - 143.10. In short, an average rate of return can only be determined by first securing an average of the stock outstanding at the end of each period for which the rate was applied. While, as stated, the dividends paid probably exceed a reasonable allowance for that purpose, it is difficult, if not practically impossible, to go back into the history of this company to ascertain what a reason - able rate of return should have been, and for that reason no attempt will be made to fix a specific allowance. At the time of the organisa - tion of this company conditions in the telephone field were radically different from what they are today. The industry was just on the threshhold of its greatest development. In 1904 the Nebraska Tele - phone Company had an investment in the state of approximately $2,- which covered 27,641 subscribers' stations, 14,000 of which were in Omaha and Lincoln. The figures are not available but it would be a conservative estimate to say that there were not 5,000 sub - scribers' stations operated by independent companies in Nebraska at that time. By 1911 the Nebraska Telephone Company's investment had been increased to $7,311,000 and its number of subscribers' sta - tions to 68,176, while the investment of the independent companies had jumped to $8,078,000 and the number of subscribers' stations to 78,774. In other words, over $12,000,000 of money was invested in the telephone business In Nebraska in a little less than seven years. This demand for capital came from an as yet untried and undeveloped industry- the hazards of which were practically unknown and the very" management and operation of which was yet to be perfected. Compe - tition was so keen that it was in reality a warfare, and many companies subsequently failed. It is apparent, therefore, that the conditions sur - rounding investments in the industry at that time were materially dif - ferent than they are at present, and that they called for a larger re - turn than today when the business has been established on a stable and permanent footing, competition practically eliminated and the apparatus standardized so that allowances for obsolescence are reduced. Making the necessary allowance for such conditions, however, we are of the opinion that the dividends paid by defendant were in excess </seg>

It can hardly be seriously argued that a rate of return ot only 5% per cent is sufficient for an investment in the tele - phone business at this time. While, as we have set forth in the fore - going:, conditions are much more favorable for the industry than at any time in its history, it is still in a state of development and investors will demand a larger return than could be secured from utilities more firmly established. In the opinion of the Commission the interest rate on farm mortgages is no fair measure of a reasonable return for telephone securities, although such a comparison is urged by counsel for complainant. There are elements of risk in the telephone business, such as potential competition, business depression, possible public ownership, radical changes in equipment for which no adequate pro - vision can be made, the possible complete destruction of the property by storm, etc., which do not pertain to farm mortgages, and which make the values of the two investments altogether different. In pre - vious cases the Commission has found 7 per cent to be a reasonable re - turn, and as the earnings under the present rates will produce a return of but slightly more than that they cannot be held to be excessive. The expenses of the company have been steadily increasing for the past three years, being over $3,500 greater in 1914 than in 1912. While it is likely that they have reached a fairly constant level, the changes in the plant and the improved service that will follow may necessitate still further expenditures, in which event the surplus over the allow - ance of 7 per rent would be consumed. In all of the foregoing calculations there has been no separation of toll from exchange property, earnings or expense. It is probable that were such separation to be made the net earnings of the exchange would be slightly increased. The net receipts from toll for 1914 were Hit $749.19, which in all probability did not defray the expens. of handling the toll business. Before the purchase of the Lincoln Tele - phone &amp; Telegraph Company's property applicant realized considerably more from the operation of its toll lines than it does under present conditions. Consequently in the past the gross earnings were larger for that reason and the exchange was the beneficiary. As the amount involved in either instance was not large, however, and would not af - fect the issues in this case it has not been considered necessary to at - tempt a separation. With reference to that portion of the complaint alleging discrim - ination as between the rates charged to business men and the rates charged to farmers, the Commission is of the opinion that no re-class - ification of charges is advisable at this time. The schedule corra sponds closely to the schedules in effect all over the state. It is recog - nized that any classification of subscribers must be more or less arbi - trary and that discriminations are thus likely to result, but until some system of basing the charges upon a reassured service can be devised that is more equitable and practicable than any now in use arbitrary </seg>

(PEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 208 William .1. Marquis, Complainant, VF. I'olk County Telephone Company, Defendant. Hall, Commissioner, dissenting: It is generally conceded that rate-making bodies, in rate con- troversies, shall make rates to raise funds sufficient to pay operating expenses, maintenance, depreciation, taxes, losses, and damages of the utility, and then a fund sufficient to pay dividends at a reasonable rate upon same amount of money. The above statement is an easy one to make and the principles therein contained are so fundamental that there are few who take issue with them. However, a brief consideration of language will show that it imposes upon the Commission a duty, which is in its essential nature plain and simple but very difficult and complex in its practical execution. The fund for operating expenses should be sufficient to employ officers, business managers and all employes in the actual operation of the business, of sufficient ability to deliver the best service to the public. </seg>

ORDER Hall, Commissioner The complaint herein is based upon an alleged senger train service of the defendant on what is ki branch of said railroad. The petition is signed by many citizen Wynot and the various towns lying between that point and Sioux ( Iowa, in which they allege -'that the defendant is not giving the vice that complainant and other patrons of the railroad are entitled to and that the volume of business demands: that the patronage enjo\ed by the defendant warrants and demands passenger trains on said line; that only one coach and a part of a coach attached to stock trains and local freight trains are provided for passenger service; that they are frequently crowded to such an extent that men, women and children are unable to secure seats and are compelled to stand for loug in - tervals; that by reason of the large volume of freight handled, the freight trains being the only ones in service at the present time M during the past, are wholly unable to make anything like schedule time and are invariably late, frequently hours late, in delivering freight, passengers, and United States mail. That the business of this branch line is of sufficient volume to deserve a freight train leaving Wynot at an hour in the morning of each day in ample time to reach the stock yards in Sioux City, Iowa, in time for the market that same day and in returning, leave Sioux City whenever they wish, arriving at Wynot whenever they can, as they do now. And in addition two passenger trains should be put into service, leaving Wynot about 6:3o a. m., and arriving at Sioux City at 8:30 a. m., or thereabouts; another passenger train leaving Wynot about lla. m., arriving in Sioux City at 1 p. m., </seg>

The trains referred to are usually very light. However, the service for the passenger traf- fic is not ideal nor what it should be, but the passenger traffic is light, as shown by the reports and by a great deal of evidence, that the Commission would not be justified in ordering the respondent put on an extra train service.

The records of the defendant and the evidence adduced establishes without doubt that there is no dispute as to how the records are kept or as to facts. The gist of the complaint is that the defendant allows the public to inspect the records referred to, but denies the same privi - lege to the complainant and his agents. The defendant admits that the complainant is not allowed access to the records, and the preponderance of evidence is to the effect that the public as well is denied the same privilege. The complainant is seeking to have an order issued by this Commission requiring the de - fendant to keep said records open for the inspection of the public gen - erally. The purpose of keeping the records referred to is that the shippers may get accurate information as to the arrival of their stock at the yards, the time defivered to the Stock Yards Company, and the time turned over by the Stock Yards Company to the commission firms </seg>

Inasmuch as the records kept by the defendant in this matter include not only state but interstate shipments, this Commisaion can - not order the defendant to do that which is directly contrary to the federal statutes, and we therefore find that the complaint herein is without merit and should be dismissed.

The only question on this count to be decided by the om mission is: Is the defendant rendering Dorchester adequate east- jnd passenger train service? Dorchester is an incorporated villafce. having a population of 610. It is located on the main line nt the de- 'endant, eight and three-tenths miles west of Crete and nine miles east Frien west-bound passenger train service is not complained of ,Vhi to consider it that we may understand the conven- He return service for passengers returning to Dorchester from it and west of that point. The Commission cannot do better n han to recite from portions of the brief of the defendant as to the iervice complained of, as the statements made therein have been vi ghly checked with the train schedules on file with the Com - q and found to be true. Dorchester has three daily west-bound as follow ly morning train, No. 7. known as the "Jitney," out 'I Lincoln at 7 a. in., stops at Dorchester at 7:50. This train Is a \\ which furnishes passenger train service through an east and ; of territory between Lincoln and Oxford. 175 miles in length. Dorchester has another train.

It also furnishes service from nts east of Lincoln, such as Omaha, Iowa points, Illinois, Chicago, . it is an evening fast train out of Chicago and a morning train m Omaha to Lincoln and Dorchester and on to McCook. It makes nections at Lincoln with the fast mail train No. 15 from Chicago at which leaves Chicago three hours after the departure of in Chicago, but catches up with No. 5 at Lincoln and there N&lt; rs the mail and express to No. 5 from Lincoln to Dorchester and d, and A very convenient train.

No. 7. from Chicago at 2 a. m., through Illinois and Iowa. It also s connections witu the through passenger train. No. 3, from Chi - through Illinois and Iowa, and out of Omaha at 4:10 p. m. There- fore, this 6 p. m. service from Lincoln to Dorchester is a connecting service for passengers, mail and express from the entire east. The above service, as outlined, gives Dorchester regularly throughout the year two west-bound trains. Nos. 5 and 19, both of which form through connecting passenger, mail and express service from Lincoln, Omaha, Illinois. Iowa. Chicago and the East. Train No. 7, above referred to, is a temporary train which has been discontinued and the former train service rendered by No. 1 reestablished, which does not stop at Dor - chester. </seg>

Dorchester has a population of 610 and its annual sales under June 30th, 1914, were $9,251. From the last figures onclusive that Dorchester is not quite comparable with Crete and d. Train No. 2 is a heavy, through, interstate train from Denver oln, Omaha and Chicago and cannot be properly classed as t It is one of the heaviest carriers of passenger traffic on the Bur - system, with equipment of mail, baggage, express cars, coaches, through tourist sleepers from California to Chicago, a din - v&gt;*Ch Standard sleepers from Denver and from California to train made up from 11 to 14 heavy steel under-frame or &gt;el cars. If train No. 2 or train No. 10, which is now being oper - nstead of No. 8 above referred to, were not in the service at all, n is of the opinion that no one would ask for additional i ;ervice to be put on by the defendant in order that Dorchester have more trains east out of that point, and that neither of the iins. Nos. 2 nor 10, should be required to stop at that point. If such luests wi if granted by the Commission and complied with by the Pendant there would be no through train service on the defendant's 3s between Chicago, Omaha. Lincoln and Denver.

            <seg id="p130">EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT The interstate rates on cement from the so-called Gas Belt in Kansas (and it is conceded in the record that, generally speaking cement is sold on the Iola basis) were reviewed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in cases Nos. 4038, 39^4 and 4485. In approv ing of the existing rates to Nebraska stations. Commissioner Clement 130 "The record establishes that an over-production of from 4 to 50 per cent in cement and a rapidly diminishing supply natural gas, which rendered manufacture cheap in the past, ha had a serious effect upon the cement trade in this field, and complainant's present troubles may be due to some extent to this cause. But, however this may be, treating the matter from transportation standpoint, and considering all the facts, circmii stances and conditions appearing of record, we do not feel that the interest of justice requires the granting of the prayer! of th&lt; petitions as to Kansas City, Missouri, Iowa. Nebraska. Colorado South Dakota or Montana." I P. 525.1 The rates above referred to are so-called group rates to i-ast&gt; and southeastern Nebraska points. The stations in the extreme easte and southeastern portion of the state are generally given the san rate as Omaha, while the Lincoln rate is carried as a blanket t stations between the extreme eastern stations and those statior line approximately north and south with Lincoln. To all stations w of said line the rates are graded up from the cheapest generally Beatrice.

            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 131 i ■ A estion of distances when group rates are under consideration is but • factor in the consideration of a just and reasonable rate. From Superior to practically all of the stations located in the east- tate the haul is made in main line train service, where rt density of traffic is materially above the average of the state. From i. of all these facts and circumstances, the Coni- s of the opinion, and we so find, that the rates established ier in Formal Complaint No. 252 should be modified as to the n carload shipments of cement between Superior and stations in Nebraska, as hereinafter provided. As previously stated, the rates from interstate points to stations in al and Western Nebraska, in which the zone or blanket rates are t applied, are built up on the rates to basing points such as Beatrice, ncoln, Fremont and Omaha, plus the rates from those points to desti- tiuii. A jobber of cement at these basing points can, under the stem of rates obtaining, ship into such basing points and reship in rtain instances under a more favorable basis than would apply under e distance scale from Superior to the same destinations. This con- lion must be recognized, and the Commission is of the opinion, and i finds, that where the combination of terminal rates from Superior • the basing points Fremont, Lincoln and Beatrice, plus the specific tes from said points to destination, set out in General Order No. 19, 11 produce a lower rate, said combination should apply as a maximum; ovided, however, that where a two-line haul is involved, the l&gt;4-cent binary shall be added.

Defendant entered a demurrer to the complaint on the ground that this Commission does not have jurisdiction, power nor authorit determine and order the construction of the more than two b of tracks extending from M street to O street on Sixteenth itl— I to command the defendant to maintain and operate the san motion was overruled by the Commission, whereupon defendar an answer to the complaint, renewing its denial of the juris the Commission, and alleging that the already established ed lines of the Company fully and adequately furnish all tl able service necessary for the convenience of the traveling public and that the system of transfers now in effect affords faciliti us persons residing in the southeastern and northeastern section city to travel from one section to the other without serious inconver ience or delay; that the construction and maintenance of tht connection" would cause a large expenditure of mone\ and that it would not result in any increase in revenue. Numerous hearings were had and a large amount my received. At the first hearing appearances were entered by a number of citiiens representing business interests on M and Thirteenth streets, who desired to be heard in opposition to the proposed change in the service. The issue presented by this complaint is as to whether the con- struction of connecting tracks between M and O streets on Sixteenth and the re-routing of certain lines of cars thereon will better serve the traveling public of Lincoln generally than it is served by the ex - isting facilities. Stated briefly, would more people be benefited by the change than would be inconvenienced? The claims of rival busi - ness interests have but little place in a question of this kind and are </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 but incidental to its determination. As is well said by the Public Ser - vice Commission of the Second District of New York, in discussing a similar question in Schoellkopf Holding Co. et al. v. International Railway Co. (Case No. 2578), "It must be borne in mind that the right of the public to have adequate, convenient and proper service upon the street car lines of the respondent is paramount to all other considerations; there is no duty imposed upon either the railway com - pany or this Commission to so route the cars of the com - pany that the property values and business conditions along such routes will be preserved or enhanced; such considerations have no place in the decision which should be arrived at in this case, except as they bear directly upon the convenience and necessity of the traveling pub - lic; and even such convenience and necessity must be controlled in large measure by the ability and facilities of the railway company to satisfy same." The Supreme Court of this state in Herpolsheimer Co. .-. The Lincoln Traction Co., 96 Nebr. 154, establishes the same princi - ple. In discussing the duty of the Commission the opinion says: "But the Railway Commission should consider the proposed changes in the service as affecting the public interests, and whether and to what extent the interests of the general public would be affected by the enforcement of such private contracts. They will take a general view of the whole situation, and deter - mine the necessity and propriety of the proposed changes, having due regard to the rights of the defendant, and economy of service, and the interests of all parties concerned, and especially the su - perior rights of the general public." It is manifest, therefore, that If the connection as asked for by oniplainants cannot be justified on the ground of a need for it by the traveling public as a whole it cannot be justified at all, and that the various business districts are to be considered only to the extent that they influence the trend of traffic. The record is conclusive to the effect that there is a considerable traffic between the southeastern and northeastern portions of the city, and that the bulk of this traffic transfers at Thirteenth and O. A portion of the passengers transfer by walking from Sixteenth and M to Sixteenth and O. The development of the business seotion east of Thirteenth and O also creates a traffic that has to be transferred under present arrangement at Thirteenth and O. There are five car lines serving the southeastern section of the city. The most important of these are the South Seventeenth, which operates from the terminal at Tenth and O to South Street; the Sumner, which operates between the terminal just mentioned and Twenty-eighth and Sumner, and the Normal and College View, which operates between the same terminal and the suburb of College View. All of these lines run over the same tracks from Tenth and O to Seventeenth and A. At the latter point the Sumner and College View cars turn east on A street and run to Twenty - first, thence south on that street to Sumner, where they turn east again and follow that street to Twenty-eighth. The College View cars </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT follow the same route as the Suniner cars to Twenty-eighth and fron that point take a general southeasterly course to College View. Th» Eighteenth street and Randolph street lines serve the section locat more directly east, between Suniner and O streets. They connect witr the O street tracks at Eleventh and O. No line serving the southeastern section of the city has direct connection with the main trunk line on O street east of Thirteenth. It is contended by complainants that this is not a satisfactory arrangement. As stated it compels all cr town passengers to travel to Thirteenth and O to transfer. In the of passengers on any of the three lines operating over South teenth street who desire to go east, even for a short distance, it quires a ride from Sixteenth and M to Thirteenth and M. thence ov to O and back on O to Sixteenth, resulting in a detour of six blocks. they do not care to ride around three sides of this rectangle they get off at Sixteenth and M and walk over to Sixteenth and O and tl catch an eastbound car. if their destination is northeast Lin Much space in the record is devoted to the studies and reeomrr dations embodied in a report made to The Lincoln Traction Company 1911 by R. W. Harris, an electrical engineer and traffic expert. Mr Harris conducted an exhaustive Investigation into all phases of tl traffic problem and made a large number of recoinmendat to the re-routing of cars, the construction of new tracks, the abandf ment of existing tracks and other matters. The situation subject of this complaint received consideration, and Mr. H a study of the number of pass.n ,V involved, and found that during the six-day period 5.696 passengers transferred between the no city and the portion served by the lir it street. This was an average of 949 per day. He concluded, howevf that the period selected was hardly normal would not have been unfair for the daily av these figures he drew the deduction that the passengers s . ived by thf South Seventeenth lines, if provided with a short-cut on Sixte. t street, would be eonvenieneed to the extent of approxir passenger miles per year. He recommended that the cor be built and that the Suniner and Twenty-einhn routed over them. Judging from figures cnbmittet this case, the traffic has changed but little since Mr. Harris made hi report, the increase in revenue passengers for the fiscal year 191 1914 over the fiscal year 1910-1911 being but 1^ per , ent pears fair, therefore, to use the figures of the Harris report as close approximation of the amount of traffic transferred at Thirteenth and O at the present time. The Harris report does not so state, but the language would indicate that the figures given include those pas- sengers who walked from M to O on Sixteenth, or vice versa. The study made by defendant for one day. June 4, 1915, shows that out of a total of 16,439 passengers handled on the lines on O street which </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION serve the northeastern section of the city, but 318, or 2 per cent, got &gt;n or off at Sixteenth and O. Many ol these passengers, of course, ither originated in the O street section or were destined there and ot transfer by walking between M and O. While I a large amount of testimony in the record to the effect that a umber ot people walk from M to U street and vice versa in ike time in transferring, it is conjectural and speculative based on actual studies. There is undoubtedly more or his, particularly of those patrons who are located in the vicin - ixteenth ami O and who find it more convenient to walk two s than to remain on the car and transfer, but that it constitutes onsiderable portion of the traffic is doubted. With this situation presented, and recognizing that it is more or undesirable and inconvenient, it is necessary to consider whether eniedy proposed by complainants is adequate. If the connection constructed there would be three ways in which it could be used, a new line of cars could be installed to operate over one II le routes on South Seventeenth and over the new connection; (2) ars on the South Seventeenth tracks could be diverted from the ent route over M street and sent over Sixteenth to O; 13) or. at ion of the cars now running on South Seventeenth could be ited over the new connection. The latter plan is the one asked for complainants, as is made clear by Article 14 of their complaint. ich reads as follows: "Complainants further show that this petition and complaint not filed for the purpose of securing an order from this Com- mission, re-routing all of the cars now running from South Six - teenth and M to Thirteenth and O street, by way of M and Thir - teenth streets, but for the purpose only of securing a re-routing of such portion of said cars as may be proper and adequate for the use and convenience of those persons desiring to reach points ist of Fourteenth street on O street, and desiring to reach the oints hereinbefore mentioned." Complainants modified their request during the progress of the ings by insisting that they desired the connection even if new ser - hiid to be installed. Defendant met this demand by introducing nsiderable evidence as to the expense it would put to if such service ould be required, at the same time contending that the new service would produce no added revenue. In the opinion of the Commission the addition of new service would be so impractical and so unreasonable that the suggestion needs but little consideration. In the first place, it would be necessary to es - tablish a new line of cars on one of the South Seventeenth street routes. It is manifest that it would not be practicable, nor would it satisfy the demands of complainants, to install a shuttle service be - tween M and O on Sixteenth. The only alternative, therefore, would be added cars on South Seventeenth. The service on the three existing lines is admittedly adequate and there is no general demand to increase it. The cost of installing and maintaining extra cars would be heavy </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT and out of all proportion to the benefits derived by the public. There would be no substantial increase in revenue and it would resolve it - self into the proposition of operating an entire line of cars over a long route in order to serve two blocks of traffic territory. These reasons amply justify the rejection of the plan, but there is still another which we will consider in connection with the third plan suggested. With reference to the second plan for the use of the connection. complainants, as indicated in that portion of the petition quoted, spe - cifically disclaim any desire to have all the cars now running from Sixteenth on M to Thirteenth and thence to O re-routed over the new tracks. Indeed, such a change would so disturb present service and result in inconvenience to so many patrons that it is not seriously en- tertained by anyone. For that reason it is not necessary to discuss it We come now to the remedy as originally proposed by complain ants, viz., the re-routing over the proposed connection of a portion of the cars now running on South Seventeenth. At the outset, this question presents itself: Will those patrons who desire to transfer from one section to the other be adequately served? And a moment's conside ation of the matter discloses that but a fraction of them, under tl; most favorable routing that can be made, will be served. The Harr report recommends that the Sumner and Twenty-eighth street line t diverted over the new connection. And yet. according to tt used in that study, there was an average of but 268 people who trt ferred to and from that line at Thirteenth and O of all three lines of 949. In other words, less than one-t passengers transferring were served by the line which to re-route. And therein lies the fallacy in the cone] by Mr. Harris with reference to the saving that would be effected I the construction of the connection. Instead of a saving •&gt; mately 141,000 passenger miles, as he calculated w saving of less than 45,000 passenger miles. This latter figure w somewhat increased, of course, if those patrons residing tory adjacent to the South Seventeenth line between A and M st were taken into consideration. These would hav cars that travel the line to A street, but as we shall point out late the nature of the service would make it very likely that it would be extensively used. All those patrons on the College View line going to or from the territory beyond Twenty-eight anil Simmer would still be compelled to take the transfer at Thirteenth and O. because the Sumner cars would not be available to them. The same condi - tion would apply to the people served by the South Seventeenth line south of A street. On the other hand, if the South Seventeenth cars were re-routed over the proposed connection, while they would serve more people on account of the traffic being more dense, they would still leave unprovided for all of the patrons in the southeastern portion of the city beyond Seventeenth and A, served by the other two lines. The transfer of the College View line would result in the same frac- </seg>
            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 139 onal service and would be entirely inadequate because of the forty- minute service on that line. Manifestly, therefore, the proposed re - arrangement would be but a partial remedy. There has been an assumption by complainants and apparently by Mr. Harris that the re- routing of one of these lines of cars over the proposed connection would solve the entire cross-town problem and correct the disadvant - ages that now exist. It is to be seen, however, that but thirty to forty per cent of the patrons would be better served, while the remain - der would continue under the disadvantage now complained of. The addition of a new line of cars would result in the same situation. A portion of the patrons would be provided with a quicker and more ronvenient transfer but the remainder would not be benefited. If de&gt; tvmlant is to be put to the heavy expense of constructing a connection the new tracks should be located and the cars re-routed so as to serve of the people who are at the present time discommoded. With reference to the relief that would be provided to pa - s in the section adjacent to the Seventeenth line between A and M ?ts. it is necessary to remember that the service would be more or unsatisfactory, for the reason that it would be limited to one line ars. The Sumner cars are so spaced with the College View cars is to provide a ten-minute schedule beyond Seventeenth and A. There s an interval of twenty minutes between two of the Sumner cars that is illed by a College View car. Consequently, a passenger desiring to the Sumner line to transfer at Sixteenth and O would have a ten- minute service two-thirds of the time and a twenty-minute service one - third of the time. This Irregularity would be confusing and would likely result in the passenger boarding one of the other cars and ansferring as at present. The South Seventeenth line schedule Is more regular, having a ten-minute frequency. The presence of the other cars on the line would be confusing, however, and it would fre - quently happen that a passenger could take one of them and make the transfer at Thirteenth and O quicker than by waiting for the Seventeenth car going by way of Sixteenth and O. So far, we have given consideration only to the needs of those passengers who desire to transfer at Thirteenth and O streets. There is another portion of the traveling public to be considered, however. These are the people who would be inconvenienced by the withdrawal of cars from the M and Thirteenth street routes. Located within a blo&lt;-k of the corner of Thirteenth and M streets are a number of public buildings and business places, to and from which there is a large traffic, among them being the City Auditorium, First Christian church, St. Theresa's Catholic church and parochial school. First Presbyterian church, First Congregational church, 8t. Paul's Methodist church, the Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph Company's headquarters building, the Lindell Hotel and the Lincoln Sanitarium, all of which are served by the three car lines under consideration. There Is a much larger traffic territory than is above defined, and all of it 1* </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT served to a greater or less degree by these lines. If any of the three lines is diverted as proposed, passengers served by it who desired to get to any of the points in this territory would have to go to Thirteenth and O and either walk two or three blocks to their destination or take a transfer to the Fourteenth street line which runs south on Thirteenth to J street. In fact, these passengers would be inconvenienced in the same manner and to practically the same extent as are passengers for East O street who now have to transfer at Thirteenth and O or wal two blocks from M to O. While the actual traffic figures are not given. the record indicates that as many people travel to and from the terri - tory served by the M street and Thirteenth street lines as transfer between the northeastern and southeastern sections of the city. To the extent, therefore, that the service on these lines was reduced to that extent would these people be inconvenienced. In orher words, the benefit that would accrue to thost pMMBfan who desired to transfer to points east of Thirteenth would be secured at the expense of those who are accommodated by the present routing. Judged solely from the standpoint of the greatest convenience to the greatest number, com - plainants are unable to establish superior rights over those who would be discommoded. In view of these considerations, it appears to the Tor complainants have not established that the general pi t would be served by the chance which they propose As we h but a fraction of the people for whom complainants speak ■ convenienced. existing schedules would be disarranged and people would be inconvenienced as would be benefited. Wt considerations are sufficient to control the Commission's cc they do not take into account the interests of defendant to w proper to give some attention. The construction of the two blocks of track would he an ex pensive piece of work, owing to the fact that a double switch at Six - teenth and M, a double crossing at Sixteenth and M and a double switch and turnout at Sixteenth and O would be required. Defen - dant submitted an estimate of $23.52". 15 as the cost of the connection. This estimate was carefully checked by the Commission's engineer. Mr Forbes, and he arrived at a figure of $14,809.49. Assuming $1". as a reasonable figure, it would appear that there should be an im - perative need for such an improvement by the traveling public gen - erally before defendant should be required to make such an outlay. As the record discloses, such a need does not exist. It is recognized that the existing situation is by no means ideal and that if there was a comprehensive survey of traffic requirements in the city with an opportunity to build a new system to meet these requirements many substantial improvements could be worked out. but we are confronted with a condition for which at the present time there seems to be no practical remedy. Eventually, there will have to be a cross-town line in Lincoln, but it should be located much farther east than is proposed </seg>

            <seg id="p143">XKBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 143 The Nebraska Telephone Company in its answer admits that two lephone exchanges in the same place are an unnecessary burden upon nhabitants thereof; that it is willing to purchase and acquire the Kearney Telephone Company at a fair figure, if permitted so to do. and if such purchase is not illegal under the anti-trust laws of the liifil States and in violation of a certain commitment entered into *ith the federal authorities through the American Telephone &amp; Tele - ;raph Conipanj, whereby this company agreed to purchase the property it no telephone company where such telephone company is in comipeti- ion with respondent, and that in view of said agreement it cannot purchase the property of the Kearney Telephone Company unless re- spondent is assured that such purchase will not be considered as constituting a violation of said agreement made by the American Telephone &amp;.

Respondent further alleged that, in addition to the local exchange at Kearney, it owns and operates other telephone exchanges located in all the important towns of Nebraska and South Dakota; that it has nvested large sums of money in long distance and toll telephone ines, which connect all the exchanges operated by respondent, and ikewi.se many other exchanges located in towns where respondent has no exchange, and that by means of said long distance and toll lines respondent is able to furnish to the city of Kearney and the state of Nebraska telephone service to practically every town in the I'nited States. Respondent further alleges that in connection with its telephone exchange located at Kearney it operates and maintains a toll switching station and toll switchboard, and to properly operate its toll long stance lines it must at all times maintain in said city of Kearney a toll switchboard and a large force of operators and men sufficient to properly take care of its toll and long distance lines which pass through and radiate from Kearney.

It further alleges that it is unable itself to finance the purchase of the local exchange of the Nebraska Telephone Company, even if said company were disposed to sell the same, and that in order to comply with the complaint it will be necessary for it to sell its property and system to the said Nebraska Telephone Company, and that its stock - holders and board of directors have authorized the board of directors to sell and dispose of same to the Nebraska Telephone Company.

ORDER Taylor, Commissioner: This complaint is made in behalf of the Farmers Grain &amp; Live Stock Association, of Hordville, which is a member of the association, in whose name the complaint is brought. Hordville is a station on tho branch line of the Union Pacific running from Valparaiso to Central City, and is located between the latter point and Polk, being 7.4 miles from Central City and 5.5 miles from Polk. Complaint is made of the present adjustment of grain rates between Hordville and Omaha, with particular reference to the relation of these rates to those applying from other stations in the same territory. The following table gives the rates on wheat anu corn from the various stations involved in the present adjustment, together with the distance from each station to Omaha: Miles Station Rate Miles Station Rate 122 Central City 12.75 11.05 131 Hordville 12.75 111 Clarks 11.9 11.05 10.2 125.5 Polk 11.9 105 Havens 11.6 119 Durant 10.2 11.47 9.77 99 Silver Creek ».77 11.00 9.35 115 Stromsburg 11.05 10S Shelby 10.2 9.77 8.5 110 Osceola 10.62 </seg>

It will be noted that the progression in the rate on wheat example, is accomplished by steps of .42 and .43 of a cent per hundrt pounds between the stations from Shelby to Polk. Between the lattf point and Hordville. however, the spread is increased to The rate of progression is practically the same between the stat the Burlington and between the stations on defendant's ma is this abrupt increase in the rate between Polk and Hord w complaint is made, complainants contending that tl of a cent between Polk and Central City should !&gt;&lt;■ d ville be given a rate midway between. There is no substant tion in the mileage between Polk and Hordville. as compared wit the mileage between the other stations, to justify a different sprt the rate.

So far as we are able to determine, there is why the same rate of progression should not be applied to tww Polk and Hordville as is applied between stations east same line. Polk certainly cannot be heard to complain if the id between Polk and Hordville is the same as it is between Polk Durant. The distance, if that is to be considered as a factor, is irable to Hordville. The only point likely to be adversely affected ild be Marquette on the Burlington southwest of Hordville. At the time the rates are the same. The two towns are not sharply ive, however, and Marquette very likely would not feel the of the readjustment. Stromsburg. Benedict and Durant would tain the advantage of their geographical location and would not cted. Hampton would still have an advantage of .43 of a cent Hordville. We fail to see, therefore, wherein a readjustment he basis of the complaint would disturb the rate structure in this prritory. We can see, however, that if the remedy suggested by efendant was adopted that it would but carry the trouble eastward nd in a more aggravated form. To place Hordville, Polk, Durant and tromsburg under a blanket of 12.75 for wheat and 11.05 for corn nake the spread between Stromsburg and Osceola over 2 cents ween Stromsburg and Benedict over 1 cent. This would neces- t ill further readjustment at these points and this in turn 1 for adjustments at other points east and south and on other ml The Commission is of the opinion and so finds, therefore, that the i as now constructed constitutes a discrimination against Hordville that the same should be removed by establishing the same rela - between Hordville and Polk as now exists between the stations t as Stromsbur ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, that the rates on wheat and corn from Hordville to Omaha and South Omaha as now published and charged by the Union Pacific Railroad Company be cancelled, and in lieu thereof the following rates be published and charged Wheat Corn From Hordville to Omaha 12.32 10.62 per cwt.

Mr. Diers expressed ae opinion that there was so much "visiting on the lines at night" lat the operator got tired of it and did not attach the call bell until te for that reason.

He said the service in town is pt and efficient and that the employes of the company are court- i Mi James M. Fuller, who was local manager of the exchange for years, and whose wife is now manager, was the principal wlt - for defendant. Describing the service and the manner in which go ration is now handled, he said the office is never alone on Sunday except for very short periods, and that seldom. Once in a while Mrs. Fuller is there alone and leaves the room for perhaps five or ten minutes, and sometimes the family leaves and 1 take care of the office on Sunday, and not so very long ago 1 was out ten minutes to run a messenger for a party 'off hours, and of course the operators were not there because it was not open hours, but there is always someone around this building and the building has two rooms, and one room opens off from the office and sometimes we are sitting in the dining room or parlor reading, but we always have our ear attuned more or less to the switchboard and we have made it a rule, and have told the people about it as far as we can, for parties ringing 'central' and wanting us, to ring three times during 'off hours on account of so many children and adults ringing in 'off hours unthoughtedly, and we would have to turn them down. When they call their neighbors on Sunday it throws the drop. The switchboard is open for the use of the public sixteen hours a day, from 5:30 in the morning to 9:30 at night. They get their service for the other eight hours by a night bell, and no one is supposed to ring unless they have an emergency call during those eight hours, but as has been stated, there are in the neighborhood of 2 7 party lines, and they make a practice of ringing one another and will stand and use the lines until sometimes it is impossible or impractical anyway to put the night bell on until in the neighborhood of ten o'clock. It is very seldom later, and during that half hour anyone wanting an emer - gency call would experience more difficulty getting in than when there is an operator at the board or than when the night bell had been placed, because when they ring one another the same action takes place at the board as in ringing for 'central', and the operators are not paid for giving service during that half hour, and if the operator was kept there it would soon be an hour and there would be no 'off hours. In eleven years that has been my experience." </seg>

At David City the rate for individual usiness is $1.50 per month and for two- to four-party residence, $1.00 :r month, the farm line rate being $1.50 with the privilege of free rvice to all exchanges. In addition to these rates there is a flat te of 50 cents per month for the "county right," or for unlimited nnections with all subscribers on the system. The company proposes to increase all $1.00 rates to a basis of 1.50 per month and extend the county right service to all subscribers, hat being the change involved in the application under consideration. t is claimed that more revenue is necessary to provide for a deprecia - ion fund, no reserve having been created for that purpose, to con - truct additional trunk lines between the various exchanges so as to lore efficiently handle the traffic, and to meet increased costs of oper - tion brought about by the growth of the plant and changed condi- n There are phases of the situation in which the company finds at this time that make it necessary for the Commission to de- rnrine whether the remedy proposed is the proper one under the rcumstances. The adequacy or inadequacy of the present revenue secondary, both from the interests of the company and the public, the question as to whether the proposed readjustment of rates will an improvement over conditions as they now exist. At the time his application was filed there were about 800 subscribers who were laying the added monthly rate of 50 cents for the full county service, leaving about 1200 who had not availed themselves of the service. Thus a substantial majority do not find the unlimited county service enough value to warrant them in paying the added charge for it. q other words, three-fifths of the subscribers are content with their &gt;cal exchange, preferring to pay the toll charge of ten cents per when necessity requires communication with another exchange the cvstem It has come to be a well recognized principle in establishing equit- lephone service that the exchange is the unit upon h such rates should be determined. Within the exchange it has found possible to so classify the users with respect to kind and antity of service as to establish a fairly equitable schedule of flat es for unlimited service. Theoretically, the only proper unit for ascertaining a rate, even within the exchange, is the message, the quantity of the service consumed, as measured by the number of mes - sages, fixing the equitable charge that should be made to the patron, but because of mechanical and practical reasons it has not been found possible to adopt this method. Going beyond the exchange, however, the only proper and just method is the measured service. The reasons for this are obvious. Some patrons use such service but very little, others use it moderately, while others — and they are almost invariably a very small minority — use it a great deal. This is well illustrated by </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT 1 In li i at a study made by the Chester Telephone Company of the traffic ove its toll lines for a period of a year. That study revealed the followin conditions: 29 per cent did not use the toll lines during the year 26 per cent paid less than 50 cents. 17 per cent paid from 5u cents to $1 16 i&gt;er cent paid from fl.iiu to f2.00. 8 l&gt;c- cent paid from *2.u\) to $5.00 5 per cent paid oier fo.UU.

            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 157 uw and much complaint is made for that reason, bearing respecting the service was to the general ef- 1 exchanges it is fairly satisfactory, but that tween towns are always busy and calls are delayed ngth of time. Applicant admits that it does not inking facilities to give efficient service, and that is its principal reasons for desiring more revenue. As e have pointed out, however, its method of increasing the revenue ly promises to aggravate the conditions, for, as it increases the rev - ue, it will greatly increase the traffic. The extension of unlimited to 1,109 additonal subscribers will undoubtedly greatly multi - number of calls. The contention of the company that at the :sent time patrons paying the ?l.uo rate frequently get the benefit the county service is no doubt well founded, as is the further con- on that a portion of the time of the operators is occupied in at - ting to detect such contraband calls and to prevent them being leted. This abuse can hardly be so general, however, as to se - ly impair the service, nor would the abolishing of it compensate for xtra burden that would be thrust upon the company by the pro- sed extension of the unlimited service. The extension of the un - nited service also involves the sacrifice of a considerable portion of jmpany's toll revenue, for the reason that those subscribers who t now pay the flat rate for the county right pay a message fee l cents when communicating with other exchanges. Applicant ates that under the universal application of the flat rate the toll receipts would amount to $5U0 annually. As that represents jut four calls per year per subscriber it would appear to be very V incumbent upon this Commission to determine, not only reasonable amount of revenue necessary to the operation of e plant, but it is equally necessary to see that the charges oduee that revenue are distributed equitably among the various bers. From the foregoing it is apparent that the rate proposed plication would result in various forms of discriminations ist of which would be the imposing of a charge upon a large lbscribers who do not care for the service. Those patrons who at the present time make no use of the county service, or at the most very little use of it. would under the proposed plan be compelled o pay for something that they do not use. On the other hand, those ubscribers the nature of whose business makes it necesary or whose inclinations make it desirable to use the service a great deal, would be fretting something that they would not pay for. With respect to the situation in David City a serious discrimination would result be - cause of the present adjustment of rates at that point. The present schedule provides for a party-line residence service at the rate of $1.00 per month. Under the proposed rate these party-line subscribers would be compelled to pay_$1.50 per month, which is the same rate </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT charged for individual line service. As a consequence of this discrim - ination, either a large number would discontinue service or a majority would demand individual line service. In the former case the com - pany would be compelled to sacrifice considerable revenue and in the latter it would be put to great expense for the reconstruction of its plant to meet the new conditions. The foregoing consideration of the difficulties involved in the application of the rate herein proposed make it clear to the Commission that neither the company nor the patrons would be benefitted by the readjustment and it necessarily follows that the application should be denied. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this case to present an analysis of the financial condition of the company, although a consider - able amount of testimony was submitted relative to the need for more revenue. A study has been made of this testimony, however, and it would indicate, although it is not conclusively shown, that the present revenue is insufficient. The company has no depreciation re - serve and is confronted with the necessity for considerable reconstruc - tion. Its operating expense is increasing with the increase in the cost of labor and the growth of the system. In view of the fact that the remedy proposed by the company is herein found not to be the proper one, it will be necessary for the company to work out some other read - justment of rates that will be equitable and that will accomplish the desired results.

            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 On September 1, 1910, James Binkert and Archie Binkert, his ion, traded a farm for what was known as the Gross Telephone Com- pany. The exchange consisted of 225 subscribers' stations, grounded circuit, with magneto system. No inventories were made of the prop- rty, or accounting had as to its finances. After the trade the owners .inci applicants herein estimated the property to be worth $8,000, and m September 1, 1910. the partnership, under the name of Lynch Tele- phone Company, opened up its books with a balancing account of $8,000, it being the estimated value of the plant, as placed upon it by the owners, with the following rates: Business, $1.50 per month, payable yearly in advance. Residence, $1.00 per month, payable jearly in advance. The applicants herein pray for authority to advance the rates to $1.75 per month, payable monthly in advance, for business phones, and residence phones to $1.25, payable monthly in advance. The nnplicants base their proposed advance on the claim that it is hard to collect rentals for one year in advance, and that If the collections are made for one month in advance it will cost more to make the collections. The testimony of the secretary and treasurer show that the company is prosperous, and that the property, as a whole, is in much better condition than it was on September 1, 1910. The Commission has on file the annual reports of the company for the years 1911, 1912, 1913 and 1914, which have been introduced in evidence and made a part of this hearing. Said reports show that for the year 911 Operating earnings $3,075.00 Expenses, including taxes 1.915.00 Net earnings $1,160.00 Operating income $3,231.50 Expenses 1,800.00 Net income 1,431.50 1913 Operating income $3,144.00 Expenses 1,830.00 Net income 1,314.00 1914 Operating income $3,196.00 Expenses 1,832.71 Net income 1,363.29 Total net operating income for the four years $5,268.79 The company borrowed $1,500, which was expended for new central office building and new cables within the town limits, of which 888.00 has been paid out of operating income, and leaves available for cash dividends. . $4,380.79 or a net income per year of $1,095.19 </seg>

There is some testimony by Mr. James Binkert to the effect thj he put into the plant $300. but the books and reports to the ( mission do not corroborate this statement. The real compl ;iint to be that collections are hard to make because rentals are payable one year in advance. The record is insufficient to justify any general incr in Commissions and courts generally, however, have approved of ratt schedules providing discounts for prompt payment; likewise, they have approved a rule calling for the payment of farm lin ■nt months or one year in advance The present rates are based on a yearly payment in advance. \Y are of the opinion that six months is a reasonable period payment in advance, and in order to stimulate and facilitate prompt payment of rentals and dues, applicant should be allowed to and collect $1.75 per month for business telephones and $1.2 month fop farm and residence telephones, provided, however, that where subscribers pay six months in advance, their bills shall be dis- counted 25 cents per month, leaving their net rates the same as ;it present.

The lines were constructed and connections made with the switch - board of the Farmers Company in accordance with said contracts. In January, 1912. the Lincoln Company purchased the telephone system of the Nebraska Company at Red Cloud and all its exchanges and toll lines in what is known as the South Platte territory, from Adams and Webster County east to the state line, and thereby became a competitor of the Farmers Company's local exchange at Red Cloud. The applicant now seeks an order of this Commission, authorizing it to cut the Hastings-Red Cloud and Superior-Red Cloud toll lines off the Farmers Company switchboard and connect them to its own toll-board that formerly belonged to the Nebraska Company. It then proposes to con nect the Farmers system with its toll-board by trunk lines between its toll-board and the toll board of the Farmers Company. The Farmers Company asserts that this will violate the terms of the con - tract hereinbefore set forth, and that the said Farmers Company will lose the primary control of the toll lines referred to. The Lincoln Company denies that the proposed change violates any provisions of the existing contracts and contends that the proposed cir - cuit arrangement will increase the facilities and improve the service fur - nished to the Farmers Company and to the public, and contends that as long as it violates no provision of the said contracts, it has the exclusive </seg>

It further alleges that the lines in question produce a very smal revenue in their present condition, and that it is necessary that thej be re-arranged in order that sufficient business can be handled ovei them to enable the company to pay for their maintenance and opera - tion; that under present conditions the Lincoln Company has no con nection between its own exchange in the city of Red Cloud and th toll lines now terminating there on the Fanners board, which ar its exclusive property and that it lias an absolute right to make icl changes in its terminals at Ked Cloud as it desires, provided that it continues to give the said Farmers Company connections witt lai lines, which is its only obligation under its contract, and provided ther that it does not injure the wrvioe which the public is recei The Lincoln Company asks pel 'mission to make said chan as the Commission lias general control over the service of carriers, and all changes made in the service must be fi by it. An examination ot the proposed contract shows that t dition covering the manner of connection of the Farn with the said toll lines is found in Section 1 and pro Lincoln Company shall furnish I lie Farmer! Company co handling of its business out of the city of Ked Cloud Section 8 of the contract set out above gives the Lincoln Company the option of establishing a separate switchboard in the exchangf the second party for the handling of its toll business, and providf that, in the event that it does so, the revenue to be paid the secon party shall be reduced 15 per cent commission on messages originatin at its exchange. Whether or not the changes to be made in the termi nation of its lines by the Lincoln Company can be construed as th said lines. There is no provision in either of said eoatracts to the el feet that the Lincoln Company shall terminate its lines on the boar of the Fanners Company and give them the exclusive use or &lt;ontn of same. In this connection It may he noted that said contra-' hereinbefore set forth and referred to, were made and entered int by the parties thereto on or about the 30th day of April, 191", vine was long after the time when the jurisdiction over rates, service an general control of common carriers were vested in the Coinmissioi All such contracts affecting service are subject to modification l.y tli Commission, upon a proper hearing, whenever it appears that III interest of the general public, served by such utilities, can he beat em served.

In 1909 the stockholders con- ded that they should have some evidence of ownership for the rty secured in excess of the original purchase price and for some vements that had been made. Accordingly they authorized an $11,500, thus doubling the capital stock. This stock was distrib - :he form of a dividend. In the absence of the records showing e of the original property, it is impossible for the Commission nine just what value should be placed on this stock, but it is t the pure- .se price should not be accepted as the sole measure its value. While the price for which a property is sold is an element be considered in ascertaining its value for rate making purposes it is ) unreliable to be accepted as conclusive. The price may be too h as well as too low. Lacking the necessary information, therefore, Commission is compelled to Took for some other basis that will fair and equitable. In this instance it seems fair to adopt the present value of the physical property as found by the department's engineer, which is $20,531.12 The manner in which the present company came into possession the original property makes it necessary to reject the book figures the property investment as a basis for ascertaining the necessary owance f jr maintenance and depreciation. The property investment nt was started with the purchase price of $10,000. Whatever wrty there was in excess of that amount, therefore, should be n into consideration in arriving at the amount required for main- nance, for it has to be repaired and replaced along with the remainder the plant of which it is a part. In the absence of information as to imount of it, however, we are again forced to adopt a method will take it into consideration. This we have in the physical val- as returned by the engineer. The reproduction value should nt the cost of all the property in use, and this we find to be 832.98 Owing to the unusual length of the farm lines in this plant, the allowance for maintenance and depreciation should be somewhat above the normal. The topography of the country and the scarcity of popula - tion make necessary the construction of long farm lines. The record shows that one of the farm lines on this system is 28 miles in length, which is much longer than economical maintenance and good operation warrant. The average for all the farm lines is above twelve miles. The average in the eastern part of the state where conditions are more favorable is from 5 to 10 miles. It needs no argument to demonstrate that such a condition calls for a larger expenditure for maintenance. The Commission hai found from 8 per cent to 9 per cent on the re - production value of the property to be a reasonable allowance for the purposes of maintenance and depreciation and, in view of the abnor - mal condition existing here, finds that 9 per cent on the reproduction value is necessary and reasonable in this case. </seg>

Without such a separation, however, it inline just what the exchange rates should be. the opinion that the two classes of service should lar as the accounting is concerned, so that it to determine what the rates for each class should clone, in this case at least, the Commission cannot of rates for exchange service that will be equitable, at once make the necessary changes in its accounts w the value of the toll property and the cost of that A laiye amount of testimony was introduced with respect to the idered by applicant, most of it being in the nature Flic principal trouble appears to be that subscribers entral office promptly, and in some instances cannot at all, it being necessary to have a subscriber closer in and thus open the line.

Under present conditions it would seem impossible for the com - pany to reduce the length of its ovn farm lines, but the Commission be - lieves it should make an effort to reduce the number of subscribers to the line. It should also make a careful study of its traffic to determine whether it has sufficient operators to handle both the toll and exchange business. The toll business should not be allowed to become a burden to the exchange and if it is found that it is, sufficient operators should be emplojed so that ah traffic can be handled promptly and efficiently. The Commission realizes that if the recommendations made herein are followed the company will be put to considerable expense.

While Mr. Swancutt offered considerable testimony relative to the ei hi al conditions under which he is operating the plant, he was un- to supply any definite figures covering his investment, opera xpenses and cost of maintenance. For that reason the Coramis n finds it necessary to rely for these facts on the annual statements c ?d in this office and on a valuation made by its engineer, Mr. Forbes. T! annual reports are more or less incomplete and are doubtless the alt of estimates made by Mr. Swancutt, but they afford some idea the operating conditions and will be used in the absence of any- tl ng better.

It is probable, however, that a certain portion of the revenue will be uncollectible, and judging from past ex]&gt;erience in this plant the amount is likely to exceed the normal of two per cent of the gross.

He is manager, bookkeeper, collector and lineman. It is obvious that in a system involving above 460 telephones one man cannot perform all of these duties satisfactorily, either to himself or to his patrons. Mr. Swancutt admits that he should have a lineman to devoted his full time to the maintenance of the property, and the Commission is of the opinion that such assistance should be at once securea. It will insure prompter attention to all trouble complaints and a general raising of the standard of service. At the present time there are no farm lines belonging to other companies switched at either exchange and no rates are filed for such service. Applicant now desires to file a rate of $6.00 per jear such service. $5.00 per year if paid in advance. It is his intent the rate is approved, to give farm patrons the option of purchasing th lines by which they are now served and to perform the switehin vice for them.

Woods and Leonard E. Hurtt. For Remonstrators — H. A. Bryant. iij lor, Commissioner: On June 6, 1914, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company ade application for autnority to establish a schedule of rates for etallic service for its excnange at Ashland, these rates to be supple - ental to the schedule already in effect for grounded service. As the s for grounded service were still to be available at the option of subscriber and as the rates applied for were standard for exchanges that size, they were approved. (Application No. 2136.) On August 22, 1914, the company made application for authority discontinue its grounded service within the city of Ashland and to incel its rates for same. In making application the company repre - ented that it had but recently installed a new switchboard, extended ts cable plant and made the city exchange full metallic. It also tated that a solicitation of the subscribers witbin the city has been ompleted and that out of a total of 288, 265 had consented to take tie metallic service, while but 23 had refused and were still receiving rounued service. On this representation it appeared that a large najority of the subscribers within the city were favorable to the me - allic service and the Commission approved the application. Subse - quent to the issuance of the order to that effect, protest was entered y a number of the patrons at Ashland, and on August 31, 1914, the ommission issued a supplemental order, cancelling the order of ap val, the purpose being, as stated, to leave "the telephone situation Ashland just as it was prior to the issuance of the order of Affgust 4." Whereupon the matter was set down for hearing for Octo - 1914. The protest of the patrons is based principally on the ground, (1) that the patron has the right to select the kind of service he desires and that th &gt; company cannot arbitrarily require him to change, (2) that misrepresentation was used by the company in soliciting subscrib - ers from grounded to metallic service, and (3) that because of an agree - ment with the farmers on the exchange it will be impossible for the company to give full grounded service for a period of five years. In answer the company contends ( 1 ) that the physical conditions within the city of Ashland, due to the existence of an electric light plant, make the operation of a grounded telephone system a practical impossibility, and that imperative reconstruction of the property be- </seg>

A roinyj cannot Mtapa Um Bhilai t Ion tfcl is upon it as a common earrier to furnish such service as may be ii fined in its schedules upon demand, provided such schedules are at proved by the Commission and the patron pays or offers in paj for til same. The question here involwil is as to whether such a schedule irrevocable, or. whether yood public policy justifies a company, suhjec of course, to the supervision of the Commission, in ex. •, n« judgment and discretion as lo how and when its plant shall constructed ana improved, not withstanding it is unable i,, unanimous consent of all its patrons. In considering the proposition here presented it appears n&lt; to consider the essential difference between a mounded and metalli telephone plant and the conditions that may make ii nrrm— r] I change from one to the other. The first type of telephone that beeara commercially successful was that commonly referred to as the ground* system. In this type there is a single wire running from the telephon instrument to the central office, this wire being mounded at elthe end, the electric circuit thus Mag completed through the earth In der favorable conditions this system affords efficient lerviee ai minimum of investment and operating cost. In the operatioi of such plants, however, serious disadvantages developed, th most serious arising from interference with the talking circuit fron electrical currents in the earth. It was found that these current cause cross talk between the lines, bring noises of \arious kinds to th. talking circuit and at times make intelligent communication Intpossib t Cross talk is also caused by induction between the wires themselw and if there are a large number of wires on one pole line this troubl&lt; is aggravated. The introduction of currents from an electric pener ating plant into the field of a telephone system invariably create: havoc with the service. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 177 I 1 II in n t this difficulty it has been found necessary to lecond wire for each circuit, thus dispensing with the circuit th. The complete metallic circuit thus provided over- ly the trouble from earth currents, and at the same through a transposition of the wires at certain intervals, makes le the prevention of induction from one circuit to another. The ir.iasc is important for the reason that it permits the enclos- number of wires within a cable. While the wires of winded plant tun be placed in a cable, the result is far from satis - &gt;r&gt; because ot the induction, which, of course, is increased as the s are brought in closer proximity to each other. Trees interfere tly with telephone wires and in a grounded system, where there are number of wires on the poles, trouble from this source is gen very much aggravated. The enclosing of the wires in a cable he possibility of interference from such sources, does away trouble arising from the open, non-insulated wires coming t with each other and affords protection from the weather. other hand, the overcoming of induction by the use of metallic makes it practical and very desirable to enclose them in circuits, larly in the territory close to the central office, where the wires tierous. The installation of a metallic system, it will be seen from the -. is a logical step in the development of a telephone plant, and be rendered imperative by changing physical conditions. While ncied plants are still very generally in use they are rapidly Ailh metallic equipment, as it is recognized by experienced men that when a grounded plant has been in service for from twelve years and reconstruction becomes necessary sound ' and the public service demand the substitution of metallic nt. The public is gradually demanding a higher standard of telephone men understand that sooner or later the patrons pany will demand metallic service. To replace a grounded with a grounded plant, when it is reasonably certain the better equipment will be demanded in the course of time, is economy, both from the standpoint of the company and the public, exceedingly unwise when the physical conditions become such that impossible to operate the grounded plant satisfactorily. The in - ing use of electricity for light, heat and power makes the future of ;rounded plant more or less uncertain and precarious. It would ap- IV ear, therefore, that ordinary business foresight should prompt a com - any to anticipate the changing over of its plant from a grounded to a letallic basis, and that it should plan, and should be permitted, to make Mil change at the time most advantageous for it. When that time rrives it does not appear reasonable that it should be prevented from taking the improvement because a small number of subscribers ob - &gt;ct to the change. The responsibility of determining when to make ecessary improvements is upon the company. The subscribers demand </seg>

The record discloses that in ier to relieve the bad condition of the service resulting interference of electric currents generated by a lighting plant wn and because the wires constituting the grounded system had congested as to be continually causing trouble, and for the son that the portions of the plant had to be rebuilt, the Telephone Company, from whom applicant later acquired installed a large amount of cable, practically covering the the Ashland exchange with its cable plant. In order to the induction as was possible without making the tely metallic, the lines in the cable were made metallic, led at the switchboard and at the instruments.

When it became necessary, therefore, to mah-j the "cutover' to metallic, there were nineteen, in addition to those who had originally refused to accept the new service, who were arbitrarily charged the new rates. Notwithstanding the misrepresentation referred to, the record da not sustain the contention of remonstrators that contracts were ob - tained by duress and threats. During the period from August 2 2 to August 31, the interval covered by the order of the Commission auth - orizing the cancellation of the grounded rates, it was proper for ap - plicant to insist that all patrons take the metallic service and pay the rates that had been approved for same. If, in attempting to collect such rates during that period, threats were made of discontinuing th&lt; service in event of nonpayment, that could hardly be construed aa a part of the campaign looking to the installation of the new servie In their zeal in endeavoring to induce patrons to agree to take the metallic service the representatives of the company may ha dieted, and no doubt did predict, that the majority would consent and that in that event the grounded service w ished. While that may have constituted an inducemer sign, it could hardly be interpreted as a threat. Ind remonstrators testified that they withheld giving th change for the reason that they desired to learn what the r consent to take the service, declining for one reason sign contracts. Of the latter number 61 actually paid for the new sen vice. There are 261 subscribers on the city exchange. Of that number, therefore, 199, or over 75 per cent, indicated a willingness to sub - scribe to the new rates and service. Of the 28 remonstrators who testified at the hearing, 20 had refused to sign contracts or agree to take the new service, although 2 of this number paid for the metallic service and 1 offered to take it if the majority did. Eight signing contracts subsequently became dissatisfied, for various reasons, and re - fused to pay the new rates. It is clear, however, that a large majority of remonstrate! s are those who were opposed to the change from the first, largely because of the increase in the rates, and who were, there - fore, not influenced by any representations made by the company. proposed to do.

            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 183 emonstrators submitted a petition, representing about 135 telephones, rawn in the form of a demand upon the company to reinstall ground - il service. As this petition was circulated in October, at which time, the supplemental order of the Commission, both schedules of were on file, it oan hardly be accepted as a test of the demand for the reason that at that time the metallic equip- t was in operation and it was possible to secure the improved ser- e grounded rates. It is quite significant, however, that but ore than 50 per cent of the subscribers could be induced to en under such favorable circumstances. From this analysis the results of the campaign and the subsequent counter campaign, ' Commission is convinced that a substantial majority of the city jscribers on its exchange were favorable to the installation of a illic system. While, as stated in the fore part of this opinion, the ige from grounded to metallic cannot be made wholly contingent the wishes of the subscribers, their preferences, should, of course, ven consideration. If a substantial majority indicated a desire metallic plant the improvement should not be abandoned solely ■ the consent of every subscriber cannot be obtained. It is a il impossibility to secure unanimous consent to any proposition, atter how meritorious it may be. As we have shown, the phya - exigencies of the situation at Ashland demanded a change and while the consent of all patrons was very much to be desired the lecessities were such that the change had to be made even if there were some patrons to object to it. The misrepresentations made are :o be deplored, but the company appears to have made an honest ef- rt to correct them, and in any event they were not so serious as to ike impossible an ultimate understanding that will be mutually sat - actory. (3) Did applicant enter into an agreement with the farm sub - scribers on the Ashland exchange, under the terms of which the present grounded rates are not to be disturbed for a period of five years, and, if so, does that make impossible satisfactory metallic ser - vice in the city of Ashland? It is admitted by applicant that it entered into an agreement with the Telephone Committee of the Farmers' Union of Saunders County, that the toll and farm line rates for the Ashland exchange would not be changed for a period of five years without the consent of said organization, said agreement being made subject to modification by this Commission. While it does not so state, the presumption is that the grounded service on farm lines will be continued during the life of the contract. The record is not clear as to when the agreement was entered into, but references to it make it appear that it was some time during the &gt;*&gt;ar 1914. Remonstrators insist that the existence of this agreement makes impossible the complete reconstruction of the Ashland exchange on a metallic basis, for five years at least, and that during that period the </seg>

This would require about one-half mile of con- oi in dod farm lines are not necessarily a bar to the making of the remainder of the plant metallic. A combination of grounded and metallic equipment is common in the state. In fact, the transition from the one to the other frequently must be gradual for reasons of economic construction. It happens that certain lines need to be reconstructed. They may be in town or in the country. It may be cheaper in the long run to make them metallic than to replace them with grounded construction and later, as the plant develops, find it necessary to again rebuild them so as to make them metallic.

As any particular Class of subscribers are put upon a metallic basis, however, the ground - ed rates are cancelled. The situation at Ashland, therefore, is not different than at many other points in the state. In determining, therefore, whether the failure to make the farm lines on this exchange metallic constitutes an undue discrimination against city subscribers, we have these factors to consider: (1) The existence of an electric light plant in the city and its operation *hrougrhout the entire day made the operation of a grounded system in the city impossible. (2) The bulk of the traffic in which city subscribers are inter- ested is within the city itself, and the use of the farm lines is therefor* of minor concern to them. (3) The combination of grounded and metallic plants is not common and is recognized as a necessity from the standpoint nomic development. (4) The agreement entered into between the company and th farmers Is contingent upon the authority of this Commission to chan it and can be abrogated at any time the public service any rec Prom these considerations it would appear that the cont of the record and all the facts bearing on U it necessarily follows that the Commission applicant was justified in changing its plant i tallic equipment and that it should be permitted to cat now in effec*. for grounded service within th ORIiKK IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, that the supplemental order issued by the Nebraska State Railway Commission under date of August 31, 1914, suspending an order issued by this Commission under date of August 22, 1914, be. and the same hereby is. cancelled.

The two rules are similar, with the exception that bot and open cars are covered in the Nebraska Classification the other lefers only to closed oars. "Flat or gondola" cars are conn in separate rules by item 690 in I. 1'. (i. F. O. Circular No hearing held on this application, they offered no ewdenee and mad&lt; no objection to the carrier's request. The dunnage allowance is of com paratively recent origin, the rule having been made effective in t state in June, 1912. A consideration of the testimony offered by Mr. R, C. Fyfe chairman of the Western Classification Committee, prompts the opin Rule 105, Trans-Missouri Units Circular 1 F, the allowance in eith instance being unlimited. "Dunnage," as used in this connection, is the material Mad at furnished by shippers, loading their goods in bulk, for the purpose bracing, staying, supporting or protecting the same in the cars while transit.

The further contention is that its continuant will invite increasingly numerous demands for the waiving of packii requirements in order to eliminate the cost of packages and reduce tl weight of goods, and that it is the nature of the goods shipped ai their liability to damage in transit that renders iliMd n. rather than the protection of carriers' equipment. While representatives of certain shippers were present at tl </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 189 1 on that the claims of the carriers as outlined above are well founded. The practice permitted to shippers of loading goods in bulk is in it - self a privilege that relieves them of the expense and labor of boxing iting. enables them to expedite loading, and at the same time fir freight charges. It does not appear that in addition to ntages they are entitled to an allowance for the free car- e of the material which makes bulk shipments possible, particularly ii .sin h allowance creates a discrimination against the shipper who nil himself of it, and when it increases the liability of risk rier through damage to the goods. That the saving to the hipper through the waiving of the rule requiring boxing or crating it times substantial, is shown in the following illustration offered Mr. Fyfe: "Formerly all pianos were required to be boxed. Some years the piano manufacturers came before the Classification Com- tce with the proposition, which was submitted by Mr. Conway, the Kimball Company, of Chicago, to handle pianos harnessed the car, and IIHJJ stated that it would save them the cost of the boxes and that it enabled them to load more quickly and likewise reduce their freight cost. As an example of the saving to piano men, I figured an example from Omaha to North Platte, on the basis of a carload of pianos. The weight of eighteen boxes, at the very lowest possible figure, would be 200 pounds per box, and that would be 3600 pounds. 3600 pounds at .604 cents hundred pounds, the rate from Omaha to North Platte, was ired and it showed a saving in freight cost at $21.74. The ry lowest value that could be placed on the piano boxes would 36.00. making; a total saving; to the piano manufacturer of 74. Now from that, to get at the actual figures, should be deducted $10. M, which is approximately the cost of harnessing and bracing in the car, leaving a net saving of $47.74." Vnder the present dunnage rule the shipper would also be entitled he free carriage of 500 pounds of the material used in harnessing pianos in the car, representing a freight charge of $3.02. In other words, the shipper loading in bulk has the advantage over the shipper ivho boxes nis pianos of $50.76 on the carload. In son.e cases the ature of the article prevents shippers from loading without boxing r crating, while other shippers, handling similar goods, can avail hemselves of the privilege. In that event, the one is required to ay transportation charges on the container in which his goods are shipped while the other is relieved of that expense. The carrier has a direct interest at this point also, in the increased risk occasioned by the bulk loading. The one shipper provides a secure container that insures the safe transit of the goods to their destination, while the other is permitted to employ a method of loading that materially increases the liability of damage. It is undoubtedly the duty of the carriers to provide adequate equipment, suited so far as is practicable to the needs and requirements of the traffic, but some portion of the burden rests upon the shipper, to the extent at least of preparing his goods for shipment, so that it may reasonably be expected that they will be transported safely under ordinary conditions. If the carrier </seg>

The Interstate Commerce Commission has permitted th« lation of the dunnage rule on interstate traffic in southw tern tory. (I. &amp; S. Docket No. 354 — 30 1. C. C, 531-646.)

The only data with refer to earnings and expenses submitted by our accounting departmen was a summary of the annual reports made by the company for the pas seven years. The record in the case is therefore so incomplete and unreliable that it is impossible to arrive at any definite conclusions with reference to the actual results of oixration. By the use of suet figures as can be relied on. however, and by comparisons with other companies of like size, it is possible to reach a conclusion with refer ence to the rates n ppl ic«I for that will be approximately equitable. The increase in the grounded business rate applied for would feet 19 subscribers at Monroe, 17 at I'latte Center, and 3 at T or a total of 39. The annual increase in revenue would amount t $468. It is proper to explain at this point that the exchange at Platt Center is owned jointly by the applicant and th.- Farm. is Indeiienden Telephone Company, but is cpe rated under a contrart arrangement b applicant. The application for the increase at I'lati. Oaator is joine in by the Farmers Independent Telephone Company. While there ar 34 business telephones on this exchange that will be affected by th changed rate, but 17 of :heni are included in this statement, the re^ enue from the others going to the other company. Applicant submitted at the himrlBi an itemized statement of ej pense for each of the exchanges affected. Where actual figures wer available they were used, but a number of items were prorated an'on ing to subscribers' stations. The following: is a summarized staU ment covering the three exchanges: STATEMENT SHOWINC. COST OF OPERATION" OF EXCHANGE!

            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 199 The reproduction new value of the property in the three exchanges, Commission's engineer, Mr. Forbes, was $18,571.20. the opinion of Mr. Forbes, is very conservative, and than that claimed by applicant. It was made from s ry furnished by the company and after a personal inspection perty by our engineers. Following its compilation it was ?ertain items of equipment had been omitted, but the tig llowed to stand without change. Assuming that the expenditures for maintenance, as shown above, iormal — and as they average but a trifle over $3.00 per station, assumption is reasonable — an allowance of 6 per cent on the Mluction value for depreciation appears necessary, particularly »w of the fact that the value as found is conservative. This would jce $1,114.27 annually, which, added to the total operating ex- pense, as shown above, results in a total charge against revenue of $4.1 78.46. The present revenue from the three exchanges is $4,866. a balince of $687.54 is left for dividends on the stork outstand- Prorating the capital stock on the basis of the subscribers' sta - we have $10,366 as the apportionment for these exchanges. which at 7 per cent should earn $725.62. It is apparent, therefore, that on this basis the present rates are not compensatory. And there Is y reason to believe that the figures used come short of reflecting al ronditions. President Bratt testified that it is not the practice office: s of the company to make any charge against the cofi.pany iveling expenses. He also testified that he owns two automo- biles that are devoted entirely to the service of the company, for which no charge is made. The members of the board of w.iom there are seven, receive no compensation. It will ?d, moreover, that no allowance is made in the figures shown ollectible accounts, fire insurance, legal expense, stationery and ng, bookkeeping and other general items of expense that are y company and must certainly be present in the one ration, although not accounted for in these figures. As act, the record is clear that the management has always xercised extreme economy in the operation of the system, and that the olicy prevails of attempting to conduct it on a "cost" basis. Expenses in the future will increase. The system has reached the point where it can no longer be operated on the present basis. The demand for improved se:vice and up-to-date equipment is already press - ing, as is indicated by service complaints registered with the Commis - sion in recent months. Connection with the toll system of the Ne - braska Telephone Company requires a higher standard of equipment and service than was necessary when only local service was rendered. If the company is to install and keep a modern system of bookkeeping, — and the Commission is of the opinion that it should, — another sub- stantial item of expense will be added that is not now provided for.

Owing to the necessity for cer- rk. however, it is not to become effective until nipleted, which is to be not later than February in service asked for in this application is based the traffic has fallen off and the decreasing rev - sary to effect economies. Statements taken from ompany bear out this allegation. The gross rev- k. re system for the eight months from February to tl ive. was $!•,(•!. 41 less than for the corresponding f 1913. While the reduction is common to practically all of in the system, it is perhaps more sharply emphasized on the lved in this application for the reason that the service was i on these about a year ago. In June, 1913, a twenty-minute rom South street to the Penitentiary and to the State Hospital installed, replacing the forty minute service then in effect. The wine statement presents a comparison of the earnings on all the involved for the period from January 1st to October 1st, 1913, \Vliil&lt;&gt; it wns expected at the time the added service was installed it would increase the traffic, the statement shows that the in- nted to only $5.00 for the nine months. At the same time rs. due to the added equipment, increased from 30423 to [» 1 1 1 &gt; . and this reduced the per car hour earnings from $1.96 to $1.76. ■nt shows an increase for the State Hospital and Peniten - lartag 1913, but it also shows a corresponding decrease he Tenth and Twelfth street lines, indicating that traffic in the ply settled portions of the territory was transferred from the short- ars to those covering the longer lines. In other words, a portion the existing traffic was shifted to the cars furnishing the new ser - p but there was no increase in revenue. The territory between South street and the Penitentiary and be - pfn South street and the State Hospital is sparsely settled, although ■ eloping steadily. At the present time it does not appear to justify ontinuous twenty-minute service during the winter months when the ffic is light. Applicant claims that by the shifting of the service proposed in the present application, together with the reduction in vice, it will be possible to save the expense of one car and crew. :&gt;1 1913 1914 Gross Car Hours Gross Car Hours Hospital 113.373.35 7005 $15,990.12 9376 entiary 11,161.73 6345 13, 234. 88 9343 i 10th St 21.771.72 9680 20,761.41 9512 i 12th 11.700.96 7393 8,026.11 4669 fotal $58,007.76 30423 $58,012.52 32900 'arninf-'s per &lt;-;u- hour, $1.96 Av. earnings per car hour, $1.76 </seg>

In dis - continuing the Goehner exchange the company proposes to connect 11 of the present Goehner phones with the Taniora exchange and then xtend the service for those phones to an additional exchange, leaving the choice of the additional exchange to the majority of the subscribers on each particular line. Doubtless the choice of all subscribers on all s for an additional exchange will be the Seward exchange. The en - service then would include the present Goehner subscribers, Tamora ward, and the rates would be as follows: Business phones, (2.00, 1 others $1.50 per month with an additional charge of twenty-five &gt;er month for Beaver Crossing. Milford or Utica. The company's Exhibit "C" shows that the rental revenue for eleven months, ending November 30, 1914, was $737, total toll collections $291, making the tal revenue, including tolls, $1,028. And when we deduct three - urths of the tolls from the above amount we have a net exchange nue of $810. During this period the expenses were $7"&gt;1, leaving balance of exchange earnings, applicable to depreciation and turns, $59 for eleven months, or at the rate of about $6."&gt; per year. From the above showing it will be necessary to raise the rates i the Goehner exchange in order that it may be self-sustaining, or do ny with the exchange and connect the subscribers with the ex- change at Taniora. it being but four miles from Goehner and the nearest exchange to that point. The serious objection urged by the patrons of the company is that it will tend to divide the community and that it will be impossible for phone users in some instances to t their near neighbors without going through extra exchanges and ying additional rates for the same. This contention is not based on a pioprr understanding of the service that would be rendered by the proposition made by the applicant, because if all Goehner sub- scribers are placed on the Taniora exchange they will receive the same service that they are now receiving on that exchange, except that their connections will be made at the exchange at Tamora instead of present exchange at Goehner. The subscribers will not only get Tamora but will get Seward, which will give them connections with a much larger and more extended service. The Commission is of the opinion that the proposed change will result in more efficient service and. at the same time, connections with a greater number of phone users, but is also of the opinion that the number of business phones on a line should be limited to not more than six. It is true that the proposed change will cut off the towns of Beaver Crossing and I'tlca from the present service, but the addition of Seward ce tainly more than compensates this loss, as Seward is the county seat with which all phone users require connections. It was contended at the hearing by the committee representing the phone users that the number of subscribers had been reduced to forty-eight on the Goehner exchange </seg>

Patrons of the company leceiving the arty-line service at the same rate furnished the individual line users ave been complaining to the company of the discrimination and in- sting on single-line service. To furnish the single-line service to all he patrons of the company in the towns served will require an ex- penditure on the part of the company estimated by its officers not less than Jl,"00.00. In order to wipe out the discrimination and be in a position to furnish the two classes of service the appli- ant desires the approval of the following schedule of rates: Business Phones ngle line desk set phones $2.00 Party line desk set phones 1.75 Single line wall phones 1.75 Party line wall phones 1.50 Residence Phones Single line desk set phones $1.50 'Party line desk set phones 1.25 Single line wall phones 1.25 Party line wall phones 1.00 It is the opinion of the officers of the company that with the higher rates charged for the single-line service, to-wit, 25 cents per month, very few if any additional demands will be made upon it for the single-line service. In such case the additional revenue accruing to the company from the rates proposed would aggregate $357.00 year. The testimony shows that the applicant has neve:- declared divi- dends in excess of 6 per cent to its stockholders, and that while it has devoted its surplus earnings to additions and extensions, its main- tenance expenditures, by reason of the aging condition of its plant, are gradually increasing.

            <seg id="p260">260 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT quested, the additional costs occasioned by special service alleged to be necessary would more than counterbalance any increased revenue. The Commission is sufficiently advised of the income and ex - penses of petitioner incident to its railway ope ations to know that under its present schedule of rates petitioner could not, in justice H itself and tho public as a whole, be expected or required to operate the new line as an additional service, particularly if the pat ons of the present Randolph line are reasonably served under the proposed changes. An examination of the plat showing the lines and territory af - fected discloses the fact that under the proposed plan but few if any patrons will be more than three blocks from a car line, ana ex - cluding the patrons on that portion of N street between 1 Sth and 26th streets who are served by the said O street lines anil the school pat ons, it, is the opinion of the Commission that the change In route will convenience a greater number than those who may bn in - ronvenienced. Some objection was made to the proposed re-routing on tin ground that citizens had invested and located their peaces of busmen or homes with reference to the present se vice. The Public Utilities Commission for the Second District of New York, in the case of Schoellkopf HoHing Co. vs. International Kail- way Company to satisfy the same "When it appears that the cars of a street railway company are carrying substantially all of those who would avail them - selves of transportation over its lines in a certain territory, no matter what changes are made in the routes, and it also app&lt; that there would be no substantial increase in income, the Conv mission should hesitate in making an order for a new line of railroad, or the increase in the number of cars then in use, which would add considerably to the operating expenses of the company; for it is equally the duty of the Commission to conserve the inter- ests of the railway company while satisfying the demands of the traveling public." The Commission is of the opinion that application to discontin^ the service on the Randolph line between 18th and M streets and 26th and J streets via 26th and N streets, and the re- outing of same, via the proposed line, is reasonable and should be granted. On the question of charging the cost of the construction of the new line to capital account. It is contended by the petitioner that such raj Company (Case No. 2578), has said: "In the settlement of these questions, the right of the public to have adequate, convenient and proper service upon the street car lines of the respondent, is paramount to all other considera- tions; there is no duty imposed upon either Railway Company or this Commission to so route the cars of the company that the property values and business conditions along such routes will be preserved or enhanced; such considerations have no place in the decision which should be arrived at in this case, except as they bear directly upon the convenience and necessity of the traveling public; and even such ability and facilities of the Rail- </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 261 a charge is just, inasmuch as the construction thereof ig occasioned by reason of no acts of its own but by reason of the location of the Mid high school ty the public and the demand of the public fo. the said service, and that there would be no occasion for said new line and service, nor could any reasonable demand for the same be maintained except for the location of the high school. Petitioner proposes in the event it is permitted to remove any portion of its X st eet track to use the same in the construction of the new line and that only the actual expenditures made in removing the N street tracks and con - structing the new line shall be so charged. Inasmuch as the question of the removal of the N street tracts was not submitted to the Commission at this time, but .emains subject to future action by either the city authorities or the Commission, no definite findings can be made. At the proper time after investiga - tion and hearing, final disposition of the question will be made in a supplemental order. Petitioner submits that its action in the premises is voluntary and it cannot reasonably be expected to proceed with the construc - tion of the new line unless it be permitted to charge its actual cost to capital account; that the only resources available for the payment of the cost thereof is by the sale of its securities, and that it must be given an affirmative ruling In this regard beto e it can and will proceed. It is contended on the other hand that that portion of the Ran - dolph line on N street proposed to be abandoned is unnecessary du - plication, anu that capital account should be charged at this time only with thu excess cost of the new line ove. and above that of the abandoned line. In the minds of the Commission there are four reasons why this contention should not obtain at this time: First. The petitioner herein is not in the first instance respon - sible for the duplication. The line in question was built by a com - peting company, which entered the transportation field in Lincoln long after the petitioner had constructed and operated its O street lines. The city was a party to the proposition in that it granted the franchise to the competing company. The competing company in the construction of the line in question, which served as a trunk not only to the Randolph street line but the East S, Vine street and North 25th street lines and the business portion of the city, exercised rea - sonably souna business judgment. The subsequent merging and con - solidation of the two companies with the resulting application of a virtually universal transfer system was of great benefit to the city. Can it in justice or equity demand and receive all the benefits of such consolidation and bear none of the burdens? We think not. Second. The line in question has not been definitely abandoned and removed. </seg>
            <seg id="p262">EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT 262 Third. The construction of the new line is occasioned by the action of the city in locating the new high school, and through no act of the petitioner. The element of adaptation in property invest - ment cost is here presented in striking form. Fourth. The accumulated maintenance and depreciation funa resulting f.om the railway operations of petitioner is sufficient only to provide for the current and deferred maintenance or depreciation of the railway property as it may accrue f.om operation, and is not calculated to take care of an unusual item of this character and amount. The payment of the cost of the new line out of this fund in an amount equal to the cost of the abandoned line would so deplete the same as to prevent the maintenance to say nothing of improving the present condition of its existing track and equipment. Had th3 company been permitted to charge the customa y five - cent fare, and by reason thereof been able to accumulate a larger maintenance and depreciation fund than that necessary to meet the usual depreciation resulting from wear and tea:, or, failing that, m earning an excessive return on the value of the property, there would be good grounds to sustain such a contention. No such condition does or has existed. We are of the opinion, the efore, and so find, that petitioner in the event that it constructs the new line under discussion, should be authorized, upon satisfactory proof being made to this Commission to charge the actual cost thereof to capital account. In the event that petitioner shall remove the X Stree petitioner will be required to account to: the same in U w manner: First. The cost of removing same shall be charged tion account Second.

            <seg id="p264">264 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT thence north to S, thence east on S to 34th, which was the end of the line. Cars were being operated over this line from the Govern- ment Square at intervals of fifteen minutes. The applicant also owned and operated what is known as the Vine Street line, which extended east from 27th on Vine to 33rd and Vine. On this line a 30-minute service was being given from the Government Square. Some time just prior to the above date referred to, the ap- plicant extended the Vine Street line one block east to 34th and Vine and its East S Street line north from 34th and S to 34th and Vine, where it joined the Vine Street line. This construction completed a loop, beginning at 27th and O streets, as follows: — North on 27th to Vine, thence east on Vine to 34th, thence south on 34th to S, thence west on S to 30th, thence south on 30th to R, thence west on R to 29th, thence south on 29th to O, thence west on O to 27th and O, at which point all cars from the above district referred to, the Cemetery line, which runs east on O to Wyuka Cemetery, and the Havelock and l'niversity Place lines converge and come down O street to the center of the city and around the Government Square. On or about November 1, 1913, and subs* quent to the construction of the track connecting the two line applicant herein changed the routing of its cars on the two lin substituted therefor a 12-minute service, as follow;;: — Al out from the Government Square and business section were routed over the original Vine Street line to 33d and V thence over the connecting track above referred to to ::4th and and thence back to the Government Square over the rout original S Street line. In addition to this, the ser coming In from the loop was extended to the Burli station. Formal complaint. No. 222. was filed by &lt;itiz near the S Street line and east and north of 29th and t complaint was made of the substituted service Before discontinuing the former service and a substitution therefor, the Traction Company should have secured an order of the Commission granting authority so to do.

            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 265 suant to such franchise right, it will be enjoined from removing such lines or withdrawing its cars from such service without first obtaining authority from the State Railway Commission so to do It was also incumbent on the Traction Company to show to the Commission that it had a franchise for the use of the streets from 33d to 34th on Vine and from 34th and Vine to 34th and S, upon which to construct, maintain and operate its street car facilities. The failure on the part of the company to procure the above order re - ferred to and to show that it was clothed with proper franchise rights was sufficient to warrant the Commission in ordering the old service restored. Since tbe order of the Commission in Formal Complaint No. 222, directing the old service to be restored, the citizens of Lin - coln have granted a franchise to the company for the use of the streets over which the connecting line had previously been built. This was followed by the application herein on the part of the Lincoln Traction Company in which it asks for authority to re-route all Vine and East S street cars around the loop to the right; that is to say, all cars to run north from 27th and O to 27th and Vine, thence east to 34th and Vine, thence south to 34th and S, thence back to 27th and O by way of the original S Street line, with a 12-minute service extending to the Burlington station. The present service on Vine Street is thirty minutes and extends only to 33d and Vine and around the Government Square, and the service on S Street is fifteen minutes and extends from 34th and S to the Government Square, which leaves the four blocks from 34th and S to 33d and Vine without service, and no service to the Burlington station. The application is accom - panied by petitions signed by several hundred citizens in the vi - cinity of the two lines, in which they ask for the proposed change, and as far as the Commission can determine, almost all of the citi - zens living on and adjacent to the Vine Street line desire the change. Those living within from two to three blocks east of 27th and north of 0 have a three-minute service on 27th and those living just north of O Street and east of 2 7th have a 15-minute service on the Ceme - tery line. The Commission realizes that those citizens living south and east of the east halt of the S Street line will be inconvenienced by the proposed change by about four or five minutes longer ride on the outgoing trips, but this is compensated for, to some extent at least, by the fact that the proposed change will give them a 12-minute service, not only to the Government Square but to the Burlington passenger station. The proposed change will also give a 12-minute service to the four blocks of new track which is now without any service. It will also give a 12-minute service to all of the Vine Street people instead of a 30-minute service, and a service which will extend tc the Burlington passenger station instead of the Government Square. The proposed change will also give a 12-minute service between the Burlington passenger station and the Rock Island station, which is an element to be considered, as there is no service to the Burlington </seg>

After careful consideration of all elements that enter into the question of this service, the Commission has concluded, and is unanimously of the opinion, that a greater number of people will be better served by the proposed change than by the service that is now being given over the two lines, and that the former order In Formal Complaint No. 222 should be vacated and set aside. The Commission is also of the opinion, however, that the Lincoln Traction Company should make a complete traffic study for a period of at least thirty days from the taking effect of the order herein, and make a report of the same to the Commission. Said report should show the number of passengers carried in and out on each car, that the Commission may be advised as to the congestion on the cars dur - ing peak hours. If the equipment should prove to be inadequate to take care of the traffic during the peak hours it will be necessary to put on larger cars or a greater number of cars.

A hearing on the above application was held August 31, 1915, at the law office of Albert &amp; Wagner in Columbus. Applicant was represented by C. J. Garlow; Respondent, Oldenbusch Telephone Company, by Albert &amp; Wagner. Hall, Commissioner: The Humphrey Telephone Company represents to the Commission that its switching charge to farm lines of $3.00 per year is not only non-remunerative but is resulting in a loss to the applicant. The Humphrey Telephone Company's entire system consists of three exchanges which are located at Cornlea, Humphrey and Cres - ton. The switching service in question is all performed at Creston exchange but the service includes connection to the other two ex- hanges. The application is based on the theory that farm lines that are being switched and are receiving the service of the entire system should pay a certain per cent of the operating expenses of the central office and central office equipment and that fhe per cent should be determined by the relation of the number of phones switched to the number of phones or subscribers' stations owned by the applicant on that exchange. In support of this the applicant submitted to the Commission the following statement as to the operating costs of the central office and central office equipment at Creston: 50.00 30.00 Office expenses, postage, etc Directory expense 9980.90 Total the part of the respondents that the question is, what portion of are being switched pay? There is no contention upon the $980.90 is unreasonable, but this amount should the lines that The applicant has on its Creston exchange 52 city and 101 rural subscribers and is switching 59 farm line phones, making a total of 212. The $980.90 makes a cost per pbone of $4.62 per year. The company owns and maintains five city circuits to the city limits to which the farm lines connect. For the maintenance and return on the investment in the circuits the company has included an item of $60.00 per year, and while this is only an estimate, the Commission is of the opinion that it is not excessive. This will add $1.02 per Operators' wages $636.0 ntereat and depreciation on central office equipment, 15T of reproduction value 84.9 Maintenance of central office equipment 50.0 nsurance and taxes on central office equipment . . 10.0 tent on central office building 120.0 </seg>

The cost statement includes another item of $189.01 for service to the balance of the exchange. The Commission is unable to in - clude this Item as the costs above set out are for the purpose of furnishing connections with the entire system. There might be an element of cost that shouM be considered in this item, but the Com - mission is of the opinion that it is entirely too remote. Prom the above analysis of the switching operating costs, th Commission is of the opinion that fifty cents per month is reasonabl and should be allowed.

You ask for my opinion as to "whether plications and bonds are sufficient as to form, substance and tion, and whether they will protect parties storing grain at the several warehouses of said applicant.' Answering will say no objection can be urged as to the financial standing of either the principal or surety. Each bond is signed in a similar manner. The principal signed where the surety should ha signed, and the surety signed where the principal should have signed This should be corrected. If that were the only objection, the bond might be approved, since that is a matter that can easily be remedied. However, in the body of the bond is the following: "Now Therefore, If said The I'pdike Grain Co. shall faith- fully discharge and perform such duties as such public grain warehouseman, and shall fully and unreservedly comply with all laws of this state and rules of the commission in relation thereto, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.

To this there is serious objection. If it were intended to be a bond, it failed to observe the statute. Section 2 of Senate . chapter 243, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1915, provides: Every public warehouse shall each year file application the state railway commission for license to do business inder the terms of this act. « • » • The application shall ompanied both by a bond running to the state of Nebraska i amount equal to the full value of all the grain it may in store at any one time, and by a receipt from the state rer showing payment of the annual license fee of two for each warehouse operated." 3, supra, provides: pon approval of the bond by the state railway commis- MM shall be issued, good until January 1 of the follow- er. would seem to negative the provision that the bond should . effect from year to year. (It should not be embodied rt-i J n of the bond that the Updike Grain Company "shall ml perform such duties as such public grain lseman, and shall fully and unreservedly comply with all laws state and rules of the commission in relation thereto," is not tly specific as to what such duties are.

Where, under such circumstances, it is shown that the rail - 1 company is willing to construct the overhead crossing if the nant will pay the cost of construction and maintenance, there ufficient ground of complaint against the railroad company.

It was allegvd in the complaint that Postle is a lhe-stock ealer and farmer; that he Is the owner of 160 acres of land de - cribed in the complaint, and across the corner of his land the rail - oad company has constructed and now operates a railway; that the iresent farm crossing over the railway is situated at the east end f a deep cut where it is impossible to properly observe the ap - iroach of trains; that its use is dangerous to man and beast, and lthough he has requested the railway company to establish an over - ieaded railway crossing, it refuses to do so. The railroad company, .mong other things, denied the allegations of the complaint and al- </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT ltged that the complainant purchased his farm long subsequent to the construction of its railway; that at the time its line was built the railroad company constructed a grade crossing over its railway for the use of the then owner of the land at a place and in a man - ner satisfactory to him. Therefore, the complainant is estopped to contend for another or different crossing. It was further alleged in the answer that, notwithstanding the foregoing facts, the railroad company is willing to construct another grade crossing for complain - ant at a point easterly and more distant from the cut; that the con - struction of an overhead crossing will require the expenditure of a large sum of money and will give the complainant a benefit and advantage not enjoyed by land owners generally in the state of Ne - braska along the defendant's railway; will discriminate in his favor and will amount to the taking of the railroad company's property without compensation, without due process of law, and in violation of section 3, art. I, of the Constitution of the state of Nebraska, and in violation of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Consti- tiitioi; of the lnite'1 States. The tions presented by the pleadings railway company to construct and prayed for by the complaint. Comniission investigated the ques - and made an order requiring the maintain an overhead crossing as Appellant contends that the 0 diction of the complaint, for the volved the adjudication of private of judicial power with which the is some force in this contention I determine that question. It is things, that the facts, as shown by imimission erred in assuming j reason that its determination rights and therefore is an exei Commission is not vested. T ut we do not find it necessar further contended, ai the evidence, do not authorize Commission to require the railroad company to construct and main - tain an overhead crossing for the exclusive accommodation of the complainant. Section 6042, Rev. St. 1913. provides: "When any per - son owns land on both sides of any railroad, the corporation owning such railroad shall, when required so to do, make and keep in good repair one causeway or other adequate means of crossing the same." In Omaha &amp; R. V. R. Co. V. Severin, 30 Neb. :il8, the court stated what an adequate crossing is, as contemplated by the statute. It appears that a crossing, as thus defined, had been constructed by the railroad company under an agreement entered into with the owner of the farm, when it obtained its right-of-way, and so far as the record shows that crossing has been maintained by the company and has been used by the complainant and his grantors for about 27 years without injury to any person. It also appears that the com - pany obtained its right-of-way by condemnation proceedings in which it paid the owner of the land at that early date the sum of $1,900. This, of course, included the value of the land taken and the incidental damages to the rest of the farm, such as inconvenient use, and all other elements of damages. At that time the owner agreed with the </seg>

The present owner, ing dissatisfied with the crossing, now insists that the railroad ■any construct for him an overhead crossing at a cost of $1,000 with a maintenance charge of at least $1,500. The present cross- not, in any way, affect the public interest, but the crossing simply suits the owner's private convenience. As we view il. the order made by the Commission was unjust, unreason- nd oppressive and may amount to taking the property of the id company without due process of law and in violation of the tution of this state and of the United States. Again, to re- re the company to construct such a crossing as the Commission has ered in this case, would discriminate unjustly in favor of the lainant and against all other persons similarly situated. Finally, vidence is not sufficient, as we believe, to sustain the order of the mmission. The railroad company contracted for this crossing and reed with the former owner with respect to its location. It offers construct a made crossing easterly from the present location, to wiiKim road for the plaintiff's benefit parallel to its railway ;i;id*' the approaches for that crossing without cost to the tint. Nevertheless, he insists that the railroad company should [ and maintain an overhead crossing for his private benefit. seem that the construction of such a grade crossing as we described is sufficient, and that the evidence fails to show that omplainant is entitled to the overhead crossing which he demands. The order of the Commission is reversed and the proceeding Reversed and Dismissed.

The prayer is that a hearing may be had nt be authorized to charge consumers an annual main- per acre, to be made to apply for water furnished (i year 19 The respondents filed an answer denying the jurisdiction of the Jailway Commission of the subject matter of the complaint, which is said is within the jurisdiction of the courts. The answer also eads the failure of complainant to furnish sufficient water in the ication season of 1913; that it carelessly and negligently allowed p canal to t-ecome filled with weeds and debris, and to be obstructed. that it failed to carry the amount of water to which the respondents' ands were entitled. It also pleads a number of acts of misconduct in the part of certain directors of the corporation whereby It Is al- tln-y obtained special privileges and advantages, and charges general mismanagement. A hearing was had and an order made allowing the complainant increase its maintenance charges to $2.00 per acre per annum. The company was also required to set apart each year 14,500.00 for the operation, maintenance and betterment of tHe ditch and to place any unexpended portion of this amount in a reserve fund for use in ncies. It was also ordered that a new set of books be opened. containing certain specified entries, and that a daily record be kept during the irrigation season of the flow in the main canal and the distribution of water to the users. From this order respondents have appealed. The principal contention of respondents is that the Commission has no authority to make an order releasing complainant from the provisions of the contracts; that the order deprives the defendants of their property without due process of law, and impairs the obligation of their contracts contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of Nebraska, the Constitution of the United States, and of the Four- teenth Amendment thereof. It is also said that the order is not sup- ported by the evidence, and that under the covenants in the water deeds the title to the canal was and should be in its customers, since the whole amount of available water rights had been sold. These con- tentions will be considered in different order than presented. 1. The evidence conclusively shows that the rate of $1.00 per acre per annum is insufficient to maintain the canal even after de- ducting certain charges criticised by the respondents, and that unless the complainant is allowed to increase the rate it will be Impossible to maintain the canal In a condition so that it will deliver water. The computations made by respondents and set forth in the reply brief, showing that the income is more than sufficient to meet ex- penses, are not accurate since they include hundreds of dollars re- </seg>

The (plan of the corporation expressed in its deeds or contracts with holders of water rights provides that when the water rights to the capacity of the canal have been sold and paid for, the cannl becomes, by certain acts of its officers therein specified, the property of the water ripht holders. Under such provision the money paid for a water right represents pro tanto a portion of the capital of the corporation. When the rights have all been sold the title to the canal passes but the title to the money remains in the corporation. It may not, therefore, be taken from the corporation without its consent to be used for maintenance. This is said, assum - ing, of course, that the prices raid have been fair and reasonable and not padded to such an extent that it is seen that at least a por - tion of the cost of maintenance should be met from the excess charge. In this case, however, no such condition appears as to an respondents.. Under the order made by the Railway Com complainant is not allowed to squander or dissipate any su z&lt; from the increase in rates in excess of that actually &lt;&gt;x year for the maintenance of the ditch. Its books are subject appropriate proceedings in a court of equity 3. Respondents insist that if the exist to the company it cannot complain been us under no restriction when it fixed the rml only apply on the complaint of water users when tt rate is unreasonable. This involves th raised. The crucial question is whether the rate of $1 year fixed in the contract is a property right with which the state in the exercise of its regulatory power cannot interfere. At the time the canal was built the practice of irrigation in this state was in its infancy, but from the very first the legislature recognized the public interest in the use of water from the streams of the state for irrigation purposes. It placed canal companies in the same class as railways and other common carriers and it has uniformly been con- sidered that their rates were subject to regulation and control. Cum- 3peetion and if It should prove when further repairs have been m to the canal, or a more specific and detailed system of bookkeep used, that the rate now fixed is excessive it can be reduced ■] 11 "&gt;eer proper application being made to that body. 2. It Is strongly insisted that the evidence shows that all available water which could be furnished has (teen disposed of un existing water right contracts, that for that reason the consumers &lt; the canal and the complainant as a stock corporation has no intei in the property.

Before the amendment was adopted the ired Ami the Legislature may from time to time pass laws es- nable maximum rates of charges for the trans- 1 of passengers and freight on the different railroads tate." (Const.. Art. 11, Par. 4.) This provision is still a part of the supreme law. The fix- fore, is still within the legislative power. It is in cific legislation that the State Railway Commission exercise such authority. It follows that, since passenger rates fixed by statute, authorfty of the State Railway Commission to them must be found in legislative action. Relator further insists that power to increase passenger rates been delegated to the State Railway Commission by the Legis- FollowinK the adoption of the constitutional amendment at ral election in 1906, the Legislature of 1907 passed an act the powers and the duties of the State Railway Commission, ame a law March 27, 1907, and to it relator points for au- hority to increase passenger rates. It contains the following pro- "The Commission shall have the power to regulate the rates i.l mi vices of, and to exercise a general control over all rail- ds, express companies, car companies, sleeping car companies, ight and freight line comranies, and all other common carriers &lt;i in the transportation of freight or passengers within the Rev.

Rev. 13, Par. 6109. At the same session the Legislature enacted another law. iiwn as the "Anti-Pass Act." Separate acts reducing express charges d freight rates were also passed. The import of statutes relating i rates and to the powers and the duties of the State Railway Com - ission is determined from all the laws on the subject, including con - itutional provisions. Referring to the Railway Commission Act, the nti-Pass Act (Laws 1907, c. 93), and the Two-Cent Fare Act ( I^aws HI, c. 92), it was said in State v. W. 859, 31 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 65 Inion P. R.

They are therefore ic pari niateria, and must be construed together." (4) The provisions quoted from the Railway Commission Ac t went into effect 21 days later than the Two-Cent Fare Act. Do they uthorize the State Railway Commission to increase paaaea r rate The answer to this question must be found in the intention of the Legislature, as disclosed by all of the legislation on the subject, when viewed in the light of the Constitution and the conditions requiring improvement. The power of the Legislature to fix rat gate to the State Railway Commission authority to in already fixed by statute, cannot be questioned.

The Commission dismissed the petition (or want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the statute fixes the rate and the Commission has no power to investigate the matter. Thereupon the railway company applied to this court for a writ of mandamus requiring tbe Commission to entertain jurisdiction and hear its petition. The question thus presented is whether the State Railway Commission has jurisdiction to make investigation as to the charge of the railway companies for intrastate transportation of pas - sengers. At the general election in the fall of 19U6 an amendment to the Constitution was adopted creating a State Railway Commission, imposing certain duties upon the Legislature in regard thereto, and in the meantime conferring certain powers and duties upon the Com - mission so created. The amendment is section 19a, art. 5, of the Constitution, and is as follows: "There shall be a State Railway Commission, consisting of three members, who shall be first elected at the general electioi in 19U6, whose terms ol office, except those chosen at the first election under this provision, shall be six years, and whose com - pensation shall be fixed by the Legislature. Of the three com - missioners first elected, the one receiving the highest number of votes shall hold his office for six years, the next highest four years, and the lowest two years. The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the Legislature may pro - vide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation, the Com - mission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enum- erated in this provision.' Pursuant to this amendment there was introduced in the H of Representatives (H. R. a 05) by the joint committee on railrc on the 11th day of February, 1907, a bill entitled: "A bill for an act creating and defining the powers, duties and qualifications of the State Railway Commission and the secretary thereof and fixing their compensation; defining rail - way companies and common carriers, regulating the same, and providing the method of fixing, establishing, publishing rates, charges and classifications for the transportation of passengers, freights and cars, including joint through rates and joint traffic arrangements, over and upon the various lines of said railway companies and common carriers in this state; the method of making, establishment and enforcing the general orders of said Commission; defining unjust discriminations; to provide pen - alties for the violation of the provisions of this act, and to re - peal all acts or parts of acts in conflict herewith, and to de - clare that an emergency exists."

It also contained an emergency clause and took effect on the day of its approval. The regulation of rates is a difficult and complicated matter. nvolves the consideration of values and other things which the -egislature itself is without necessary facilities to ascertain. The lature, realizing this, and knowing the purpose of the people of tate in providing a State Railway Commission, has supplied facilities in detail to that Commission and made liberal ap- propriation for that purpose. If the Legislature has power under the Constitution to regulate rates without the assistance of the Rail- way Commission, it will not be considered to have done so unless that intention is expressed in direct and unequivocal language. These statutes were pending before the Legislature and were being ronsidered at the same time; they were considered together. The two icts must be construed together as one act, and we must consider the statute as if it had been inserted as a part of the Commission then we should harmonize the whole and derive the intention Legislature therefrom. In Chicago, B. &amp;. Q. R. Co. v. Winnett, 162 Fed 242, 89 C. C. A. ISS, it was said "The Legislature would have full power to delegate to the Nebraska State Railway Commission the authority to fix rates &gt;r the transportation of passengers and freignt by common arrieis within the state of Nebraska, if the Constitution were ilent upon that subject." The constitutional amendment contemplated that the regulation Ues and general control of common carriers would be delegated e Commission, and the presumption arises that the Legislature, vtn if it retained the power to fix rates independently of the Com - lission, would in the first instance delegate all such powers to the ominission. If, therefore, the language of the Legislature subse- the amendment of the Constitution is ambiguous, or of doubt- ul meaning, it should be considered as delegating such powers. The Supreme Court of Missouri, in construing a somewhat similar ute, used the following language, which seems to be pertinent re "Therefore it follows that, if the hand of the Legislature by former acts was so laid on rates that no power existed to increase a hard and fast maximum general statutory rate (es - tablished to cover all cases and arrived at by legislative guess, however intelligent the gwaM may be, as seems to be the case at the time the rtilities Act was passed), the conclusion is irresis - tible that the Legislature intended its hand should be lifted, and that by general rules and methods prescribed for the guidance of the Commission, as here, it was intended that it first ascertain the facts and next should apply them in regulating rates, up or </seg>

If the Commission ■ Id name 2' L . cents as the passenger rate, this statute would apply and to chary" more than the rate so fixed by the Commission would be criminal; but no penalty is incurred by charging more than the rate named in the so-called passenger rate statute.

            <seg id="p308">308 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT Subdivision "c," Par. 15, of the act, makes it unlawful for any "railway company or common carrier to change any rate, schedule or classification until application has been made to the Railway Commission and permission had for that purpose.'' This implies that upon such application and permission any rate can be changed, and plainly provides that the Commission may in - vestigate upon application and fix and establish rates "for the trans- portation of (both) freight and passenger The constitutional amendment required the Legislature to pr vide by law for the regulation of rates of service and general control of common carriers. In obedience to that requirement they enaetec this comprehensive statute for that purpose, as the title shows. In that act they provided again and again that the Commission ih investigate and fix passenger rates. It seems that the very fact the Legislature reiterated this command to the Commission t passenger rates has weakened the command itself. The dir unequivocal language of the Legislature I section 5) The Commission -hall have the power to alter, chang* amend or abolish any classification or rate when deemed n sary. and such amended, altered, or new classifications or : Rhall be put into effect in the same manner as the originals. — is now disregarded or annulled If the Comir any rate, and make a new one, and put it into effect, an oversig the Legislature, if any U make the language of such minor act definite, cannot sun rule the plain language, as well a.s the whole tenor and I comprehensive Commission Act, as well as the spirit and intent the Constitution itself. The Legislature kn continually changing, and that or too low upon change of co porated in the Commission Act the Commission shall have th abolish any rate when dt declaration that rates then or at Legislature would be temporary islature or investigated by the Commission The fifth paragraph of the syllabus of the majority opinion, an the authorities cited supporting it, t The general Commission Act is not to be construed separately a a later act. The two acts are to be construed together as on act, as the majority opinion itself declares. The Passenger Rate Act is not "in conflict with a general intention expressed in a latt enactment," but is in harmony with it, being intended to operate only until the Commission can perform the comprehensive duties im- posed upon it. Since the two statutes are to be construed together as one act, the construction given them by the majority opinion creates the situation of inconsistent provisions of the same act. In such case, if the provisions are in fact inconsistent, the latest ex- pression controls. This rule is universal. </seg>
            <seg id="p309">NEBRASKA BTATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 309 1 tl i H I pinion says that the Legislature has "left the ission free to change or abolish rates within the the lawmakers"; that is, if the application had \v senger rate, the Commission would have Juris - the duty, to investigate conditions. This duty t in the Rate Act. It must therefore be rehensive Commission Act. All a give that the two acts should be construed together, and if possible.

The Legislature ly found it necessary to change the rate. The statute fixing t two cents was intended as a temporary act, until necessary ould be made and the truth learned. To so regard is necessary to make the two acts consistent and enforce W« ought to do that, and not convict the Legislature of the same time two inconsistent acts.

It would be equally reason- viso to the Passenger Rate Act: "Provided the way ( )n may investigate and raise this rate but they 11 never lower it." "Change, alter and amend" can be construed mean raise." as well as to mean "lower." If the Legis'ature ended that the Commission could change and alter the passenger te only in one direction, why not say that the Commission can the rate, but cannot lower it? If the Railway Commission Act amended by construction, and the word "lower" is substituted for ? words "alter, change and amend," we will have to also amend uny other sections of the act.

            <seg id="p494">494 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT PART VI. PHYSICAL VALUATION Lincoln, Nebraska, December 1, 1915 Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. i Gentlemen: The work of your Engineering Department during past year has been confined almost entirely to current matters ley have arisen. It has not been possible to undertake any broad basic investigations relating to safety, service and costs, except ie case under consideration seemed to require, for the reason that force in this department has necessarily been reducid below the mum of the actual work required. The number of persons em - ed in this department at present is as follows: Vocation. Number of Persons. Chief Engineer 1 Chief Clerk Stenographer Pliy*irul Valuation: The physical values of the property of publ service corporations, as shown by the accompanying tables, are tl same as published in the report of last year. The work of keepiri the values of such property within the state of Nebraska up-to-dat as contemplated in the Physical Valuation Act, calls for a force &lt; engineers and assistants far in excess of the number at present en ployed, and for this reason we were unable to bring the appraiseniei referred to down to date for the next annual rapoil The Physical Valuation Department of the Interstat. Commission has begun work in this state and lias tahM an inventory of the Rock Island Railroad property, and no doubt the Government forces will undertake the inventory and appraisement of all the other steam railroad properties in this state within the next few years. The steam carriers are going to great pains and expense to prepare inven - tories for the check and inspection of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission, and the thoroughness with which the work has proceeded should insure reliable and dependable results. We have taken up with the Interstate Commerce Commission the matter of the classi - fication and division of the property of the carriers as to working sections, yard limits, etc., in order that the segregation may conform as nearly as possible with the work previously done by the state. In this manner we hope to make close comparisons with the figures of • he United States, and be able to get the greatest benefit from pending appraisement. We have also prepared answers to the questions pro - pounded by the Federal Valuation Board, and have submitted a report setting out our interpretation of the National Physical Valuation law and the manner of classifying and arranging the results of the ap - praisal, in order that they may be of the greatest service to the public. </seg>
            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 495 Tax Valuation: A valuation of the railroads within the city of South Omaha, pending at the time of last year's report, was finished and given to the tax commissioner. We have also rendered some assistance to the South Sioux City authorities in the appraisal of a spur track of the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Railway, under Informal Complaint 3791. Fortunately these hrve been the only requests for information of this character submitted to this department, as they ordinarily re - quire a large amount of time for computation and report. New Map: The new official railroad map of Nebraska issued this year has been the subject of a careful check by this department. The alignment maps of all the railways were examined and a number of small errors in the older maps have been corrected. The new map gives the railroad locations in the state more accurately than it has ver been done before. The new laws enacted by the legislature of 1915 have added to the many things requiring the assistance of the engineering depart - ment. Wire Crossings over Railroad Tracks: House Roll 217, regulat - ing the construction of electric wire crossings over and under rail - road tracks at public highway crossings, has made it necessary to prepare specifications with which all such crossings must conform. For the sake of uniformity we have made these specifications agree as closely as possible with the regulations of other states, and the speci - fications adopted by various electric associations in high standing. This law also imposes upon the Commission the duty, either by personal inspection or otherwise, of obtaining information where the track or tracks of railroads at public highway crossings are crossed by wires in a manner not in compliance with the specifications adopted. In order to carry out this injunction we feel that it will be necessary to compile a record of all the wire crossings on public highways in this state. The limited force and funds available for this work will make it necessary to inspect these crossings in connection with trips to various parts of the state, made necesary by the inspection or appraisement of utility properties. Progress along this line will necessarily be slow when it is known that about five thousand crossings come within the purview of this act. Transmission Lines: Senate File No. 65, regulating the con - struction, operation and maintenance of power transmission lines in this state, also requires the service of the engineering staff. In this connection we have already examined and passed upon the filings in the following applications: A-2469 and A-2568, Ernest Meyer, transmission lines from Oak to Davenport and Edgar. A-2496, Continental Gas &amp; Electric Corporation, transmission line from Hampton to York. A-25f&gt;3, M. M. Johnson Company, transmission line from Clay Center to Glenville. </seg>
            <seg id="p496">496 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT Other applications under this act are bow pending and there air strong indications that the state is just entering upon an era of de - velopment involving; the long distance transmission of electricity for light and power purposes. So far the specifications submitted indi - cate that the applicants propose to build first class lines which should not interfere with nor jeopardize travel along the public highways. Stocks and Bonds: Several applications under the Stock and Bonds Act of 1909 have required a property check or valuation.
