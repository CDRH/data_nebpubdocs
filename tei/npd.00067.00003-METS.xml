SNYDER COMPARISON OF THE RELATIVE FEEDING VALUES OF WHITE AND YELLOW CORN FOR FATTENING HOGS During the winter of 1921-1922, from January 24 to March 7, a period of 42 days, two lots of 10 pigs each were fed white corn and supplementary feeds and two similar lots yellow corn and the same supplements. The average weight of the pigs at the beginning of the test was 100 pounds. • They were self-fed. Lot 1 was fed yellow corn, shorts, tank - , age, and a small amount of milk. In the ration of lot 2 white corn was substituted for yellow corn. The rations of lots 3 and 4 duplicated those of 1 and 2 with oats m addition T?T « * glves the amoum * °* each kind of feed consumed. Alfalfa hay was fed m racks. Very little oats was eaten. Ihe average daily gain per pig was practically the same, 1.37 pounds m the two lots fed white and also m the two lots fed yellow corn. The pigs eating white corn required 360 pounds of corn, tankage, and shorts and those eating yellow - corn 381 pounds of corn, tankage, and shorts to produce 100 pounds of gain. The relative, values of white and yellow corn were further tested during this same winter by feeding one lot of ten 78 - -pound pigs for 28 days on a ration of yellow corn, tankage, oats, and milk, and a similar lot the same ration excepting that white corn was substituted for yellow. Alfalfa hay was fed m racks. The details are given under lots 5 and 6 m ! Table 1. The daily gain of the two lots was practically the same. Ihe pigs eating the yellow corn required 400 pounds of corn tankage, and oats and those eating white corn 365 pounds of corn, tankage, and oats to produce 100 pounds of gain. Combining the results given by the three lots eating white com and comparing these with the results given by the three lots eating yellow corn, we find that the rate of gain was the same for both kinds of corn, 1.28 pounds daily per pig. With white corn and supplements, the pigs required 362 pounds to produce 100 pounds of gain, and with yellow corn and supplements they required 388 pounds to produce 100 pounds of gain. During the winter of 1922-1923, similar trials were made without alfalfa hay, milk, or oats, the rations being corn and tenkage. The duration of the test was 60 days. There were 6 lots of 15 pigs each. The pigs m lots 7, 8, and 9 weighed 58 pounds each; those |n lots 10, 11, and 12 weighed 67 pounds each. Lots 7 and 10 were fed white corn and tankage ; </seg>

ALFALFA PASTURE During three consecutive summers, spring pigs were pastured on sudan grass and on alfalfa to determine the rela - tive feeding values of these two forage crops. After the first season, 1923, the tests were continued until the pigs were ready for market. When pigs on a light grain ration were moved from a none too succulent sudan grass pasture in the late summer to alfalfa pasture, they naturally took on a heavy fill which made their gains for a short period larger and at a low cost. Altho the data as presented show these and other inequalities, it has been considered best to present the entire story as furnished by the pigs and the feed, trusting that the reader will appreciate that the inconsist - encies in the results presented are natural to the conditions covered in these tests. SUMMER OF 1923 In the summer of 1923 from June 28 to August 27, one lot of 15 spring pigs weighing 79 pounds each at the start, grazed on alfalfa pasture and had access to a self-feeder of corn. A similar lot was handled in the same manner except - ing that they grazed on sudan grass pasture. These are lots 20 and 22 of Table 5. The average daily gain on alfalfa was 1.51 and on the sudan 1.30 pounds. The corn consumed to produce 100 pounds of gain on the alfalfa was 359 pounds and on the sudan 402 pounds. </seg>

Three lots wei;e pastured on sudan grass and three on alfalfa. The grain ration was corn alone. One lot on each type of pasture was given a 1 per cent 1 grain ration, another a 2 per cent grain ration, and the third a full grain ration, fed thru a self - feeder. Table 6 gives the results in detail. The alfalfa pasture was of good quality at all times. The season was dry, and altho some irrigation water was used late in the season, the sudan pasture was not succulent at all times. During the 88 days that the pigs were grazing on sudan grass, those getting the light grain ration gained at the rate of .19 pound each daily and ate 517 pounds of corn to pro - duce 100 pounds of gain. Those fed a medium grain ration gained at the rate of .48 pound each daily and ate 419 pounds »A 1 per cent ration is 1 pound of feed daily per 100 pounds weieht of the animal. </seg>

Those fed a full grain ration gained at the rate of 1.11 pounds each daily and ate 406 pounds of corn to produce 100 pounds of gain. The pigs grazing on alfalfa pasture and fed the same corn rations as those on the sudan pasture gained at the respective rates of .47, .91, and 1.29 pounds each daily and consumed 214, 222, and 388 pounds of corn to make 100 pounds increase in weight. The pigs fed light and medium grain rations on sudan grass pasture required about twice as much grain to produce 100 pounds of gain and gained only about half as fast as the pigs fed a similar ration on alfalfa pasture. On , sudan grass pasture the lightest ration required the most grain to produce 100 pounds of gain. The reverse was true on alfalfa pasture. A comparison of the lots full-fed does not show so much difference in the relative values of alfalfa pasture and sudan grass pasture, since the grain and not the pasture furnished the very large proportion of the ration. On the 24th day of September, all pigs on sudan grass pasture were moved to alfalfa pasture, as the sudan grass pasture was no longer available owing to dry weather and frosts. The grain ration used on sudan pasture was con - tinued. The pigs were kept in the alfalfa pasture until October 21, when they were put into dry lots. During the short period on alfalfa pasture, the pigs that had been fed a light grain ration on sudan pasture naturally enjoyed the change and made an unusual gain in weight for the amount of grain eaten. After being put into the dry lots on October 21, all lots were self-fed corn and tankage. A short time was taken to accustom the light fed pigs to a full ration. The two lots self-fed corn during the summer were in the winter quarters only two weeks until they had reached the market weight set at 250 pounds. The figures for the two weeks probably mean little or nothing on account of the short period. The lot fed a medium grain ration on alfalfa pasture re - quired 35 days in winter quarters and the similarly fed lot on sudan pasture required 65 days in winter quarters to reach the 250 pound weight. The light-fed-alfalfa-pastured lot reached the market weight at the same time as the medium - fed-sudan-grass-pastured lot. The light-fed-sudan-pastured lot was about two weeks behind the other two last mentioned, and while marketed at the same time, were 28.5 pounds short of the 250 weight. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Pork Production The data given in the summary of the entire fattening period indicate that when a full grain ration is fed, sudan grass pasture and alfalfa pasture have about the same value, and that, as the grain ration is decreased, the value of alfalfa over sudan grass is increased. Faster and cheaper gains were secured from alfalfa pasture than from sudan grass pasture, especially when a restricted grain ration was fed. SEASON OF 1925 The rations used in the test during the summer of 1925 were somewhat different from those used during the previous summer. The very light grain ration was omitted. A ration of corn and tankage self-fed was substituted. There were three lots of 15 pigs each on sudan grass pasture and three similar lots on alfalfa pasture. The rations on each pasture were corn and tankage self-fed, corn self -fed, and 2 per cent corn. The test began on June 30. Pasture conditions per - mitted the use of the summer range until October 6. The lots not ready for market were put into winter quarters and self -fed corn and hand-fed tankage until marketed. As in the former tests, the pigs grazing on the alfalfa pasture made faster gains with less grain than pigs similarly fed on a sudan grass pasture. The difference in rate of gain and feed consumed was increased where the grain ration was limited. The two lots of pigs self -fed corn and tankage made approximately the same rate of gain, the slight difference being in favor of the alfalfa pasture. The pigs self-fed corn and tankage went to market directly from the summer pasture at the weight of about 245 pounds, on October 6. Those self -fed corn on alfalfa pasture followed two weeks later; and those fed a 2 per cent ration of corn on alfalfa pasture followed the corn-tankage lots by a space of 7 weeks. The self-fed sudan-grass ration and the 2 per cent corn-alfalfa ration gave about the same final rates of gain. The pigs fed a 2 per cent corn ration on sudan grass pasture did not reach the 250-pound weight until December 15, or 10 weeks later than their mates self -fed corn and tankage. The final results when the pigs were marketed indicated that sudan grass gave slower and more expensive gains than alfalfa. This is especially noticeable when the grain ration was limited. During two summers a lot of 10 sows that had raised spring litters have been kept on alfalfa pasture and another similar lot on sudan grass pasture without grain. The sows </seg>

The sows on sudan grass pasture have gained for the first two or three weeks and then have lost weight. fu^u^ 8 * 8 conducted during the three summers indicate that while sudan grass is a good forage crop, it is not equal to alfalfa under conditions prevailing at North Platte It may be more nearly the equal of alfalfa under more humid conditions.

The profit on the average pig fed corn alone during the 60 days was $2.04 and on the pig fed corn and tankage $1.96. For each bushel of corn fed alone there was a return of $1.11, and for each bushel of corn fed with tankage there was a return of $1.09. In this test tankage was not worth the price being paid for it. 1 . There was a third lot of similar pigs grazed on alfalfa pasture and self -fed corn without tankage or other supple - ments. The pigs in this lot gained at the rate of 1.51 pounds each daily, ate 359.3 pounds of corn for 100 pounds of gain, gave a profit of $2.89 per pig, and returned $1.25 for each bushel of corn eaten. The sudan grass-alfalfa experiment of 1925 gives further opportunity for comparing a ration of.com with a ration of corn and tankage on both sudan grass and alfalfa pasture. "While the cost of the gains was quite similar from either ration, the time consumed in getting the pig to market was very much less where tankage was fed. The difference in favor of tankage was more marked when the forage was sudan grass ithan when it was alfalfa. The value of tankage depends very largely on whether the feeder is concerned with cheap gains or with maximum profit in a given time. The problem is likely to be whether to push the spring pig on to the market and make room for the fall pig and likewise the fall pig to make room for the succeeding spring pig, or to allow a pig to stay on the farm an entire year. This problem has many sides and angles but we be - lieve the bulk of the evidence favors heavy feeding and quick returns. SELF-FEEDING VS. HAND-FEEDING AND SELF-WATERING VS. HAND-WATERING In this test 80 spring shoats were divided into 4 uniform lots of 20 each. The first lot was self -fed and hand-watered ; the- second lot was hand-fed and hand-watered; the third lot was self -fed and self-watered; the fourth lot was hand-fed and self-watered. A lighter group of 64 pigs were divided into 4 uniform lots of 16 pigs each at the same time and put on rations duplicating those of the first four lots. This gives the results of 36 .pigs fattened under each of the four condi - tions mentioned. Since the hogs of the second group were lighter than those of the first and were fed longer, the results 'The details of this test are given in Table 6. </seg>

The test with Group A continued 6 weeks. The average weight at the beginning was 187 pounds and at the close about 250 pounds. The average daily gain was 1.55 pounds per pig. On the average, 445 pounds of grain, corn, and tankage with 8 pounds of alfalfa hay made 100 pounds gain. The test with Group B continued 12 weeks. At the be - ginning of the test the average weight of these pigs was 131 pounds and at the end 256 pounds. The average daily gain was 1.49 pounds.

            <seg id="p021">Pork Production The self-fed lots received corn and tankage separately in self-feeders. The hand-fed lots were given corn in one trough and tankage in another. The troughs were removed or the hogs shut out of the feeding pen after the hogs had been given a reasonable time for eating their fill after being fed. They were fed morning and evening. The self-watered hogs had access to small hog watering tanks in which the temperature of the water was kept above the freezing point by heat from a kerosene lamp beneath. The hand-watered lots were watered from troughs. The hogs were watered morning and evening. All hogs had warm, dry, well-bedded sleeping quarters but were fed and watered in outside lots quite well protected from severe winds. Alfalfa hay was fed in racks. If we consider the results of Group A alone, we find that the lot self-watered and self-fed led the other lots by a rather wide margin, with the hand-fed and self -watered lot ranking second in economy of gain and profit per pig tho below the self-fed and hand-watered lot in rate of gain. The lot hand - fed and hand-watered ranked lowest in all points. The aver - age of the two lots hand-fed, one of which was self-watered and the other hand-watered, when compared with the average of the two lots self-fed, one of which was self-watered and the other hand- watered, shows that the self -fed hogs gained faster,, ate more for 100 pounds gain and gave more profit than the hand-fed lots. This is at least in part accounted for by the fact that the hand-fed hogs ate less in proportion to their weight than the self -fed hogs. When comparing the two lots self-watering with the two lots hand-watered, we find that the self-watered pigs made the faster gains, ate less feed in producing 1Q0 pounds of gain, and gave the greater profit. The results of Group B considered alone are not so favor - able to self-watering. The lot self -fed and hand-watered ex - celled the lot self -watered and self -fed in rate of gain, con - sumed less feed in producing 100 pounds of gain, and gave a greater profit. The hand-fed and self-watered lot out - ranked the self -watered and self-fed lot in economy of gain and profit, and almost tied with it in rate of gain. If we compare the average of the two self-fed lots and the two hand-fed lots of Group B, we will find that the self-fed hogs made the faster gains, used less feed for 100 pounds of gain, and gave the greater profit.

The self-watered and self-fed hogs consumed 467 pounds of feed for 100 pounds of gain and gave a profit of $2.92 per pig.

            <seg id="p023">Pork Production It is difficult to determine from these results which of the four practices, self-watering, self-feeding, hand-watering, and hand-feeding, has the greatest influence on the perform - ance of the hogs. In Table 11 the chief points are brought together for closer comparison. Table 11 — Summary of Groups A and B.

This is probably due to the fact that with the self-watering and self - feeding each hog, large or small, brave or timid, has an oppor - tunity to get all the water and feed it cares for. We can not see any circumstances under which self -watering should not be a good practice. The saving of labor fully repays the cost of the tank and oil: Self-feeding hogs may not be practical under all conditions but this practice may be followed with profit much more extensively than has been thought. The opinion has been common that hogs will eat too much tankage if given access to it. This is likely true unless they also have access to other feed that they like and also may be true with some brands of tankage. In this test no lot of hogs ate as much as 5 pounds of tankage with 95 pounds of corn. The average amount of tankage eaten was 3.34 pounds in 100 pounds of corn and tankage.

Thirty-four and five-tenths pounds of tankage replaced 80 pounds of corn. Valuing corn at 84 cents per bushel tankage at $60.00 per ton, and hogs at $10.00 per 100 pounds, tankage decreased the cost of gains 16 cents per 100 pounds and increased the profit $1.39 per pig or 56 per cent during the 46 days. If hogs were valued lower this percentage in - crease of profit would be larger. Adding shorts to a ration of corn, tankage, and alfalfa did not increase the rate of gain and lessened the amount of tankage and total amount of feed required to produce 100 pounds of gain only slightly. With shorts valued at S30 00 per ton, the cost of 100 pounds gain was decreased 16 cents and the profit increased 8 cents per pig.

Table 12 gives the results in detail. . FINISHING FALL PIGS, 1924 PASTURE OR DRY LOT Pork producers differ more, perhaps, on the question of raising or not raising fall pigs and in the manner of handling them than on any other matter pertaining to pork production Some men like to push the fall pig from birth to market weight; others prefer to grow the pig rather slowly and take advantage of cheap summer pasture and market the pig dur - ing the summer or fall. There is also the question of how to finish the pig that is in good flesh and weighing about 150 pounds when pasture becomes available in the spring. Should this pig be finished in the dry lot or on pasture? Light on this problem was sought thru the test described below. The pigs were farrowed about September 20 and were fed quite well during the winter. They were let run at large irom March 5 until they were put in the fattening lots, May £i. During that time they were given no special care but Table 13— Fattening fall pigs. Dry lot compared with alfalfa pasture Corn and tankage compared with corn and shorts on alfalfa pasture. All corn was fed in self-feeders. Twenty pigs were used in lot U2 and 25 in each of lots 48 and U for a period of 39 days, from May 21, 1918 to June 29, 1918.

            <seg id="p026">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 214 got about all the corn they cared for. The rate of gain from birth until May 21 was about .7 pound per head daily. The i ate of gain from birth until marketed at an average weight of 225 pounds was about .8 pound per head daily. A middle of March pig making a similar gain would reach the market shortly before Christmas. Seventy pigs were used for the test during the fattening period of five and one-half weeks, extending from May 21, 1918, to June 29, 1918. The pigs were separated into two lots of 10 and two lots of 25 pigs each. The former two lots were kept in dry corrals and fed corn and tankage thru self - feeders. There was an attempt made to determine the effect of feeding green alfalfa to one of these lots but they ate so little alfalfa that this was discontinued after the second or third week. The results from these two lots have been put together, averaged, and designated as lot 42 in Table 13. The other two lots, 43 and 44, grazed on alfalfa. One lot was fed corn and tankage, the other lot corn and shorts. Self-feeders were used with both lots. The average weight of the pigs at the beginning of the test was about 158 pounds and at the close about 225 pounds. The 20 pigs kept in a dry lot and self -fed corn and tankage made an average daily gain of 2 pounds each. They con - sumed 356.6 pounds of corn and 25.9 pounds of tankage for 100 pounds of gain. The cost of 100 pounds of gain was $6.13, considering corn worth 84 cents per bushel and tankage worth $60.00 per ton. Considering hogs worth $10.00 per 100 pounds, this lot gave a daily profit of 7.8 cents each per day or a profit of $3.04 per head during the five and one-half weeks. The 25 pigs grazing on alfalfa pasture and self-fed corn and tankage made an average daily gain of 1.67 pounds each and consumed 369.3 pounds of corn and 14.4 pounds of tank - age for 100 pounds of gain. The food consumed in producing 100 pounds increase in weight cost $5.97. The daily profit per pig was 6.73 cents. The profit per pig during the period was $2.63. The 25 pigs grazing on alfalfa pasture and self-fed corn and shorts made an average daily gain of 1.69 pounds per pig, and ate 362.7 pounds of corn and 53.9 pounds of shorts, a total of 416.6 pounds of feed for 100 pounds of increase in weight. The shorts cost $30.00 per ton. The cost of feed consumed in producing 100 pounds of gain was $6.25. The daily profit per pig was 6.33 cents or during the period $2.47. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">Pork Pboduction t In this test where 150-pound shoats in good flesh were being finished for market at 225 pounds weight, the pigs in a small corral without green feed gave a faster gain and a cheaper gam and more profit than similar pigs receiving a similar ration but having the run of a field of alfalfa. Where the pigs ran on alfalfa there was little difference m gam or profit between feeding a ration of corn and shorts and a ration of corn and tankage. The pigs in the dry lots consumed nearly twice as much tankage as the pigs which were in the field of alfalfa. SHORTS Two lots of twenty-five 157-pound fall shoats were grazed on alfalfa pasture for 39 days. One lot was self-fed corn and tankage; the other lot was self-fed corn and shorts The rate of gain was practically the same, 1.68 pounds per pig daily. The one lot required 369.3 pounds of corn and 14 4 po !J n^ S f tanka »e and the other lot 362.7 pounds of corn and 53.9 pounds of shorts to produce 100 pounds of gain One pound of tankage was equal to about 3.75 pounds of ln?«i Or ? rtS a L $30^° l ., per ton waa e(mal to tenk^e at $112.50 per ton. (See Table 13.) A group of ten 60-pound pigs were fed a ration of corn, tankage, and shorts, while a similar group was fed corn and tankage, for a period of 46 days. The addition of shorts to the ration of corn and tankage did not have any appreciable effect on the rate of gam or amount of feed consumed. The relative value of shorts and tankage in this test was shorts $30.00 per ton and tankage $80.00 per ton. (See Table 12.) C8M] </seg>
