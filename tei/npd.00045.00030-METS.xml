            <seg id="p001">THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION LINCOLN, NEBRASKA, MAY 5, 1917 (Reprinted November 1, 1917) (Reprinted June. 1919) CIRCULAR No. 3 COOLING TANKS AND MILK HOUSES AS FACTORS IN CREAM IMPROVEMENT BY J. H. Frandsen,* Professor of Dairy Husbandry. INTRODUCTION The quality of any dairy product when it reaches the con - sumer depends to no small extent upon the conditions prevailing upon the farm where the raw material is produced. The value of Nebraska's butter fat output would be increased several cents a pound if all of the dairy farmers of the State could be induced to give the milk and cream better care on the farm. According to the latest data available, such an increase would raise the returns for butter fat produced by the average cow about $6.50 a year. Applied to the total annual production of Nebraska's 700,000 dairy cows, this perniium on higher quality of cream would amount to $4,500,000. The significant fact is that this increase in the value of the product can be secured at a very ulight additional cost to the producer. As a result of market investigations carried on by the United States Dairy Division some time ago to determine the quality of American butter, a large amount of the butter examined was found to be of inferior quality because of the poor cream from which it had been made. Such a state of affairs is bad enough, but still more discouraging is the fact that during the last few years the amount of poor cream has not decreased. Altho modern methods and machinery have done much to improve the quality of creamery butter, the most skillful butter •Credit i* due Mr. E. A. Markham for much valuable assistance in preparation of thi« circular. </seg>
            <seg id="p002">2 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Circular 3 makers using the best of methods and machinery cannot over - come the evil effects arising from the filthy and slovenly methods followed by some cream producers. Unfortunately many dairymen do not realize this condition of interdependence Which really exists between the creamery and the cream producer. Good butter cannot be made from an inferior grade of cream. The better the quality of the butter produced the greater will be the demand. High grade butter commands the highest price, even when the market is well stocked with the lower and cheaper grades of butter . If the manufac - turer is forced to sell at a lower price owing to the poor grade of butter produced, it follows that he cannot pay as much for the butter fat. The dairymen of this country have suffered enormous losses due to the lower price received for poor butter. The present need is for a survey of the situation that shall result in a thoro understanding and cooperation of cream producers, creamery men, legislators, and educators. CLEANLINESS Our ideas of sanitation are materially advancing; and, as time goes on, the public will demand that more and more care be exercised in the production of foodstuffs. Where is the in - telligent person today who is satisfied to have his milk cleaned by straining out the filth that has gained access to it thru careless production? He knows that suspended impurities and taints cannot be overcome by this method, and he demands that the product be kept clean and pure from the time it is drawn from the cow's udder until it is ready for consumption. The intelli - gent fanner of today knows, too, that bacterial growth in milk and cream is the greatest factor in the deterioration of dairy products. Tho great care is exercised in handling milk, some bacteria will gain acess to it in the milking process and is the subsequent handling. The bacterial content, however, can be kept very low by using properly constructed utensils and by thoroly cleansing and sterilizing all the milk apparatus. UTENSILS The milk pail should be of the covered type to exclude bac - teria that may fall into the milk from the udder during the milk - ing process. It should be of good material, be well tinned, and have all the crevices flushed with solder. It is difficult, if not im - possible, to thoroly cleanse and sterilize a milk pail having deep crevices along the seams. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">Cooling Tanks and Milk Houses 3 To thoroly cleanse milk utensils they should first be rinsed with cold water to remove all particles of milk. They should then be .thoroly scrubbed with a brush in warm water to which a small quantity of good washing powder has been added. A washing powder free from grease is much to be preferred. After this, they should be steamed or at least rinsed in boiling water. No wiping cloth of any kind should be allowed to come in con - lac-t with them after the scalding process. Sunlight is one of the best disinfectants, and when possible all utensils should be placed in goo ) sunlight and pure air. CREAM COOLING Low temperatures are detrimental to bacterial growth, and the effectiveness of this means of bacterial control is forcibly illustrated in the following table, which shows the number of bacteria in one cubic centimeter of milk. Samples of the same milk were held at different temperatures for 10 to HV-j hours to show the effect of temperature on bacterial activity. Table 1 — Showing the importance of holding cream at low temperatures T; m &lt;&gt; v«i«i Number of bacteria Time held pef cubic centimeter Temperature of milk Frequent experiments have shown that low temperatures will greatly retard the growth of most germs and that cream quickly cooled will keep sweet much longer than when it is allowed to cool gradually. The practice of adding warm cream to cream that has been previously cooled is recognized as being extremely undesirable because warm cream raises the temperature Fig. 1— A cream °^ e wn °l e mass sufficiently to start the cooler for cooling dormant bacteria to activity, causing them cream as it comes to multiply rapidly and produce large from the separa- am(mn t8 of acid and undesirable fermenta tor . • i » .i • • l a , tions, before the cream is again cooled to 12 Degrees F &gt;0 10 " '0 " . 10 •0 " " 10 hours 10 " 10^ " 11 " 11 " 11H " 3300 11,580 15,120 188,000 2,631,000 4,426,000 </seg>

Warm cream should, therefore, be thoroly eooled before it is added to the cold cream. The most satisfactory and practical method so far devised for cooling cream on the farm is the use of some form of cooling tank. OmCIAL CHEAMOOO1.ING TANK Fig. 2 — Section of square cooling tank CREAM COOLING TANKS A cooling tank that will meet with general favor among cream producers must be simple in construction and yet durable and inexpensive both as to first cost and as to operation. It is </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Cooling Tanks and Milk Houses 5 generally agreed that the type of cooling tank which most nearly lneets all of these requirements must use water as the cooling agent, because on all farms a certain quantity of water must be pumped each day. and because water is efficient as a conducting medium to facilitate absorption of heat from the cream. Owing to the fact that water is pumped at least once a day to furnish water for the live stock, a considerable economy in operation is effected by using this water in the cooling tank. Several types of cooling tanks have been suggested, in each of n-hich water is the cooling medium. Fig. 3 — Connections for cream cooling tank The greatest efficiency is secured by admitting the cooling water near the bottom of the tank and removing the warmest water by means of an overflow pipe near the top and at the end opposite the intake. The pipe must be of such size that there will be no danger of water rising above the tops of the cans. In the preliminary experiment (reported January, 1915) the rectangular tank, shown in figure 2, gave highly satisfactory results. Later, a round tank, shown in figure 4. embodying the features of the rectanglar tank, gave equally good results and has the added advantage of being less expensive than a rec - tangular tank. Tl;e-e tanks proved so successful that a committee of the Association of American Creamery Butter Manufacturers adopted </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Circular 3 6 the round and the rectangular tanks (shown in accompanying illustrations) as the official tanks of the Association, and they have arranged to furnish plans and specifications to farmers de - siring to build their own tanks. This Association has also taken steps to have these tanks manufactured and distributed at the lowest possible cost to interested persons. The official tank is so designed that the cooling water cir - culates around and under the cans. The water coining in thru the intake is admitted near the bottom of the tank. In this vay the warmer water is being displaced constantly. The cans are raised sufficiently to allow complete circulation of the water. Strips of wood or metal in the bottom of the tank are provided for this purpose. These also protect the bottom of the tank. A swinging arm made of i/j-inch steel holds the cans down, and a metal lug in the bottom of the tank engages the lower rim of the ean, preventing it from swinging outward when only partly full. In addition to the 10-gallon cans for holding cream, space is proxided for two 5-gallon cooling cans of the shotgun type. These cans rest on a projecting metal hook. The cans are pre - \ented from swinging outward, when partly full, by a band of * j irh strap iron attached to the inside of the tank to form a hoop around the cans. A swinging arm of light steel prevents the cans from floating up when only partly filled. One of these shotgun cans is for cooling the cream after separation. The cream is skimmed into the: shotgun can. The can is then placed in the tank and the cream stirred for a few minutes until cooled. The cream remains in this can until the next skimming. It is then emptied into the 10-gallon can, and the cooling shotgun can is washed and sterilized preparatory to receiving the newly-skimmed cream. The second shotgun can is provided as a household refrig - erator. In this can is a removable tray filler having three remov - able shelves which serve as receptacles fbr such perishable pro - ducts as butter, cream, milk needed for the table. The inner portion may be lifted out readily to remove contents. Butter may be kept firm without difficulty in one of these refrigerator compartments, where ordinary well water is used in the tank as directed. While all of these tanks are very similar in the manner in which the water is applied, there is considerable difference of opinion as to the most desirable shape and dimensions for such a tank and some uncertainty regarding the best insulating ma - terial. </seg>

            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Circular 3 8 The twofold object of the experiment with cream cooling tanks was to determine whether a tank using only water as a cooling medium could be relied upon to maintain fairly constant tt-mperatures and to determine the value of wood as an insulator for cooling tanks. Wood is known to be a good nonconductor when dry, but there are many other substances known to be I ettcr but more expensive. The use of the more expensive insula - tion could be justified only upon positive proof that the wood loses much of its value as an insulating material when in_ direct contact with water, as it is in the cooling tank. Five different cooling tanks were placed in a partly sheltered £pot and filled wth water, and the variations in the temperature of the water compared with the changes in atmospheric tem - perature. Table 2 shows the temperature variations in three of those tanks. These three were selected because they represent the type generally referred to as the "official tank." The construction of these tanks is as follows: Xo. 2 — A square tank built of 2-inch cypress. No. -i — A square tank insulated with 1-inch of ground cork or mineral wool. No. 4 — A round tank built of 2-ineh Washington fir. Table 2 — Showing variation in temperatures in three cream cooling tanks Jul 9 «.m. 12 m.

It was thought best, therefore, not to change the water. Hence, readings that showed the absorption or radiation of heat thru the sides of the tank were secured.

            <seg id="p010">10 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Circular 3 The difference iu the results obtained with these three tauks is so slight that one would scarcely be justified in going to the expense of providing insulation other than that furnished by the wood itself. . The foregoing table also shows that the water within the tank responds slowly to a change in atmospheric temperature. The relation of atmospheric temperature to the temperature of the water in the tank can best be shown graphically. The average of the three tanks was taken as the temperature of the water, and the curve plotted as shown in figure 5. It will be seen that these tanks are equally effective as a pro - tection against heat or cold. This is indicated by the fairly constant temperature thru the night. In order to make a more thoro test of this point, however, it was decided to carry on a hi-ries of tests during the winter months under conditions as nearly as possible like those that would prevail upon the average farm. USE OF CREAM TANKS IN COLD WEATHER In these winter experiments, the- tanks were exposed out-of - iioors. The only protection given consisted of a double layer of 10-ouuce canvas thrown over the top of the tank. In these experiments, the water was adjusted at 6 p. m. daily to a tem - perature at, or as near as possible 50 degrees (the temperature of well water;. Twice daily, record was made of the temperature of the cream in each tank. The results of one of these tests, together with the atmospheric temperatures, are shown below: Table 3 — Showing the efficiency of cream tanks in preventing freezing Nil JANUARY IS JANUARY 14 * a.m. ' 9 a.m. 12 m. 6 p.m. 12 p.m ( a.m. 9 a.m. 12 n 6 p.m 12 p.m. S«° »° 48° 39= 40= 46 M° 49° 48° —21" I —15" 1 —7° — »° — 11° -|-l o +8° -J-8* Atmoaphcre —21 ° JANUARY 15 JANUARY 16 N... fa.m. 9 a.m. 12 m. 6 p.m U p.m 6 a.m. » a.m. 12 m. 6 p.m. 12 p.m M° | S«° S« o l»° W | H° 17* 41° 48° n° W I +1" -(-I* +1* I •" *~+l°T +*° 39° 44 ■• Atimxphrrr +•• + 2 o </seg>

            <seg id="p012">12 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Circular 3 It is to be hoped that the farmers of this State will come to look upon the cream cooling tank, not as a thing the usefulness of which ends with the warmer summer days and sultry nights, hut as a part of their equipment which can be profitably used every day in the year. Fig. 7 — Tanks used in cream cooling experiment The responsibility, however, does not lie entirely with the farmer. The same care that must be exercised on the farm must be observed at the cream station and creamery. The cream station must be provided with proper cooling facilities, and the quarters must be sanitary and well ventilated. Otherwise the work and care of the dairyman count for naught. Again, material improvement must come thru cooperation with the railways engaged in the hauling of cream, whereby at their junction points shelter would be provided which would at least protect the cream from the sun when left on the platform. Something, too, could undoubtedly be done toward providing more sanitary and better cooled cars for use in shipping cream. CREAM GRADING A spirit of progress must guide those who are interested in the development of the industry if dairying is to gain and hold the place to which it is entitled in our agricultural system. With the demand for better cream must come a cream price based </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Cooling Tanks and Milk Houses 13 strictly on grade. As long as the cream producer sees his in - different neighbor producing poor cream and receiving the same price for it, it will be extremely difficult to convince him that quality really counts in the making of good butter. However, one should not lose sight of the fact that every additional can of good cream helps directly or indirectly the general average of the butter made, as well as the price secured for it. Fig. 8 — A small milk house It is sincerely hoped that all creameries will have sufficient faith in the importance of cream grading to reward the producer of the higher grade of cream with a better price. It will not be difficult to convince the farmer of the desirability of basing the cream price upon quality, for already he sells his wheat and corn according to grade. His cattle and hogs are now sold according </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Circular 3 to quality, and he prides himself on his skill in "topping the market." There is nothing visionary or impractical in cream grading, for wherever it has been faithfully and conscientiously tried and has been accompanied by payment on the quality basis, there has been a marked increase in the amount of first grade butter made. Fig. 9 — Plan of small milk house (10x10) MILK HOUSES When we have reached the point where grading is an accom - plished fact and the advantages of that system of buying are better understood, it will not require the amount of argument that it does at present to convince many dairymen that a milk house is not a luxury, but a very desirable part of the farm equipment. The location of the milk house should be studied carefully. Convenience, good drainage, and cleanliness are the principal factors that should govern the choice of a location. It should not be in the barn or directly connected with it. A closed alley leading from a door in the side of the barn to the milk house is often a convenient arrangement and saves steps. This arrange- </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Cooling Tanks and Milk Houses 15 ment may have to be altered, however, to secure the advantage of good light, freedom from barn odors, and a well-drained site. A location outside the barnyard is to preferred, in order that the farm animals may be kept away from it. In locating the milk house, the greatest possible advantage should be taken of ths beneficial effects of sunlight. A building need not be expensive to fulfill all of these conditions. The expense involved in the Fig. 10 — A large milk house with separate room for engine (See figure 11) construction of a milk house will be governed, of course, by the quantity of dairy product handled on the farm. A dairy house need not be expensive, however, to be convenient and sanitary. The most desirable type of milk house is one that is sufficiently large to accommodate all of the necessary dairy equipment, and it should be used for no other purpose. A cement floor with a uniform slope from all sides to a central drain will be found most satisfactory. The walls and ceiling may be either of wood or of cement plaster. The latter is the more desirable but a little more expensive. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Circular 3 16 The building should be provided with enough windows to insure an abundance of light and good ventilation. The cream cooling tank, separator, wash sink, tester, scales, and milk sheet make up the necessary equipment. An outside rack where dairy utensils can be sunned is a valuable addition. i % \ % (at w 5 | I i I "s | - — — H </seg>
            <seg id="p017">Cooling Tanks and Milk Houses 17 A milk house such as the one shown in figures 8 and 9 is suitable for the small dairy farm. It is so simple in construction that any farmer should be able to build one with no other aid than that of the farm help. On many farms the separator is run by a gasoline engine. In that case, the milk house shown in figures 10 and 11 is the most de - sirable. It will be noticed that the engine is placed in a separate room. This precaution is neces - sary to avoid tainting the fresh milk and cream with the odor of gasoline. The engine room, how - ever, may contain, in addition to the engine, a water heater or small steam boiler for heating the water for washing and sterilizing. ICE FOR CREAM COOLING Either type of milk house de - scribed above may be enlarged so that one end may be used for an ice house. In view of the fact that an abundant supply of ice may be had every winter for the harvest - ing in practically all parts of Ne - braska, it seems strange that more of the farmers of this State do not take advantage of this oppor - tunity to store ice for summer use. All of the larger cities offer splendid markets for sweet cream at good prices thru the summer months, but under present condi - tions this market is restricted to the few who live within a short distance of the city.

On this basis a 20-cow dairy will require 8 to 10 tons. To this should be added about 50 per cent to allow for shrink - age and for household uses. Since a ton of ice with packing occupies about 50 cubic feet, an ice house 12'xl3'xlO' will be ample for most farms. The better the construction the less will be the loss due to shrinkage; and even tho ice is cheap, good workmanship and proper insulation will be found a profitable investment in ice house construction.

The solution of this problem lies in the observance of a few simple rules which may he stated as follows : It is impossible to produce clean milk and cream unless the cows, stable, milker, utensils, and separator are clean. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">Cooling Tanks and Milk Houses 19 To wash milk utensils use, first, cold water for rinsing; second, warm water containing a small quantity of good washing powder for cleansing; third, boiling water for sterilizing. Wash the separator thoroly after each separating. Use a metallic strainer. It is practically impossible to keep cloth strainers sweet and clean and free from bacteria. Skim the milk as soon after milking as possible, and cool the cream at once. Skim a cream testing from 35 to 45 per cent butter fat. Cream of this richness keeps best, and at the same time is not so sticky that it cannot be properly stirred and accurately tested. By skimming a rich cream, more skim milk is left at home for feed, and there is also smaller bulk on which to pay express charges. Do not mix new, warm cream with cold cream until it has been cooled in the shotgun can provided for this purpose. Keep the cans of cream in a cooling tank until time of de - livery. Deliver the cream to the creamery or cream station early in the morning, and not less than three times a week during the summer, and twice a week during the winter. Protect the cans of cream from the sun by covering with canvas or with a wet sack while enroute. f4-12- &gt; 17-2OM] [9-20-'17-5M| I6-9-19.3MI </seg>
