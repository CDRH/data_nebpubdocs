REPOBT OF ANNUAL MEETING. 

PRAYER BY J. H. PRESSON. 

O Lord, we acknowledge Thee in all our ways. We thank Thee that we 

are co-laborers with Thee. As tillers of the soil, we plough and plant; we 

scatter the seed broadcast and in the furrow. We look above for the sun- 

shine and the rain. We labor and are glad, as we see the blade, the stalk. 

the ear and the full corn in the ear, and in the harvest we rejoice, as we 

bring in the sheaves. 

Bless, we beseech Thee, this organization, whose object is to bring to 

the highest possible perfection the various grains and grasses of our 

fields; those also who labor for the best results in the cultivation of the 

vineyard, the orchard and the meadow; and may all others who engage 

in any useful pursuits receive Thy blessing. May the officers and members 

of this society be endowed with wisdom, that they may do those things 

which will best promote the interest of our great state. May peace and 

harmony prevail in all the deliberations of this body. Grant us these 

things, we ask in Thy name. Amen. 

As per by-laws, the President had appointed in advance of this meeting 

the following Committee on Credentials: W. R. Mellor, G. W. Hervey and 

V. Arnold. Also as an Auditing Committee: L. Morse, L. D. Stilson and

THE STATE FAIR OF 1902. 

The fair of 1902 was, in near all essentials, superior to any of its 

predecessors, showing both growth and progress. The need for more 

ample provisions for the best presentation of products were plain to all 

observers. The value of our fair from an educational standpoint is more 

recognized annually. The fact that our legislature, in the exercise of its 

wisdom, has provided permanent grounds for this use is evidence of this. 

If fairs are of value to any, they are to all. Nothing should be placed on 

exhibition not of an instructive character. Side-show, fakes should not be 

entertained. Substantially, the management, at present, are compelled 

to use them as sources of revenue with which to defray expenses. To 

obviate this the legislature should, even if contingent, provide other 

¦wnn Together with such resources, the management is at the mercy 

and dependent upon climatic conditions. 

NEBRASKA OBOP8 FOE THE YEAR 1902. 

The value of agricultural statistics, as well as of all other industries. 

becomes more apparent annually. Experience teaches more and more 

that only systematic and scientific farming "pays." This more particu- 

larly of later years, because of the sharp competition in all vocations. 
Twenty years' active experience in obtaining agricultural data and 

tabulating same in Nebraska warrants me in asserting that, under existing 

modes, the best that can be said of the work is that it is far from being 

correct, and is unsatisfactory. In too many instances tabulations are got- 

ten up and given publicity for special speculative purposes. Eight or ten 

years since the national agricultural statistician of the department at 

Washington fell under the displeasure of his chief and was discharged, </seg>

being accused of manipulating figures to suit large dealers in agricultural 
products. In our own state, the reports of county societies are due at 
the annual meeting, too late to be of use. Even when they are rendered, 
they are too meagre to be of practical benefit. I have never had a full 
report but once from any county in the state, and that was made for a 
premium of $50 offered by myself. What we need Is a new and compulsory 
system. Precinct assessors, under severe penalty for non-performance 
of duty, should be required to obtain and place on file such data 
as will give the truth as to acreage and yields.

AOKKl LTtRK IN NKBRASKA. 

To the few now living who witnessed placing the corner-stone of agriculture 
in Nebraska and spared to behold present results will be accorded 
expressions of pride. Pride of the present, and well based hopes for the 
future, is the equal exultant shared by every citizen of the state, no matter 
what the age of his citizenship. 

Ethis connection and retrospecting the commencement, progress and 
ent of agriculture in Nebraska, I yield to temptation and quote from 
address of the lamented J. Sterling Morton, delivered by him at the 
territorial fair, held in 1858. Just at this time we were beginning to 
I and see a future of worth in agriculture for Nebraska. We had 
ed a severe winter, and many had left the territory discouraged: 

"The spring of 1858 dawned upon us, and the icy hand of winter relazed 
its hold upon the earth, and the prairies were once more clothed In 
sunshine and emerald. The result of our thinking during the long dreary 
winter was now about to be embodied in active efforts to enhance our real 
prosperity and substantial wealth. If there were any fortunes to be made 
in Nebraska, they were to be acquired by frugality and persevering exertion 
alone. The soil was to be tilled and taxed for (he support of the 
dwellers thereon: and out of it and it alone was all true and substantial 
independence to be derived. The gloom of the long night of poverty was 
about passing away forever. The clouds were breaking; the effulgence of 

a better and brighter day sent Its first glad beams to reanimate and rejoice 
the dispirited and encourage the strong and hopeful. Labor at once 
began, and its hundred voices made the air resonant with its homely 
music. All about us, on every side, the prairie plow was at work, turning 
over, as it were, the first page in the great volumes of our prosperity. 
Everywhere were brawny arms lifted up to strike the earth, that a 
stream of plenty and contentment might flow forth and bless our country. 
Everywhere these rich and rolling prairies, which had lain for unnumbered 
years as blank leaves in the history of the world's progress, were 
being written upon by the hands of toil. Seed had been sown, farms 
opened and every energy had been taxed to make the territory of Nebraska 
self-sustaining. It was the first genuine effort in the right direction. 
The people were roused to the fact that agriculture, and that alone, was 
to be the sole support, the sheet anchor and the salvation of the territory. 
The first steamers that came up the Missouri in 1857 brought us corn to 
keep us and our stock from perishing by hunger and starvation. We paid 
for it at the rate of two dollars per bushel. But now, by the energy of 
the farmers, Nebraska, in less than two years, had been transformed from 
a consumer to a producer. And the steamboats of the old Missouri bore 
away from our shores in the spring of 1859 hundreds of thousands of 
bushels of corn to the southern and eastern markets, which we did not 
need for our home use, and for which, at the rate of forty cents per 
bushel, we have taken more money than for town lots in the last eighteen 
months, or will in the next twenty-four. Thus, imperfectly and hurriedly, 
I have narrated the history of agriculture in Nebraska down to the planting 
of last year's crop. What that was, and how much greater the breadth 
of land cultivation than ever before, the new farms that met the eye on 
every hand and the vast fields of ripening grain that magically usurped 
the place of rank prairie grass, eloquently proclaimed. </seg>

"If our brief and only half improved past has been thus encouraging 
and thus indicative of prosperity; if, notwithstanding the mercilessness 
of the panic and scarcity of money, the present time, to-day, finds Nebraska 
richer in the true elements of prosperity, stronger in the golden 
capital of skillful industry and contented labor than she ever was before, 
who shall predict the future? Who shall attempt to portray the fullness 
and glory of her destiny? 

"We stand to-day upon the very verge of civilization, riding upon the 
head wave of American enterprise; but our descendants, living here a 
century hence, will be in the center of American commerce, the mid-ocean 
of our national greatness and prosperity. Upon this very soil, the depth 
and richness of which is unsurpassed in the whole world, manufacture 
and skill in the various arts may, and will undoubtedly aid us in our pursuit 
of a glorious and independent opulence; but our great trust and 
strong hope is still hidden in the fertility of our soil and its adaptation 
to general cultivation. 

"It may be urged, and often is, that the calling of the farmer is an 
arduous and homely one. That it is arduous no one can deny, but it 1* honorable. 
The idea that a man cannot be a true gentleman and labor with 
the hands, is an obsolete, a dead and dishonored dogma. All labor is 
honorable. Men sturdy in mind and thought, even as they are robust in 
body and active in all that pertains to the full development and perfection 
of the physical system of mankind, let it be our high aim, by our enlihgtened 
and well-directed training of both the body and the mind, to elevate 
and improve our race and make the western man the model, both physical 
and intellectual, from which all the world may be happy to make copies. 

"Be inspired then to hasten the carving out of that destiny of indisputable 
superiority which God has assigned the American people; and so inspired 
and laboring in the great field of the world's advancement, when 
death, that harvester whom no seasons control and no laws restrain, 
gathers you to his dark and noiseless garner, may you go, like the grain 
that has thrived and ripened in the brightest sunshine, pure and untainted 
by the mildews of the world, back to Him who planted mortality 
on the earth, that immortality might be reaped and garnered and loved 
in Heaven." 

VALUE OF FARM LANDS. ETC. 

In a late issue of Scribner's Monthly, W. S. Harvard says of the experiment 
stations in the United States; 

"It is quite like turning the pages of a book of magic to look over the 
work in progress by the experiment stations -of the United States, so remarkable 
are the achievements of the powerful adjuncts of modern agriculture. 
The word 'station' ill-fits them. They are not stations, but powerful 
institutions, exerting an important influence upon state, indeed 
upon national life. They are of large economic importance, and are 
in immediate and constant touch with the sources and development 
of our national wealth. In direct increase of this wealth, they show 
marked results; indirectly, their influence is still more significant. These 
results are annually becoming more important, not only from the standpoint 
of science, but in actual and enormous increase in national wealth 
on the property of the public." 

The last official national census, 1900, shows the great Importance of 
agriculture in the United States. At that time 25,739,657 farms were being 
operated. These were valuo.l at $16,673,694,247, of which amount 3,560.-198,191, 
or over 21 per cr-.t, represented the value of buildings, and 13,-114,492,056, 
or over 18 ;-er cent, represented the value of lands and im- </seg>

provemenu other than buildings. The value of live stock for that year 
is placed at $3,078,050,041, and farm machinery and implements at 761.-261,550, 
making a total value of farm property amounting to 20,514,001,-848.

Mr. Potnteb: I more you that the report be adopted. 
Seconded and carried. 

Chairman: We will have the report of the chairman of the Board of 
Managers. 

Mr. C. H. Ritooe: As chairman of your Board of Managers I herewith 
submit the following report: 

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OP THE BOARD OP MANAGERS. 

The past year your Board of Managers has expended $4,713 for permanent 
improvements on the fair grounds, which in their judgment was 
expended where most needed. It has been largely spent for facilities for 
taking care of the large exhibit of live stock. When the new stock buna 
were built in 1901 it was thought by all that we would hare ample capacity 
for taking care of all the live stock that would be put on exhibition; but 
to our surprise our barns were more than filled and it was found quite 
expensive to put up temporary quarters for the means of taking care of 
the exhibit. One of the first things your Board took up the past year 
was to arrange for and have constructed one horse barn, two cattle barns, 
and one swine barn at an expense of $3,500. With this additional capacity 
we were overcrowded the past year as much as we were in 1901, and in 
order to take care of the overflow it was necessary to rent five tents and 
equip them for use in exhibiting stock. 

We have set out under the direction of J. H. Hadkinson some 300 trees 
at an expense of $185. It was found necessary to put on a new roof on 
one of the speed barns and do a large amount of repairing on all the 
other old buildings that were on the ground, Including a new ticket office 
at the amphitheatre, the removal of two small buildings to be used as an 
office for superintendents of classes A and B, the moving of a ticket office 
at the main gates on account of the change made by street car company, 
lumber on hand that was used in tents, all of which cost $750. Furnishing 
lumber for the Horticultural Society for improvement on Horticultural 
Hall to the amount of $65. Grading around Horticultural' Hall and main 
driveway at an expense of $95. New show-cases in Art Hall $118. 

RAILROAD FACILITIES. 

Early last year the B. ft M. R. R. made application to extend their track 
in the ground up to the rear of Fish Building. This was granted by your 
Board, and they now have trackage enough inside of ground to unload 
all exhibits, which is done at much less expense to exhibitors and cars 
can be unloaded in half the time it took heretofore. Also the convenience 
to patrons on account of the passenger service given there by the B. A M. 
I am sure is appreciated. 

Pur Board has received some publicity in the press from statement* 
i by the Lincoln Traction Company, the company which operates the 
t-car service to and from the grounds, and as the Board did not care 
ter into a long newspaper correspondence they have deferred making 
statement, and I think in some cases the wrong impression has ex- </seg>

            <seg id="p040">

NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

isted in the minds of many, and I believe at this time you should know 
the exact facts that are connected with this transaction. Tour Board 
has been accused of shutting out the street car company. These are not 
the facts. Tour Board, time and again, have asked the street car company 
to extend their tracks into the grounds and has given the street car 
company equal facilities for terminals within the grounds with the railroad 
company, and this resolution is still in force. It is to the inter— ti 
of the fair that the street car company have an entrance to the grounds, 
and since I have been on the Board it has never been refused and the 
Board are only too anxious for them to extend their track this year and 
will give them the best facilities now at our disposal. 

BY-LAWS. 

I desire to call attention of the different superintendents to section 44 of 
our by-laws, which requires all superintendents, both class and general, 
to make a written report to the Secretary or Board of Managers at the 
close of each fair. In some cases this has been complied with, but in a 
great many it has not; and I believe it very important that each superintendent 
make a report. Said report should embrace recommendations to 
the Premium List Committee under their supervision and improvements 
as to minor changes in buildings, etc. A report of this kind would be of 
great value to the Board of Managers and Premium List Committee, as 
the superintendent who gives his personal attention to one department 
is in a better position to know the requirements of his department than 
the Board of Managers. Respectfully submitted, 

C. H. Rudge, Chairman. 

Chairman: What will you do with the report of the chairman of the 
Board of Managers? 

Mb. Bargee: I move that it be adopted and placed on record. 

Motion, on being seconded, carried. 

President Dinsmore then delivered his annual address as follows: 

THE PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL ADDRESS. 

Gentlemen of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: The great 
clock in the chaber of the Omnipotent never stands still; it ticks off the 
yean as it has ticked off the centuries; now it has struck the hour, and 
another year in the history of the State Board of Agriculture has begun. 

With hearts filled with gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of heaven and 
earth, the giver of every good and perfect gift, for the manifold blessings 
which He has vouchsafed to us as men and agriculturists during the 
Tear last passed, I cordially greet you, members of the State Board and 
accredited representatives of the county agricultural societies, to this 
our annual meeting. 

,L MEETING. 

Since lost we met in this hall a year has passed, in many respects a 
remarkable one. Never during the past thirty years have we had just </seg>

Esason as the one Just passed, unusually dry In many parts of the 
seed ing-time, to be later followed with an excess of rain which 
into the harvest, resulting in the loss of an unusual amount of 
lin, interfering with threshing and fall seeding. 

Corn was never so immature at the time of frost as during the past 
season Notwithstanding all drawbacks and discouraging conditions the 
agriculturist finds himself favored in a marked degree, crops of all kinds 
of grain abundant, prices fair, grass and forage abundant, so that there is 
abundant for both man and beast. 

PEO8PEBITY OF AGRICULTURAL UHIBTH, 

gpast year has been marked by a phenomenal raise in the values of 
tate, the transfers of which have been largely among residents of 
'n state; thus in a most substantial manner showing their conin 
the resources of the state, and the dividend-paying qualities of 
11. 

Eile the farmer has been most prosperous, the exclusive stockmen 
s state have been blessed in a marked degree; ravaging disase has 
almost unknown among the stock, while an abundance of grass has 
shed an unusual amount of beef direct from the pasture and at 
i not dreamed of in past years. * 

All in all the agriculturists of the state were never in a more prosperous 
condition, never had more for which to return thanks to the giver of all 
good and perfect gifts. 

WORK OF THE BOARD OF MANAGERS. 

The officers of the association, upon entering upon their duties at the 
commencement of the year, were met with less perplexing questions than 
in some of the years past; however, they were compelled to make provisions 
for a considerable increase in the live stock department. In 
doing so they built one horse barn, two cattle barns, and one swine barn, 
of the same size and general appearance of the barns heretofore on the 
grounds. These buildings were put up at a cost of $3,500, and were paid 
for out of funds improvised by the Board. 

The fair held can truly be ranked as one of the most successful held by 
the Board, the attendance was large, and the net results financially satisfactory. 
From the start there appeared to be a spirit of emulation, alike 
among the exhibitors, patrons, officers, and employes of the association, 
to make the fair a grand success, which was most happily realized. 

TRASSPGRTATIOS. 

The system of public transportation, both of exhibits and patrons, was 
vastly improved over former years, which resulted in the saving of time 
and comfort of patrons, and in the end told to our benefit. 

The Lincoln Street Railway, which has heretofore entered the grounds, 
this year pulled out and delivered their patrons just outside the grounds. 
This was not entirely satisfactory to the public, nor was it to your </seg>

            <seg id="p042">

officers. It is to be hoped that they may be Induced to build into the 
grounds and deliver their passengers near where the Burlington railroad 
now delivers theirs, which I am sure would be more satisfactory to the 
public and profitable to the railway people. 

DECEASED MEMBERS. 

I -ins the past year the angel of death has more frequently than ever 
&gt; summoned from our ranks members to join the great throng be- 
Among the list so called are some of the earliest members of the 
[ who, when the efforts of the Board were in its infancy, gave of their 
and money without stint to advance the interests for which the 
I has ever stood and* worked. 

Early in the year Hon. J. Sterling Morton, a charter member of the 
Board, an ex-president, was called to lay down his life's work; and thus 
went out a noble life; his character, life, and work have added luster to 
the state. Hon. Samuel M. Barker was next called. He died at his home 
in Merrick county, this state, full of years and experience. He was an expresident 
of the Board, who during the years of its struggling for an 
existence was always at the front ready to do anything he could in the 
interest of the Board. H. C. Lidlck died at his home in Burt county, 
tb*s state. While one of the younger members of the Board in point of 
service, he was a man of ripe years, full of experience, and ever ready to 
do for the advancement of the Board's interests. Hon. J. R. Cantlin died 
at Valdosta, Ga., soon after our last semi-annual meeting, which he attended. 
While one of the younger members in point of service, he had 
been with us for many years as the representative of the agricultural 
society of his county, an earnest worker and a true friend of agriculture. 
Richard Daniels, late of Sarpy county, this state, died on the evening of 
November 30 in the city of Chicago, where he had gone to attend the 
international live stock show. He was many years a member of this 
Board and an earnest, indefatigable worker. He was one of, if not the 
first exhibitor of Shorthorn cattle at our fairs; a man who did much for 
agriculture in general and for live stock interests of the state. The influence 
of his life's work will be felt and bear fruit for generations to 
come. These men were, each and all of them, men of character and influence 
in their respective home circles, the influence of some extending 
beyond the state throughout the nation. To know them was an honor to be 
proud of. Our loss is their gain. May their memory be to us an incentive 
to higher and nobler acts in the interests of agriculture and good 
government. 

OUB FINANCES. 

The financial standing will be disclosed by the reports of the Secretary 
and Treasurer, which I think will be satisfactory to you and be of general 
interest to the public. 

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED. 

There are many improvements and repairs that should be made on the 
grounds, much more than can be done this year. The race track should </seg>

            <seg id="p043">
43 

REPORT OF ANNUAL MEETING. 

be rebuilt, it having been seriously damaged by the high water of the 
past season. The amphitheatre should be enlarged. Our fish building is 
much too small to house and accommodate the most attractive exhibit 
that we have on the grounds. 

RECOMMENDATION'S 

I recommend that the Legislature be asked for an appropriation for the 
purpose of building a new fish building, 60x110 feet, with permanent 
aquariums and plumbing, costing $9,000. Also, for the building of two 
water-closets, one for women and one for men, to be constructed according 
to modern plans, capable of accommodating not less than twenty-four 
persons in each at the same time, costing about $4,800, including necessary 
sewerage. This is made necessary by the sad deficiency In our 
present accommodations, which are too small in size and incapable of 
being kept in a cleanly manner at times when in greatest need of being so. 

I recommend that inducements be held out to exhibitors of implements 
to build permanent buildings on the grounds, and for that purpose a 
system of leases be entered into giving the party the exclusive use of the 
ground covered for a term of years, for the purpose of exhibiting, at the 
Eie time reserving the right to the Board to lease the buildings and 
unds for temporary purposes whenever for any cause the lessor should 
lect or fail to exhibit themselves. 

DATES OF FAIR. 

We are assigned the following dates by the International Association of 
Fair Managers, viz., September 4 to 11 inclusive, thus giving us the week 
following the fair in Minnesota (with whose dates we have for years 
clashed). It should result in our having a much larger live stock show, 
which, if it develops, will require increased facilities to care for them. 

PREMIUMS FOR NEBRASKA ANIMALS. 

In my opinion the time has arrived when the Board should encourage 
the showing of live stock of known purity of breeding owned and bred 
in the state. In these exhibits the age of females in the cattle classes 
should be restricted to animals of two years old or under, and in the 
classes for horses to three years old or under. Classes thus formed, 
with proper cash premiums, should bring out a large exhibit of animals 
bred in the state that would show our people that there are- herds and 
studs capable of furnishing the necessary sires for the improvement of 
all of our stock. 

ALLIED ASSOCIATION MEETINGS. 

There has been prepared a most complete program for a series of meetings 
by allied associations. Prominent speakers have been secured and 
a real treat promised for all who will attend the meetings to be held 
in this hall the evenings of this week. All are cordially Invited to attend. 

I wish to return thanks at this time to every member of this Board for 
the loyal support they have at all times given me in the discharge of my </seg>

44 


duties. To the members of the Board of Managers I am under especial 

obligations for the unselfish and painstaking cheerfulness with which 

they have responded to my every call for advice or service which at 

times has meant a pecuniary sacrifice to them 

I now return to you the office which you so generously extended to me 

one year ago. I have done what I could to uphold its reputation and 

maintain the honor of the Board.

development and advancement of agriculture. He was always generous of 
his means and time most liberally. 

Resolved, That this Board regrets the death of one so valuable to itself, 
the state, and the community in which he lived. 

Resolved, That we hereby extend our sympathy to his bereaved family. 

Resolved, That a page in the year-book be set apart and dedicated to his 
memory; and further, that the Secretary be requested to furnish member* 
of the family of the deceased with a copy of these resolutions. 

G. W. Hebvet. 

Lincoln, Neb., January 20, 1903. W. A. Potwteb. 

Whereas, In the death of Richard Daniels, of Sarpy county, there has 
gone from among us one who for many years was an active and useful 
member of this Board, one who contributed liberally of his time and 
ability in promoting the best interests of this association as member, manager 
and exhibitor. In the latter role and that of breeder he was so conspicuous, 
strong and prominent that he was recognized as the father of the 
Shorthorn industry of our young and growing state. He was especially 
well and favorably known to a long list of breeders, feeders, exhibitors 
and competitors in the show-ring of our greatest fairs, where his animals 
always won a good share of blue ribbons, thirty years ago. The writer 
recalls the inspiration it gave when he with his famous herd arrived in 
the old days, and It is safe to say that no one man did more to stimulate 
and build up the breeding of ideal typical Shorthorn cattle than he in his 
long and well rounded life of usefulness. He was of a most congenial disposition 
and one who made strong friendship among his associates. This 
was made so manifest on his visit at our last fair. He was born in Davonshire, 
England, 1830, and died December 11, 1902, suddenly, at the Fat 
Stock Show, Chicago. "Peace be to his ashes." 

Resolved, That we tender to the surviving members of his household 
our sympathy; and further, that we set apart a page in the year-book 
dedicated to his memory, and the Secretary be, and is hereby, instructed 
to furnish a copy of these resolutions to the surviving members of his

claimed another one of our members, our Viee-President, J. R. Cantlin, of 
Blair, Washington county; therefore, 

I (red, That in the sudden and unexpected death of Mr. Cantlin this

earnestness was always manifest in the part he took in discussions

Mb. Hebvet: I more the adoption of the resolutions. 

Same being seconded, was adopted. 

Chairman: What is your further pleasure? 

8KUTABY Fubkas: You all remember at the last session of the legislature 
of this state a bill was passed substantially killing off county 
societies in this state. I have had quite a number of representatives here 
on this occasion to call upon me and ask that I bring that matter before 
this meeting; especially a delegation from Jefferson seemed to be particularly 
interested and desired that I should bring it up in some shape 
or other. In order to get an expression from this society whether by vote 
here, when we are together, or by fixing it at another place and time, I 
would suggest to the gentleman from Jefferson county that now is as 
good an opportunity as you will have to get a full expression from the 
members of this society. It might be talked over perhaps a little more in 
detail, and there is nothing to prevent its being talked over now before 
the Board. There is nothing else before the Board, and I have brought 
the matter up, and if the members see fit to discuss it, I will offer a 
motion, or others may do the same thing, to obtain an expression. 

Chairman: I am waiting to hear an expression from the members. 

Mb. Steele, of Jefferson county: In regard to the law that was passed 
here last winter. It was the reunion of agricultural interests, and I thought 
it would be a good opportunity to come up here to this meeting and get 
the feeling of every president of the different societies and agricultural 
interests in the state and have their voice upon the matter, and if it is 
favorable, to get up a request or petition to the legislature to amend that 
law in some way. That was my idea. I want to hear from these different 
presidents and get their opinions in regard to the matter. 

Mb. FVbnas: State what effect that had on your county. 

Mb. Steele: It had the same effect in our county as in others probably. 
Of course we aim to pay good premiums in order to do a good business. 
Without this aid we don't feel ourselves able to have agricultural fairs. 
That is the object in having this agricultural law amended so that we can 
draw our usual amount of money as before. I suppose other counties 
are in the same fix. I know Nuckolls county is. We started in to have 

a fair last fall. Of course, we saw we could not get any aid from the 
town or commissioners, and it seemed as if about two-thirds of the 
county commissioners have turned it down; and so, if that law is not 
changed to aid these agricultural societies, they will be turned down 
everywhere. My object was to get this thing around in shape to Intro- </seg>

duce a request to the legislature and have the president of each county 
sign it, and show them the use and need of having this law pnt back 
as before. That is my Idea. I would like to hear from every president 
here. 

Mb. Fillet: As representative from Gage County Agricultural Society 
I desire to say that we are in the same flx down there. We went ahead 
and held our fair, and then our county board did not pay over the money. 
I would be in favor of a law being passed by the legislature making it 
compulsory upon this board of commissioners to pay over these fund* 
when these county organizations have gone ahead and fulfilled their 
contract — in other words, held their fair, — and I would like to see a 
petition, or something gotten up, and have it signed by all the presidents 
or representatives of different counties over this state, — a petition for 
the legislature to pass such a law. 

Mb. Younoebs: I understand from the remarks of the Secretary that 
there is a bill introduced. Can you tell us the nature of the bill in the 
house? 

Secretary Furnas: I don't know what it is. 

Chairman: I understand the nature of it is this, to pay three cents for 
each inhabitant in the county on the basis of five inhabitants to each vote 
cast for the member of congress at the last preceding election. This is 
really the re-enactment of the bill that was repealed two years ago. 

Mr. Youngers: I make a motion that it is the sense of this meeting 
that that bill pass. 

Mr. Williams : I move to amend the motion, that the president of this 
association appoint a committee to draw up a memorial to the legislature 
earnestly praying that the bill before the legislature may be so amended 
that it will stand as it was before. 

A Mtuim- I wish to qualify it to the effect that the amount shall not 
exceed three cents to each inhabitant. 

Chairman: My memory says three cents for each inhabitant on the 
basis of five inhabitants to each vote cast at the last preceding election. 
I may be wrong. 

Mb. Wilson: I second the motion. 

Mb. Hebvey: I think it would be well to add to that, that each member 
here, or president, will work upon their representative in the house to 
consent to use their influence. I think we can get at it as well that way 
as this way. I think when you come to work upon the members of the 
house that they will pass this question the same as two years ago, on account 
of western interests taking advantage of that law, and I think you 
will have to embody it in this bill before it will pass either house, and 
leave it so that it can be overhauled by the agricultural counties. I think 
why the present bill was passed was on account of some of the grazing 
counties taking advantage of this law. I think you will have to change 
that law before it will pass the house. That seems to be the sentiment. 

Mr. Mann: Where there is an organization organized which consists </seg>

of the farmers paying on each to the amount of $50 to organize an agricultural 
society. Speaking about the grazing districts. If in our grazing 
districts we have an agricultural organization, and they offer to pay 
premiums, why it would not hardly be right to bar them out, after my 
way of thinking, for some of our western counties the appropriation will 
run $110, $115, etc., and the sense of this meeting is that with $10,000 in 
one county would make it a one-sided issue. Our agricultural societies or 
country argricultural societies, are all auxiliary to our state society. The 
old bill was a good one. I don't know as the western counties get that 
money who run a side-show. I think the old bill is aa good a bill, as far 
as I can see, as any new bill where it would bar out where we don'.t have 
10,000 inhabitants. I am speaking for the western part of the county. I 
would be in favor of our legislature re-enacting the old measure, or one 

The following was read and adopted: 

Whebeas, The law governing the county appropriation for the maintenance 
of county agricultural societies was so changed by an act of the 
legislature in 1901, making it optional with boards of county commissioners 
whether or not they grant the county aid, or any part of it, as 
provided by existing provisions of law, and that the State Board of Agriculture 
find that under this existing optional provision of county aid it is 
working a hardship and embarrassment to the best interests. County 
agricultural societies of Nebraska have been fostered, and which has been 
responsible, more than all other influences, for the present high standard 
of our state's exhibitive character. 

Ill, Morse: I don't know where you can draw the line for agricultural 
counties in Nebraska. I lived up in Dundy county a year ago. We 
shipped grain down east so that you fellows could have something to feed 
your chickens with — and it was very good corn — and I am rather doubtful 
of a memorial being any good. The legislature don't like to read memorials. 
I certainly am in favor of the re-enactment of the old bill, and 
I think a resolution properly drawn to this effect would do a great deal 
of good. 

PIr. Fletcher: I move that the President and Secretary of this society 
appointed a legislative committee to look after this. 

Mb. Johnson: I don't mean to infer that I am opposed to the western 
counties in any respect. I only meant to bring this question before this 
committee so that they will know what they are running up against I 
am in favor of the re-enactment of the old bill. That question arose in 
my talks with the members of the legislature and I simply mention it so 
as to be prepared. 

Mb. Williams: It is all politics. It was politics that passed that measure 
two or three years ago. It originated with the different boards of 
county commissioners throughout the state. They wanted to bring the 
agricultural elements down on their knees for political purposes to beg 
for that appropriation. A delegation who understood their business should 
wait upon the state board of commissioners that is now in session in 
Omaha, and ask them, in the interest of good judgment and of the state </seg>

REPORT OF ANNUAL MEETING. 

that is purely agricultural, to keep their hands off that bill and let it be 
repealed, as we know who passed it and we know who we have got to go 
up against to have it repealed. I was through that fight two years ago. 
I know who drew up that bill and I know that money was appropriated by 
the state board of county commissioners to pass it. It was killed once la 
the lower house. It was taken up and reconsidered and passed, and to 
do anything with the repealing of that bill I think you must reach it 
through the board of county commissioners that is now in session at 
Omaha. I am not in favor of a petition. I am in favor of a body of 
representative men, say three, that would wait upon the different agricultural 
meetings that are now being held in Lincoln, and talk to them in • 
business way to use a little influence with the county commissioners, and 
get their representatives to let that bill be repealed for two or three yean, 
and I think we can accomplish more by diplomacy than we can by resolving 
or by petition. I am certain that if the three men mentioned now 
would go to Omaha and appear before the board of county commissioners 
and say that Nebraska is expected to take a front place in the ranks of 
agriculture, and by their influence to kill off that appropriation and prevent 
an appropriation to the different counties, that you have to appeal to these 
different counties to make a state exhibit, I believe they will keep their 
hands off and let that bill be repealed. Thre is a disposition in the house 
to repeal it unless there is some influence brought to bear from the 
source Of the county commissioners from the different counties they 
represent, and who nominated the representatives that were elected. They 
want to turn it into a political machine, for the members of the different 
agricultural societies go there and ask them in consideration of political 
favors that they will pass that appropriation. I am in favor of the delegation 
proposed. 

A Membeb: We are in the same boat, and I am very much impressed 
with this last gentleman's remarks in regard to this very question. It mean* 
a great deal with the county commissioners, and I know it does with our 
county, because last week we waited until the new board took their seats 
and they turned down our claim. We appealed and are going to carry it 
up, and to show you now that these commissioners are into this. Of the 
two commissioners two years ago who were on our board and helped to 
pass this law and positively refused time and again to allow us our share, 
one is now our representative from York, and you will see what we have 
got to fight. 

Chairman: You have heard the amendment to the amendment, that a 
committee of three be appointed as the legislative committee. Are you 
ready for the question? 

Upon receiving a second the amendment was adopted. 

B Williams: I would ask in the interest of good judgment, that if 
epresentatives of the press are present they make no mention of 
remarks on this question that may have been said about the county 
issioners; but that is what you will have to do, have them keep 
hands off. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

Chairman: I think the suggestion is good. 

Me. Williams: I know we will go before our commissioners. 

Chairman: The motion is carried as amended 

¦ Bassett: I wish to inquire if we are to have a committee on resolu- 
I have the following resolution I wish to offer, which is as follows: 

Retolveil. That the State Board of Agriculture commend the Nebraska 
game and fish laws, of which passage was urged by the members of this 
Board in the annual meeting of 1901. Under strict enforcement of these 
laws there has been a noticeable increase in game, song, and insectivorous 
birds, resulting in a great benefit to the agricultural interests of the state. 

We endorse the efficient administration of the Fish and Game Commission 
by its officers, and recommend their reappointment by Governor 
Mickey. 

I move its adoption. 

Motion seconded and carried. Adopted. 

BMcIntybe: I want to inquire of the Secretary if he has a roll of 
mbere, so that we can get up a voucher on this hotel bill account. 

Secbetaby: The report of the Committee on Credentials will answer it.

dded to the list. If so, I wish they would report to the committee. 

Mb. McIntybe: I see that the chairman of our old committee on rainmakers 
is present, and I would' like to call him up and see if that committee 
Is ready to report (Mr. Young). 

Chaibman: I think it is time for him to report. 

Me. Fletcher: Mr. Sutherland is here as a delegate. 

Mb. McIntybe: Mr. Sutherland, I think, handed me his credential and 
I left it on your table. 

Secbetaby: I remember of his speaking to me about it. 

Mb. Mc-Intybe: I didn't read it, but he handed it to me as his credential.

inserted in place of 


It was a certificate from the Secretary, as I was 

elected as a delegate.

Seconded and carried. 

Chairman: We will proceed to the nominations at once. 

The following nominations were made: Robt. W. Furnas, Nemaha

Mr. Walsh: I beg leave to pass a remark or two, as an old agriculturist 

and having thirty years' experience in county organizations and fairs. I 

would ask that that committee, in making their selections, select men of 

ability, men who have experience in agriculture, men who are hustlers. 

The State Board of Nebraska stands foremost in the eyes of every other 

state 01 the United States, and to keep up the reputation of the beat, I 

would ask those men to study wisely and well the qualities of each man 

that they recommend to serve on this Board, particularly this coming 

year. It is one of the most important years in the history of the state. 

Nebraska will have an opportunity at St. Louis, I hope, to show the 

United States and the world at large what it can do in the agricultural 

line and I would ask them and impress upon them, above all things, to 

select men of experience and hustling qualities, and whose past records 

would be a guarantee that they would serve if selected.

fill vacancies:

ington report has it 7,000,000. I ask this for the benefit of the farmers. 
The law requires the assessors to take that. 

Skbetary Fubnas: There is nearly 100,000,000 difference. 

Chairman: The assessment is made so early in the spring, as a rule, 
that this is very incorrect. 

Mb. Mouse: The farmer generally tells us what he is going to put in. 

Bretary Fubxas: That obtained from various sources, that I have re-1 
to in this state, but they varied from 176,000,000 to 300,000,000 
a state. I don't remember now what were the estimates from the 
tment at Washington. 

Mb. Bassett: Every man ought to know that the whole thing is guesswork 
from start to finish. 

Mb. Meixob: I don't see any merit in the request, for the reason, if 
Brother Furnas is right, it is of benefit to the farmer, because the less the 
acreage the better. I think the statistics taken from our Board will carry 
as much weight as the statistics taken from the government. 

SBcBrrABT Fubnas: I exercised a great deal of care in making these 
estimates, and as Brother Bassett, and all others know, who have had experience 
in gathering statistical matter, it is very largely guess-work. 

B Morse: The board of trade at Washington quotes Washington 
is 7,000,000, and it makes a difference about the price of corn, and it 
e important that we come nearer to that. I think our Secretary is 
nearly correct, but the board of trade figure it the other way. 

Ma. Hebvey: I move you that the Secretary's estimate is two millions 
near correct. I was statistician for twenty-five years. When I was assessor 
the farmers would not give it correct. 

Chairman : The motion is that it be declared the sense of this body that 
the report as furnished by your secretary is 2,000,000 nearer correct than 
that furnished by the Agricultural Department at Washington. 

Chairman: It has been quite the custom before adjourning at this time 
in our meetings to formally fix an hour to-morrow for the election of 
officers, making it a business of the Board here so that the parties may 
know when the officers are to be elected, and be present or not as they

BBPOET OF ANNUAL MEETING. 

ADDRESS OF WELCOME BY MAYOR H. J. W^INNBTT. 

I President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The gentleman handed me that 
rhen I came in and said there was a speech in it, but I don't find a 
in it. He reminds me of an old Quaker that I read of once. He 
iving some business with a man and it was not very pleasant, and 
s, "Williams, thee knows I never say harsh things of anybody, bat 
mayor of this town was to ask who is the biggest liar in it, I would 
lately look thee up and laying my hand on thy shoulder, tell thee 
lyor wished to see thee." 

Now I am very glad indeed of having the opportunity of extending a 
welcome to you on behalf of the city of Lincoln. I will occupy but a moment 
of your time because a gentleman who follows me knows all about 
agriculturists; he has been fanning them for the last eighteen or twenty 
yean to my knowledge. [Laughter.] But you have a great many things 
to be proud of, not only in the city of Lincoln, but in the state of Nebraska. 
The building that you occupy and in which you hold your meeting is your 
building. This campus is covered with buildings in which you have an 
equal interest with us. Lincoln is our home, but it is your capital, and 
we endeavor to make it such so you will be proud of it. 

I know, gentlemen, that you are probably aware that the state institutions, 
all these buildings, everything, you should have the same interest 
in them that we have. I have been in the state of Nebraska about twenty 
years, and I have had some little experience, not in farming exactly. My 
first experience in the state of Nebraska was sheep raising, and I will say 
that I did not have the same experience that a men I knew once did. He 
was an Englishman and he had been a miner all his life. He came to the 
western part of Pennsylvania directly from England. He had never lived 
on the farm, but he had saved a little money by hard work, and be bought 
a piece of land. At that time there were some New Englanders in Vermont 
selling sheep at great prices and they induced him to buy some 
sheep. Of course, he did not know how to take care of them, and one 
after another they died. One day I met him on the road — I was a boy — 
and I said to him, "How do you like farming?" He said, "If I ever farm any 
more, I will not farm sheep." But that was not my experience. I had 
quite an experience in the western part of this state. I was over four 
years in Cheyenne county, and I not only made my living, but I had an 
experience that has been very valuable to me. 

Phe state of Nebraska, when I was a boy, was known as the Great 
srican Desert, and now, although it has been a few years, it is within 
memory of men who have scarcely passed middle life. I can remember 
when nothing was here but a vast prairie, storm swept. But this great 
city of Lincoln and the city of Omaha, and the state at large, has bees 
Cvered by railroads and telegraph lines and telephone poles until it is 
w almost a checker-board, and in this you have all played your part. 

Now, gentlemen, in behalf of Lincoln, it is my desire to extend a wel- </seg>

come to you to-night, and I hope that during your stay here it will not only 
be agreeable, but profitable to you. I thank you. [Applause.]

a gentleman who will address you on behalf of the Commercial 
this city, Mr. Henry Mayer. 

ADDRESS OF WELCOME OF HENRY MAYER ON BEHALF OF THE 

COMMERCIAL CLUB OF LINCOLN. 

E Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I want to say, ladies and gentlethat 
what Mayor Winnett has said about my farming the farmers may 
le, but I am not going to tell all of it, because I will not give the snap 
— it is my own. 

I know a great deal about farming. I had four years of it less than he 
did. I came here to-night, ladies and gentlemen, representing the Commercial 
Club, a body of 400 men of Lincoln's business and professional 
men. I cannot tell you anything about farming; my part of the program 
la not any part of it. I came here representing these business men and 
to bid you welcome to — I was going to say our city — it la not our city, it 
is your city. This is the capital city of the state, and as such it is your 
city, and we always want you to feel when you come here that you are 
coming to your city, and when we ask you to meet with us as we often do, 
we ask you with the whole-souled feeling of fellowship, with the feeling 
that we want you here not for your dollars but for your presence. I know 
when men like you get together that you get together for the same purpose 
I go east — to see what is going on. And I know that when you go home 
that you will get some new ideas to carry back with you, and I hope that 
when you go baok home that you will carry back the feeling that the city 
of Lincoln welcomes you most heartily; that the Commercial Club is 
ever ready to do whatever it can for you or any other organization that 
comes to Lincoln here for the purpose of studying its little needs. I thank 

Chairman: It is my pleasure to now introduce to you a gentleman 
whose acqualntnce it has been my pleasure to have for nearly or quite a 
quarter of a century. It has been my pleasure to serve with him in the 
legislative bodies of this state; to meet him in business circles, to meet 
him in the political fields, and to know that he is a man true and tried, a 
man whom you have honored, and whom you have called to the highest 
position in the state, who will discharge that duty with fearlessness, and 
with credit to you and himself. I now have the honor of introducing to 
you Governor Mickey of this state. 

ADDRESS OF WELCOME BY GOVERNOR J. H. MICKEY. 

Ladies and Gentlemen: It certainly affords me pleasure to be in this 
place to-night, for if I should judge from your looks I don't see anybody 
here that wants anything. [Laughter and applause.] I come to you to- </seg>

night somewhat weary and fatigued over the day's duties, yet I come with 
a happy heart and feeling all right towards all of you, and so far as I 
know everybody else. I come to you with a feeling of satisfaction and 
rejoicing in the fact that I have been an humble factor with yon In helping 
to make our great state what it is to-day. I think if I got the thought 
right, I am here to-night to speak to you on the developments of agricultur 
— agricultural resources of our state of Nebraska. The state derives 
its name from an Indian name signifying "water valley." The act constituting 
the territory of Nebraska was approved May 30, 1854. Its area 
then was 351,558 square miles, which extended from the 40th parallel of 
latitude to British America on the north, and from the Missouri and Red 
rivers on the east to the summit of the Rocky Mountains on the wet. 
Some time ago I read a brief history published by the state, and I remember 
this sentence used in that history, speaking about the territory of 
Nebraska. It described the Yellowstone Park, I think it was; that was 
a portion of Nebraska at one time, and went on to describe it. The area 
of the territory was reduced to its present limits by the formation of the 
territories of Colorado and Dakota in 1861, and of Idaho in 1863. Nebraska 
was organized as a state March 1, 1867. It was my happy privilege 
to become a citizen of this state in 1868. I might stop and say that on 
September 30, 1868, my homestead entry, the homestead being in Polk 
county, Nebraska, was the first business transaction that was done in the 
Lincoln land office — that was September 30, 1868. I arrived in Lincoln, 
coming from Polk county, about 10 o'clock that morning. The land office 
had been removed from Nebraska City. The officers of the land office were 
busy preparing for business, and so they said to me, "If you will com* 
around just after dinner we will be ready for business," and I was there, 
and Mr. Kennedy, now of Omaha, being one of the officials and I have forgotten 
the other man, was the other officer, and as soon as they opened up 
after dinner my homestead entry was made. The population in 1900 was 
more than thirty-seven times as large as that given for 1860, the first year 
in which the population appears in the United States Census Reports. 
Nebraska is 208 miles in width and 412 miles in length; area over 76,000 
square miles, or over 49,000,000 of acres of land. Our state is larger than 
all of New England states combined. Has eight counties that are each 
larger than the state of Rhode Island. It is nearly seven times as large 
as Belgium; larger than England or Wales or Scotland and Ireland together.' 
Agriculture and stock raising are the main occupations in Nebraska. 
Total valuation of farm products in 1900 was $747,950,057, showing 
an increase of over 46 per cent in ten years, or over 480 per cent in twenty 
years. There are 121,600 farms in the state, an increase of 58,138 In 
twenty years, or 91.5 per cent increase in that time. The corn acreage of 
Nebraska alone is 2,668,665, greater than the entire improved farm acreage 
of Louisiana. In twenty years the average value of Nebraska farms 
increased 165 per cent.

P&gt;mestead, I had to have some corn to feed and I actually had to 
in the month of April from my homestead in Polk county to within 
miles of the city of PlatUmouth before I could find any corn to buy. 
True, there was some raised the year previous, but only enough for those 
who lived there and what they needed for their own consumption. I paid 
fifty cents a bushel just this side of PlatUmouth, and it took me a week, 
including a part of Sunday, with my wife in the wagon, to make the trip 
to get one load of corn, with which I planted thirty acres with the seed 
corn and fed my three horses. That was in the spring of 1869. Total 
number of acres devoted to crops in 1899 was 15,153,956 and the total 
value of crops was $92,469,326. The total value of all live stock on June 
1, 1900, wag over $150,000,000. The value of vegetables grown in 1899 was 
$3,201,228. In 1899 the production of eggs was 41,132,140 dozen, showing 
a gain of 76.5 per cent over that of 1889. In 1899 the total value of poultry 
productions amounted to $7,567,046, of which 53.8 per cent represented the 
value of eggs, and 46.2 per cent that of poultry raised. The total acreage of 
all crops for the year 1900 for Nebraska is greater than the total acreage of 
all crops in Colorado, Arizona, Indian Territory, Idaho, Louisiana, Massachusetts. 
Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey and New Hampshire combined. 
[Applause.] As in all of the above named states the acreage is 
14.950,364, while Nebraska shows an acreage of 15,153,956. In 1880 in the 
acreage of cereals Nebraska ranked fifteen of the states of the United 
States with an average of 3,500,246. 

I remember well, when I came to Nebraska in 1868 and then moved 
my family in 1869, that it was a problem, and an interesting problem, 
whether Nebraska would ever be an agricultural state. My homestead wm 
upon the Blue river, where we had some timber and bottom land, and 
certainly it was thought that if any of the land was good that the timber 
and bottom land would be perhaps best. Out on the upland between the 
Blue and Platte rivers, up on that high upland, it was a serious question 
whether that would be suitable for a great many years. I can remember 
that between here and on the upland, between this place and where I 
lived, it was a serious question but what it would be many years before 
that upland would be suitable. In Nebraska, where I live in Polk county 
and many other places on the high upland, the fact to-day is revealed that 
the best and most valuable farms that we have in Nebraska are on the 
table-lands. In York county, I read an instance the other day, a farm 
lying on the upland sold for $75 an acre, and in many other counties 
there are farms that cannot be bought for $75 an acre. We might ask 
what is the cause of the change; what has brought tne results that we 
have today? I want to stop here and pay tribute of respect to the men 
of this commonwealth that have withstood the drouth and grasshoppers 
and all these things that have gone to make up the sturdy citizenship of 
our commonwealth to-day, and we are reaping our reward. I believe in 
the providence of God where man does his utmost, and the Scriptures 
teach us that man's extremities are always God's opportunities to give </seg>

and reward the honest efforts of the millions whenever they throw themselves 
into the breach and are determined to accomplish that which God 
intended they should. 

I remember in an early day of a settler in Nebraska who came here yean 
before I did, who now is dead and gone. I remember he said to me, "For 
a fanner to come out into the interior of Nebraska and undertake to make 
a home and farm and raise products, he undertakes too much; he is foolish 
to try it. Why? Because every mile you travel up the Platte river you 
go up at the rate of ten feet to the mile, and when you get up about 200 
miles you are so high that you will never have products that will make 
the products valuable." He was an intelligent man, too. I am here to say 
that out in Dawson county that there for a number of years it has been 
my privilege to visit during the harvesting and threshing time and they 
have actually threshed from an acre of land from forty to sixty bushels 
of wheat to the acre, and I had the happy privilege a little while ago during 
the summer of talking with a man near Chaclron. nearing the Wyoming 
line, who said, "I cut from my own land last year over two thousand tons 
of alfalfa hay." And I could go on and show that it has been proven to me 
that the privilege of cultivating this soil and using it as God intended you 
should is only beginning to open up. The soil is ready, andlf we 
cultivate it as we should, with the increase of the growing of trees and 
the increase of the decay of vegetation all over this land of ours, that 
the rainfall will increase and conditions will change so that this state 
will be in the next quarter of a century still more productive than it is today. 
I believe that with all of my heart, but I believe it depends upon our 
citizens how we tend our soil. I could go on further, but I will not take 
your time to go on further, and I think twenty minutes is my limit. 

I am confident that every citizen in this commonwealth that has grown 
so rapidly in the last thirty years, I am full of that thought that if we 
cultivate this soil as we ought to and manage our business as fanners 
ought to, we will see greater results for our children and their children; 
and I believe in Nebraska; I believe in her soil; I believe in her climate; 
I believe in her citizenship; I believe in everything so far as living to make 
it bo great as it is to-day. 

I remember of being west of here years ago, and, speaking about that 
country that seemed worthless, a man said that "all that country was 
good for was thrown in by God to hold all the rest of the country together." 
I believe in the cultivation of the soil and efforts of man to 
subdue the soil and to do as God intended they should do, that in this 
country we shall accomplish great things for humanity. 

Eet me give you a thought about inigation. The government of India 
the last forty years has spent $100,000,000 on irrigation works. The 
gation canal waters 14,000,000 acres of land once counted as arid 
)re the construction of the canal. The question as to whether investlt 
in canals has paid, is answered in the India canal reports Just pubed. 
The value of the products on the irrigated lands in a single year </seg>

exceeded the $100,000,000 spent on the canals and other works, and the 
consumption of India in 1857 was $2,000,000 in imports and $128,000,000 
in exports. In 1902 the imports were $264,000,000 and the exports 392,-000,000. 
India has grown in forty years to be one of the great exporting 
countries in the world, standing sixth in the list. Its increase in commerce, 
to say nothing of the great increase in internal trade, has resulted 
mainly from irrigation and railway building. In Egypt the same system 
has been carried out, and the wealth of the country has been increased 
rnfold. In Nebraska, Irrigation will also pay. I believe in It. You and 
may not live to see any great results, but I believe with all my heart, 
candidly, that with the gathering of water in reservoirs and the digging 
of artesian wells and elevating the water to the surface in the arid portions 
of our state, and the planting of trees, as our former great citizens 
instituted in the state, Mr. Morton, years ago, and if we keep it up and not 
be so hoggish as to have all the land put to farming corn, but raise wheat 
on it, it will grow, and raise trees on it and let the land produce the 
timber that we need in our sand-hills and arid country, it will bring 
great returns. I remember speaking some time ago with a man who said 
he would plant pines upon those sand-hills, and if so, within fifty yean 
from now we will see a great change in the climatic conditions in the 
western parts of our state, and it will bring great blessings to our 
humanity. I thank you for your attention. [Applause.] 

Chauman: It is now my pleasure to introduce to you Chancellor E. 
Benjamin Andrews, who will address you on behalf of the State University: 


ADDRESS OF WELCOME ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF 
NEBRASKA, BY CHANCELLOR E. BENJAMIN ANDREWS. 

Mr, President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I found myself, when the President 
started to introduce me, almost lost in the interesting reverie into 
which I had fallen when I listened to the sublime and true and great 
prophecies of the gentleman, his excellency, who has just now addressed 
you. But I aroused myself from that to welcome all of you, and incidentally 
1 may welcome here and now all, because I dare say a great many of 
the organizations which will meet to-morrow and next day and the next 
days are represented here to-night; welcome the State Board of Agriculture 
and the representatives of all the other organizations who are here 
to-night to the premises of the State University. And I assure you it is a 
great pleasure; it is a great pleasure to me personally and officially. In 
the first place, it is a splendid thing for those of us who work at the 
university to see the representative men from the different parts of the 
state, to have them come into our grounds, and as far as they can in the 
few days they are here, to look after our work. We are sort of public servants, 
and feel we ought to be looked after. We should be delighted if the 
looking after should result in fault-finding. Now it is not often — it is a </seg>



            <seg id="p061">
61 

¦ i 

very rare thing, indeed; it occurs only once a year — that we are able to 
see as large a company as this of the representative men from the different 
sections of the state coming onto our grounds and looking us over and 
getting acquainted with us and, if you please, censure us. They are aa 
welcome to censure as they are to praise. 

iere is another consideration which moved my mind and my feeling* 
e same way. We feel, those of us who are at work at the university, 
we are trying the best we can to do your work and not our own. not 
we wished to be thought of as servants, — every faithful servant 
m to do the work he is set to do as well as he can; we don't wish to 
luite the temper of feeling that it is "our" in the sense that it Is not 
r" fault also. We feel we are working for you and for the community 
ibraska, and those that border on the four sides of Nebraska. 

Farming is not worth while merely because of the money it brings in. 
It is not worth while to do anything merely for the personal honor, although 
these things come in and they have their places. I believe no 
man can be happy in life unless he feels that he is at work for interests 
that are broader and higher — for something more than his family — than 
his immediate community where he used to be located. [Applause.] Of 
course we know, or think we know, we try to feel that we are doing this 
whether we see your faces or not; but when great companies of men 
come here and look in upon us from the different remote parts of the 
state and they walk about, and we are permitted to shake hands with 
them, and then hear these statistics of the greatness of the commonwealth 
we represent, then we feel that we had worked for a large community, 
for a large and representative company of humanity, and that makes 
us very glad to have you come here, and we go on rejoicing. It is an immense 
pleasure and comfort to see you and to shake hands with yon ami 
to have you upon its grounds. 

There is another reason. The other reason is the nature and dignity 
of the calling, which is here represented by the State Board of Agriculture. 
Agriculture, as agriculture, is the oldest of all of the human callings. If 
you please to distinguish between agriculture and stock raising, then 
stock raising is a little the older. You go back a century or two, I don't 
know how much farther — farther in some parts of the world and not so 
far in other parts — in stock raising than in agriculture, but in all intents 
and purposes to-night stock raising is a part of agriculture. So we apeak 
with propriety of Nebraska when we speak generally of it as an agricultural 
state. So I say the calling that is represented here is the oldest of 
the honorable callings of mankind, and that is something. I am not one 
of the kind that gets down on my knees every time something old comes 
along, but if that which is old is also good, and if its continuance from 
age to age has been because of its goodness, then its age adds a certain 
dignity and beauty, and when its age can show that it may be said to be 
as old as humanity, then you may say that its very age is an element of 
beauty and glory. Agriculture is not only the oldest of human callings, but </seg>

            <seg id="p062">
62 

NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

It is the one that underlies all other callings, more than can be said of any 
other calling. All callings that are necessary to the life, the honorable 
life of humanity, are deserving, and I should myself speak of none of them 
except with respect. All people are inclined to respect men who are doing 
those things. But for agriculture we should all die. It is not so with 
most other callings. Some of them humanity could get on without, perhaps 
not so well. For instance if the manufacture of collars of linen, 
should stop, we should still live — we should wear woolen or something. 
You have heard of the German young lady of New York who was walking 
down Fifth avenue, and she saw a number of laborers, and they had 
unbuttoned their shirt fronts and thrown them back so as to get the air, 
and she hurried home and beset her papa for money and then she got a 
lot of ladies together and formed a benevolent association for the purpose 
of procuring neckties for the poor population of New York City. 
[Applause.] I suppose were there no necktie makers, we should get along 
and live, and presidents of the United States would be elected, and things 
would be moving on as usual. But you cannot say that of the agricultural 
industry. Take that away, and the race in all its parts, in all its enterprises 
and manifestations of its mighty life, ceases. Agriculture is 
the industry on which all other industries stand, on which all other 
occupations of life are planted, and you represent agriculre. That is 
another reason why we are glad to see you here to-night. 

Furtner, agriculture is the industry which has the greatest future. 
Just as there is no end to agriculture in going backward until you come 
to the time when there were no human beings to live upon agriculture, in 
the same way, the further you go into the future, as long as you find 
human beings to feed you will find agricultural industries going on. It 
is not so with the many things that are now lucrative and honorable 
industries. Agriculture, like the truth that is spoken of in the good 
book, will never pass away. It will always be here. 

Permit me to advert to a few thoughts in response to the editor of 
the American Agriculturist, that I saw two or three months ago. I 
think agriculture is, relative to the other honorable industries of the 
world, to become more and more, while many of them will become leas 
and less, even if they last at all; and that grows out of the fact that 
the agricultural land of the world is practically used up, for if you get 
it now you have to pay for it. The land which will be reclaimed by 
irrigation in the central part of this republic will perhaps beoffered to 
the puDlic for a small sum per acre, but generally speaking, the good 
land of the world is to be paid for. It is worth a considerable figure. 
You cannot get a good farm any more simply by going and living upon 
it and cultivating it. This is an epoch in the history of mankind. It 
has never been so before, since the founding of the world until the 
last twenty-five years, for practically you could get free land, but now 
you cannot get it any more. You might get a little in Canada and some 
little in the United States, but it is nearly all gone. Now, while all the </seg>

63 

free land la gone in the world, humanity that has got to live in the land 
is increasing by leaps and bounds in all the more prosperous countries 
of the world, and while the people thus multiply and increase, everybody 
has to be fed. Any man that can reckon can see that that must mean 
that the owner of good agricultural land has got a sort of a corner, an 
honest one, too. He has not manufactured it himself. He is a shareholder 
in an industry that the providence of God and growth of mankind 
have made possible. His interests are going to grow, and the 
raisers of agricultural produce are going to hold a bigger share in it. 
But it is not only the agricultural land that is going to increase in 
value, but every form of agricultural produce is going to cost more per 
pound with every passing year. That would not mean very much provided 
while the agricultural population was getting on in that way the 
rest of your population was becoming smaller; but the rest of your population 
wul not become smaller for some time. While it is going to cost 
a little more every year to get agricultural produce out of the ground 
and to market, on the other hand the non-producer of non-agricultural 
produce is going to be cheaper year after year, so that the non-agricultural 
producer will be able to exchange with the agricultural producer 
for a hundred or two hundred years to come, to enable the agricultural 
producers to get all the advantage that is natural to their situation. 
Now, as I said a while ago I don't take very much joy in this outlook 
myself, simply because you are going to be richer. All that, however, 
aside, that is not the main issue — more wealth, that is the whole sequence, 
it is the same sequence, compared with other things. 

I take it that this transaction means a permanent social change in our 
humanity; it means in the agricultural part of our population where 
virtue always has its main home, and I know that you are not all saints 
because I am personally acquainted with some of you. [Applause.] After 
all, every association knows that it is in the country part where virtue is 
mainly developed. It is that section of the world that is going to have a 
cinch on all the rest more and more in coming time. And further, the 
culture and mental talent that have thus far very largely been in the city, 
the great rush in a very few years, we will see that rush from the city to 
the country. I believe that that rush is going to be turned back. 

I was in the city of Chicago when the great canal was finished, and it 
was a sight, the like of which I hardly ever had in my life, to see the 
Chicago river stopped, stopped right there at State street bridge, and 
then after a little turned back. The river began to run upwards, and you 
watched it and by and by the land was perfectly visible, instead of the 
waters passing down the river into the lake, they passed back. I believe, 
in the same way, the tide that is now on, of some young people going from 
the city into the country will, after a time, halt; then after a little 70a 
will find it turning back and the people will fall over each other. to get 
homes in the country. They will bring all the excellent opportunities we 
have of civic communities and carry them with them in the country, and </seg>

there in the country they will have the undivided richer possessions that 
cannot be gotten in the city. I believe, therefore, we stand over you 
and those whom you represent as a lepublic in a most delightful attitude, 
because when you want armies, if you ever do, and very likely you will, 
you know where you can turn to get them, to the great brain and brawn 
and pluck of the people of the country. Commercially, socially, intellectually 
and religiously, it is going to mean more and more; the republic 
that is to be will be in larger proportion than even the revolutionary 
republic in this country. I thank you. [Applause.] 

Chairman: I now have the pleasure of introducing to you the Hon. H. 
F. Mclntosh, who will respond to the address of welcome. [Applause.] 

RESPONSE TO THE ADDRESS OF WELCOME, BY H. F. M'INTOSH. 

tlfr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, and Representatives of the 
•litical, commercial and educational interests of the city and state in 
which ice are: It affords me a peculiar pleasure to thank you for the 
generous welcome so cordially extended us as stockmen and farmers who 
have come to visit your beautiful city. And first to the mayor of this city, 
into whose care for the association, and business and personal comfort 
of all our fairs, this community has committed. Let me say that these 
men come to you not as those who come by stealth and in the night to 
go in the dark and forbidden paths which we are told exist in every city, 
save Lincoln. These are men of the open. Their lives and industry is 
brawn of the sunshine. They are inspired daily to high thoughts and 
noble aspirations by the broad sweep of a Nebraska horizon with its varied 
scene of beauty; by the broad dome of the heavens which is continually 
over them, so far and so changeable by day, so near, so ornate, so magnificent 
by night. They are inspired by all of the surroundings of nature, 
of trees and plants and waving grain, the work of their own hands. And 
they come to you with this fresh wholesome life, to share with you for a 
brief time the things that exalt and embellish the life of the civic community 
up around the university and a library, ordered by your wisdom 
and directed by your kind care for us all. 

Mr. Chairman, you have no reason to fear from these men. They will 
give you of their wholesome simple, rural life for a week in full measure 
for all that you give them of your hospitality. 

And to the commercial interests which have spoken so cordial a welcome 
to us. We recognize the value of the commercial men in the community, 
as we, tilling the soil, are co-workers with God in the work of 
creation, so the merchants by seeking out channels through which the 
wants of the body are supplied from the ever increasing productivity of 
your industrious lives. Each merchant with us is a co-worker of creation. 
So we honor your calling. We say to the representative of the Commercial 
Club, and such members as may* be here, just as one of our American 
poets has said to that emblem of the commercial interests, </seg>

REPORT OF ANNUAL MEETING. 

Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State! 
Sail on, O Union strong and great! 
Humanity, with all Its fears, 

With all its hopes of future years, 
Is hanging breathless on thy fate. 

So with us, to the commercial interests of Lincoln we say, go forward. 

And to the university which has welcomed us here and in such 
generous words by the chancellor we have to say, Mr. Chancellor, 
that many of us have come here for ten years or more to 
these annual meetings, and by these comings we are able to measure the 
progress you are making. We know you are progressing in many ways. 
For instance during the past year since we were here, this University has 
acquired a fully equipped medical college of the highest order, and added 
to its resources, and we take pride in all such advancements, and we take 
more pride in the men and women who constitute the governing and 
teaching forces of this university than we do in your material advancement, 
because we find that you have here, or have gathered here since you 
came among us 4n this brief time, a body of instructors who are not only 
able teachers, but whose lives are blameless and whose daily intercourse 
with the students, have exerted an influence which inspires the highest 
thoughts and aspirations of human character. This is more to us who 
send our students here than any of the material things in university life. 
This example of instructors and faculty inspired to the highest order of 
manhood and womanhood, and so we are proud of your university, and 
our hearts warm to it with feelings more than we can express. I mention 
this for your encouragement and for the encouragement of those who so 
nobly help you; not merely for your encouragement, but I mention them 
in the presence of our chief executive of the state, and such members of 
the legislative bodies as may have come into this hall, because, Mr. Chancellor. 
I want them to know that the farmers of Nebraska honor this 
university, and we expect our executive and legislative officers to build 
up this university and sustain it in all its departments. [Applause.] We 
do not ask for agricultural education alone. We do ask for agricultural 
education equally with, and along with, all the others. [Applause.] 

And now, Mr. Chairman, and gentlemen all, who have greeted us with 
so cordial a welcome, thanks. We come to you as agriculturists for oar 
own progress and benefit. We have to-day drawn the edge of the plowshare 
a little liner, because we have come to this meeting. We hope to 
train the eye to keener perception, and, if may he, to tune the ear to higher 
emotions. You have opened your city to us, Mr. Mayor, as a social community, 
surrounded with librarv and university, and we shall do yon 
great wrong if we go away from here having found it merely a chophouse 
and barber-shop. We will not forget, of course, Mr. Mayor, that' yoa 
scald your milk pans and fry your fish, etc., just the same as we do in our 
farm homes, but for the week let these cares pass by, let it be sacred to

THIRD SESSION. 

Wednesday, 10:30 A. M., January 21, 1903. 

Chairman: We have with us this morning a representative from the 
exposition at St. Louis, — Mr. Crawford, — and he would like to say a few 
words, and we will listen to him. 

M«. Ceawpord: Mr. President — Let me see, Mr. President, this is the 
managing board? 

Chairman: This is the State Board of Directors, together with the 
presidents of the county societies, who form a part of our meeting. 

Mb. Crawford: That makes it quite a representative body. I suppose 
you have other business you want to attend to I presume, and I will not 
detain you with a long speech myself. Every one of you are a little interested 
in knowing something about the proposed magnitude of the 
Louisiana exposition. Now, there is a feeling among members of congress, 
and public men, that this idea of public appropriations for expositions 
must come to an end some time, and Senator Thurston of your own state 
is authority for saying that this idea prevailed in congress when they 
made the last appropriation for the St. Louis exposition; that this probably 
would be the last exposition which congress would deem it advisable 
to aid. The appropriation made by congress for this exposition is the 
largest, consequently feeling that the climax perhaps had come, and the 
federal appropriation for this exposition is $5,000,000, besides $1,000,000 
that the federal government will spend for its own. Now Missouri and 
the city of St. Louis have raised $15,000,000, and what the different states 
have appropriated, and also the foreign governments, the resources of this 
exposition is much the largest of any exposition ever before held. It 
exceeds that of the Paris exposition, and also that held in Chicago in 
1893. Now, gentlemen, of course this is intended to celebrate the 1 hundred 
years after the purchase of Louisiana Territory, of which you are a part. 
It has been cut up into twelve states, and you are one of these twelve states, 
and outside of these there are two territories. I was pleased with what 
I heard last night from your governor and chancellor of your university, 
and other representative men, concerning the commonwealth and future 
of this territory. The exposition primarily is the exposition of the living 
that live here in this section. Of course, it is consequently sectional and 
international and world-wide and comprises the whole civilized portions 

Now I am here to represent the commission which has in charge down 
there at St. Louis the getting ready, the building and the exploiting of this 
great world's fair. So far Nebraska has not taken part. So far there has 
not been an appropriation by your state government, and I am here in an </seg>

open way, not to log-roll and railroad to get a message through this legislature 
trying to convince some of its members that it would be well for 
your state to make an appropriation to enable this state to be represented 
down there. Of course, I know that your state finances are In an embarrassing 
condition, I realize the fact of that, but at the same time I doubt 
very much whether the people of this state would be satisfied, being one 
of the original twelve, that your state should not be represented at this 
fair. You will ask the question, of what particular good can this exposition 
be to you? You men who are agriculturists and horticulturists, and 
connected with the different agricultural societies throughout the counties 
of the state of Nebraska, — in the first place, If you should have down there 
a state building — Mr. President, 1 believe it should not be anything in 
the way of a very extensive building, from the fact I don't believe you 
need it — if you had a nice, neat, pleasant looking cottage that would be 
representative of the well-to-do people of the state of Nebraska, built 
large enough so that when your people go there they will find somebody 
that can answer their questions, tell them where the important things 
are in the fair, tell them where the interesting things are and where the 
Nebraska exhibits are, and where they can get a rest and take their lunch 
baskets and eat their meals and visit, if you had a cottage of that kind, 
somebody there with a bureau of information to answer these questions 
and perform the functions which I have indicated, I think it would be an 
advantage to your people. There you would have toilet rooms particularly 
for your women folks who are strangers there, places where they can write 
letters, where they can receive their mail and make engagements to meet 
those they know in the different parts of the state. That is one thing 
that ought not to cost a great sum of money. If I was in this state 
and had at my command $300,000 I would not advocate a high-priced 
building, but a cottage, practical, useful in its functions, certainly is 
a very valuable thing to you as citizens of the state. 

Now you have in your state growing industries. I heard with pleasure 
about that last night. I wish that the governor had gone further and told 
us about alfalfa. Your president says that you can raise three crops in 
this state. Governor Furnas has been telling me about that, as well as 
other men. Now all my lifetime I have been trying to be a practical man, 
and I want to say to you, having had something to do with expositions, 
I did not know there was the great basis and foundation for the future 
wealth growing out of this alfalfa that I have learned recently since I 
came into your state. Now a man like I am, that has had a little to do 
with expositions, and who has tried to keep well posted, was ignorant of 
this fact, how about other people, and therefore it is a branch of industry 
in the state of Nebraska which needs exploiting before the citizenship of 
the United States. 

I find that your horticulturists have been in session lately. They tell 
me about the capacity of the southeast part of this state for raising fruit, 
cherry, apple and peach crops. I did not know that you had the capacity </seg>

            <seg id="p068">
68 

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

for raising and selling peaches; It was a new thing to me. So that I know 
that a great many people within the western part of the United States 
don't know in an essential way about the capacity of your state in these 
lines. 

Now you represent the live-stock business. There will be a great exposition 
down there of cattle. They have built one of the largest buildings 
in the entire exposition, which will cover over 20 acres of ground for the 
comfort and arrangement and carrying out of the live stock business. 
This pavilion will be very large. In addition to that the agricultural 
building covers over 20 acres. The horticultural building is very large. 
Now, you men who represent the live stock interests and business, 
and represent the ordinary grain and crop growing business, 
and who represent the fruit business, will find all of these things 
provided for at this great fair. Now, in a live stock way I think it take* 
more money to exploit an exhibit of live stock than anything else. 
It is rather costly in the first place to fit it up, it takes a little time; it 
is costly to ship it there, to take care of it; it must be constantly looked 
after and fed and watered. It seems to me it would be well for your state, 
as outlined by the governor here last night and the chancellor, of the 
great industries growing up in your state, that it would be well for the 
state to get beyond these things and have a reasonable appropriation, and 
appoint a commission to see that the various branches that you represent 
here are represented at St. Louis. I have talked long enough, but it may 
be you would like to ask me some questions. There may be something you 
would like to get light on, and if so, I will do the best I can to answer 
these questions. At any rate, I hope that this representative body of 
productive forces of the state of Nebraska will pass a resolution asking 
your legislature to make a liberal appropriation for the Louisiana Purchase 
Exposition — not extravagant — not demanding a great building, although 
it will help you as a people of Nebraska, but an appropriation that 
will be liberal in this character, and then, if you should get such an appropriation 
and a commission be appointed, I very much hope that the 
agricultural and live-stork forces of the state of Nebraska will be represented 
on the make-up of that commission. 

Now Mr. President, if there are any questions I will be glad to answer 

¦ C. n. Rudoe: I would like to introduce a preamble and resolution, 
is as follows: 

ST. LOUIS EXPOSITION. 

Whereas. To commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the 
Louisiana Purchase from the French government, the city of St. Louis 
has organized a Louisiana Purchase Exposition Company, and in 1904 
will throw open to the public the largest exposition ever shown, in 
which all countries, states and territories have been invited to participate, 
and for which a great many states and territories have made liberal ap- </seg>

propriations for same, and as Nebraska has become a moat prominent 
factor in the territory embraced in this purchase by reason of her rapid 
and permanent illustrative development of her worth as one of the 
greatest states of the Union: 

Klved, That the State Board of Agriculture do hereby recommend 
legislature of the state of Nebraska, now in session, that a liberal 
riation be made for exhibiting the resources of the state. 


REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS. 

Mr. President: Your committee, to whom was referred the recommendations 
of the President's address, submit the following report: Tour committee 
is in full accord with the recommendations in regard to needed improvements 
recommended in the address, and to the end that these improvements 
should be secured your committee would recommend that 
this matter be placed In the hands of the legislative committee, and the 
legislative committee be instructed to endeavor to obtain appropriation* 
sufficient for the construction of the improvements. In the matter of the 
recommendations for permanent buildtngs for implement exhibitors on 
the state fair grounds, your committee recommends that the Incoming 
Board of Managers be instructed to enter into such leases with implement 
exhibitors for sites for permanent buildings as shall, in their judgment, 
be for the best interests of this Board. We recommend that the premium 
list should include special premiums for live stock of known purity and 
breeding owned and bred in our own state. 

Respectfully submitted, 

W. A. Poyntm, 

J. R. Sutherland, 

Frank H. Young, 

Committee. 

Mb. Poy.nter: I move the adoption of the report. Adopted. 
Mr. Meixob: I desire to report further the names of A. W. B. 

E legate from Johnson county, and , president, from Red Wilv 
county. Adopted. 

Mm. Bassett: The committee on revision of premium list is ready to 
report. The committee on revision of premium list met and considered the 
reports of such superintendents as made recommendations. We are sorry 
to say that not all of the superintendents made recommendations as to 
what was needed and desired in the changing of the premium list, rules and 
regulations, or the schedules for premiums offered. It would be well if 
superintendents would do so, as Mr. Rudge suggested yesterday. That 
really is the best source of information that the Board of Managers have, 
or that those who make up the premium list have. There has been a 
general demand — The President recommended it in his address, and from 
other sources — that special premiums be offered for Nebraska-bred animals, 
and in accordance with that demand the premium list committee </seg>

            <seg id="p070">

NEBRASKA BTATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

has made one or two recommendations along that line. If such premiums 

are offered for animals at the ages mentioned, and as there are thirty-five 

lots, taking the various classes of live stock — horses, cattle, sheep and 

swine it would make about $50 for each lot, which would make a total 

sum of about $1,800. The committee did not deem it wise to increase the 

premium list that much, they therefore recommended that no third pre- 

miums be offered, and the money thus saved be used as premiums for Ne- 

braska-bred animals. I would like to say in this connection that I thinl 

there is a misapprehension on the part of a good many as to the per cent 

of premiums awarded Nebraska exhibitors of live stock. There seems t 

be a feeling that the Nebraska exhibitor of Nebraska-bred animals doei&gt; 

not stand a fair show in competition with other exhibitors of live stock at 

our fair, that he is at a disadvantage, and I thought that surely was the 

case in a larger sense than I find it to be true, and so I requested the Sec- 

retary of the State Board to furnish my committee the number of entries 

ta each class of live stock made at the fairs of 1901 and 1902, and the 

number of first and second premiums awarded both Nebraska exhibitors 

and what we might term foreign exhibitors. This statement is not very 

lengthy, but I would like to present it here in order that it may go into 

the record, and that we may have some basis on which to consider this 

matter in the future.

Mb. Bassett (continuing) : In accordance with the recommendation of 

the President, your committee recommends that in live stock claaaea 

there be added for each lot a lot of Nebraska-bred animals, horses and 

cattle, two years and under; sheep and swine, one year and under; Pro- 

vided, that any Nebraska-bred animal winning the first or second pre- 

mium in open competition, shall not be eligible to compete for premiums 

in lots, especially for Nebraska-bred animals. The reason for that 

proviso is that the man who would enter in the open competition and win 

the first or second premium, the chances are that he would also win first 

in the lot set apart for Nebraska-bred animals only, and thus duplicate 

his premium, and so we thought it only fair that he should not be per- 

mitted to win in both. He has a chance to go into the open competition, 

and if he wins there he is barred from the other. 

Now, in the matter of the matured corn exhibit which has been held 

during the annual fair, the committee recommends that it be held during 

the January meeting, that the State Board furnish the necessary money </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGR! 

Pyment of premiums and incidental expenses of holding the 
it the matter of caring for the exhibits, selection of judges, the 
if the premium list and score card, etc., be under the auspices 
i Improvers' Association, which has taken up this work, and is 
qualified, in the judgment of the committee, to hold the exhibit 
fter the judging and marking of premiums. 

Bere are a good many things relating to the revision of the premium 
that would necessarily come up later, and with these recommendai, 
I move you that the further consideration of the matter be left 
the Incoming Board of Managers and with power to act, and that this 
nittee report to the Board. Adopted. 

Chairman: While this matter is fresh in our minds, let me say one or 
two words with regard to Nebraska exhibits. A few years ago I was 
standing in the rain with the judge as the cattle came in, and he said to 
me: "I would like, if I could, to give more of these premiums to your 
Nebraska cattle; but look at these cattle as they come in. They are not 
halter broke and have not been groomed, and the hair does not look 
smooth. They have been taken up out of the pasture and brought here, 
and are not in a condition to show, hardly in any condition to stay in 
the pasture. Teach your people to halter break your cattle and smooth 
down their hairs, and they will stand some chance." There is where our 
Nebraska breeders are at fault in bringing their animals into the ring 
when they are not either in condition to be let in nor in condition to 
show what they are themselves. They don't show as well in the ring as 
they do in the pasture, because they have been shipped away from the 
natural end of the season; many of them don't like the water that they 
And here, and consequently they are at a disadvantage here. They had 
better ask the judge to go out in the pasture and examine them there 
than here. Prepare your cattle and you will have no trouble. They can 
exhibit them and win the premiums, but they cannot do it if they bring 
them in on the grounds as they have been doing time and time again. 

Mb. Cook: The gentlemen who made the county collective exhibit from 
Howard county have filed a statement here with your Secretary in which 
they would like to be heard by this Board, and I imagine that the proper 
method would be to have that read. One of the exhibitors is with us here 
and we may be able to hear from him also in the matter. 

Bbcbetaby Fubnas: Claim of Howard county is presented for $100 on 
county collective exhibits (continues to read). 

Chairman: What will you do with the statement just read? 

Mr. Rvdge: I will say, when this matter came before the Board of 
Managers, that on account of the exhibit not scoring, the Board of Managers, 
under our rules, were unable to give this county collective exhibit 
any premium, while we felt at the same time that the county collective 
exhibit was a very creditable exhibit from this county, and we would like 
to have given them some money for the expense that they were put to, 
for the reason that in the years gone by they had come to our relief when </seg>

            <seg id="p073">
73 


we' were hunting for county collective exhibits, but the Board of Managers 
felt that in the position they occupied that it would be impossible for 
them to allow moneys to this county and not take in the other county 
collective exhibits that scored less than 800. And looking at it in this 
light, that these county collective exhibits are more expensive than any 
other kind that are brought to the fair for the men who get them up, and 
I think that this county — I should be in favor myself of giving this 
county a reasonable amount for their exhibit. It comes from a portion 
of the state that has not been making county collective exhibits 
and from a portion of the state that we would like to have make 
more exhibits at our state fairs. Now at that time the Board of Managers 
felt it was beyond their jurisdiction, and I am glad the matter has come 
up here, and I would like to see it fully discussed and would like to see 
Howard county get something for making their exhibit. 

Ma. Williams: As one of the Board of Managers last year, and one 
that looked over the exhibit, I took quite an interest in it. The facts 
as stated there were very apparent to all. Therefore, in view of the fact 
that the State Board are present and have the facts before them, I move 
you, Mr. President, that the State Board pay 50 per cent of the premium 
offered in order to help out the expense that was incurred in making that 

Secbetaky Fubnas: What do you mean by the premium offered? 

Mm. Williams: The $100 to that one county, for I realize it was a very 
meritorious exhibit and it came so near to the required amount of the 
score asked for, that it did seem a pity that they should fall down at that 
point, and their exhibit was very meritorious and far above others that 

¦ Mellob: For the information of those present I will state, if I 
ber correctly, the score was 785 out of a possible 800 — just lacked 
its of the required score and getting the money. 

Sbcebtary Fubnas: That is about right. 

Mb. Walsh: Did I hear Mr. Williams' motion seconded? 

fill ill M ii i Flbxas: I did not. 

Mb. Walsh: I am opposed to the motion to allow a dollar to any 
county that fails to score, for the reason that it establishes a precedent 
where there will be no end to this claiming. I have had many years' 
experience in my own county in offering premiums, and the precincts of 
Douglas county, except the past year, offers premiums to the different 
precincts to have the thirteen precincts compete with each other in 
Douglas county. That is how in the past we have brought up our county 
to a high standard. But in no circumstances would we deviate from the 
rules laid down by that premium list, for it would create trouble that you 
cannot tell when it would end. Because this county came up to so near 
to the standard, those matters should be left entirely with the State 
Board and their judgment to look over the matter, and if they think there 
should be compensation to a limited extent, that is all well and good; </seg>

tbelr action would be sustained by this boiy. and I would ask this body 
not to establish such a precedent, as you go beyond the award of the 
premium judges whenever you do that. 1 am in favor of large premiums 
for the different counties, and any county that would occupy a certain 
space and could not find the space, in the awarding we think should be 
allowed at least $25, that is to say, if they were not placed at all. If they 
occupy so many square feet, that they be allowed $25, or a portion, 
enough to cover the amount of expense that they were at; but I am 
heartily in favor of paying every county sufficient in your premium list 
to stand by what your premium list says and the judgment of the judges. 

LMb. Vance: I endorse what he said, and I move you that this matter 
d other matters similar, if any, be referred to the incoming Board of 
Managers to adjust. 

Motion received a second. 

Ms. Cook: It seems to me if this motion carries that this Board will 
find itself in exactly the same condition that the old Board is in; they 
did not know what to do in matters of this kind, and I would like to 
nsist upon the members of the Board here to decide this question for 
Howard county one way or the other. We have had hard work in getting 
iiese people in that county to come down here and make a show. We 
ppreciate the fact that they ought to be paid, but we also see the reason 
bleness of the situation, that it might create a precedent that would cost 
s some money; but I want the Board to-day to take this matter up and 
ecide it. I would like to hear from Howard county in the matter, and 
' there was some way in which we could go about this matter and pay 
tern a part of this for the trouble they have had in the matter, it seems 
to me it would be money well spent. However, I would like to have it 
ecided to-day. 

Chairman: You are not talking to the motion before the house, which 
1b to refer. The motion that was made by Mr. Williams, that they be 
paid, was not seconded, consequently nothing before the house. 

Mb. Cook: I beg your pardon; I think I was talking to this motion to 
refer to the Board. 

Mb. Babgeb: I feel like Mr. Cook, that this matter ought to be settled 
right here and be done with it, and not encumber the new Board with this 
matter so that they will have to go to a considerable trouble to investigate, 
and I was about to second the motion of Mr. Williams, for the reason 
that it comes from a member of the Board of Managers, and another member 
of the Board of Managers has also said it was a meritorious exhibit, 
and for the sake of disposing of the present motion, I move you that the 
motion be laid on the table. 

Mb. Mellob: I would like to amend the motion, that it be settled by 
this Board at the present time. 

Chairman: If this motion is voted down it is then with the Board, and </seg>

REPORT OF ANNUAL MUTING. 

Mb. !*¦"¦"¦• I believe an amendment is in order. 

Chairman: You have a right to amend if it is seconded. 

¦Meixor: I want it to be settled by this present Board of Agriculhile 
in session. 

¦Bassett: I rise to a point of order, that that is really the motion 
¦r to this Board. 

Km ax: Those favoring the adoption of the motion to refer to the 
; Board say aye; contrary, no. Motion lost. Now it is before the 
i take such action as you wish. 

Mb. Williams: I will now renew my motion, that this Board allow 50 
per cent of the money that was to be awarded the county exhibits upon 
this claim; that would be $oj. They came within 15 points of scoring. The 
State Board of Management were at fault. It is true they had their 
grasses there, and there was no place for them; they were stored away, 
as they would be in a hay mow, and for that reason alone I believe this 
E should take this matter under consideration. We didn't have the 
if we had, we could have given them the space to exhibit; therehope 
this motion will pass. 

The motion received a second. 

S Bassett : I would like to ask if there are not other counties In this 
condition. We cannot make an exception in one case. The Board 
$100 in case the county does certain things, but when they fall 
that score they are not entitled to the $100. If there are other 
es that should be taken care of in matters of this kind, it seems to 
¦ ought to know how that matter stands. 

Secretary Fubnas: There is no other county asking it. 

Mb. Eaton: I think we are going into something that some day might 
open a broad field in this line. Now our county came down here and we 
were promised certain space. We failed to get all of it, but the Board did 
the best it could. We were satisfied. We scored up very highly; but if 
this trouble arises, it gives us a chance to come in as a county under the 
plea that the Board did not provide us with the room to display our 
grasses. Our grasses were packed in boxes and were never opened; members 
of this Board will remember that growing grasses were never taken 
out of the boxes, only in the boxes as they came from the depot. Had 
those grasses been opened, as we had a big number of them, and been displayed, 
our score, in our estimation, would have been way up, and we 
might probably have gotten first standard in our county. Now, yon see 
by bringing in these other counties as were below the 800 marks, those 
that were upon the same footing under the same conditions could come in 
and ask this Board to pay them the limit as you offered in your premium, 
under the same plea that there was no room to display their stuff. There 
were a good many counties here that, if I remember right, the scores 
run along up close to the 800 mark, and they failed and they got nothing; 
and if we should adopt this line, we are bringing this into a position where 
other counties will come in, and it will be an everlasting thing, not only </seg>

for now but the future; therefore, Mr. President, I am opposed to the 

Mb. Hekvey : I think in regard to this matter, if there is an appropriation 
made as a compromise measure for this county, that it should be 
without reference to any score card or any score that this county has 
made, nor any reference to the premium list, and not associate it in any 
sense with the per cent of the premium offered; that it should be a 
specified amount that this body sees proper to give this agricultural society 
for a consideration of their exhibit, but associate it in no sense with 
the premium list or score card. 

Mb. Ewi.no: As superintendent of this class for several years these 
things that are before the Board just now have been of vital interest to 
me. The first intimation that I had that it would be brought before this 
Board was the motion read from the desk. For several years I have 
recommended something similar to this gentleman's statement, particularly 
the gentleman from Douglas, that there should be a small amount 
paid to every exhibitor that comes here. I have been urging this matter 
for several years, and we found that one or two individuals asked this 
expense, and from no fault of their own, that circumstances were against 
them, they missed getting anything from a few points; another county, 
under better circumstances, scoring a few points better, above the 800. I 
have recommended, that this gentleman makes the same recommendation, 
say, an appropriation of $25 for each exhibitor, and the expense that goe* 
to these counties can be very easily estimated. Some counties get more 
than Justice, while others are cut off with nothing. I came before the 
Board of Managers several times after the fair last year and urged that 
three counties which failed to score 800 points be given some money. 
Four counties failed to score even on corn, and Howard making a very 
creditable showing. The Board seemed reluctant to consider that matter. 
I should like in the list for another year that some notice be taken of this, 
and I should urge this matter and make it a settled amount. I think my 
recommendation was $40 for the first county, and $25 for the lowest. They 
did not see fit to consider it. I think it would be for the interest of county 
collective exhibits for the future that we adopt some such plan. 

Mb. Youngebs: In reply to the statement why the Board did not consider 
that, the reason was that the rule laid down was that a society or 
county exhibit must score 800 points to get any of the money. Secondly, 
If we had taken Howard, that would have taken some of the other counties. 
I think that if Howard gets any, I think every other county that went to 
expense in this matter should be considered. That is the reason the 
Board did not take it up. 

E. Ewing: That is correct. You can have the ablest body of Judge* 
you can select over the state from other counties, and their judgment 
differ. The last year they scored a little lower than the year before, 
county they thought had a better exhibit in 1902 than in 1901. 

Mb. Bassett: I know there is a great deal of merit in this discussion. </seg>

The Board of Managers visited the exhibit and considered the matter, so 
they know something in regard to it; but you will understand that the 
premium list provides for giving $100 to each county In order to encourage 
the exhibit and help out on the expense, and you will have to 
draw the line somewhere. I talked with Mr. Ewing a good deal about 
these matters during the last fair and afterwards. I move you that 1100 
be appropriated by this Board, and that the same shall be prorated by the 
Board of Managers as it shall deem best among those making county 
collective exhibits, to whom no premium money was awarded,' and that 
the whole matter be referred to the incoming Board of Managers, with 
to act. The Board of Managers can determine the matter; that 
be appropriated for that purpose. 

Chairman: You make that as an amendment to Mr. Williams' motion 
or substitute. 

Mb. Bassett: I move to amend. 

Mb. Poyxter: I am opposed to this kind of procedure. By what reason 
can we come to the conclusion that we should offer to those county 
collective exhibitors an advantage that we do not offer to stock 
raisers or any other class of exhibitors? Many men come here at 
great expense in feeding up their stock that costs lots of money, 
to come within a few points of scoring. We don't think of coming 
forward now and making an appropriation to meet the expense that 
these gentlemen have been out. Our county of Boone went to an expense 
for a number of years and did not score, but they did not quit on that 
account. Howard county labored this year under the same condition as 
the balance of the state did. Other counties were in the same condition; 
that is, in regard to the immaturity of crops; it labored under the same 
disadvantages other counties did, owing to lack of space. These counties 
that scored had the same disadvantage to contend with that Howard 
county did. The Board of Managers did the best they could in the appropriation 
of space; they seemed to treat all equally. The rule was that 
each county must score a certain number of points in order to get a 
certain portion of this money, the same as money is held up to stock 
exhibitors. I cannot see by what kind of reason this Board can to-day 
appropriate money to make good some part of the expense of exhibitors 
that came here who failed to score in order to get a portion of this money. 
I am entirely opposed to this whole proposition, and the time will come. 
if we do this, when the Board will regret this action. 

Mb. Ewino: The reason Is this. He compared premium in Class 
to the other classes in the premium list. If there are half a dozen exhibitors 
here of cattle, some of them would take first, second and third premiums. 
It is just possible that in these county collective exhibits that 
none of them may take any. The result there is unfair, and I will My 
further there is something outside of that. We are interested in having 
every county in the state interested in this state fair, and we get mmc 
thing more than live stock, as one exhibit will embrace all the products 
or that county. </seg>

WIIMI I STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTCMC. 

Mb. Cook: The gentlemen seem to have a wrong idea of this matter, 
and in explanation I want to say that if we have a (air to bring people 
out to look at our exhibits, we have got to have these things (or them 
to look at. The stockmen take this method of advertising their goods. 
They bring them down here and show them to the farmers, and exhibit 
to get benefits from them. They expect to get money out of their showing 
and exhibiting their wares, and say here, come and buy a bull, etc. On 
the other hand, the gentlemen who get up these county collective exhibits 
have got to drive out over the county at their own expense. I have gotten 
up a county exhibit once or twice myself, and I know when I came down 
to Omaha I had $125 of my own money expended expecting to be paid or 
lose it. This situation resolves Itself into this, we have got to encourage 
these people to bring these things down here to make the show, or we 
don't have any one here to go through the gate. I want to amend that 
motion making it $200 to be divided, prorated according to the four 
counties. We will never miss the money, and it will encourage these people 
to come down here. 

Ch a ibm an: The first motion is $100, to be appropriated pro rata among 
the (our counties. The amendment is to be $200. Am I right? Those in 
favor of the motion to amend will say aye. Contrary, no. Lost. 

Mb. Walsh: I believe in fair play. I opposed this matter on the 
ground that it was wrong; but two wrongs don't make a right' Those men 
should be paid for their trouble. If, by an oversight in the premium list, 
it was neglected to offer so much to each county to cover expenses; if 
through mismanagement of the Board of Managers there was lack of space, 
and these gentlemen did not get space, it is not the exhibitors' fault, and 
they should be paid. Unless you encourage collective exhibits you cannot 
have a state fair; it is the county collective exhibit that makes the state 
fair what it is. You cut this off and there is nothing left but live stock 
and a midway. The sooner the Board of Managers get down and encourage 
the agricultural exhibits through their different counties, and 
their counties through their different precincts, and be liberal and broadminded 
in the matter of cash prizes, then you will get a state fair that is 
a state fair. You offer a large premium to live stock that don't live in 
the state. They will come if you don't offer any premium. They want 
the blue ribbon because they are for sale. The farmer, what does he get? 
The live stock exhibitor comes here and carries off the blue ribbon, and 
makes a sale of his stock through the advertising he gets. I am in favor 
of a more liberal premium list, with every county getting enough to cover 
their expenses. The sooner the State Board get down to business and do 
business in that way the better for the state of Nebraska. Now, I move 
you as an amendment to all other amendments that $150 be set apart and 
distributed among these four counties equally. 

Chairman: The amendment to the amendment, which Is (or $150 to be 
appropriated among the counties that scored less than 800 points. 

Mb. Walsh: I call for a rising vote. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATS BO ABO OF AGRICULTUM. 

Secretary Pubkas: The vote Is so caat. 

Chairman: The next thing in order will be the election of Treasurer. 

A Membeb: I will nominate Mr. Ed. Mclntyre, and I will move you 
that the rules be suspended and Mr. Mclntyre be elected by acclamation. 


Chairman: Mr. Mclntyre is duly declared Treasurer for the ensuing 


Chairman: The next is the office of Secretary. 

Me. Bassett: I would nominate Mr. Pumas for Secretary 

Mb. Walsh: If there is a man in the state of Nebraska that is well 
known, it is that of your honorable Secretary. He has brought the state 
fair, through his personal efforts, up to a standard second to none in the 
United States. Go where you will, all over the east, you will hear of the 
State Board of Agriculture of Nebraska and the fair they put up. And 
I want to say to you, it may be the last opportunity I will have of making 

a statement before this association, that your Secretary is a man of sterling 
qualities. He has studied agriculture from the foundation, and in 
justice to him, and coming from an agricultural county, I have great 
pleasure in seconding the nomination, and move you that the rules be 
suspended and he be elected by a rising vote. 

Motion carried by a unanimous rising vote. 

Chairman: I hereby declare Governor Furnas duly elected as Secretary 
for the ensuing year. 

¦McIstybe: I desire to Bay to the members that, under the resolu- 
L88ed yesterday, I have prepared a paper here for the money to pay 
ixpenses of members, and as fast as you will come and receipt this 
I will pay you the five dollars. 

Mb. Babger: I believe that this severs my connection with the State 
Board. I have been a member now for, I think, nine years. It has been 

a great deal of pleasure to me to become acquainted with the different 
citizens of our state who take an interest in this agriculture. It has 
been a pleasure to do something, whatever has been my ability to do, 
to advance the cause of agriculture and stock raising, and I wish to 
thank all of the members of this board who have worked with me in this 
work, for the courteous treatment I have received, and their hearty support 
in this work. I don't say that I am sorry to retire from the Board, nor 
from this Board. I am sorry to leave the association of gentlemen who 
have been so kind and courteous to me in the years in the past I believe 
I will have a relief in being left out as a member in the future. 
Gentlemen, I thank you. 

Mr. Dirsmobe: I wish at this time to comply with the request of Dr. 
Peters, and call attention again to the meeting that will occur in this hall 
this evening, commencing at 8 o'clock. The program prepared is an 
interesting one. [Here reads program.] 

A Mxmbeb: Mr. Butler, of Topeka, Kan., who speaks here to-morrow on 
the subject of "Combination of the Farmers of the United States in </seg>

Regard to Building Elevators and Shipping Their Own Grain," told me to 
ask you if you would permit him, this evening, to make an announcement 
from the platform regarding his subject to-morrow afternoon. 

PIhairman: At the close of the meeting there is no objection so tar 
the chair knows of. The Nebraska Bee Keepers' Association will meet 
this afternoon in Room 111 in Central University Building. Is there 
any other business to come before the Board? 

Mb. Walsh: Don't you think it will look somewhat strange If this body 
meets and adjourns without making a recommendation, or talking the 
matter over regarding a state exhibit at St. Louis? 

Chaibman: We have adopted a resolution this morning favoring that 

Mb. Walsh: Don't you think it would be proper for the State Board to 
ask the state papers to agitate the raising of small grain, advocate how it 
should be taken care of, and also the planting of the different varieties 
of grain in a small way to be nursed and taken care of for exhibition 
purposes? A great many counties raised the finest of sheath grain In 
this state, but with a lack of knowledge of when to cut it and how to 
care for it, it becomes lost. I think that through the State Board that 
information should be given to the different counties of how to proceed 
to take care of the sheath grain. Men from different sections look largely 
to what sort of sheath grain you exhibit, and there is a lack of knowledge 
of how to take care of that sheath grain which is often wasted. You 
may not know it, that those who raise sheath grain for exhibition are 
in the habit of putting it in very early in the spring by drilling it. If It 
is only ten by ten cut it in the proper season, and weed it out and see to 
it that the proper work is put up. I am heartily in favor of the Stats 
Krd making such announcement through the press of the different 
ities of how to proceed to raise corn and also sheath grain. 

Chairman: Will you prepare something of this kind for the press? 

Mb. Walsh: I will present that to the Board and they can do with It 
as, in their judgment, seems best. This Is the information that Nebraska 
should have. Nebraska is purely an agricultural state. Men who own 
farms in this state don't know what a bonanza they have. 

Mr. Bassett: Under the rules, is it necessary for the President to 
appoint a Board of Managers to be confirmed by the State Board while 
it is in session? As I understand that there is no business further than 
that, I move you that we adjourn to the hour of 8 o'clock this evening, in 
Cer to receive the nominations of the President, and transact any other 
iness that is necessary. 

Seconded. 

Mb. Williams: I wish to amend the motion to meet at 2 o'clock to complete 
the business of this session. There are some who would like to go 
away this afternoon. 

Seconded.

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICUL.TUBS. 

Chairman We will put the motion as it is. The chair will announce 
his appointments when he is prepared to announce them. 

The motion as amended, which was to meet at the Lindell Hotel at 
2 o'clock in the afternoon was carried. 

Meeting adjourned to meet at the Lindell Hotel at 2 P. M. 

FOURTH SESSION. 

Lindell Hotel, 2 o'clock P. M. 

President Dtnsmore opened the meeting, and announced his appointment 
of the following Board of Managers: C. H. Rudge, Chairman; G. 
R. Williams, Peter Youngers, Thomas A. McKay, and W. R. Mellor. 

Mb. McI.ntyrk: I move that the nominations of the Board of Managers 
be confirmed. 

Motion duly seconded and carried. 

Chairman: What is your further pleasure? 

»Mann: I believe it would be an advantage to our agricultural assoi 
if the President or Board of Managers would appoint a committee 
t upon the different railroad companies to get a reduced rate on 
Qg haul. Starting anywhere west of Long Pine on the Elkhorn 

Mb. Cook: I move as an amendment that as long as we are not very 
hungry, that we proceed to business now and finish the session, 
road it costs about $25 for a man to bring his wife along, and It is too 
much. The gate receipts depend upon the railroad companies a good 
deal, and it don't do any harm to make another application for this reason, 
and the railroads are as much auxiliary to us as we are to them, 
for the agriculture of the state is as much for them as for us. It will 
do no harm for the railroads to know that we are pushing them. Now 
we have a rate I suppose within a hundred miles. In my county we 
have a rate of one fare for the double trip, $12.55. The result is that 
if he brings his wife along it will cost $50. I am not speaking for myself. 
If it will get our people educated to what we are doing, it will make our 
agricultural association more successful I think. There is trouble to 
some extent in the western part of our state where our grazing land is, 
that our people don't rub up against these gentlemen of the eastern part 
of the state. I think if the chairman is appointed a committee of one, 
or leave it with our Board of Managers to see the railroad managers, it 
will do us no harm if we don't get it. When the fair was at Omaha we 
had a $6 rate; what was the result? There was the greatest attendance 
from the western part of the state we have ever had. I tell you gentlemen, 
if we have more people than we can accommodate, we will extend 
our grounds, and I submit this, and put it in a resolution leaving it with 
the Board of Managers or with the chairman to submit this to the rail- </seg>

roads, and tell them that we demand that they shall recognize as as a 
board of agriculture of the state of Nebraska. 

Mb. McInttme: In order to put the matter in shape, I will move that 
It Is the sense of this Board that the President press this matter along 
the line of Mr. Mann's speech. 

Seconded. 

Mr. Cook: We have a gentleman up in our town who is a very great 
Importer of fine horses, brought over sixty-three in his last shipment this 
year. And while the state fair needs this, the railroads have made it 
compulsory for them to pay one-half fare. I think probably that It might 
be a good idea along this same line to take this matter up. Now if the 
association would say, if there is a bull killed or horse killed, that they 
would relieve the railroads of that responsibility, or take the losses off 
their hands, it might be put back to where It was a few years ago, making 
it free freight each way. On that basis we could get that man down 
here with his thirty horses — a whole show, a whole state fair in itself. 

President Dinsmore: I wish to say right along that line that that rate 
we had up to last year, would probably never have been taken away 
from us except for the accident that happened at Harvard and the suit 
that was brought to collect the value of a bull that afterwards died, and 
the railroad companies say this in so many words "we can afford to take 
your stock free as we have done, but we cannot afford to be an insurance 
agent," and if the live-stock people and exhibitors, who are the men 
really at interest in this matter, had taken that matter up and paid for 
that bull out of their own pockets at a price they could have compromised 
it, the exhibitors would have been ahead, but it having gone as far as it 
has, I am seriously in doubt whether or not the railroads will retract; but 
we will do what we can, all we can. 

Upon motion, adjournment was here taken to meet at the chapel in the 
State University, 8 o'clock P. M. 

FIFTH SESSION. 

The meeting was called to order at 8 o'clock P. M. with Mr. Dinsmore in 
the chair. 

Chairman: The time having arrived for this meeting, we will now 
come to order. We have with us a gentleman tonight who is to address 
you upon "Nebraska Fifty Tears Ago and Now." He is a gentleman that 
has been with us many years, as one who has seen this state grow from 
infancy to what it is now; knows the possibilities of the state, Is able 
to give you something that is not only worth reading, but is worth your 
while to carefully consider it and carry it home to think of after you 
have gone from here. I have the honor of introducing Major J. R. Burhanan, 
who will address you. [Applause.] </seg>

KBBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

"NEBRASKA FIFTY YEARS AGO AND NOW." 

Mr. Chairman: This title of the subject of my address is something 
of a misnomer, inasmuch as Nebraska at that time did not exist as an 
individuality. It was simply a part of the Louisiana Purchase. True a 
few — a very few — white people, adventurous spirits, had strayed out from 
the older settlements and, braving the hardships and dangers of pioneer 
life, had "squatted" along the western banks of the Missouri river. No 
accurate census exists of the number, but it ranges from a minimum of 
300 to a maximum of 600 white persons, who were then located within 
what became two years later the territory, and afterwards the state of 
Nebraska. True, there had been a party of Mormons— Religionists— a 
sect which had come into disfavor elsewhere, because of their peculiar 
tenets and despotic rule, who found it necessary to seek seclusion from 
other civilizations, and sought this isolation July 21, 1846, as promising 
uninterrupted occupancy, where their leader ruled and governed, without 
other law than his own will. As people began to come here the great 
Mormon leader, Brigham Young, who had sought retirement here, found 
it necessary to "move on" and so April 2, 1847, had tracked out a way 
across the plains and over the mountains, where he found another valley 
Innocent of habitation, returned, organized his followers and moved the 
whole band across the desert sands to Salt Lake Valley, where he sought 
to establish, and did for a time, have an independent government — not 
recognizing subordination to any power, but that he created. He was 
a national character in a way, and a great genius, and it required ultimately 
a United States army of thousands of soldiers (October 3, 1857, 
2,000 soldiers under Gen. Albert Sidney Johnson), to traverse the road 
be had traveled, across plains and mountains, to subdue his aggressive 
power, and re-establish the supremacy of the United States Government 
His submission followed, but not with the best of grace, and never with 
hearty loyal acquiescence. 

The vast plains to the west, in this new territory and state, were covered 
with uncountable numbers of buffalo and a large number of Indians. 
The latter, not overwell pleased with the innovation of white citizens, 
roamed the desert, living on the game of the plains and the fish of the 
streams. There were no railroad connections, no means of reaching the 
settlements of the United States or the outside world except by stage 
conveyance across Iowa and Illinois to advancing railroads, which were 
slowly wending westward; or via the Missouri river to St. Louis or Cairo, 
and south, or up the Ohio river to and through the various ports to settlements 
in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and beyond. The lonesome little settlements 
hugging the Missouri river, and keeping in touch with each other 
for mutual protection, had no convenient markets, nor in fact need of 
them, for their own products, all of which were required for their own 
sustenance. No conveniences of life or living, only hardships for sturdy 
souls to endure, and danger, to tie them together in bonds of friendship </seg>

and fellowship. Even at that early date was felt In this Isolated section 

that struggle which had begun elsewhere on the part of one section of 
the country and resisted in another part, now spreading up into this terri- 

Em Kansas, which later made the sections of Kansas and Nebraska 
as contesting ground, and which finally resulted in the greatest 
t history has ever recorded, — on the one side for the supremacy 

of the institution of slavery, and on the other for its exclusion, and ulti- 

mately its total elimination. Thus the history of the territory and state 
originated in strife, and not only was it menaced by Indians and isolation, 
but by a struggle of governmental principle, whose culmination 

had to be submitted to the final arbitrament of the sword. 

In 1854 territorial government came with Its politicians and office 

Elders. True, the politicians were an infliction, which we never hare 
ve gotten rid of, and while some probably may be good — as a bread 
ey are bad. If all politicians were statesmen and patriots, they would 

be a blessing, but unfortunately they are not. 

While the buffalo and the Indians succumbed to civilization, in Justice 

to the truth we must speak of other pests which retarded the satisfactory 
progress of the territory for a time. The grasshopper invasion surpassed 
for a time the pernicious influence of the politician. But that period of 
desolation passed away, and we have become a great state. Our success- 
6 development has continued to the present, excepting during the yean 
: and 1895, when a severe trial came which gave our pride a fall, 
lely, the visitation of the so-called "hot winds" accompanying serious 

Eh which spread over nearly the entire country, visiting Nebraska 
other states. At that time our farmers were money lenders. Over 
• cent of the time deposits in the country banks were by the farmers, 
years depleted the bank accounts, and savings, and many who bad 

not been frugal or thrifty, laying away for a store against reverses, left 

the state, wandering elsewhere; many ultimately returned. But ISM 
came with its rains and prosperity, and these have continued ever since. 
We have created in this state over 122,000 farms, covering 30,000,000 
acres of ground, and have nearly 20,000,000 remaining for grazing and 
hay. These farms and the grazing section produced in 1902, on conserva- 

tive estimates (and where obtainable the best statistics), as follows: 

Corn, 200,000,000 bushels, worth $70,000,000 
Wheat, 50,000,000 bushels, worth 27,000,00V 

Oats, 55,000,000 bushels, worth 15,000,000 
Other grains and seeds in proportion 2,000,000 
Hay and forage 17,000,000 
Potatoes and vegetables 3,600,000

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE. 

I feel warranted in saying that it is actually $300,000,000 or over. This 
includes simply the products of the soil, and that which the products of 
the soil sustain, which means the stock raised and fed on the products of 
the soil. 

Endustry which has passed the experimental stage is the culture 
r beets. The adaptation of our soil and the climatic conditions 
conceded to be favorable and warrant entire confidence in large 
Lions from that crop. To-day there are three beet-sugar factories 
in the state with an aggregate capacity of about sixteen hundred tons 
per day, which means the manufacture of from twenty to twenty-live 
million pounds of beet-sugar per year in the state. The most successful 
factory is located at Norfolk, the junction of a principal branch and the 
main line of the Fremont, Elkhorn £ Missouri Valley railroad. This industry, 
though successfully started, is in its infancy. There should be 
fifty, or even one hundred, such factories in the state, and even that 
number could not more than supply the demands of the market. Aa an 
evidence of the value of this crop it is statistically true that one man, 
Mr. Widener, of Holt county, in 1902 raised 170 acres of sugar beets, 
which netted him over $30 per acre. This on land which probably two or 
three years ago could have been readily purchased at much less than his 
net earnings for one year on this crop. This called for no irrigation. 
Just plain, simple, intelligent farming. 

Another specialty partially developed in the state is the cultivation of 
alfalfa, recognized to-day as one of the most important feed products that 
can be raised. There are now near 250,000 acres growing in the state. 
As food for all stock it is recognized as healthful and fattening for horses, 
cattle, and hogs. The crop yields, in three or four cuttings, five or six tons 
per acre. It is claimed, and I believe conceded true, that where hogs feed 
on alfalfa there is no hog cholera. Alfalfa dates back to 500 years B. C. 
as a remedial agent. It was introduced by Darius in Europe, and was 
cultivated to some extent by Greeks, Roman, and Egyptians. It was, 
lowever, during the noted reign of Solyman "The Magnificent," sultan 
of the Ottoman empire in the seventeenth century, that this "median 
pasture plant" (our alfalfa) became of value. The sultan ordered a study 
of foods and drinks that would beautify both man and woman. Alfalfa 
is of the clover family, and nearest of kin to the red clover. It has been 
called the "Queen of the Prairie." It has characteristics different from 
any other plant grown. It strikes its roots deeper — twenty-five feet or 
more — until they reach moisture. In the materia medica you will not 
find a sustance in either the animal, vegetable or mineral kingdoms so 
potent for building up and giving strength and vital force as alfalfa; 
magnesia, phosphorus for the brain and nerves, phosphate sodium and 
iron and sulphur for purifying and enriching the blood. Alfalfa has 
been in use as a medicinal product for about four years in this section. 
It was manufactured at this period by the Alfalfa Company, of Wichita, 
Kan., and is on sale at all wholesale and retail drug houses; also by the </seg>

rest to stock growing, grazing and hay, producing in one average year 
over three hundred million dollars in value from its soil and what the 
soil supports. No mines, ores, coal or timber, simply the soil surface, is 
a liberal contribution to the world's support. 

Apropos to the measuring of these great developments and their consequences, 
we must note the development of the "Black Hills," which at 
the time of this early history were utterly unknown, or only known, if at 
all, as an "Indian reserve." Now, with Nebraska's two principal railroads 
penetrating the heart of them, they have become famous, especially in 
two great and national interests; one, a group of gold mining camps, 
whose output for 1902 will be about twelve million dollars and whose 
rapid developments will, in a very few years, double this. The other the 
large system of thermal springs in the Southern Hills, whose waters have 
been proven a specific for some ailments, notably rheumatism. These 
waters have proven so important as to have attracted the national government, 
which has stamped its approval and endorsement on their healthful 
effects by establishing there a national sanatarium, a distinction not 
accorded to any other place in the United States for the same purpose. 
Here will be sent thousands of sick and disabled soldiers, who will be 
treated, cured and restored to the army. You will readily see the relations 
that the Black Hills sustain to Nebraska, drawing from Nebraska 
its supplies of grains and merchandise. Going back. The railroads were 
attracted by the hundreds of miles — millions of acres of rich Iowa prairie 
lands, and built through them to the Missouri river. The farmer from 
the middle states, and even from Europe, followed the railroads. The 
overflow came to Nebraska, converted the "Desert" into farms and stock 
ranches. Two of the great railroads which led in opening up Nebraska, 
the Union Pacific and the Burlington and Missouri, had large land grants 
which served as a basis of wealth, and paid for liberal advertising. The 
latest railroad, the Fremont, Elkhorn * Missouri Valley, had no land 
grant, and so had to depend on the special merits of its section to secure 
settlers in the north part of the state. The influences have been fairly 
successful, and we now have a large population in that portion of the 
state. Fifty years ago land in Nebraska was worthless as to price. It 
had no money value. Now it is selling from 175 per acre down to *10 or 
bper- acre. This Fremont, Elkhorn * Missouri Valley railroad exid 
its line through the agricultural section of the state, through the 
range district in the north part of the state, and not only of Ne- </seg>

braska. but into the ranges of Wyoming and South Dakota, as well aa 
to pioneering Into the heart of the Black Hills. No irrigation is needed 
along the line of the Elkhorn railroad or in the section tributary to it in 
Nebraska. In the stock ranges in Nebraska irrigation is not sought or 
required, as the stock interest is as important in its specialty as agriculture 
is elsewhere, and the stock ranges in Nebraska are the best adapted 
of any section in the great west. Interspersed all through that section 
are hundreds of small or large haying valleys, which are abundantly 
watered and on which is cut ample hay for necessary feeding purposes 
in winter, to care for the stock which graze on the contiguous ranges in 
summer. Nebraska is so rich, so prosperous, and so necessary in her 
share of feeding the world that no other western state compares with it 
in many respects. 

Nebraska is not only justly famous as an agricultural and stock growing 
state, a money-making state, but is equally rich in its educational 
advantages. Its State University stands the acknowledged peer of any 
state university. Its standard is of the very highest. In addition, there 
are a number of state normal schools whose record and standing are 
enviable. The Normal at Fremont, Neb., has an attendance of from 
660 to 800 pupils and a record of excellence rarely attained. The State 
Normal at Peru is also a superior school, besides there are a number of 
colleges and high-grade schools which have assisted the state to its 
enviable standing, as having less illiteracy than any other state in the 
United States, which means in the world. 

Again, it stands very high in point of health. Its clear sky, its persistent 
breezes, and its elevated plateaus insures freedom from malarial or 
miasmatic poisons, gives vigorous, stimulating health, which breeds industry, 
self-reliance and success. Its high standard in morals, church 
and law-abiding tendencies, as a warrant of good order and useful contentment. 
Its cosmopolitan population constantly merges into genuine 
American patriotism, whose loyalty is expressed in its response to every 
demand in support of national or local order. 

About, or over 600 newspapers are published in the state; some good, 
some bad. Some conducted on good sound principles, others the offspring 
of the unadulterated demagogue, but as the Almighty made all 
sorts of vermin, as well as the highest grade of creation, and doubtless all 
planned for a wise purpose, it is best that no one creation should attempt 
to impeach another, but leave each to work out its own destiny. 

The state of Nebraska, when her chief city of Omaha undertook to 
give an exposition, stood solidly behind the city and promoted and 
sustained the most successful, great exposition ever given in the United 
States, excepting only, the great World's Fair and Exposition of 1893 
in Chicago. The local pride of this state was involved a nd the whole people 
stomped approval by their attendance. Its reputation extended 
through the nation and drew crowds from nearly every state. Its management 
was on such broad, liberal methods that its success was unpre- </seg>

eedented, and its history stands out unique in the history of great expositions 
in the world, having paid its stockholders 90 cents on the 
dollar, within 10 per cent of par on all subscriptions in its aid. No other 
exposition has ever paid over 12 per cent on such subscriptions. The 
Essissippi Exposition was concededly a national affair. So ideally 
complete was it that not only the president of the United States 
Cabinet, but many distinguished Americans and foreigner were 
ns. 

To-day the state is the abode of wealth, varied industries, culture, 
education and refinement. Prosperity rewards Industry abundantly. 
"Then," or fifty years ago, its lonesome 600 or less, had scant and meagre 
comforts. To-day her cities, towns and farms have abundance, and 
luxury. Omaha, its largest city, has over 150,000 population; Lincoln, its 
capital city, has over 50,000, and many cities in the state have 10,040 to 
15.000. and villages five and ten miles apart all over the eastern agricultural 
half of the state. The people of the state have a right to feel a 
local pride in the present status of its advancement, and the prospect for 
much greater progress in the future. Encouragement should be extended 
by each citizen to prospective settlers, who bring with them Integrity of 
character, thrifty and frugal habits and a desire t o buy or own a farm, 
or a business interest. Ownership of interest insures the best cftizenship. 
France, with only one-half as many inhabitants as the United States, has 
more farmers who own their farms than the United States has. True, 
their farms are very small in comparison with ours, but they are homes. 
Ownership is essential to permanency and good, loyal citizenship. In all 
this, good judgment would discriminate between the kind of people who 
should be encouraged to come. Subsidizing enterprises is always questionable. 
. A legitimate business will always pay its legitimate expenses, 
and illegitimate enterprises which ask the stimulation of subsidy are 
questionable. 

Chairman: We have with us to-night a gentleman who will address 
you next from a neighboring city, a gentleman who is an authority not 
only in his own state, but throughout these United States, upon the 
growth and the care of one of the greatest staple products, and whose remarks 
will be such that those of you who are here from the farm can 
well afford to take them home with you and put them into practice: it 
will pay you to do this many times. I now have the honor of introducing

on the program. I want to plead not guilty to that charge, not

may take exceptions to it. Now, I once aspired, while living in

I make this explanation at this time that you may not class my name

QUALITY AND TYPE OF OUR FARM ANIMALS. 

BY A. P. OBOCT, PRESIDENT OF THE ILLINOIS IMPROVED LIVE STOCK BREEDERS' 

ASSOCIATION. 

There are two important and very essential factors in all farming 
operations. It is important in the first place that it be attended with 
a fair profit for the money invested and a reasonable compensation for 
the time and labor expended in conducting the work of the farm. In 
the second place it is no less important that the fertility of the soil be 
maintained, and not wastefully dissipated, as is the case in exclusive 
grain growing or cropping. 

The natural soil fertility should be most jealously guarded as so much 
capital stock, that under no circumstances is it to be impaired. It 
should be looked upon as the very basis and foundation of profitable 
and successful farming, and the plan should ever be to so farm that this 
capital stock — this essential condition — be not impaired or wasted. Any 
system of farming that continues to draw upon the bountiful stores of 
nature without any adequate return therefor is not only wrong but wastefully 
extravagant, and in the end will lead to impoverishment, unprofitable 
farming, and abandoned farms. The history of the past, the world 
over, has demonstrated this fact again and again. The correct theory 
of successful farming, therefore, requires that the fertility of the soil be 
maintained and not dissipated. This can only be accomplished by every 
fanner becoming a manufacturer and making his farm a manufacturing 
plant or condensing factory, where all of the products of the farm — the 
corn, the oats, the grass, the forage crops, everything grown — be consumed 
and converted into marketable beef, pork, mutton, wool, butter, cheese, 
horses, mules — anything you like, in the shape of live stock or their 
products, and the resultant wastes, in the form of fertility, be returned 
to the land to compensate it for the fertility given up in growing the 
crops. The question then confronting us at this time is, will we become 
manufacturers, and market our farm products through or by means of 
live stock and return the greater part of the fertility required in growing 
the crops to the soil for the benefit of future crops, and of the future 
generations that are to follow us, and thus greatly and constantly increase 
the value of our farms, or will we sell the crops to the grain dealer 
and with it an essential part of our farms, year by year, until little or 
nothing remains and the farms are greatly depreciated in value. Which 
•hall it be? </seg>

REPORT OF ANNUAL MUTING. 

If we decide in favor of the first proposition, then the lire stock becomes 
the medium or connecting link between the crude products of the 
farm — the grain, the grass, etc. — and the labor in producing the crops 
and caring for the stock, and the final result of the undertaking the cash 
receipts, the profit or loss. The result is dependent upon the specific performance 
of each individual animal involved in the consumption and 
conversion of the grain and other food into the market commodity. Each 
individual animal becomes a separate machine in this farm factory, and 
if the cost of running or feeding this machine for the required period 
is greater than the value of the finished product, then this animal machine 
is not a profitable one and its kind should be discarded in the 

I is said that the average dairy cow in this country does not produce 
than 130 pounds of butter-fat annually. At 20 cents per pound the 
ict of this cow or machine would be only $26. It is further estimated 
the cost of keeping the average dairy cow is $35 per year, conae- 
Lly she does not pa&gt; for the keeping — her board — and is an unable 
machine. On the other hand, there are numerous cows that 
consume the same quantity of food and convert it into three, four 
or even five hundred pounds of butter-fat annually and pay a good round 
profit for all of the food consumed and all of the care and labor required. 
The one is a good machine — the other is a bad one. The one has the 
ability and the capacity to convert the crude farm products into a more 
concentrated form of such a quantity and quality as to make it a paying 
and profitable business. The other lacks the ability to do this and consumes 
more food, or fuel if you please, in the manufacturing process than 
the product is worth on the market. One farmer may raise a horse that 
will readily sell at 5 years of age for $200 or $300, another may raise one 
that will sell for one half as much, yet the one has consumed just as much 
food and required just as much care as the other. The difference is in 
the machine and may be designated as quality. The one has acquired, 
through long years of breeding and selection, the habit of converting its 
food into bone and muscle and flesh and so distributing it about the body 
as to make the most perfect and most useful animal for the purposes for 
which the horse is wanted. The other lacks this ability — this quality, 
hence is a poor and unprofitable machine. It is true that the. a is much 
in knowing how to manage a machine, but if it is not adapted to the 
work required of it, has not the inherited quality, it can never do good 
and profitable work. 

Ee machine determines what the product shall be. The feed cannot 
ge it. The first step in every undertaking should be a definite plan 
purpose. Without this there is indiscriminate confusion and haprd 
results. If the farmer decides to market the products of his farm 
igh his live stock, he must then determine what the finished product 
-oducts shall be. Whether beef, pork, mutton, wool, butter, cheese, 
any or all of these things, as he may think best. It then becomes a </seg>

question of economical and profitable production. We know that the 
different breeds of stock have their specific uses and purposes. We know 
that they have been selected and bred for generations — even hundreds of 
years — for the purpose of doing some particular thing well. Some particular 
thing better and more profitable than other animals of their kind. 
They have been bred for performance — for quality. We know that there 
are breeds of cattle that have acquired the habit of placing the product 
of the food consumed upon their backs where the most valuable and best 
meat is to be found, and they do this naturally and at an earlier age and 
consequently more economically than those animals whose breeding has 
not been specially directed. We know that other breeds of cattle have 
been developed possessing the quality of the greatest and richest milk 
Buction. One breed of sheep produces great qualities of the best wool 
another excels in mutton production. The same is true of all the 
)us breeds of domestic or farm animals. Each has its particular 
— its points of excellence or usefulness. 

It is a necessary condition in the successful production of any product 
that we be familiar with the means or machine by which it is produced 
and that we have the best for accomplishing the work designed. It is 
therefore necessary that we know our farm animals and all their various 
characteristics, peculiarities and qualities. It is desirable to know their 
past history, their pedigree — the record of their ancestors and the environments 
with which they have been surrounded and what quality or 
qualities have been most developed — so that in a choice of breeds for the 
farm we may select those that have the best inherited qualifications for 
rocceasfully accomplishing the object we have in view. 

The value of the animal and its quality depends upon the use we make 
of it. Our variety or breed of cattle may be the best for the economical 
production of milk and butter-fat, but fall far short of doing a profitable 
Job in the production of beef, for the reason that the beef habit has never 
been cultivated or developed. On the other hand, every effort has been 
made by careful selection and breeding — by special feeding, by the early 
and persistent encouragement of the milk flow — to establish a breed of 
cattle whose principal object is the conversion of the food consumed into 
milk and butter-fat. This process has developed the udder at the expense 
of other portions of the body, hence the cat hams — the narrow back and 
lean angular body— the dairy type. Other breeds of cattle have been 
evolved for a very different purpose. The production of milk beyond the 
requirements of its offspring has not been encouraged, but the conversion 
of food into the best quality of muscle and fat has been cultivated, as 
well as form and temperament, until we have the small head, short neck, 
short legs, set wide apart, rounded crops, a good wide back with broad 
deep loin, covered with good thick flesh and a bulging twist — all the fixed 
Bracteristics or habits of the unmistakable beef type. We sell our 
In and various farm crops to our stock, but the price depends upon the 
lity of the animal to which it Is fed or its ability to convert the food </seg>

            <seg id="p093">

Into the best paying product. The better the machine the better work It 
will perform. Always the machine and not the food determines what the 
product shall be. The better the animal — the longer it has been bred for 
a special purpose, the more quality it has — the better price we will receive 
for the feed consumed and the labor expended. 

Eiw shall the desired quality in our farm animals, and especially for 
purposes, be obtained, is the serious question confronting moat 
era to-day. The question of quality — of breeding the best of Its 
kind — has not yet sufficiently recommended itself to the great mass of our 
farmers and stock growers, and the result is that the scrub — a mixture 
of everything and not much of anything to recommend it — abounds everywhere 
and many are compelled to market their farm products through 
the medium of a very inferior machine, and content themselves with 
low and unprofitable prices. My answer to the feeder and corn grower 
is, grow your own steers of the kind and quality you want I know we 
have recently been told by good authority that we cannot afford to keep 
a cow upon the high-priced land of Illinois for a year for her calf. The 
statement has been widely circulated, and so far as I know the correctness 
of the assertion has not been questioned. I may be exceedingly 
rash in attempting to controvert the idea, but if it is a correct statement 
of the situation, and there is no help for it, then we are Indeed in a deplorable 
condition. At the present time, we look to the western ranee* 
for many of our best feeders, where they are grown on cheaper land and 
under cheaper conditions than can be found farther east, but it is only 
a question of a short time when this source will no longer be able to 
supply the demand. The irrigation of much of this region, to be undertaken 
by the government, and its adaptation to general farm purpoees 
will soon drive out the large breeding herds, from which source so large 
a part of our feeders and meat supply is now derived. I think there la 
no question but that this will happen in the near future, and that the 
vast territory now devoted to breeding herds of cattle and sheep will 
soon be used for other purposes -and the herds will be dispersed. The 
price of land is rapidly advancing in all of the corn-growing states, and 
in a short time the area where a cow can be profitably kept for her calf, 
according- to the accepted idea, will be exceedingly limited. 

Where then shall we obtain our cattle and sheep of the requisite quality 
for feeding purposes? We cannot much longer look to the western ranges, 
and the price of our corn land, even now, is too high, it is claimed, to 
admit of raising them, except at a loss, and the price of this land, high 
as it now is, will be much higher. The dual purpose cow is suggested as 
a panacea for all our ills — the cow that will produce an abundance of the 
richest milk, and a calf that will make a good and profitable feeder for 
beef. The dairy cow and the beef cow have been bred for generations 
for diametrically opposite purposes. The tendencies and habits of each 
have become fixed. Whatever increase has been made in the milking 
quality has been at the expense of the beef quality and rice versa. If </seg>

            <seg id="p094">

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE. 

the two qualities could be combined in the same animal, giving us a first 
class milk and beef animal in one, we would certainly have the ideal 
animal, but it can never be, except in a limited degree. Taking the dual 
purpose cow as she is and for what she can do, it is yet an open question 
If a greater profit can be made, taking into account the extra labor, care 
and expense involved, than can be derived from the special purpose cow. 
The idea of the use of the dual purpose cow does not involve any change 
in our method of farming or feeding or saving of the waste products of 
the farm, but holds out the inducement that by combining the dairy and 
beef cow in one of medium quality for milk and beef purposes and the 
addition of extra labor and feed, we may afford to keep her on our highpriced 
land. 

Conceding all that is claimed for the dual purpose cow to be true, it 
cannot possibly relieve the situation to any extent or promise to provide 
the necessary number of feeders of the best beef quality. While the 
dual purpose cow may be the cow for the small farmer, who can and will 
by his own labor work her for all she is worth, in my judgment we will 
be compelled to look to some other source for any great benefits or advantages 
over the present situation. The average feeder in the corngrowing 
states must breed and raise his own feeders and of the type and 
quality that can be most profitably fed for market, and he must do it 
upon the high priced land, if that is the kind he is fortunate enough to 
own. The time has come when the farmer must pursue the same business 
methods, use the same business sense and practice the same economy 
found necessary in other vocations. I do not mean to say that farmers 
generally do not practice economy, but many of them are short sighted and 
do not practice the right kind. Many industries prosper and make vast 
sums of money from products that formerly were allowed to go to waste. 
Once the packing houses only saved the meat, tallow, lard and hides — the 
offal was wasted. Now everything is saved and out of the offal formerly 
lost, immense fortunes are made. Their profit is now in this former 
waste. Manufacturers of the present day are making heavy profits out 
of the material that formerly was considered good for nothing. One of 
the most striking examples of this kind is now seen all over the south. 
Kere the cotton seed was formerly thrown away and in most cases not 
n used as a fertilizer, it is now valued at several dollars per acre by 
the grower, which sum represents that much clear profit on the cotton 
crop from what was formerly thrown away. The value of the cottonfcc•rop 
reaches the millions and its utilization not only furnishes an 
tsed profit for the planter, but has established a great industry for 
hole country that furnishes labor for a vast army of men. 

fubtedly the most stupendous waste of to-day is that of the corn 
the farms of the corn-growing states. The animal loss from this 
represents millions upon millions of dollars to the corn growers 
country. The amount is almost beyond our ability to comprehend, 
waste is steadily and constantly going on year after year. The </seg>


            <seg id="p095">

great waste is in the corn-growing and cattle-feeding regions — the place 
where we are told the land is so valuable that we cannot afford to raise 
our own feeders and where we cannot afford to keep a cow unless we milk 
her. It has been settled over and over again by experimental tests and 
trials that one-third of the feeding value of the corn plant is in the 
plant outside of the ear. The loss or waste of this part of the plant 
represents so much money thrown away. There is no other business in 
the world, so far as I know, except farming, that is so prosperous and 
established upon such a paying basis that it can afford to utterly disregard 
and throw away one-third of the value of one of its greatest products 
and still prosper. It simply shows what possibilities there are, when 
the business of farming is conducted with the same judgment and understanding 
and the same business methods and the same economy practiced 
that we find necessary in other undertakings. 

It is true that our farmers occasionally clamor for a change of administration, 
in order that their distressed and unfortunate condition 
may be improved; but on the whole we are doing fairly well and the 
business of farming is reasonably prosperous, notwithstanding the fact 
that we are not in some respects exercising the same skill and intelligence 
in conducting it that is used in other enterprises. It will avail 
little to talk to our feeders of the value of type and quality, unless we 
can point them to the source from which this kind of stock can be ob- 

Corn. the great fattening food, is grown upon our highest-priced and 
most valuable land, and as a rule the farmer raised it, is also the feeder, 
but under existing conditions and according to the prevailing idea, he 
cannot afford to raise his own feeders of the type and quality that will 
make him the most money, but he must buy whatever kind he can get, 
good, bad or indifferect, from some other section of the country, when 
land is cheaper and they can afford to raise them. To my mind there Is 
something radically wrong about this whole business, as it does not 
permit -the corn grower and feeder to say to what kind of stock he will 
sell his corn. I believe the farmer should run an independent plant, from 
start to finish, and when he has raised the corn or other food and desires 
to market it through his stock, that he will have the stock of the type 
and quality to consume it, that his best judgment tells him will net him 
the most money. The farmer who raises the most corn must of course 
produce the greatest amount of fodder — the greatest amount of that food 
stuff now so prodigiously and profligately wasted. Why not utilize this 
valuable food product in growing the animals that' later are to be fattened 
upon the corn? It is a very simple proposition and I believe a 
practical one. It simply proposes to utilize what is now permitted to go 
to waste. What Professor Waters estimates in Missouri to be worth 
annually to tb» feeder of his state over $40,000,000. and what I believe 
has been estimated in Nebraska to be worth at least $25,000,000 annually, 
and for the whole country would represent to the farmer a valuation of </seg>

something like three-fourths of a billion dollars. If we can grow stock 
upon what is now wasted, we will surely stop the waste and be that 
ahead. And what is to hinder? You ask can it be done? Two objections 
or excuses are offered for not making a better use of the corn-fodder. 
The first that it has little or no feeding value, and in the second place, 
if it has a value, it is less than the cost of harvesting and saving it. In 
other words, the contention is that it costs more to save the corn-fodder 
than it is worth after it is saved, and therefore it is a saving not to 
save it. It is not necessary for me to enter into any discussion in regard 
to its value as a stock food. The actual feeding tests that have been 
made at our experiment stations and the comparisons in feeding value 
with other food products of known and standard value have settled this 
question beyond all controversy. The conclusion is this, that corn-fodder, 
when fed alone, has something like one-half the feeding value of timothy 
hay, but when fed in combination with clover hay or some food of that 
nature, is fully equal to timothy hay. The corn-fodder produced on an 
acre of good corn land is equal in quality and value to the timothy hay 
that could be grown on the same land. Shall we save it? 

For fear some may think that I am talking at random or "through my 
hat," as the saying is, I want to explain that I annually raise about 300 
acres of corn in Illinois. For the past two seasons the yield has been 
between eighty and ninety bushels per acre -and the yield of fodder over 
three tons per acre. I have every acre, every stalk cut up and run 
through the shredder. I have kept a careful account of the cost of doing 
this work, and I am prepared to demonstrate that the fodder does not 
cost to exceed over one dollar per ton, after deducting the cost of gathering 
and cribbing the corn in the ordinary way. Now, then, I have a ton 
of fodder that has cost me $1 and is worth, at the least calculation, half 
as much as timothy hay. which in my section of Illinois is $8. My fodder 
then is worth $4 per ton. By the investment of $1 I have secured a 
value of $4. Ordinarily, if a man can invest $1 in any enterprise and at 
the end of the year have $1.10 to show for it, he looks upon it as a good 
proposition. He has made 10 per cent on his money; but in this case, as 
you will see, I have made 300 per cent. Now by a proper combination of 
this fodder with other kinds of food, such as clover, cow-peas or alfalfa 
or grain, I can double its value and make it the equal of timothy hay, and 
even better, and more valuable ton for ton. I have a first-class stock food 
that will keep in good condition lots of cows and their calves. I can 
raise all the feeders the farm will raise the corn to feed for the market, 
and they will not cost me as much as it would to go upon the market 
and buy them, and besides I am the master of the situation, as to the 
type and quality of the stock I feed, and I can make more money from 
my feeding operations than if compelled to feed any kind of stock that 
I might be able to pick up. The price of land is largely regulated by 
what it produces and what can be made out of it. I can raise three tons

shred It and put it in the barn or rick, at a cost not to exceed $3, or 11 
per ton, for the fodder. From this one acre I have more than enough feed 
to keep a cow for the five or six months when she is not grazing, and 
with the proper combination of other cheaply grown and soil improving 
foods, like clover, alfalfa or cow-peas. I have sufficient food to keep two 
or three cows, and at a cost not to exceed one-half of the value of a firstclass, 
well-bred beef calf at six months of age. Yet it is contended that 
we cannot afford to keep a cow tor her calf. I challenge this assertion 
and say it is the very thing we should do on the high-priced lands, and is 
the only thing we can do to stop the great waste that is now going on. 
It is no time to throw up our hands and say we cannot do a thing when 
present methods do not suffice. Rather let us look for better and more 
rational methods and for ways and means for doing what we know 
ought to be done and bring about a condition that we know ought to 
exist. Another thing, while I am keeping this cow that is to raise the 
calf, the manure that I can make with the shredded corn-stalks that are 
not eaten (for they are the best absorbent in the world), if properly 
utilized, is worth all it cost me to keep this cow during the winter 
months, and she has not cost me a cent and does not owe me anything. 

Cattle on full feed for fattening purposes can only consume a small 
uantity of fodder. Hogs, to which so much of our corn is fed, cannot 
consume it at all. No animal that we are fattening for market can conume 
any considerable quantity of it. How foolish, how unbusinesslike. 
o so manage our farm factory or manufacturing plant that we have a 
large quantity of valuable product on hand every year that we cannot 
tilize or get anything for. The facts of the case are that we need to 
balance the products of our farm, and raise such crops only, and in such 
uantities, as can be consumed entirely and without waste. To do this 
e must also balance the stock to fit the requirements of the farm, and 
f the kind that will consume every part and parcel of the entire products, 
nd when we do this and select stock of the best type, and quality, as the 
medium for condensing it. we will be doing business in a business way. 

Chairman: Will you tell this audience the price of land upon which 
you are raising these crops? 

Mb. Gbovt: The land is not for sale. 

Chairman: The average price of your land in your section? 

Mr. Gbout: I should think it would be priced at from $75 to $100, and 
it might be more than that. 

Chairman: What is the price of corn? 
Mr. Gbout: From 30 to 35 cents. 

Chairman: Farmers of Nebraska, if farmers of Illinois can ratoe 
cattle and corn and make it profitable on land at that price and corn at 
that price, cannot the farmer of Nebraska make it more profitable than he 
is doing by adopting some other and better methods? For thirty yean 
I have been going up and down this state, summer and winter, and it has

struck me very forcibly that the farmers are throwing away a good fortune 
every year between here and my home, and it is only sixty-eight miles 
away. There is one thing you must do if you meet the conditions that 
confront you to-day, and that will continue to confront you from year 
to year, — you must make some use of that which you are now wasting. 
Isn't it time for you to commence doing this? and if you are convinced, 
then will you go home and turn over a new leaf and commence anew: 
commence in keeping account of what it costs you to do things and what 
you can get out of it? No man knows what he is doing unless he keep* 
an account, which will show both the debit and credit side of the account. 

Mr. McIwtmh: I would like to suggest that we have a neighbor who 
is a farmer, interested as Mr. Grout has already outlined. I think that 
fanner is in the house, it is Mr. Brown, of Maple Creek. Neb. Will not 
Mr. Brown give us a review of his present methods? We had him before 
this meeting two years ago, as you remember, and his address was of 
exceeding value to us. Now. Mr. Brown, give us a report. 

Chairman: We would be very glad to hear from him if he is in the 

Km an: Gentlemen. I will introduce to you Mr. Brown, who is a 
a farmer among us, and you may learn from him. | Applause. | 

Mr. Brown: It is always a pleasure to me to look upon the faces of 
thoee so interested in the advancement of agriculture as to give their 
appearance in such a meeting as this, but I had not expected to-night to 
appear before you at all, so I am taken right on the spur of the moment, 
and don't expect to talk intelligently to you. I only heard a small part 
of the address of my friend here at my side. I differ from what he has 
Just saiil. I tell you that to begin with he has not approached the truth 
of the matter. | Laughter. | The feeding that we are doing this y&lt;-.ir 
on the very land that he talks of exceeds anything that he has said. 
I Applause. I Perhaps, gentlemen, the very liest thing I can do. the 
easiest thing for myself and the best for you, is just to tell ytou simply 
in the fewest words what I have tried to do at home. If it is worth our 
while trying to do, possibly it would be worth while to hear it. Many of 
you that have seen me before know that in the last fifteen years I have 
been cutting nearly, if not all, of my corn-fodder. I have been carrying 
as many cattle and sheep and hogs on my place as I could to see how 
many I could profitably keep the year around, till I got land in Dodge 
county on the table-lands — not on the bottoms. I had about 120 head of 
cattle of all grades, about 300 head of sheep, and 100 head of hogs. I 
was able to feed; I was able to feed those all. my friend, from the products 
of that three eighties. I cut all my corn. I will not go back further 
than two years. In 1901 I rented the pasture. I took my cattle out of the 
pasture, just keeping a few to milk at home. By putting them in the 
pasture I lost |800. It was not a good year for pastures, and it would 
have paid me better had I kept the whole of them at home. When I </seg>

away. My pasture did not turn out well. From the poor corn crop 
of i901 we carried them over to last spring, spring of 1902. gaining in 
flesh during tbe entire season of 1901. I rented the pasture again. I took 
them to it. I stocked the pasture very gently, about one-half of the 
amount that I had the year before. It was a different pasture from the one 
I had in 1901. The pasture was very abundant and I expected to continue 
for the coming year, but I had to deny myself of that privilege. What I 
am going to say is, that in the fall of 1901 we had procured a larger 
amount of sheep — we fed the older ones off. We had our stock of young 
lambs, the males we fed off and shipped to Omaha along with th*ir 
mothers, and we retained the crop of ewe lambs for the accommodation 
crop of the future. These were bred from western ewes and western 
bucks. You can not change the result of thai flock before Christmas 
without any extra feeding. We sold them in Omaha at an average weight 
of 80 pounds, while their mothers, western ewes, turned the scales at 
135 pounds. We had not furnished a bushel of corn per head to those 
ewes. I wish you could remember that this is on upland and not bottom 
land, and also remember the dry time we had in the fall of 1901. 

Q. Did you use Leicestershire very long? 

A. For five years. 

Q. And you are very well pleased with the outcome? 

A. Yes, for the first crop of western ewes. 

Q. The reason I put that question is. they are a rare article in this 
part of the country. 

FYes, sir. The ewes we have now will be two years old in next May, 
will turn the scales at an average of 160 pounds. 

Now for the season of last year. In the fall of 1901 a little after our 
oat crop was taken off. I turned in and disked that ground as quickly 
as I could, and we had our stock removed fr,om the fields as quickly as 
possible. I expected rains, but none came. We were ready to sow the 
field with grain, but when the oats that was turned down would not 
sprout there was little use in trying, so we did not sow it. We left it to 
the seeding of oats, which was very heavy, and that did not sprout until 
the beginning of September when we had our first rain. It was beginning 
to look a little blue with a large stock of cattle and sheep and hogs and 
the supply of feed scarce. We had rain on the 4th of July and was mostly 
on the surface, and as quickly as that oats started, it showed me the 
rapidity of growth. It was only the middle of July till we had one of the 
most immense crop of oats: in the fall almost knee high to turn those 
sheep in. We turned them in. The weight that I mentioned to you 
will prove that in this way we were able to market our ewes, and we 
weathered the lambs successfully on the land that we fed these on. We 
fed them in the field, fed them the corn without shelling so that they 
would travel over the field. We plowed that down and raised a crop of 
corn on it this last year. We cultivate level cultivation as soon as 
possible. My neighbor across the road has the clay land. We both plowed </seg>

in the spring. He reaps a crop of about fifty bushels to the acre of not 
very good corn; we have harvested a crop of over seventy bushels on 
every acre we have planted, on every acre, of the soundest corn I ever 
grew. [Applause.] I mention that with regard to the sheep, as I don't 
think there is any man that can put any animal on his place that will 
give him as quick returns as the sheep. There is no possible way that I 
see of increasing the intrinsic value of our farms as we can do It with 
the sheep. But one year in the thirty years that I have farmed in the 
state of Nebraska have I raised a better and more matured crop of corn 
than in the year just passed. 

Now, for the cattle. We have increased our stock of cattle as rapidly 
as we couid. They are Shorthorns. I used as good bulls as I could get. 
We have cut our corn, as .much of it as we thought our cattle will use. 
Now, I would remark also, in that corn-field, which was planted this 
last year, at an average of four to five to the hill and gives us five ears 
of corn that are matured, and planted about six inches apart, we cut 
enough of our fodder with it to carry our cattle. It didn't take it all. 
We cut three acres of that. 

Q. Is your land subsoil? 

A. No, sir. 

How we put up our corn. It was very wet. We set in cutting our corn. 
1 did the cutting, and the little boy drove the lead team. These ears 
would average four to five to the hill; a heavy crop. We used four horses 
on the binder. It made nine rows of shocks across the acre. It aMM 
almost Incredible, but we did it. We put thirty and over of these 
sheaves to the shock. There happend to be no wind, so it did not sweat. 
There was rarely a single ear injured. We never had a better supply of 
nice fodder with good ears in it. We expected to shred it. My friend 
spoke very highly of shredding; I never tried it. I had arranged for it. 
but they did not put in an appearance until after the snow came, and 
then came over to do the shredding, but I didn't have it done. We cut 
sixty acres of corn last fall, and we are trusting to feed to the 1st of 
May, 120 head, together with eighty sheep and about fifty hogs, and we 
don't expect to buy a single bushel of corn. 

Q How did you feed that? 

Ke load it on the wagon every day and go in with a number of 
and put it in a rack between poles. We have about eighty head 
feed in that field. 

Q. Don't you husk out that corn? 

BNo. sir. We feed about eighty head in the fall. We drive out into 
eld. If it is a nice day, no wind, we then cut the bands, otherwise 
By the time they get the ears eaten off, they will soon open. We 
open another gate and let the hogs out into the place. 

Q. How much labor does that take to run such a farm as that? 

¦L larger boy, and my son, a grown man, and then there is a boy that 
part of his time in the fall. </seg>

REPORT OF ANNUAL MEETING. 

101 

Q What do you do for pasture in the summer time? 

A. Up until two years ago, we began about the 10th of August and 
give it to the cattle from the field. 

Q. What do you feed up until the 10th of August? 

EVe have always had corn-fodder with the corn on, because we 
take it off; we let the cattle do it. It will run us through May, 
re supplement the forty acres of pasture which we have on the 
which is our feeding ground, with any other hay we have kept over. 
ve not grown a clover crop for the last eight years. 

Kjn't it often happen the way you feed your corn-stalks that the 
rt of the stalks will get lost either by the wind or dry weather, so 
e stock do not get it at all? I mean the leaves especially. 

Ko, sir; because if it is a windy day we do not cut the bands; 
a still day we cut them. 

Q. Would you mind telling these gentlemen present — and I don't want 
you to answer it unless you want to answer it — how much your average 
gross income is per annum from your three eighty acres of land managed 
under this system? 

¦No, I would not, but I would have to find the books and figure it up 
mt $2,600 a year. 

A. No, 1 would not, but I would have to find the books and figure it op 

Pbokessor Lton (to Mr. Grout): On that high-priced land at what 
age did you find it necessary to make him pay? 

A. The most economical period is the earliest period you can get him 

for the market, which is not to exceed two years, and it would be 
better to do it at an earlier period. 

¦How many cows can you keep on a quarter section of land and feed 
teers out and turn them off at their proper age? 

A. I could not answer that question, because I have several farms, and 
as some of the stock is on one and some on the other. I buy and sell as 
the opportunity presents itself. 

Q. Do you think you could within a reasonable limit? 

¦No, I could not do that because I have got a herd of breeding cattle, 
bred, and I take care of them, I pasture them sometimes In one 
and sometimes in another place. 

Q What weight can you get on a steer at twenty-four months old? 
A. I sent some to the market last April that weighed 1.400. 
Q. How long have you been feeding corn? 

A. About six months only. 

Q. For eighteen months they had little or no corn? 

RMost of them were purchased; I didn't raise them all, but I had 
them during the summer, and commenced feeding them about 
March and April. 

Q. If you were raising them what would be your feed to make the 
steer at twenty-four months? 

A. I would feed them a little corn from the beginning. I would never 
let them lose the calf fat, keep them gaining a little all the time. </seg>

            <seg id="p102">
102 


Q. While they were a suckling can you feed them a little corn? 

K would be better. I don't say I do that as soon as they are weaned; 
haps commence to feed them a little before they are weaned, so 
ey will not go back when they are weaned. 

Q. About how much above the average market price can steers, made 
in that way, on the market bring if they are bred right? 

¦ could not answer that definitely; you know what a difference 
is in market prices, two or three and sometimes four cents. 

Q. What time do you think is the best time to shred it? 

A. As soon as the fodder is sufficiently dry so it will not spoil. If you 
commence about the first of November, after that the weather is milder 
and the days longer and all of the conditions are much better, and you 
can shred it better then. The question was asked this afternoon in regard 
to shredding, and it is usually supposed to be a very expensive operation. 
Now, perhaps I can do it better than a great many could do it, because 
I own my own outfit complete, the shredder and engine, and then I use 
my regular farm hands, bo far as I can, men that I have that work for 
me by the month, and in this shredding operation I don't count my 
teams as anything, as you understand that in order to raise the grain I 
am compelled to have the teams, and at this season of the year they are 
doing nothing. I have kept careful count of what it costs to shred, and I 
have the figures in my book of the expense for one day. It takes eleven 
men to run the outfit, and then I allow for the board of eleven men, 
coating me $10.20; and then I have another whose pay and board is $2 5" 
for that day. Part of them I board all the time and part of them simply 
get their dinner. I allow 90 cents for the amount of coal I get. I get 
that coal a little cheaper, because it is right on the farm. I allow 25 
cents for the oil; I allow $1.77 for the use of the engine. I will explain 
that. That amounts to $15.62; that is the expense of running that outfit 
for one day. That day we husked and put in the crib 625 bushels of corn. 
Now then, if you allow 24 cents for husking that corn in the field and 
putting it in the crib, it amounts to exactly $15.62, with the amount of 
cost in running and oiling of $1.70 for the use of the machine. This 
machine shreds and husks it. 

Q. Do you allow for the engineer? 

A. He works for me by the year. It cost me more this year than it 
ought to. This 625 bushels represent seven and one-half acres, which 
cost me $17 per acre. I was unable to use the corn harvester on account 
of the ground being very wet, and then the corn did not ripen evenly, and 
I simply put my men to cutting where it was ready. That $17.50 for the 
acre which, divided by 7» it cost me $2.33. That is the total expense of 
putting that shredded fodder in the barn. In fact I think there are nearer 
three tons than two. Allowing $2 for the corn — $1.16 per ton. The rule 
Is that the fodder will weigh as much as the corn. If I have eighty 
bushels to the acre, it gives me 5,600 pounds; nearly three tons. I cannot 
get my corn shucked out of the shock at two cents per bushel. It seems </seg>

            <seg id="p103">
103 


to me it is a plain business proposition. After you take the coat of 
gathering the corn and putting it in the crib in the ordinary way, you 
get your fodder, including the cutting of it in the first place, not to 
exceed $1 a ton, and I believe I can make it still cheaper. I have been 
put onto a scheme where we can load a shock of corn on the wagon in 
one minute. 

Q. How do you do it? 

A. Our shocks are so large that they very seldom freeze. 

Bou spoke of three tons to the acre; that Is the combined weight you 
m one acre. What part of that is bedding and waste material? 

R perhaps one-third or one-half. It don't make much difference, 
le eat all they want. I have lots of it and what they don't eat is 
uable for manure. 

Q. How do you store your fodder? 

A. I put all in the barn will hold, and the balance I put up in stacks. I 
feed tnat which is outside first. 

Q. What kind of feed would that be for a horse? 

Ke don't feed our horses anything else in the winter; we have 
; else to feed them. 

Q. How large a machine have you? 

A. It is 6 to 8 row machine. By watching these things it can be done 
even cheaper than I have. 

Chairman: There is a resolution I am told that a gentleman would 
like to present here in the interest of the university. I take it that the 
friends who are here are friends of the University, and that they will 
remain and take action upon this. 

Ma. Hendebshot: At the first evening's session of the Live Stock 
Growers' Association a resolution was presented, at which meeting it was 
almost unanimously endorsed. House Roll No. 102 was read, and a committee 
appointed to pass upon the resolution, which will be brought before 
that convention. They interviewed Chancellor Andrews and many of the 
professors of our university. It was the unanimous voice of this committee 
that this resolution should pass. [Here Mr. Hendershot read the 
resolution above referred to.] It is thought advisable to ask this convention 
to pass this resolution to-night, and I move you, Mr. Chairman, 
that it be the sense of this meeting that they adopt this resolution. 

Adopted. 

The following bill was drawn and presented to the legislature for 
consideration:

&lt; OFNTY COLLECTIVE EXHIBITS. 

WITH COMMENTS OF "NEBRASKA FARMER." 

The greatest feature of attraction at the Nebraska state fair, for years 
past, has been the county collective exhibits of farm produce. Agricultural 
Hall has been reserved for this feature of display, little attention 
being given the exhibition of articles in this department, only as they 
appear in connection with a county display. It may be said in this connection 
that the inducements for the county collective exhibit are such as 
to concentrate the efforts of the exhibition enterprise of a county to the 
securing of one of the big cash prizes offered. The individual exhibition 
is thus swallowed up by the exhibition trust, as it were. It is easier for the 
individual in any county to turn his produce over to the person or association 
of persons who arrange to represent the county in a collective 
display at the state fair than to attempt taking his exhibits to the state 
fair independent of this assistance. Carload transportation arrangements 
are secured for the county exhibit and its transportation to and from 
the fair free of cost; thus the feature of county collective exhibits ha» 
prevailed throughout the state as a state fair attraction. 

K advantage in this method of exhibition is in the competition the 
money incentive creates among ambitious exhibitors. There is 
appropriated for this feature of agricultural display, above the

the contest. The bis prize was $300 for the county showing the highest 
score in a possible 1.600 points. The remaining $1,700 to be prorated 
among the contestants showing a score of 800 and above, according to the 
value of their score. In the recent contest there were fifteen counties 
that scored inside of the limit, and were entitled to a share of the award 
of the purse of $2,000. 

K accompanying table will show the counties contesting and the 
each received in the various lines of produce scheduled for the col&gt; 
exhibit. 

Special mention of the excellent and attractive features of all these 
exhibits would necessarily have to be indulged in not to do injustice to 
some one, as they all possessed meritorious features of exhibit. There 
is, however, one very important point that should not be overlooked in 
this form of county collective exhibit, and that is the exhibitor has more 
to do with the quality of the display than the district of the state in which 
it is grown. In other words, any county in Nebraska can grow some good 
exhibition produce, but it requires an exhibitor to collect and prepare this 
material for exhibition. It is folly to say that a county west of the 100th 
meridian can produce better farm produce than the rich agricultural 
counties on the east third of the state. Yet we often see the best county 
collective exhibts come from the range districts, from counties that do 
not make any claim to general agriculture, and the rich agricultural 
counties either not exhibiting at all, or have their exhibits in the hands 
of incompetent persons, who do not know how to select high class exhibition 
produce, or fail in putting it up in an attractive and effective 
display 

The county collective exhibit is not a just claim of one county or one 
district of the state over another in point of superiority in soil or land 
values. It demonstrates the skill of the exhibitor, his energy and ambition 
to excel. There are but few exhibition men in any county, and these 
become proficient in the work by years of experience; they learn to be 
critics in quality and appearance of articles for exhibition by coming in 
actual contact with skilled exhibitors. The county taking the first prize 
in this state fair contest has an exhibitor, in the person of Mr. Peterson, 
who has few equals in selecting, preparing and placing a display of farm 
produce. Cuming county is one of the best counties in the state, and 
Peterson is one of the best exhibitors in the state. Thus Cuming county, 
scaled by state fair measurement, is justly entitled to the award it re- 

One of the important features to be observed in these county collective 
exhibits is to fill every classification in the list of products, thus getting 

I rating that will help in the aggregate. The omission of one division or 
Variety of produce cuts out 100 points from the possiDle 1,600. 

Wesern counties exhibited a higher standard of produce, when their 
lack of moisture and general agricultural conditions were considered, 
than the rich counties on the east side of the state, which have had an 
abundance of moisture all summer and excellent crop conditions. </seg>

CROP REPORTS. 1902. 

The editor of this volume is indebted to the Omaha Daily Bee for the 

Bng valuable tabulations, which are found to be more correct than 
cial returns from counties. We include, also, the Bee's able review 

of the crop conditions 

NEBRASKA CORN CROP. 

These figures tell more eloquently than any words the story of Ne- 

braska's agricultural prosperity. Not only has the position of the state 
as a member of the corn belt been maintained, but the claim to recognition 
aa a wheat producer has been more than vindicated. Five years ago Nebraska 
made a bid for admission into the list of states wherein wheat is 
raised in such quantities as to be considered a factor in the markets of the 
world. Th'is presumption was met by some evidences of skepticism on the 
part of those who pretend to fix the lines in this regard, and Nebraska 
was told to make a reputation. In 1897 the wheat crop of the state was in 
the neighborhood of 30,000,000 bushels. In two years it bad increased by 
about 10,000,000 bushels. Now, five years after the proposition was made, 
the total crop is more than doubled, reaching to over 60,000,000 bushels. 
In this connection a close study of the large table presented herewith will 
be of interest, as it shows how the farmers have changed and that while 
the acreage of corn has decreased, the acreage of winter wheat has been 
largely increased. In the northern counties spring wheat is still raised. 
The crop for 1902 is divided as follows: Winter wheat: Acreage, 2,046,198; 
yield, bushels, 49,406.808. Spring wheat: Acreage. 722.132: yield, bushels, 
10,809.862. This is by far the biggest wheat crop ever raised in Nebraska. 
Some difference of opinion exists between the farmers, the elevator men 
and the eastern buyers as to the merchantable qualities of the crop. 
Local elevator men Insist that it should grade No. 2, while the eastern 

men say not. At the local mills it is being made up into a fine grade of 
flour, and the dispute as to its grade will likely not be settled, aa the price 

depends on the grade.

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

KINO CORN'S PLUMBS. 

In 1900, which was in many respects Nebraska's record year for corn, 
seventy-nine counties returned an acreage of 7,721,209, with a total yield 
of 241,935,527. In 1902 eighty-four counties return an acreage of corn 
amounting to 5,773,170, with a total yield of 224,201,950 bushels. This 
decrease in acreage is in a large measure due to the fact that the crop of 
1901 was almost a failure, and the price of seed corn was so high that 
many farmers did not put in the usual amount. The figures in the table 
will be found rather below the government's estimate, which was 7,818,000 
acres, with a total yield of 234,540,000 bushels. Conservative grain men 
are all agreed that the government estimate is too high, and that the 
figures given herewith are more accurate. A remarkable feature of the 
government's crop report is that Nebraska is not credited with an acre 
of winter wheat. 

One other thing which militated against the corn crop during the last season 
was the unusual amount of rainfall during the growing months, and 
the very wet and cold September, the time for ripening. Thus the early 
growth and the maturity of the crop was interfered with. This damage was 
not general, however, for the rainfall was very unequally distributed 
during the later months of the summer, and while some few counties, in 
the southwestern part of the state principally, actually suffered for want 
of rain, others had too much. Early planted corn was well matured before 
the first touch of frost and the later planted was caught only in the 
low grounds. In some sections of the state the damage in this way is estimated 
as high as 50 per cent, while it is admitted that a large part of the 
crop will be what is known as "soft" corn, due to the frost overtaking the 
crop before matured, it is estimated that fully 30 per cent of the yield will 
be marketable, while the balance will be available for feeding purposes. 
During the month of October the warm weather did much to redeem this 
soft corn, drying it out and repairing as far as possible the damage done 
in September. In this dry weather of the last three weeks has been of 
inestimable value to the farmers. 

YIELD OF OTHEB CHOPS. 

In 1900 the acreage returned for oats was 1,789,170, with a total yield 
of 48,785,422 bushels. For 1902 the acreage is 1,669,208, and the yield 58,-603,007. 
While this total falls more than 5,000,000 bushels below the government's 
estimate, it shows that the year was an unusually good one for 
oats in Nebraska. During the whole season the weather conditions were 
favorable for oats, except those planted on liver bottoms, where the floods 
destroyed all chance of a crop. The growth was heavy, even rank, and 
the harvest was in a large measure delayed by these conditions, but the 
yield was most abundant. This yield in bushels is the largest reported in 
many years and possibly the largest ever grown in the state. 

¦shows more than double the acreage and three times the yield for 
hile barley shows a slight falling off in acreage and yield. Neither </seg>

CROP REPORTS. 

Efforts to gather exact figures as to the potato, hay and alfalfa crops met 
with disappointment, but enough is shown by the reports tabulated to give 
some idea of the importance of these crops to the state. From the ."&gt; 
acres reported, 7,875,096 bushels of potatoes will be gathered. This 1b probably 
half the total crop of the state. From 1,012,849 acres have been cut 
1,670,161 tons of hay, although the total crop of the state is estimated by 
the dealers at fully double these figures. Alfalfa is taking its place as a 
major forage crop, 207,069 acres being returned, with a yield of 1,070,960 
tons. Some counties report as many as four cuttings of alfalfa during the 

ABUNDANCE OF FEED. 

It is certain from these figures that there will be no shortage of feed in 
Nebraska during the coming winter. Already thousands of head of cattle 
and sheep have been sent to the feed lots, and many other thousands will 
follow during the winter. The range in the state was never in so good 
condition. Not a great deal of corn has been fed as yet, and no hay, for 
the pastures afford the best sort of picking. Unless the winter be unusually 
severe the range stock in Nebraska will be in splendid condition 
to go on corn in the spring. 

Another very encouraging condition is that the ground is in splendid 
nape for fall seeding, and during the fine weather of the last three weeks 
lie farmers have been busy putting in winter wheat and rye. Such 
eports as have been sent in on this item point to a largely increased 
acreage of winter wheat, so that it is not at all unlikely that the next 
ear's crop report will show that Nebraska is entitled to the full 60,000,-000 
bushels of winter wheat that was claimed for the state by some of the 
grain men this year. 

No effort has been made to put a price on the crop of 1902 for Nebraska, 
but conservative men estimate that the four major crops will fetch 
in the neighborhood of 1125,000,000. If the value of the barley, potatoes, 
hay, alfalfa, sugar beets and the other products of the farm for which 
complete figures have not been obtained were added to this estimate it 
will be seen that farming in Nebraska still pays. Then the dairy and 
poultry interests of the state are not an insignificant factor in its agricultural 
total, while the fruit raisers are prosperous, but reluctant to even 
give an estimate as to the extent of the yield for the state. </seg>

ROME DISEASES OF WHEAT. 

BY L. L. HARTKR. OHELL. 

WHEAT RUST. 

Life History. — A fungus like that growing upon the wheat, and its close 
relatives, unlike many other fungi, has several stages in its life history. 
I shall not attempt here to give any absolute information concerning it. 
From very early times people have become more or less acquainted with 
the wheat rust in almost every portion of the globe. In later years, attention 
has been called to it because of the extensive damage done to crops. 

¦s are several views advanced at present concerning the regeneration 
very destructive fungus, but as yet. no one has been able to decide 
ly upon any one of them. 

This fungus is a lowly organized plant and lives solely upon the food 
material obtained from the host. There are two species of the plant which 
attack the wheat in spring and summer, viz., Puccinia graminis and 
Puccinia rubigo-vera. They differ but slightly and not at all in their 
effect upon the grain, there being only some slight differences in the form 
of the spore. They differ somewhat in their life history and mode of re- 
Eeration from year to year, which will be mentioned later. Puccinia 
igo-vera is more prevalent in this section of the country than Puccinia 
mini*. 

The vegative portion of the fungus is in the form of minute threads, 
called the mycelium, and permeate through the tissue of the stem and 
leaves. They obtain nourishment from the host and when the proper 
time comes begin to form spores by a sort of swelling up, soon being 
ready for distribution. Three stages are in evidence in the life history 
of this fungus, yet there is very good evidence that one of these may be 
lacking in many instances. It was found many years ago that in the 
locality where there were many barberry bushes, wheat rusted worse than 
elsewhere. Investigation showed that spores which were formed here 
would infect the wheat and cause rust. These spores are formed on the 
leaf of the barberry in little cluster cups. The mycelial threads which 
permeate through the tissue of the leaf divide up into little parallel 
chains composed of spores. By their growth and increase they finally 
rupture the epidermis and the end spores are carried away by the wind. 
These spores are very minute and single celled. They are called aecidiosporea 
and thus the aecidial stage. When they alight on the proper host, 
as wheat, they germinate and produce the uredo-stage. The spores are 
called uredospores. This is the second stage in the development. Moist 
damp weather is the most favorable condition for the germination of the 
aeeidiospores upon the wheat. These likewise grow under the epidermis 
of the wheat and the mycelial threads permeate through the tissue. After </seg>

a period of a few days the epidermis is ruptured and the spores appear 
in red streaks over the blades and steins. This is known as the red ru»t 
stage and is prevalent during the spring and early summer. During 
favorable conditions it spreads with astonishing rapidity, and in a few 
days a whole field may be destroyed by it. The spores are-single celled and 
formed- singly at the end of the mycelium. They are very unlike the 
aecidios pores. 

When unfavorable conditions arise, uredospores cease to form, and 
from the same threads another kind of spore is formed. It is two celled 
and much thicker walled. These are the ones which remain over winter, 
and in the early spring germinate, forming sporidia, which infect the 
barberry again, when the round of life is completed. These spores form 
black spots on the surface and is called the black rust stage. They are 
known as teievtospore$. About March or April each cell of the teleutospore 
germinates and forms a little thread which is four septate. From 
each one of these, one sporidium is formed and during the spring winds, 
is carried to the barberry. 

I1KHTRVCTION CAV8ED BY BIST. 

No exact estimate of damage done by rust to wheat can be made. The 
amount of wheat lost annually is enormous. Whole fields have been 
almost completely devastated by atacks of it. Fields which look very 
promising may in a few days become so thoroughly contaminated that it 
is worthless to harvest it. Probably no one disease causes so much 
destruction to cereals as this one. When favorable conditions arise three 
known species of rust attack the grain, Puccinia gramxnis, Pucdnim 
rubigo-vera, and Puccinia coronata. The last named occurs more frequently 
on the oats of this country. The last two are not so visible as 
the former. They do not rupture the epidermis but form their spores 
under the surface. The destructive effects are none the less apparent. 
The spores of Puccinia gramini* appear very readily by rupturing the epidermis 
of the grain and forming red streaks or spots on the surface. 

B attempts have been made to determine how these rusts regenerate 
•ar to year, in localities where no barberry is found and no satiaconclusions 
have been ascertained. The uredospores of all the 
have been germinated through the whole winter by artificial 
but whether or not this is sufficient to carry it through from one 
until the next is uncertain. If this should be the case, only one 
i the life history would be necessary. We know that teleutospores 
are formed later in the summer when less favorable conditions of growth 
prevail. The walls of these spores are thick and well adapted for enduring 
winter weather. The teleutospores of some species have never bean 
germinated through the winter months. They remain dormant until 
t March or April when they begin germinating. Some pathologist* 
reported success in germinating teleutospores of Puccinia rubigolut 
all attempts made to germinate Puccinia gramini* hava failed. </seg>

            <seg id="p120">

NK BE ASK A STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

There is a prevailing opinion that the teleutospores serve to carry the 
rtiwwBR through the winter, and in early spring germinate and form little 
sporidia, which have the power of producing uredospores on the growing 

There is a possibility that some other plants yet unknown have much 
the same power as the barberry and form thiB intermediate stage. 

The fact that there is wheat growing in some part of the United States 
at all times in the year, would induce one to believe that the spores were 
carried by the wind to fields in other regions. In early spring the spores 
in the southern states would be mature and "ready for dissemination as 
soon as favorable conditions existed further north and the strong prevailing 
south winds would carry them along infecting the fields. Experiments 
show that there is a certain stage in the growth of the wheat 
when it is more susceptible to infection than at others. This period would 
become later in going north and by the time a field would be susceptible 
the spores south would be ripe. In the same manner the spores would 
blow south in the fall and thus some portion of the country would be a 
source for infection. 

nmmnt 

Pyet no successful preventives have been found. Many experiments 
been made by spraying. Solutions consisting of potassium blcarbonead 
acetate, copper sulphate, mercuric chloride, and several others 
been made and applied to the grain about the time the rust appeared. 
Different strengths go to prove that when the solution or compound was 
strong enough to kill the fungus, that the effect of the fungicide was 
worse than that of the rust. None of these have yet proved satisfactory 
and the difficulty of reaching the grain for spraying purposes is wholly 
impracticable and too expensive for consideration. The most promising 
outlook so far is the obtaining of a variety which is immune to rust. 
Some varieties have been found which are not as susceptible to infection 
as others, and the farmer should use every effort to obtain such a grain. 
Whether it is the grain which has a hard stem, or the one with a soft one 
that is Immune, has not satisfactorily been worked out. There are in all 
fields some stalks which show very slightly or not at all atacks of rust. 
These particular ones should be gathered up and the seed sown. They will 
show leas susceptibility to infection than the ones from which they were 
gathered. This process must be repeated for several years and a variety 
ran probably be obtained which will be almost immune to rust. This may 
seem at first thought almost a fruitless attempt, but in view of the fact 
that millions of dollars are lost annually by this destructive fungus a few 
years might serve to eradicate the evil to an enormous extent. 

SMITS. 

Ki the loss caused annually to cereals by smuts is not so great as in 
! of rust, the damage sustained is of great importance and should 
led carefully by every farmer raising grain. The losses annually 
te into the millions. </seg>

HOME IHSKASES OF WHEAT. 

121 

Ptwo kinds of smuts which are common upon wheat. One 
e loose smut, Vstilago tritici, and the other the stinking smut. 
ins. The latter is named from its very characteristic odor. 
these two diseases hare upon the host are essentially alike, 
ir life history they differ slightly. 

Life History. — The round of life is much more simple than that of 
rusts. Smuts gain their hold upon the host plant when it is very young. 
The fungus develops from a spore which gains entrance when the grain 
of wheat is sprouting. The spore of the smut is very minute and In the 
case of Vstilago tritici. a thread is developed which becomes septate. 
From each of these septa a sporidum is formed, which, upon germination, 
enters the soft delicate tissue of the host plant. The mycelial threads follow 
the soft parts of the host as it grows, ramifying through the cells and 
feeding upon the substance of the plant. When the stalk of wheat heads 
out and forms seeds, the threads of the fungus are already in it and likewise 
fruit and turn the head black. This black substance is the little 
spores (seeds) of the fungus. 

The spores of Tilletia firtans produce some what different conidia from 
the loose smut, but their method of attacking the host is practically the 
same, the spore first germinates and forms a promycellum. The conidia 
grow from this in sort of a whorl. They are threadlike and later unite 
in pairs, by cross septum. The mycelial threads enter the tissue of the 
young wheat plant just the same as the loose smut, and live and follow 
its growth up until it matures. Stinking smut is less easily recognised 
than loose smut. It affects nothing but the grain of the wheat and can 
hardly be recognized without squeezing the kernel. It has a very characteristic 
odor. 

Ke smut blackens practically the whole head and destroys nearly if 
the grains of the ear. Wheat which is affected by smut grows 
that it otherwise would an 1 begins maturing earlier. The leaves 
ker green and the head stands erect instead of drooping down as a 
' stalk would do. 

PREVENTIVKS. 

I its are by no means as destructive as rusts nor as difficult to handle. 
m of the fact that the disease does not spread from one plant to anmakes 
it comparatively easy to destroy. The only possible way in 
the fungus can gain entrance into the host is just when the wheat 
nates. In order that this could be possible the smut spores must 
the grain of the wheat very near the end where the sprout comes 
Any method which would destroy the smut spore without damaging 
heat would be a successful remedy. 

Kie one may now ask why their field which one year was free from 
was badly affected the following season. This is simple enough and 
lave occurred in several ways. The threshing machine may have 
su a job wnere the grain was badly contaminated with smut and by 
Dg grain through it, much of it would be sprinkled over by the </seg>

tThis is probably the most common way of Infecting grain which 
?n free from smut. Again stock may be fed upon straw from 
1 grain and the manure hauled upon the field. Grain is often inby 
running through fan mills in which there has been smutty 
These are but a few of the sources of infection but serve to 
te. 

Ba welt known fact that smut reduces the yield considerably, but 
has other objectionable leatures. Bread made from smutted wheat 
holesome and the flour less valuable. Diseases have been known 
8 their origin from the smut in the flour. 

Only a few remedies can be suggested whim have proved the most 
¦uccessful. The hot water method is a very simple and inexpensive one 
anu has met with fairly good success. In this treatment the grain is 
plunged in hot water at about 130 degrees for about five minutes. The 
grain must be kept moving and then laid out to dry. If it is desired to 
sow soon after plunging, more grain must be put on as it will swell up 
some. Some of the kernels will also be destroyed by the heat. One chief 
difficulty has been to get an application that would destroy the spores and 
at the same time cause no damage to the grain. Farmers would do wett 
to sow a patch for the purpose of getting rid of the smut regardless of 
the yield. The following year they could sow good seed and more than 
make up for the loss in yield the year before. 

Another method often used, is a solution made of copper sulphate. Six 
pounds of copper sulphate dissolved in enough water to wet a ton of 
wheat immersed for six or seven minutes has been found successful. If 
the solution was made stronger some of the wheat would be destroyed, 
and if weaker some of the spores would remain. 

WHEAT SCAB 

Eis fungus. Fusarium roteum. attacks only the heads of the wheat and 
irs as a yellowish and sometimes a pinkish covering over the heads, 
cks the glumes together. This disease does not make its appearance 
the grain begins to ripen. Its attack causes premature ripening, 
kernels are shriveled up and very light. Stalks affected by scab can 
¦en over the field as yellow heads. 

The scab on wheat is very different from that seen on other plants. 
There is nothing about its character that suggests scab. The life history 
of this fungus is imperfectly known. Very little has been done with it and 
as to how it passes through the winter months is not well understood. 
It spreads the mycelial threads over the glumes and forms spores from a 
network of branches known as hyphae. Each of these crescent shaped 
spores is three to five septate. These cells may drop off separately and 
each has the power of germinating and forming new mycelial threads 
which can produce the fungus again. 

The damage caused by scab is never very great. Some fields have been 
known to have ten per cent of the heads affected, but usually it falls con- </seg>

siderably below this. It has been found that some varieties of wheat are 
more susceptible to Fumrium roseum than others. Rainy weather about 
the time of heading and damp low ground is more apt to cause scab. 

The remedies, as yet, are practically none. In view of the fact that some 
varieties are more susceptible than others, the rejection of such would 
suggest itself as one worthy of consideration. If the crop of one year has 
been damaged by scab, the stubble should be burned before another crop 
is sown. This will destroy all of the spores left on the ground and undoubtedly 
will reduce the damage the following season.

le some damage to many of the cereals in Italy.

POWDERY MILDEW 

This fungus, Erysiphe graminit, while not commonly damaging, has 
been known to cause considerable destruction to cereals. It grows as a 
wnite powdery substance on the upper surface of the leaf. It reproduces 
by means of conidia which are formed from the mycelial threads. The 
conidia are in the form of chains. The end spore breaks off first. Bach 
has the power of reproducing new mycelial threads. When unfavorable 
conditions arise, as from lack of moisture or insufficient heat, perithecia 
b formed. These are dark spherical bodies which contain asci with 
four to eight spores each. The following spring these germinate

SOME CORN DISEASES. 

BY R. E. SMITH. LINCOLN. 

Kmo.n Smut.— Caused by a parasitic fungus, Ustilago zeae.— Usually 
smut is mentioned, reference is bad to the masses of fine black 
r or smut boils which appear on different parts of the corn, stalk, 
leaves and ear. In size these masses vary from the merest pustule to the 
size of a man's head.' These masses are the spores of the fungus, corresponding 
to the seed of higher plants, in that they propagate the smut. The 
fungus itself consists of microscopic threads which run through the tissues 

Brtion. — Contrary to the belief popularly held even as late as 1895. 
I this respect different from the smuts of wheat, oats and other 
i, the corn plant is not infected through the seedling, either by smut 
planted with the seed or by its being in the soil. 

The spores germinate on the ground at any time after maturity, i. e., 
with proper warmth moisture and food material. They produce minute 
colorless secondary spores or conidia. It is by means of these that the 
corn plant is Infected. These conidia are blown about and infect the host 
wherever the tissue is still tender, that is to say, in a rapidly growing 
condition. When a conidium falls on such a place it sends a slender 
mycelium through the epidermal tissues of the corn, and soon a small 
white crinkly patch appears on lae surface. This patch gradually puffs 
out, forming a shiny, whitish, watery boil which later turns to dark green 
and finally to black. In the meantime it increases in size and cracks open, 
exposing myriads of microscopic black spores held in a fibrous network. 

Time of Infection. — Smut may appear on corn at any age from the time 
it is six inches high to maturity. Most of the smut however appears after 
the plant is a month old, i. e., from three feet high and upwards. 

When the stalk begins to appear, surrounded by sheaths, a very characteristic 
point of attack is the junction of the leaf and the sheath : the 
smut pustule splitting the sheath and growing on the outside. Later, smut 
may appear upon the different parts of the. plant as it matures, nodes, tassel, 
ears, etc. It is to be noted, however, that the result of infection is 
entirely local, the fungus not spreading from one part of the host to 

Damage to the Crop. — On an average not over 5 per cent of corn is 
smutted. Smutted corn bears one-third less corn than clean corn. It 
is also found that smutted corn bears the same amount of stalk as clean 
corn. Further, the smut is found to contain a very large per cent of 
protend matter. This would lead to the conclusion that the fungus extracts 
the ear-forming material from the sap, and the ultimate loss In corn is 
the same whether or not the ear is itself smutted. 

Remedy.— The only practical remedy for smut is negative. Do not </seg>


            <seg id="p125">
125 

leave smutted material on the field! It would be well to cut the smut 
boils off before they become mature, at any rate at harvest time gather 
up all the smut and burn it. This is entirely practicable as Dr. Beany 
says, "A fairly active boy with a gunny sack, at ten cents an acre, will 
save the farmer much in the end." 

I Results of Cultures.— Spores are quite large, 8.12 m., usually spherical, 
ough sometimes variously shaped. They are brownish black in color. 
The surface of the spore is thickly covered with short blunt spines. The 
spores germinate both in fresh and distilled water; somewhat more 
readily in nutrient solutions, as corn-agar. bouillon, agar-agar. Germination 
occurs in from twenty-four to thirty-eight hours. A slender thre« 
septate promycelium is sent out, which grows to considerable length. 
Later the promycelium becomes branched at the base. Sporidia are 
formed both terminally and laterally. In the air conidia are more abundantly 
produced in chains, sometimes branched, which remain attached 
to the spore, or the promycelium becomes detached near the base and continues 
development. 

Smut on Sobghum and Broom Corn (Cintractia-vulgarit) . — A very characteristic 
peculiarity of this smut is its action on the flower-forming parts 
producing small smutted kernels. The plant tissues form a columella 
about which the smut forms. The plant infects by means of conidia. 
which send their infection threads into the growing seed before the plant 
appears above ground. The fungus follows the upward growth of the 
plant and shows no sign of its presence until the flowers begin to be 
formed, when the seed-like kernels are formed. This seems to be a case 
of a beneficial smut; for while the cane stalk must nourish the fungus, 
the fungus in turn prevents the formation of flowers and increases the 
sugar content from one and a half to two per cent. 

Soborum Head Smut (Ustillago reiliana). — Rare. Found also on 
dent corn. This smut appears in the ears and tassels as a rough, coarse 
granular mass. The ear when attacked is not distorted, the smut being 
concealed by the husks. This smut is much worse than the common 
smut, in that when a plant is attacked the stalk is reduced from 50 to 
70 per cent and practically no corn at all is produced. 

Maize Rust (Puccinia sorghi). — Very similar to Pucdnia gramini*. 
Not found very abundantly in any one locality. Reaches its maximum 
abundance in October, and affects mainly late crops. 

tuccinia graminit appears in July and August, two and a half to three 
months earlier. </seg>

COMMON IUKKASKS OF THE POTATO. 

BY SARAH L. UOUBT, rMVEBHITY IXACE. 

Since potatoes are a very important crop in America, anything whk-h 
materially decreases it is worthy of serious attention and study. 

I. Potato Scab (Oospora scabies). — This is the commonest and most 
widely known of all the diseases of the potato and so deserves consideration 
first. The real cause was not discovered until very recently (1890) 
and so, of course, there were many attempts to explain the disease without 
proper investigation. Most of these explained it as due to inorganic 
cause*. For instance, excessive moisture was thought to account for the 
tubers becoming scabbed, by affecting the lenticels, which are present upon 
normal tubers, and thus produce an abnormal growth of corky tissue. 
Mechanical irritation from foreign substances in the soil produces abnormal 
growth of these lenticels and slow decay follows — was thought to be 
another explanation of scab. The chemical action of lime or oxide of iron 
waa thought to be another explanation. 

Kization by barnyard manure has been definitely observed to in 
the prevalence of the disease, which was explained by the supposiit 
It may furnish conditions favorable for the action of one or 
! the causes already given. 

The fact that a clean crop is sometimes secured when barnyard manure 
is used as a fertilizer seems to show that this alone will not scab potatoes, 
and the fact that scab often occurs when the potatoes are in light dry land 
entirely free from extraneous matter shows that some of these supposed 
causes is in itself sufficient to explain the disease. The most that can be 
¦aid is that they furnish conditions favoring its prevalence. 

Worms, myriapods and mites are often found tn the deeper scab furrows, 
but careful observation shows that they are not the cause of them. 

In 1890, Thaxter, who discovered the real cause, and other students of 
the disease, made the following observations as to the appearance of 'he 
fungus and its growth upon the tubers: It appears early, when the potatoes 
are no larger than hazelnuts, as small reddish patches upon the surface 
of the skin. There it continues to grow, the spots come together, 
coalesce, and become rough and brown in color. In extreme cases they 
envelop the whole potato. As the spots enlarge, they do so at the expense 
of the tissue of the potato beneath, which passes into a spongy brown 
substance filling the cavity of the scabbed spot. This change in the tissue 
is not truly a putrefactive one, but a gradual loss of life in the cells of a 
well defined area, followed by a very slow decomposition. Beneath the 
spots the tissue remains unaffected. 

A microscopic examination of scab spots of different ages discloses the 
fact that they are produced by the outer cells of the corky layer of the 
</seg>
            <seg id="p127">
127 


tin dying and separating to form the loose brown dead matter which 
ntributes so much to the rough appearance of the diseased tubers. 

As the outer cells of the skin die at the scabbed spots, new ones are 
formed within, at the expense of the other tissues immediately beneath. 
Thus, the scab eats its way deeper and deeper into the tubers. 

The growth of the fungus continues until the crop is harvested when 
it is found to cease growing with the potato. Then the disease does not 
spread while the potatoes are stored. 

tThaxter found that the threads of the fungus could be secured for study 
ly with great difficulty in July or August, for with very little handling 
ey broke up into very minute fragments which appear like bacteria. 

Prevention. — The present mode consists in planting "seed" potatoes 
which have been treated with corrosive sublimate solution. Then, since 
infection seems to take place from the soil also, care must be taken about 
having the ground free from rubbish and organic matter which harbor the 
fungus or its spores. The crop should not immediately follow a crop of 
sugar-beets, especially if scabby, for the same organism scabs both crops. 

The corrosive sublimate solution is prepared by dissolving two and onefourth 
ounces of the corrosive sublimate in about two gallons of hot 
water, and after ten to twelve hours add thirteen gallons more of water. 
The potatoes are immersed in the solution for one and one-half hours, 
spread out to dry, cut and planted. All treated tubers should be planted, 
for the above solution is very poisonous. 

It. Late Blight or Potato Rot (Phytophthora infestans). — This is the 
dreaded potato disease which caused the famine in Ireland in 1845. It 
originated in South America and was brought here about 1840. The 
leaves, stems, and tubers are all affected, and since it spreads very rapidly 
entire fields are often ruined by it. The tubers are decayed. 

This fungus thrives only in very moist, cool climates and does not 
occur in the western states, since it requires a temperature between 72° 
to 74° P., and is probably not found at all where the mean temperature is 
above 77° F., according to Galloway of the Department of Agriculture. 

III. Early Blight (Alternaria solani). — This is often mistaken for the 
late Blight, but is entirely distinct from it. It attacks the leaves and sometimes 
tne stems, but never the tubers. The disease progresses slowly, 
scorched-looking spots on the leaves show its first appearance. These 
gradually become larger, coalesce, and in three weeks or a month all the 
leaves succumb. The stems remain green for some time, but finally die 
for want of nourishment. Other authorities claim that the stem of the 
plants is attacked close to the ground first. The leaves curl and finally (he 
stem collapses. The entire plant is killed and the growth of the tubers 
stops when they are about the size of walnuts. Mere drying up of the 
leaves, due to the dry climate, has also been confused with this disease. 
This can readily be told from the disease though, for spots caused by the 
fungus turn black with concentric ridges around them. This is a very </seg>

ture for several years As much as one-half of the crop has been ruined 
in parts of the country. 

Prevention. — Bordeaux mixture, full strength, applied five or six times 
at intervals of ten days, is an effective remedy. The plants should be 
sprayed first when they are four to six inches high. Six pounds of copper 
sulphate and four pounds of quick lime are thoroughly mixed together 
in twenty-two gallons of water. 

IV. Bacterial Rot (Bacillus solenoceorium) . — These diseases, said to 
be caused by bacteria, seem to be poorly worked out, being variously described 
and named and considerably confused. The one given above has 
bean pretty clearly worked out and is called the Brown Disease. It causes 
sudden wilting of the foliage. The stems become brown internally and 
shrivel. The bacillus passes down through the stems into the tubers and 
brown-rots them from within. This disease is said to spread by means 
of the potato beetle which carries it to healthy plants. Occurs in the 
south; in Nebraska doubtfully. 

Prevention. — Spraying to kill the beetles is given as a preventive. 

V. Stem Rot, Black Ring. Collar Rot (Rhizoctonia solani). — This disease 
seems to be very common in Germany and within a few years has 
been reported in this country, being reported in New York, Iowa and 
California. Since the fungus is both parasitic and saprophytlc, it may 
to serious to the crop. It occurs also on beets, carrots, alfalfa, red clover, 
onions, turnips, peas, celery, lettuce, beans, cabbage, blackberries and rasp- 

The fungus develops very rapidly in heavy soils which are poorly 
drained, and the spores, if not the active parts of the organism, remain 
In the soil. 

The underground stems of the potato are affected first, either killed or 
dwarfed. Apparently the fungus begins its growth in the tubers and grows 
with them. Badly affected plants may wilt suddenly and soon dry up and 
die. The potatoes are often stunted so they remain small. Aerial potatoes

patches resembling small clods of dirt are produced upon the tubers.

often reach the size of a centimetre or more across. They are partially 
hollow and are light brown in color. The general opinion among botanists

growth and afterward fungi enter and cause the hardening and browning 
of the tissue.

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF SOME OF THE DISEASKS 
OF SUGAR BEETS IN NEBRASKA. 

BT FRANK G. BBtNER, HASTINGS, NEB. 

Probably owing to the abundance of wet weather during the latter part 
of last summer (1902) the sugar-beet suffered considerably from fungus 
and bacterial parasites. While dry weather is most favorable for the 
spreading of the spores, since when dry they float about in the air and are 
carried from one field to another and scattered over the same field, yet 
moisture is indispensable to their germination and growth. Rains not 
too infrequent, or at least heavy dews, to moisten the surface of the leaf 
or the bases of the leaves at the crown, where the fungus gains entrance 
to the root, is necessary, for in this moisture the spore germinates and 
then sends its threads down into the leaf through the breathing pores — 
stomata — or directly into the cell itself or down between the cells at the 
base of the leaves into the crown of the beet and from this into the whole 
root. It almost goes without saying: a wet season is a season of plant 

One of the most common of the beet's enemies during the last year was 

Leaf Spot (Cercospora beticola). — In various sections of the state this 
was reported very troublesome, especially true was this at Ames, Hebron, 
Hastings, Grand Island, Roca. and the Agricultural Experiment Station at 
the University farm east of Lincoln. At this place I am told there were 
but few plants in a several acre patch that escaped entirely. 

R»r'», speaking of the disease in 1899, says it is one of very wide 
ition both in this country and in Europe, and occurs everywhere 
beets are grown, if only to a limited extent. Although found also 
the past year on the red variety of garden beet, my questions have 
failed to give me information of a single instance where much damage 
has been done, even where these have been cultivated in rows, side by side, 
with the sugar variety, as was reported to me from Hebron and in which 
e" so the sugar-beets suffered very severely from leaf spot. This can 
lined as being due, perhaps, to a greater resistance which the red 
ers to the fungus's intrusions. 

Ename leaf spot denotes the appearance of the disease. I have not 
t in the younger stages, but Duggar 1 says, "It begins as small brown 
with a reddish-purple margin; these spots being scattered irregularly 
over the leaf." Sometimes they cover the entire leaf surface, there 
being scarcely a particle of normal leaf tissue left between them. This 
was the case, I am told, at the State Farm with very many of the plants 
last summer (1902), and some dead leaves clinging to stored beets which 
I picked up during the winter indicated as much. 

•Figures refer to bibliography at the end of this article. </seg>

            <seg id="p131">

As the disease progresses, the spots become ashen gray at the centres, 
with the margins as before, and they may become so numerous as to cover 
a large portion of the surface of the leaf before any general discoloration 
whatever is evident. Later the blades show a parched appearance, begin 
to blacken gradually from the tip of the leaf towards the stalk, and finally 
the whole leaf is black and crisp. As soon as the blades present the 
parched and dry appearance they stand more nearly upright in the crown 
and have a characteristic curled or rolled appearance. The outer earlier 
leaves are attacked first, and as these leaf-stalks wilt they are shed. To 
supply this deficiency new leaves arise from the bud or centre, the result 
of which is the elongated crown so characteristic of sugar-beets which 
have suffered from leaf spot. It is observed that where this elongation is 
marked the roots are abnormally small, much of the energy of the plant 
evidently being directed towards saving itself. In looking over a large 
number of beets in the cellars at the State Farm and those grown on a 
four-acre patch at Hebron this difference in the size of the roots of affected 
and non-affected plants was very prominent, and certainly reduced the 
sugar-content very materially, since this depends directly on the size of 
the root, other things being equal. 

Sorauer says that leaf spot is not confined only to the leaves, but to the 
peduncles, flowers, seed-pods and seeds themselves, and therefore he 
thinks there is great likelihood of the disease being transmitted through 
the seed so as to be in readiness for an attack on the young seedling when 
it arises. Professor Bessey doubts this. 

Bvon Thueman' thinks, "without doubt the fungus causing spot dissugar-beets 
is the most injurious of its fungus enemies." 

»3 occur on both upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. It is worse 
lower parts of a field, and more injurious on heavy than on loose 
soils. 

A hand lens showed the tissue of the affected leaf shrunken and the 
border of the spot to be elevated. The threads of the fungus too can easily 
be seen. The threads (hyphse) are brown in color and pass through the 
stomata. On these threads — conidiophores, or spore-bearing branches — 
the spores are formed, which are long, very narrow, spindle-shaped bodies. 

P&gt;n Thueman and Sorauer say that the conidiophores break through 
epidermis and do not come out through the stomata, while Pammel' 
observed both methods of coming to the air. 

e spore-bearing threads are found in clusters — fasciculated — rarely 
on the leaf, and from these clusters numberless spores are pinched 
be scattered by the wind from plant to plant over the field. The 
damage, or direct way in which this disease injures the sugar crop 
is by reducing the active leaf area of the plant. Since this leaf in the 
presence of sunlight assimilates carbonic acid gas, converting into starch 
and finally into sugar, anything which tends to reduce the leaf area will 
reduce the sugar-content to just that extent. 

But how is the disease carried over from year to year? It was observed </seg>

that Sorauer thinks It is transmitted by the seed. Pammel' says the 
spores pass into the soil with the fallen leaves, and thus the disease is 
capable of infecting young beet leaves the following spring; but from a 
number of very badly affected leaves which I gathered early in the winter 
I was unable to produce the disease on living beet leaves, in the greenhouse, 
by the most careful inoculations, nor was I able to grow the fungus 
on any of the standard culture media by inoculations from the diseased 
areas. My results, however, were not conclusive. This indicates the small 
vitality of the spores, which probably survive only where numbers of 

leaves are collected in bunches. 

Since spots ocur on both sides of the leaves, a remedy would be difficult 

to suggest, and would necessarily have to be preventive largely, more than 

ttive. Hence, when taken in the earlier stages of the disease and 
ikied over the field freely, the Bordeaux mixture has been found to 

have some remedial value. This consists of, 

Copper sulphate (blue vitriol) 6 lbs. 

Fresh stone lime (unslaked) 4 lbs. 

Water 50 gals. 

Another leaf trouble of the beets, but not nearly so common as the above 

nor as destructive, is 

White Rust (Cystopus blitii). — I know nothing of the disease, nor has 

inquiry from the beet raisers of the state brought any information of its 
presence in Nebraska. Pammer says this fungus was called to his attention 
by one of his students as occurring on sugar beets, but whether to any 
great extent or generally he was unable to say. Other authors do not 
mention it, so it cannot be virulent. When present, white pustules may be 

seen on both sides of the leaf. 

Beet Scab (Oospora scabies). — Rough, warty, excrescences very often 

appear on the beet root, such as are commonly seen on the tuber of the 
potato. In texture these patches are corky and spongy. The same fungus 
causes the disease in both cases. It is very common in Nebraska and 

Tubeuff reports it as prevalent in Europe. 

This is a local disease, i. e., it does not injure, so far as known, any 

Eer part of the plant than the area affected. It is subcortical only 
en the warty areas are very large. Bolly* thinks the scab must be 
ked upon as an abnormal development of corky tissue, stimulated to 
excessive growth by the presence of the fungus. For a long time this 
Eiess of surface was thought to be caused by some mechanical injury, 
&gt;lly and afterwards Arthur, independently, traced this excrescence 
fungus Oospora scabies, and found the one causing potato scab 

to be identical with the one causing a similar disease on the beet. 
A large number of letters of inquiry from farmers in Minnesota and 

El showed that in every case where beet scab was found to exist 
potatoes had been grown on the ground the previous year, indithat 
the fungus lived in the soil over winter and affected the tubers 

or roots the following year. This disease is very common in Nebraska. </seg>

DISEASES OF ST'GAB SKITS. 

Little is known of the character of the fungus. In nutrient agar It produces 
a minute mouldy growth. It is rod-like, very much resembling bac- 

Economieally, beet scab undoubtedly reduces the sugar-content to the 
extent of the scabby area, at least, and how much farther is not known. 
It certainly does injure their appearance, and hence reduces their market 

Here again the remedy is negative: Do not grow sugar-beets on soil 
which has produced scabby potatoes. This is the only remedy known. 

Leaf Rot, sometimes called Root Rot (Phyllosticta tabifloa). — This is a 
disease little known and, as far as I have been able to investigate, has not 
been studied in this country. I have found no paper or bulletin treating 
of it. Professor Bessey a number of years ago had it brought to his notice 
in Nebraska, but went no further with it. In Tubeuff and Smith's text the 
disease called "Heart Rot" is described as being due to this fungus, but 
Prillieux says that Phyllosticta is probably a conldial form of Sphsrella. 
As occurring in Europe, the host symptoms are a withering of the leaves, 
followed by the appearance of whitish spots on the beet root, which soon 
fill up with withered tissue and the fungus threads — mycelium. It occurs 
first as a leaf disease, blackening and rotting them, and from these runs 
down into the root, killing it. Mr. Hedgecock, a fellow in the University of 
Nebraska, found some Phyllosticta on beets in the western part of the state 
in 1901. Especially were the mother beets affected. The ten-acre patch 
on which this was found was covered with lime and cinders, and the next 
season no Phyllosticta rot was found. 

Root Rot (Rhizoctonia) . — This is a common disease of Europe and 
America, occurring most frequently in sour damp soils after a continuance 
of wet weather. It is the damping-off fungus so common to species 
of carnations, lettuce, carrots, radishes, cabbages, asparagus, pine, etc. 
It was first observed by J. C. Arthur in Indiana, who described it as a 
"damping off," causing a blackening of stem, crown, and root below 
ground; as he thought, due to any number of species of fungi. Arthur 
found no fruit, so he supposed the spores had been planted with the Nad 
and followed the rows. This fungus caused a total loss, the beets dying 
shortly after being affected. In 1891, Pammel* described the disease m 
due to a sterile fungus which had caused so much loss to sugar-beet growers 
in Europe and had been named by Kuhn Rhizoctonia beta. The same 
fungus was observed by Atkinson* in 1892, to cause, to quite an extent, 
the damping off of cotton in Alabama. 

Ethe beet, the infection starts at the leaf bases, where the moisture 
icts from rain or dew. These leaf bases are seen to blacken, when 
leaves fall and wither. After a time the leaves turn brown, and th« 
rn mycelium — threads — may be seen under the surface of the stem 
extending to the outside through cracks, which have been formed in 
leaf tissue. 

Gradually the fungus works its way down into the crown and root, these </seg>

            <seg id="p134">
134 

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

also becoming black and cracked. Infesting these decayed parts and cracks 
a little later, the brown mycelium may be observed as in the leaf bases 
described above. Sometimes the whole root decays and the plant succumbs. 
More often, however, there is not this general decay, but during 
the earlier stages of the disease* brown spots may be seen on the surface 
of the root, which speedily enlarge, forming large brown areas. These 
extend until often the whole upper area is cracked and decayed, or shows 
a brown withered appearance. Pammel 1 thinks the decay no doubt due to 
bacteria, which have followed the inroads of the fungus. If the weather 
is cold or dry, the disease may stop with this partial decay, and sometimes 
one-half the beets of the field may be found partly rotted at the harvesting 
in the fall. Pammel says that in few cases has he found the beets entirely 
destroyed. More commonly the crown alone is rotted or a fissure 
is rotted in the side to which the soil clings in harvesting. 

A cross-section of the root shows a blackening of the tissue under the 
superficial fungus growth, which may be due to a ferment which the 
fungus throws out. Exposing these surfaces in a moist chamber for a few 
days, a pale mycelium grows out which gradually turns to a light brown. 

Microscopical examination of the diseased tissue shows branched, nearly 
colorless, threads which ramify between the cells and intercellular spaces, 
and frequently the threads are found in the cell cavity itself. 

The branching* is very characteristic, being irregular and dichotymous, 
the young branches being inclined to the direction of growth of the parent 
thread at a very acute angle. The young branch is narrower, too, and restricted 
where it unites with the parent branch, and a septum is Invariably 
formed a few microns from the point of union. The young hypb.se are 
strongly vaculated, but later become uniformly granular and more deeply 
colored. On the beet they show a sporadochia-like growth frequently but 
more commonly a felt-like mass covers the surface. 

No conidia or other fruit are formed. Instead the hyphae break up into 
hyphal lengths, of a single cell or composed of several cells. These answer 
the purpose of fruit and germinate after a few hours, under favorable 
conditions. A marked peculiarity is observed in the germination, in that 
the germ tube always passes out through the septum which separates one 
cell from another, and frequently where a hyphal length is composed of 
two or more cells the germ tube passes through one or more of these cells, 
in which case the cell thus penetrated seems to contain no protoplasm, 
probably being absorbed by the advancing bud. 

Bar* says that the fungus can easily be grown on acidulated agar 
50 per cent lactic acid to a test tube of media, as ordinarily filled 
ure use), bean pods or sterilized beet. On the two latter it grows 
turiantly. 

If portions of an affected beet or pure cultures be placed on the basis 
of the leaves when moist the blackening effect can easily be secured. 

Moist conditions are essential for the spread of the disease; hence it is 
more frequent on low than on high ground, and a crop on soggy, clayey </seg>

DISEASES OF SUGAR BEETS. 

soil is more subject to the disease than one on sandy soil or loam. The 
observation that an acid medium was essential to the growth of the fungus 
artificially suggested to Duggar to test the soil on which the plants grew, 
and this too he found slightly acid as he had anticipated. It was observed 
also that areas of the field upon which ashes had been strewn were 
S attacked. This led to the experiment of scattering from sixty to 
ity bushels of air-slaked lime per acre over an affected field, with the 
t of stopping the spread of the disease. Three applications, howver, 
necessary to accomplish this result, but beets already diseased were 
lided in the least. 

Professor Lyon noticed the disease at the University Farm east of Lincoln 
both in 1901 and 1902, and spoke of it as being seen on very many 
fields over the state during both seasons. In experimenting with a field at 
Ames, Neb., Professor Lyon' says: "All diseased matter was carefully 
removed from the field. The lime was then liberally scattered on the remaining 
plants and around the affected areas. Later examinations showed 
hat the limeing was quite effective in stopping the spread of the disease, 
a some cases even curing slightly affected plants, while on the untreated 
portion of the field, the disease continued to spread for sometime. A 
later experiment showed that the limeing had no apparent affect where 
the diseased matter was not first removed. • • • The lime although 
quite fresh semed to have no injurious effect upon the green foliage which 
was in many cases completely covered." 

t Professor Lyon and Duggar's experiments and obseratiovns seem 
cate, there fore, the best remedy to be (1) careful collection and 
tl of all diseased material from the field, and (2) then a liberal 
lion of some alkali, lime, perhaps since it is the cheapest. Aa 
above, Duggar suggests 60 to 70 bushels of air slaked lime per acre. 

Ratodes. — Nematodes, commonly known as vinegar eels, are fref 
found in diseased beets, but whether these penetrate the living 
and by their presence and action cause a disintegration and decaythe 
beet substance, or whether they follow some other disease, — are 
;r-product, — is not Known, so far as I am able to find. It is a well 
fact that nematodes do thrive normally in decaying media, and 
they have been found frequently in the interior of beets affected by 
Rhizoctonicf. Hedgecock and Metcalf 1 found them in abundance in decayed 
beets which had been destroyed by bacteria. So whether nematodes really 
do cause sugar-beets to decay or in any way affect them, lessening their 
growth, or sugar-content is still a mooted question. Professor Metcalf 
found that he could isolate the nematodes by bacterial culture methods, 
and when the isolated nematode was placed in a Petri dish containing 
agar, and thus permitted to wriggle here and there tfirough the agar 
medium, a streak of bacteria followed him, indictating that the bacteria 
clung to his sides and were rubbed off as he pushed his way forward. 
This making of the nematodes bacteria carries very materially complicates 
and magnifies the baneful effects of these organisms. More, however, must 
be known of them to warrant a definite statement of their exact action. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE. 

Soft Rot (Bacterium teutlium) Metcalf and Hedgecock. — In 1901, Mr. 
Hedgecock 1 while engaged in work on plant disease in the University of 
Nebraska, had called to his attention a disease of the sugar-beet producing 
a wet rot. Later, in 1902, with the co-operation of Professor Metcalf, who 
was a trained bacteriologist, the disease was traced to a bacterial origin. 
On further inquiry, the soft rot was found to be quite prevalent throughout 
the state, both during 1901 and 1902, and to some extent in Arizona and 
Colorado. It was found that the bacteria would not attack any but 
relatively mature beets. In no case would inoculations on a young seedling 
produce the disease, nor was the disease observed on young beets in 
the field. The first appearance of the disease* is noted by a rotting of the 
root at the tip. This then gradually works itself up until the entire beet 
is rotted, the leaves seeming, however, to indicate no disturbance until 
almost the entire root is destroyed, when they suddenly collapse and turn 
black. In the earlier stages cavities are noticed at the tip where the rotting 
occurs. These cavities are filled with a viscid translucent substance. 
The bacteria are not found in the fibrovascular bundles but in the softer 
parenchymous tissue lying between these, hence the formation of the 
cavities. Ultimately all the parenchymous tissue of the root and leaf 
alike is destroyed, the beet being one soft viscid mass of decay. 

The bacteria are of a slimy nature, and no difficulty is found in isolating 
them by the common agar plate method, but since the rot begins at the 
tip and goes upward, probably following the direction of the water, it was 
a question for a time with Professor Metcalf how to make inoculations. 
This was accomplished by means of tubes reaching down to the tip and 
sides of the root and through these tubes a portion of decayed material 
containing the bacteria could easily be brought in contact with an abrasion 
which had been artificially produced for the purpose. Newly inoculated 
beets showed no discoloration, nor did any appear in young beets, as was 
said before. The first change noted in a section was a change in color 
toward a yellow, shading into a clay color or gray. Gradually these colors 
darken until all becomes a black. This peculiarity, however, is observed. 
that a beet may be half rotten without any apparent alteration in color. 

Under the microscope the parenchymous tissue of a badly affected beet Is 
seen to have gone down entirely, indicating a complete disintegration and 
destruction of the living substance. The advance of the organism is observed 
to take place through the tissue first killed by the presence of some 
bacterial product, probably an enzym. 

Bacterium teutlium* is a short bacillus or rod form, from 1.5 to 3 
microns in length and about 0.8 microns in width. In a solid culture 
medium chains are formed, while in a liquid medium the rods are free. 
In neither case is there any motion. This is an entirely new disease; 
neither the organism nor the infection having been described in this country 
or in Europe before Hedgecock and Metcalf observed it. No remedy as 
yet has been suggested.

centage of sugar found In some sugar-beets was associated with a peculiar 
characteristic of the affected beets, by Arthur of the Indiana Agricultural 
Experiment Station. A microscopic test revealed the presence of bacteria 
throughout all parts of the root and left no doubt that the root was not 
In a normal state of health. The bacteria 1 * were easily isolated, and found 
to be of an arthrosporous form, each cell being about two times as long 
as broad. Quite an active movement, too, was noted when the bacteria 
were grown in a rich nutrient media. 

Arthur believes the disease not to be at all rare in Indiana, judging from 
obesrrations which he made. The disease was found among all the beets 
sent in for examination during the year, from the various parts of the 
state. Of those sent in 12 per cent were found affected, and while he had 
no exact data from those grown at the station, he had every reason to 
believe that the per cent would have run up higher, since the better class 
of beets are selected in sending to the station for analysis. This disease 
was found also by Hedgecock and Metcalf in Nebraska. 

S disease tends to reduce the sugar-content very decidedly, and this 
it first leads to the recognition of its presence. To the unpracticed 
tere is no other mark which is apparent. Examining three lots, 
r found the sugar-content among the first to be 13.3 per cent for good 
and 11.9 per cent for diseased ones; in the second lot, 10.5 per cent 
for good ones and 7 per cent for bad beets; and for the third lot, which Arthur 
thinks is the most reasonably accurate, 10.3 per cent for good and S.7 
per cent for diseased beets respectively. It is seen that the sugar lots la 
nearly one-half, which would not make the beets worth harvesting for 
sugar purposes in Nebraska and thus would prove a total loss economically. 


Rarely or never does the bacterium break down the tissue or kill the 
plant. Except the leaves there are no external marks. The diseased and 
healthy roots cannot be distinguished by any external characteristics. The 
leaves, however, appear puffed out between the veins instead of flat as in 
the healthy beet leaf, and later in the season they are paler and smaller, 
and the outer ones fall off earlier than with normal plants. 

A cross-section reveals a greater importance of the fibres constituting 
the concentric rings, and dark spots become evident on exposure to air, 
unlike those in normal beets. A diseased root, too, is rather softer, 
tougher, and of a yellowish white color, and weighs lees than a healthy 

Examining this tissue under the microscope bacteria are found in every 
cell in great numbers, especially is this true of the large loose-celled tissue 
lying between the fibrous tissues of the root and in the similar tissue in 
the veins and midrib of the leaf. Bacteria are found attached to the protoplasm, 
and also in the cell sap. Rod-like in form and colorless, they are 
usually isolated, but sometimes are found in pairs. A gelatin medium becomes 
alkaline, whether acid or neutral to begin with, when the bacteria 
are grown in it for a few days. They also posess the power of liquefying </seg>

Great numbers of bacteria of the kind described were found on slices of 
many of the beets from the State Farm, when sectioned with sterilised 
methods, and placed in a sterilized Petri dish. Although the whole exterior 
of the slice became covered with a slimy liquid, the interior remained 
unrotted for weeks. 

I inoculated several plants in the greenhouse with the bacteria, both 
through the crown and through the soil about the roots, but the growth 
has not been sufficient yet to warrant me in pulling and slicing the root 
for evidenece of bacteria. Owing, then, to the imperfect state of our 
knowledge of the disease, no remedy as yet can be suggested.

ing is the best ever made by the Hatcheries for a corresponding period 

with the same amount of expenditure. 

BLACK BASS. 

There were distributed 28,590 of these desirable game fish during the 

period covered by this report, 19,590 flngerllngs and 9,000 fry. This Is 

the first season we have planted any of the bass as fry, but the Michigan 

and Wisconsin commissions claim it to be a success in their waters, and 

I have deemed it worthy a trial here. The demand for bass has always 

exceeded the supply; this is not only the case here, but in every state 

maintaining fish hatcheries. I have increased our breding stock of baas 

the past summer and expect a corresponding increase of bass next year. 

It is also my intention to secure, if possible, a small number of adult 

small-mouth bass next spring for breeders, all stock of this variety having 

disappeared during the administration of my predecessor. </seg>

BOCK BASS. 

There were planted 3,350 during October and November,. 1901. One 
thousand of this number being allotted to bur commission by the United 
Stites Fish Commission. An additional supply of adult fish will have to 
be procured before we can extend this work as the old Commission lost 
practically all the breeding stock of this fish, while endeavoring to make 

fish exhibit at the State Fair in 1900. 

CRAPPIE8 

There were planted 15,225 crappies, during the biennial term, 2,100 being 
procured from a slough near Peru, Nemaha county, the balance being 
hatched at the ponds at South Bend. All applications for this fish have 
been filled, though in some cases the allotment was not as large as applied 
for. The introduction of the crappies into the waters of this state 
has been very successful and should be extended. 

STBIPED PEBCH. 

Owing to the fact that the old Board of Fish Commissioners lost practically 
all the adult stock of perch at the state fair in 1900, only 200 fish 
of this variety were available for distribution in 1901. In April of the 
present year I secured a fresh stock of breeders from Seymour lake, and 
as a result was enabled to distribute 5,000 fry and 12,800 six months old 
perch a total of 17,800. This is more than twice the number planted in 
any previous year. 

CHANNEL CATFISH. 

There were planted 23,285 catfish the past eighteen months the major 
portion of these being taken in trap nets from the Platte river near the 
Hatcheries, and transplanted over the state. The artificial propagation 
of the channel catfish in ponds at the Hatcheries has been a partial failure, 
as we have not been able to meet the demand for them from this 
source, but the ease with which the young fish can be collected in the 
autumn, when they are migrating to the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, 
makes their distribution a matter of slight expense, and this branch of 
our work is meeting with much favor. 

WALL-EYED PIKE. 

As a result of the fact that I did not assume charge of the Hatchery 
until July 1, 1901, and the old Commission had no one in their employ 
who was competent to collect pike eggs, ho pike were hatched in 1900 and 
1901. In April of the present year with the assistance of one man I succeeded 
in collecting about 12,000,000 eggs at the spawning grounds at Bay 
City, Michigan. Of this number I estimate we planted 11,104,000 fry. 
Pike culture in small ponds has proven a failure, and I have discouraged 
the planting of them in such places, owing to their cannibalistic habits. 
The bulk of the hatch the past spring were planted in Cut-off lake and the 
Elk horn. Lou p. and Blue rivers, where natural food is abundant. </seg>

REPORT OF 8UPERINTBNDBSNT FISH HATCHBRMB. 

BROOK TROUT. 

B stock of adult brook trout in the ponds had become decimated to 
in extent by disease, and other causes when I assumed charge of 
atcheries that I was only able to collect 15,000 eggs during the 1901 
ting season but by the purchase of 50,000 eggs from a commercial 
hatchery and the allotment to our Commission by the United States 
Fish Commission of another 50,000 eyed eggs, we were enabled to plant 
93,000 fry the past spring. We bare collected 50,000 eggs from the stock 
of breeders this fall mostly from the two year olds and expect to collect 
as many more and will likely receive an allotment of 50,000 from the 
National Commission. The stocking of the trout streams in the northwest 
part of the state was sadly neglected by the old Commission during 
the last two years of its existence, and should now receive the attention 
they deserve. In addition to those planted I reserved about three thousand 
fry at the Hatcheries to increase our breeding stock. 

RAI.NBOW TROUT. 

241,000 fry and 1,020 flngerlings of this variety were planted during the 
present year, and we still have several hundred flngerlings on hand for 
distribution next spring. 50,000 of these eggs were brought from a commercial 
trout hatchery, 50,000 were donated by the United States Fish 
Commission, and the balance collected from our stock of breeders in the 
Hatchery ponds. The adult stock is now in fine condition and I expect 
to collect 150,000 eggs during February and March, 1903. The rainbow 
trout have made if anything a better showing than the brook trout in the 
streams in the northwest part of the state, and the demand for the stocking 
of streams with this fish is extensive and insistent. 

BBOWW TROUT. 

Pom about 40 brown trout in the ponds, we collected about 25,000 eggs 
ig the 1901 spawning season, and about the same number the past 
Small plants of these trout have been made several times along with 
brook and rainbow trout, but their introduction into the waters of 
this state has not been attended with the same success, as has the brook 
and rainbow trout, those planted last spring were put in with the rainbow 
trout and counted as such. Were it not for the fact that we hare a 
few breeders on hand I would favor dispensing with their culture. We 
have abundant evidence that the brook and rainbow trout are best adapted 
tthe waters of this state, and the propagation of other trout has been 
gely a waste of time and money. 

GERMAN CARP. 

Ei output of carp during the present biennial period was 4,450. Owing 
b strenous objection of anglers and sportsmen no application for 
to stock public streams or lakes have been considered. We have 
all applications made for carp to stock private ponds the present 
i and have fed several thousand of them to the adult bass and trout. </seg>

Eit not for the fact that the carp are the only fish that will lire in 
shallow ponds on farms and ranches, I would favor the discontinuif 
their culture entirely. 

GOLDFISH. 

E distribution of goldfish during the period covered by this report 
,664, about one third of the number being disposed of during the 
fair. There has been a marked falling off in the number of requests 
&gt;ldflsh, since the new law went into effect imposing a charge for 
I have delivered some to the state institutions, for which no 
e has been made. As a result of the excessive amount of rain and 
reather the past summer, the goldfish did not color well, and we 
ave the greater part of this season's hatch in the ponds. 

STTNFISH. 

2,000 blue-gill sunfish. secured by seining some of the sloughs along the 
Platte river when about to dry up in the summer of 1901, have been 
planted, 1,500 in 1901 and 500 the present year. There is a growing 
demand for sunfish, and I shall devote a small pond to their culture the 

YELLOW BILL-HEADS. 

Prom a few pairs of these fish secured from the Santee lakes, and placed 
in the pond with the catfish, we hatched and reared about 5,000 bullheads; 
1,000 of this number were planted in Oak creek near Valparaiso, 
by request of citizens, the balance were distributed along with public 
plants of catfish, of which no accurate record was kept 

RESCUING FISH FBOM RECEDING WATERS. 

Owing to the excessive dry spell in June, July, and August 1901, many 
streams, lakes and ponds, that in an ordinary year contained sufficient 
water to sustain fish life partially or entirely, dried up. This was notably 
so of the Platte river, which became practically dry from North Platte 
to Columbus. July 19, 1901, in compliance with instructions from the 
Commissioner, I proceeded to Grand Island with the fish car, to seine the 
shallow ponds left by the receding waters and remove the fish, but upon 
investigation found we had arrived on the ground too late, as all the fish 
of any value had been taken out by persons living along the stream. We 
spent two days there and succeeded in collecting about 2,000 small fish, 
mostly chubs, pike, catfish and carp. These were taken to the Hatcheries, 
the chub utilized for food for other fish, and the pike, catfish and carp 
formed part of our state fair exhibit on September 30, 1901. I received instructions 
from the Chief Deputy to proced to Peru, Nemaha county, and 
examine a slough said to be drying up near there. Upon investigation I 
found there was tons of fish in the slough although the water Was nearly 
gone and it had been seined almost daily for weeks. The majority of 
fish were bull-heads, buffalo, quillbacks and hybrids, but with the assistance 
of two men in two days, I succeeded in collecting 3,000 bass and </seg>

crappie. These were placed on the fish car and planted in the Blue river 
at Deweese, Humboldt lake, Frenchmen river. Wauneta and Curtis lake 
near Curtis. One trip of this kind was made the present year to the 
ponds in the vicinity of La Platte, but owing to the high water little 
could be learned as to the contents of the ponds. There are numerous 
ponds and sloughs along the Platte and Missouri rivers in which thousands 
of fish perish every dry season, and I know of no way in which the 
energies of the Commission can be used to better advantage than in saving 
these fish. This work is prosecuted extensively along the Mississippi river 
by the Illinois and Wisconsin commissions, and the National Fish Commission, 
and I think we ought to carry on this work so far as our means 

FISH CAR. 

Our fish car is a valuable aid in carrying on our work, without which, 
it would be impossible to stock streams and lakes in the remote portions 
of the state. During the past eighteen months the mileage covered by 
the car, not including switching and transfers, was 3,997 miles on the B. 
4 M. R. R.. 3.458 miles on the F., E. £ M. V. R. R. and 1,824 miles on the 
U. P. R. R., a total of 9,279 miles. Like most other state property, when 
turned over by the old Board of Commissioners, the car was badly in 
need of repairs. The repairs were made at the Union Pacific shops at 
Omaha during the past winter, and the car in appearance is now a credit 
to the Commission. 

Ayi AB1AL EXHIBITS. 

Siame and Fish Commission exhibits at the state fair in 1901 and 
irpassed all previous displays, both in number of fish and the 
t condition of the specimens shown, which called forth the adl 
of the visitors and evoked many favorable comments from the 
he main exhibit was shown in twenty plate glass aquariums eight 
feet long, divided in three compartments. A large tank in the center of 
the building also contained a large number of fish, and imported ornamental 
fish was shown in twenty glass globes. The total number of live 
fish on display was about 12,000, ranging in size from brook minnows half 
an inch long to the ponderous Mississippi river catfish, weighing 121 
pounds. A special feature of the display was the specimens of mounted 
game birds and animals placed in the center of the building and along the 
side walls, which added much to the embellishment of the exhibit. 

Considerable credit is due Chief Deputy Geo. B. Simpkins and Traveling 
Deputy Geo. L. Carter, who assisted materially in making these exhibits. 
The State Board of Agriculture, realizing what an attraction the 
fish exhibits have proven, have decided to erect a permanent aquarium on 
the fair grounds for the use of the Fish and Game Commission, and it 
is my intention next year to show not only live fish from the Hatcheries, 
but to collect fish from every section of the state, and place them on 
display properly labeled as an object lesson of what fish culture has accomplished 
in Nebraska. </seg>

BEPOKT OF SUPERINTENDENT FI8H HATCHERIES. 

STOCKING PRIVATE PONDS. 

Piction 13 of article 1 of the new game and fish laws, which requires 
a charge be imposed for fish planted in private waters, is a step in 
right direction. Some fault has justly been found with this provision 
of the new law by persons who have had applications on file for fish for 
one or two years, but generally the new order of things is being accepted 
without complaint. Nearly all the states, which operate fish hatcheries, 
have long since done away with the free distribution of fish to private 
ponds, and have practically turned this branch of the business over to 
private enterprises. It has been a manifest injustice in the past that the 
taxpayers of the whole state, should pay for stocking the private ponds 
of a limited number. The charge imposed for fish for stocking private 
waters is merely nominal, being as follows: 

Wall-eyed pike (six months old), $3.00 per 100. Pry, $100 per 1,000 
Brook trout " 5.00 " " 2.00 
Rainbow trout " 5.00 " " 2.00 
Black bass " 3.00 " " 1.00 
Crappies " 2.00 " " 1.00 

Striped perch " 2.00 
German carp " 2.00 
Channel catfish (one year old) 3.00 

Goldfish " 1.00 per dozen. 

The term fry means fish from two to six weeks old, and the term fingerlings 
mean fish from six to twelve months old. Fry is delivered to applicants 
during March, April and May, fingerlings principally in October 
and November. $291.70 was derived from sales pf fish in 1901, and $435.55 
in 1902, a total of $727.25. While this amount may appear insignificant. 
it will about cover the expenditure of necessary labor at the Hatcheries 
for the period covered by this report. In addition it has cut off that class 
of citizens who have applied for fish in the past, whether they had a suitable 
place to plant them or not, just because the state was conducting a 
sort of free fish dispensary. The legislature, no doubt, intended to create 
a cash fund at the Hatcheries from the sale of these fish to be used in 
case of emergency, the same as other state institutions have, but as the 
law does not specify any disposition of the money, on the advice of the 
Attorney General, it has been turned over to the State Treasurer, and I 
hold his receipts for the amount. 

FINANCIAL STATEMENT. 

Kike no detailed financial statement, as all bills are audited by the 
Deputy, and his report will cover in detail all expenditures of the 
sries, as well as the Warden's office. Of the total amount appro-1 
by the last legislature for the support of the Commission, $7,700.00

Office expense, etc 23 00 

Total $1,127 82 

Leaving a balance of $6,683.18 to conduct the Hatcheries for 21 months. 

There will be a deficiency of about $300.00 in the labor fund, and about 

the same amount in the fish food and repair funds. This is entirely un- 

avoidable as the $841.00 left in the labor fund by the old Commission, was 

not sufficient to pay one man for 21 months. The small deficit in the fish 

food fund is caused by the increased cost of beef livers, corn meal, etc.. 

and the deficit in the repair fund, on account of rebuilding the two large 

nursery tanks in the hatching house, and the purchase of coal for heating 

the Hatchery, for which no provision was made in the appropriation. To 

offset this deficit of $600.00 there will be a surplus of at least $200.00 in the 

amount allowed the Deputy Commissioner for traveling expense, and an 

additional $727.25 derived from the sales of fish to owners of private 

ponds and lakes. 

NUMBER AND VALUE OF FISH IN HATCHERY PONDS. 

I do not attempt to give a correct report of the number and age* of 

the fish in the state ponds, as this would practically be impossible. At the 

time the ponds were drawn off in September of the present year, we had 

about 50,000 fish of all kinds propagated at the Hatcheries on hand. This 

was at the commencement of the fall distribution, and we have since dis- 

tributed about 40,000, which would leave at the present time about 10,000 

fish of all kinds and various ages on hand, on which I have placed a value 

of $1,000. This is a conservative estimate. As all kinds of game fish are </seg>

cannibals, a count of the fish In September would be nothing more than 
an estimate now, for this reason I do not endeavor to give the number in 
detail, and claim it is accurate. 

RESULTS OF FISH CULTURE IX NEBRASKA, 

The question is often asked, what has the Hatcheries accomplished, and 
has the work been profitable to the taxpayers? As a whole, I hare no 
hesitancy in answering this question in the affirmative, though it must be 
admitted in the early history of the Commission, little was accomplished, 
the work being largely experimental. The thousands of land-locked 
salmon and white fish planted, were a total failure, and the same is also 
a fact in regard to the lake trout. I have never seen but three lake 
trout taken from the public waters, those were taken in ponds on spring 
streams near Glen, Sioux county; and were not thrifty specimens. There 
may be some lake trout in the spring fed lakes in the sand hills, as the 
result of plants made, but it is my belief that we have little to show for 
the hundreds of thousands of lake trout planted. The brook trout have 
made a better showing and as a result of their introduction, practically 
all the tributaries of the Niobrara river contain this species. During the 
past summer I have had an opportunity to examine some of these streams, 
and have seen many fine trout taken. It is no uncommon sight during the 
summer months to see strings of from a dozen to fifty trout brought in to 
Neligh, Ewing, O'Neill, Atkinson, Stuart, Long Pine, Bassett, Johnstown, 
Valentine, Chadron, Crawford and Harrison. The principal streams In 
which they are found are the Verdigree in Antelope county, the Bazile in 
Knox county, the Eagle, Red Bird and Big Sandy in Holt county, Pine 
and Plum in Brown county, Evergreen, Minnechaduza, Boardman, Gordon, 
and Schlegel, in Cherry county, Chadron, and Bordeaux, in Dawes county. 
Hat, Sowbelly creeks, and White river in Sioux county. Limited numbers 
are also taken in the headwaters of the Niobrara in Sioux county, they are 
also found in a few streams in Custer, Keith and Kimball counties. Like 
the brook trout, the rainbow trout have also proven very successful. They 
are found in practically all the streams that contain brook trout, and 
specimens weighing as high as seven pounds have been taken from Pine 
Creek, Brown county. I personally caught ten in a small tributary of the 
White river in Sioux county in 1898 that weighed in the aggregate nearly 
forty pounds. As no trout were found in the state previous to 1883, I 
think no one will question the success of this branch of the Commissioners' 
work. Hundreds of people go out from Omaha, Lincoln and other 
towns to fish in these clear sparkling streams for trout, and the money 
spent in this way is considerable. It is said that the first plant of black 
bass made in Nebraska waters was the result of a wreck of a United 
States fish car on the Union Pacific, while crossing a bridge over the g 
Elkhorn river in 1875, and from this accidental plant the bass became 
scattered along this stream from its mouth to the headwaters in a few 
years, certain it is that there was bass in the state before the State Com- </seg>

mission began its work, but the results of the Commission's work in 
planting bass is every where apparent. This is especially so of the lakes 
in the sand hills of Cherry county, where owing to the sparse settlement 
they have had an opportunity to multiply and increase. Whether the 
pike are more numerous in our streams now than before the Commission 
began their propagation is a question that is debtable. The increase in 
the number of mill dams on our streams, has prevented them from ascending 
some streams, as they did when the state was first settled, the increase 
in population and the consequent increase of manure and sewerage 
that washes and is dumped in many streams, has rendered them unfit for 
the pike, and Wiere is no question but what in some of our shallow 
streams the pike are migratory, they ascend the streams in the spring and 
go down in the fall. This may be so to a lesser extent on the larger 
streams as the best fishing for pike is during the months of May and 
October. Plants of pike made in Seymour lake near Omaha in 1895, a 
lake fed by an artesian well, weighed over two pounds in 1898, and while 
the deputies were removing carp from Cut-off lake near Omaha and 
Crystal lake near Dakota City, the past summer, some fine specimens of 
pike were taken, showing the plants made in those lakes were successful. 
Crappie and perch were only found in a few lakes bordering the Missouri 
river in this state prior to 1892, today they are to be found in the streams. 
lakes and ponds in over half the counties in the state. The past summer 
I found many of them in the illegal fyke nets seized on the Elkhorn river, 
and fine strings of them are now caught almost daily during the open 
season, at Ewing, Neligh and many other points. West Lake near the 
Hatcheries which eight years ago, contained no crappies, now contains 
thousands and the same is true of Seymour Lake near Omaha. The German 
carp which were brought into the state in 1880, and have subjected 
the Commission to much criticism, have increased to such an extent as 
to be a nuisance and hundreds of requests were filed with the Chief Deputy 
in the last eighteen months for permits to seine out the carp. As for 
the channel catfish, no one will question the wisdom of their distribution, 
as they are native to our streams and the Commission's work in transplanting 
thousands of them from the Platte river to the numerous 
streams and lakes throughout the state, cannot prove otherwise than 
beneficial. 

Fish culture in private ponds of limited area has not been attended with 
the same degree of success, as has been the case in public waters, and I 
will admit that more money has been spent in private fish culture in 
Nebraska than has ever been derived from it. The main causes of this 
are as follows: lack of knowledge in constructing the ponds, the alluvial 
character of the soil, which causes the ponds to fill up with mud in a few 
yean if the surface water is not perfectly excluded. The desire to raise 
trout and bass where the water supply is only sufficient for carp, catfish, 
or sunflsh, and often an attempt to rear a dozen kinds of fish in a small 
pond, are all contributing causes to the many failures I have noticed. </seg>

RBPOBT OT 8UPBEINTBNDKNT IIAT» HERIES. 

DOES IT PAT TO OPERATE THE HATC 1 1 OUTS? 

This question is not propounded now as often as in the early history 
of the institution. It is my candid opinion if the laws were so framed 
that we could show up the goods, that it would be an easy matter to prove. 
not only from an angling standpoint, but in a commercial way the 
Hatcheries are a good investment. If licensed fishing was allowed on 
the Missouri and Platte rivers, the value of the carp alone that could be 
taken, say in a period of five years, would more than equal the amount 
expended on the Hatcheries. 

The man who is able to buy black bass, pike, or catfish for his table will 
say the carp are not fit to eat, and my assertion sounds "fishy," bnt it 
cannot be denied that carp sell readily for five cents per pound on the 
Omaha market at the present time, and it is also a fact that in 1899 the 
quantity of carp taken by licensed fisherman on the Illinois river, in the 
state of Illinois, amounted to 6,332,999 pounds, and sold for $189,980. 
These figures were furnished by the Illinois River Fishermen's Association 
and are authentic. The carp catch for the present year will amount to 
over 1200,000 and will more than equal in value the catch of all other 
kinds of fish in that state, and I am confident from the hauls of carp made 
in the Platte and Missouri rivers, while collecting specimens for the Fair 
exhibit the past summer, that the carp alone in these streams would 
produce a considerable revenue if properly handled. Some pessimists 
opposed to artificial propagation, will say that all the fish planted by the 
Commission in Jones lake, are seined out by law breakers, and sold. This 
may be the case, but it is no valid argument against our work. Another 
critic of the same stripe will say that as a result of the drouth in 1901, 
Smith creek dried up and all fish planted therein by the Fish Commission, 
as well as the native fish perished, therefore fish culture in Nebraska is 
useless. As well might say, that because we have an occasional crop 
failure, the farms should be abandoned. The breaking up of lands around 
many lakes in eastern Nebraska, and the consequent washing in of soil 
has filled up many lakes, and the dumping of manure refuse, and sewerage 
has driven out all fish except carp, catfish and bullheads. From some 
small streams, these causes cannot be interfered with, and the only thing 
to be done is to adapt our work to the new conditions. During the past 
summer a cloudbust near Harrison, Sioux county, swept down the White 
river valley and carried everything before it. After the storm hundreds 
of trout were found that had been carried out of the stream by the flood. 
It will likely take five or ten years restocking to replace the fish destroyed 
by this storm. It also damaged the Elkhorn railroad and carried 
out their dam at Andrews, but the railroad company did not abandon the 
damaged piece of track because of the disaster, and the Fish Commission 
will not abandon this beautiful trout stream because of this misfortune. 
In numerous instances drouth and flood have annulled the work of the 
Hatcheries, both in this and other states, but this is no reason why flan </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRRTLTURB. 

E&gt;rding to the United States survey, Nebraska has 6,485 miles of 
is, and 11,160 acres of lakes, all public water. Certainly no more 
&gt;le work can be fostered by our legislature than the stocking of 
waters with food fish, now that the feasibility of the work cannot 
rationed. 

Ethe great state of New York, one of the pioneers in fish culture, can 
d to spend $56,000.00 annually in this work, surely Nebraska, one of 
foremost states in the union can afford at least $5,000 annually for 

DONATIONS FROM THE IMTKl) STATES FISH COMMISSION. 

During this biennial term the United States Fish Commission have 
allotted our commission 50,000 brook and 50,000 rainbow trout eggs, 1,000 
rock bass, 500 black bass, and 400 crappies six months old. 

NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS. 

I new cement floor is needed in the hatching house, new sills, roof 
ngled and exterior painted, additional trout hatching troughs and 
i, a number of shipping cans, seines, etc., should be added to the 
hery equipment. The barn should be raised, reshingled and painted, 
ce house needs reshingling, likewise the spring house. The Superin»nt's 
residence should have a new veranda, and requires papering 
painting Inside and out. As the wagon bridge is impassable, it will 
be necessary to move the fish car shed either to Louisville or the new 
station south of Gretna. New wheels, heavier fulcrum and bottom rods, 
and air signals should be put on the car and the interior of car painted 
and varnished. 

About 200 rods of fence inclosing the Fishery grounds will have to be 
rebuilt, the large stone dam will have to be widened and newly cemented, 
some new supply and drain pipes will be required for the ponds, and a 
considerable quantity of mud removed from twenty-two ponds. Owing to 
the small amount appropriated for labor the past two years, this work 
has been necessarily somewhat neglected. A new work team, harness 
and lumber wagon will have to be purchased, the present team having 
outlived their usefulness, and the wagon being beyond repair. 

RECOMMENDATIONS. 

Sould recommend that the proceeds derived from the sales of fish 
&gt;cking private waters, etc., be used solely for the improvement of the 
ery grounds, leveling the pond banks, sodding, planting trees, shrubflowers, 
constructing walks, etc. 

Eoubt if there is a citizen of our state who saw our display of fish at 
LSt state fair, but is proud of the showing made by our Commission, 
judicious expenditure of a few hundred dollars would make the 
leries just as attractive. 

In my judgment that section of the law prohibiting the netting of fish </seg>

            <seg id="p155">

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT FISH HATCHBBMS. 

in the Missouri river on the eastern boundary of our state, should be 
repealed and licensed fishing allowed. The state of Iowa allows unrestricted 
fishing in any manner in this stream at all seasons of the year, 
and the same privilege should be extended to our citizens. 

That a systematic examination with nets should be made in the next 
two years of all streams and lakes In the state if possible, to determine 
to a certainty what success has attended the stocking of many of these 
waters in the past, and what kinds of fish to plant there in the future. 
There are many fine lakes and spring streams in the sand hills, that have 
never been stocked or inspected by the Commissioners or deputies. 

That a committee from the Senate and House of Representatives be 
invited to visit the Hatcheries during the legislative session, and learn 
something of the work being done, and the needs of the institution. 

Ra stated appropriation of at least $10,000.00 for the biennial period 
rided for the maintenence of the Hatcheries, thus doing away with 
:essity of asking a special appropriation each biennial term. This 
plan followed in most eastern states, and enables the superintendfigure 
ahead on work to be done and improvements, which cannot 
e under the present makeshift method of operating the Hatcheries. 

CONCLUSION. 

I assumed the management of the Hatcheries under adverse conditions, 
and I believe a fair comparison of the condition of the buildings and 
grounds now and when I was appointed will prove that I have done well 
with the limited means at my disposal. The number of fish produced will 
compare favorably with the distribution of any Hatchery in the United 
States, considering the amount expended in their production. The Commission 
is deeply indebted to the B. * M., the F.. E. * M. V., and U. P. 
railroads for free transportation of fish car and employees. Requests 
made to the officials of these companies for transportation have always 
been promptly honored. I am also under obligations to Chief Deputy 
Slmpkins and traveling Deputy Carter, as they have assisted me whenever 
requested, and have endeavored in every way to make this branch of the 
service a success. In the future, as in the past, it shall be my constant 
endeavor to secure the best possible results for the money spent under my 
supervision. W. J. O'Brien, Superintendent.

SUGGESTIONS AS TO CHANGES IN OUR FISH LAWS. 

There is a growing disposition among the people that if the sportsmen 

and anglers are to dictate our fish and game laws, they also should bear 

the greater part of the burden of propagating and protecting fish and 

game. This is evidenced by the passage of laws in several states impos- 

ing a license on those who go afield with rod or gun. Some states divide 

the responsibility for fish propagation between the angler and commercial 

fisherman by making both cough up a little to the general fund. In the </seg>

            <seg id="p178">
178 


way of licenses, while the license imposed is merely nominal, yet in the 
aggregate they produce considerable sums. In Michigan and Wisconsin, 
the proceeds derived from these licenses provide enough money to pmy a 
thoroughly organized and well paid system of wardens. Ohio collects 
about $1,000 annually from her commercial fishermen in the way of 
licenses; California $7,500 from the same source, and Washington about 
$25,000 annually. In the latter state the revenue is principally from the 
salmon fishermen. I merely cite these as examples. 

The last legislature in our state, in its wisdom, passed the new fish and 
game bill, with its license features, and imposed a charge for fish delivred 
for stocking private ponds or lakes from the Hatcheries, or public 
waters. The operation of this law in the past eighteen months has been 
satisfactory, as it has produced enough revenue to pay two-thirds the coat 
f maintaining the commission, and there has been no complaint that it is 
rardensome. 

I believe the law should now be amended so as to advance a few steps 
further on the common sense lines laid down by the framer of the present 
law, and instead of imposing a license of $1.00 for going beyond the 
boundary of your home county to hunt and fish, cut the price in two and 
make it 50 cents a year on every resident of our state who goes afield with 
rod or gun. This amount would be so small that ao otie could object to it, 
yet it would result in yielding thousands of dollars each year and would 
put the cost of propagating and protecting fish and game where it belongs 
—on those who enjoy the sport. Those who do not indulge in such pastime, 
would not be taxed for something from which they received no benefit. I 
would also favor the licensing fyke or hoop nets on the Missouri, Platte, 
Elkhorn. Loup, and Blue rivers. On the three latter streams from the 
mouth of the stream to the first mill-dam only, nets to be not less than 
two and a half inch mesh stretch measure, and to be used without leads 
or wings. A license fee of at least two dollars each to be imposed for each 
net, same to be revoked in case the law was not strictly complied with. A 
license of this kind, in my judgment, would be a source of considerable 
revenue, and would meet the approval of a large majority of the people 
living along these streams. Few pike, bass or crappie enter this kind of 
net, even in waters where they are numerous, and a mesh of the size indicated, 
would retain nothing but the mature fish. Fully ninety per cent of 
all the catfish caught or taken in our streams with rod and line weigh 
leas than a pound. I know in making this uggestion I will call down on 
my head the criticism of many well meaning anglers, who will argue that 
if these fyke nets are permitted by law, the fish would fail to reach their 
•pawning grounds in the smaller streams, but any one posted on the conditions 
on the streams mentioned, will bear me out in the statement, that 
during the spring rise when the fish are ascending the streams mentioned, 
there is so much mud, silt, leaves, and other trash in the water, that a 
stationary -net cannot be maintained in working order, hence they would 
offer no obstacle to the fish during the reproductive period. </seg>

¦¦POST OF SUPERINTENDENT PISH HATCHERIES. 

In the past eighteen months hundreds of requests have been made for 
permits to seine Out the carp, buffalo, quilbacks, and other coarse flak, 
owing to the wide spread impression that they were destroying the game 
fish, a conclusion in which I only partially concur. In many cases these 
requests were made by persons who had a sincere desire to endeavor to 
better the conditions for the game fish, in other instances it was simply 
a desire to obtain a cloak under which to violate the law. After sixteen 
years study of this question on our streams, I have come to the conclusion 
that it is not the rapid increase of the german carp, buffalo, gars, and 
other coarse fish, but rather from the fad that the increase in the number 
of anglers, has resulted in many cases in the depletion of the game flak. 
While our laws have thrown an effective mantle of protection around the 
coarser varieties, especially those of the carp family, thus permitting them 
to increase. If a member of the coming legislature was to introduce a 
bill to absolutely prohibit the killing of geese, ducks and other migratory 
birds, except with clubs or sling-shots, just because a nimrod in pursuing 
them with firearms, occasionally killed other game, said legislator would 
probably be characterized as having "bat in his belfry," yet a bill of the 
kind in reference to the birds mentioned, would be just as reasonable 
as our present law in reference to our migratory fishes, and it cannot be 
denied that on the streams I have mentioned, the catfish, buffalo, quillbacks 
and also the pike are migratory, and in their annual migrations 
have to run the gauntlet through several states where they are afforded 
no protection whatever. Let it not be understood that I favor letting 
down the bars for the indiscriminate slaughter of even our coarse fish, but 
rather that I am endeavoring to point out a way to save what is now practically 
going to waste. 

So far as fishing in our lakes, ponds, or small streams on which there 
are mill-dams, I would favor the law be made even more stringent than 
at present, and if it becomes necessary to seine out some of the coarse 
fish to benefit their game cousins, it should be done under direct supervision 
of some member of the Game and Fish Commission or not at all, but in 
the streams mentioned in my judgment, a change in the law somewhat 
as I have outlined, I think would result in placing on the market thousands 
of pounds of fish each year, that under our present law is a dead 
loss to the state. 

A FEW FACTS REGARDING FISH AND FISH BOGS. 

Fish are cold-blooded animals. The first attempt to hatch fish artificially 
in the United States was by Dr. Garlick in Cleveland, Ohio. The 
first attempt to hatch fish anywhere is said to have been in the fifteenth 
century in France. 

Old fish, like any other creature, become barren. A fish in captivity 
becomes barren much earlier than those who have their freedom. The 
size of fish does not depend on its scales. 

The shad has large scales, while the salmon, that attains a greater size, 
has scales that are almost microscopic. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE. 

The young of sturgeon are protected with armor, but this practically 
all disappears before maturity. The slime on a fish is as necessary to its 
health as perspiration is to a man. Little is known of the diseases that 
attack mature fish, the fungoid disease being the most common. Bathing 
the diseased fish in salt water is beneficial. The eggs of fish are not impregnated 
in the ovaries, but after being deposited by the female. Partally 
incubated eggs can be transported thousands of miles when properly 
packed without injury. Some fishes deposit their eggs on stones, brush, 
or acquatic plants, the eggs adhering by a glutinous substance that surrounds 
them, these fish build no nests. The body of a fish is in four parts, 
head, trunk, tail and fins. The head of a fish ends at the back of the 
gills, the trunk just back of the vent. The chief propulsive power of a fish 
s not by means of the fins, but by the sinuous motions of the body, giving 
t the motion of a snake. AH fish do not possess the same number of fins, 
tie number depends on the species. The chief function of the fins is for 
balancing and steering, the spine-like parts are called rays. The names

REPORT OF Sl'PERlNTENDENT FI8H HATCH1BIM. 

Eincipal fins are dorsal, caudal, ainal, and pectoral. The month 
y organ of attack flsh possess, other weapons are for defensive 
only. 

The purpose of gills in fishes is to separate the air used by them In 
breathing, the water is taken through the mouth and expelled through the 
gills, thus if the gills are injured death usually follows. The majority of 
fish swallow their food without mastication, but some perform this function. 
It is generally believed that the organ of taste in fishes is not keen. 
Some flsh of the carnivorous type, even after they have satisfied their 
appetite, .go on killing other fishes. Black bass are a conspicuous example 
of this habit. Many fish have a distendable gullent and can swallow a 
fish of their own size. In all fish the teeth are shed and renewed during 
the course of their life. 

Some flsh require a much larger amount of oxygen to sustain life than 

Ki kinds of flsh build nests and deposit the eggs therein. The suna 
nest builder. Fish that do not build nests desert their eggs as 
i deposited. 

g'he catfish and bass guard their eggs, and the young for some time after 
j are hatched. About one per cent of the eggs that are deposited or 
wned in the natural way are hatched. About 95 per cent of the eggs 
collected by the artificial method produce young flsh. It is estimated that 
if all the eggs of flsh deposited naturally should hatch and reach maturity, 
the rivers and lakes would be so full of flsh they could not be navigated. 
At the spawning time the males of some species are pugnacious, and the 
battles often end fatally. Fish eggs swell about one third in size after being 
deposited by the fish. The young fish emerges tail first from the egg, 
if it emerges head first the outer membrane might become fastened 
about the gills causing it to smother. 

Ra certain period the young flsh are called fry and live on the conof 
the sac, the same as a young plant lives on the seed leaves; the 
gradually absorbed and disappears. As soon as the sac is absorbed 
the young fry begins to feed on objects in the water which nature indicates 
as food. The fry of all game fish are cannibals. Fry of the trout, bass and 
pike three or four weeks old will attack and devour their younger and 
weaker companions. Carp in this state require no feeding during the 
winter months, as they hibernate or sleep from December to April. 

Carp, crappie, sunfish and catfish spawn during May and June. Brook 
trout spawn in November and December, rainbow trout ill February and 
March. Trout thrive best in water of an even temperature of 60 degrees 
Fan. Bass, crappie and sunfish eggs hatch in from seven to nine days 
according to the temperature of the water. Wall eyed pike eggs require 
from fifteen to twenty days, trout eggs from six to ten weeks, white ftali 
eggs five months. </seg>

THE ADAPTATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF WINTER 
WHEAT. 

BY T. L. LYOJS, AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION, NEBRASKA. 

The present northern limit of winter wheat production in the 
trans-Missouri region lies in the state of Nebraska, thus limiting the 
output to a portion only of the arable land in the state. The spring 
wheat region protruding south from the Dakotas overlaps the winter 
wheat region to some extent, and thus winter wheat and spring wheat 
are raised side by side. 

Bie chief condition that discourages winter wheat production in 
hern Nebraska is the dry, cold, winter weather. Spring wheat 
¦rs from a number of adverse conditions, due mainly to its late 
linp. This habit increases the liability to injury from chinch bug 
hopper depredations, and especially to injury from dry, hot 

Winter wheat as a crop for Nebraska has enormous possibilities. 
• •nly are the large yields of this wheat such as to recommend its 
culture to the farmers of the state, but the quality of Nebraska winter 
wheat gives it a high standing among buyers and consumers. The 
conditions of climate that produce a milling wheat of superior excellence 
are found in the region of country bordering on the semi-arid. 
It is worthy of note that the great spring wheat producing region 
borders on the semi-arid belt in the north, while the region that is 
fast becoming the center of winter wheat production occupies a similar 
ion farther south. It is very noticeable that the quality of hardness 
in wheat improves as its culture approaches the semi-arid belt. 
Its advantage over spring wheat is evident in its larger yield, when 
not winterkilled, in its comparative freedom from insect depredations, 
and in the protection it affords the soil during a considerable portion 
nf the year. All these considerations make it highly desirable to improve 
our winter wheat in hardiness and quality, so as to extend its 
growth more widely throughout the state and to increase its productiveness. 
Improvement in hardiness may be looked for either bj the introduction 
of hardy varieties, by rendering hardier by selection varieties 
already grown, or by a combination of these processes. Improvetnt 
in quality and productiveness is to be sought in careful culture, 
tile soil and rational selection of seed. 

To these ends this station has tested, during the last five years, one </seg>

ADAPTATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF WINTER WHEAT. 

rlred and eighteen varieties of winter wheat, many of which are 
ign varieties, chiefly from eastern Russia. These tests have thus 
resulted in selecting a few American varieties as especially suited 
to Nebraska by reason of their hardiness. Two of these, Turkish Red, 
a bearded wheat, and Big Frame, a smooth wheat, have been pushed 
north and west by distributing packages of twenty pounds of seed to 
each of nearly four hundred persons living north of the Platte river, 
or west of the 100th meridian. Reports from these attempts have been 
very encouraging, the great majority of trials having been successful. 

A number of Russian varieties have shown themselves to be very 
hardy, and it is possible that some of these will furnish the foundation 
for varieties adapted to the northern portion of the state. These 
Russian wheats are generally late maturing sorts, which is a considerable 
disadvantage in southern Nebraska, but farther north 
quality is less objectionable, and when a variety is sufficiently han 
endure the winters its advantage over spring wheat is proportional to 
the difference in the time of ripening. 

Wheats from different sections of the country have shown decidedly 
different qualities when sown here from seed of the same variety 
grown at the Experiment Station. Seed from more humid regions, but 
from approximately the same latitude, matured later and did not yield 
so well as native seed, while seed from central Kansas matured earlier, 
and yielded slightly better than native seed. The relative hardiness at 
these alien wheats has not been thoroughly tested, there having been 
but two severe winters since they have been grown here. In the winter 
of 1896-97 and again in 1898-99, Turkey wheat from Kansas winterkilled 
almost completely, while Turkish Red from Iowa and Nebraska 
survived the winter creditably. Judging from this it would not always 
be safe to use Kansas-grown seed. 

TEST OF VARIETIES. 

A large number of varieties of winter wheat have been tested during 
the past five years. Most of these varieties have been grown first in 
small amounts to test their hardiness, and later if they showed unusual 
hardiness and if the seed available sufficed they were tested on 
a larger scale. In all, 118 varieties have been tested, of which a very 
small number have demonstrated their ability to pass successfully 
through severe winters. Whatever may be the productiveness of i\ 
variety, its usefulness in the long run will depend upon its hardiness; 
consequently it must demonstrate its ability to live through winters 
of at least average severity to entitle it to a further test. 

TESTS DURING 1896-97. 

Table I shows the record of the test for the winter of 1896-97. All

The winter of 1896-97 was a severe one on winter wheat. The gTound 
was bare of snow most of the time, which produced a condition too 
severe for even the Canadian wheat. Most of the wheats had been 
ffrown in Kansas for at least one year before this test, which would 
perhaps make them more susceptible to the cold. It will be noticed 
that there was Turkish Red or Turkey wheat from Iowa and Kansas, 
and that the Kansas seed killed out entirely. 

TESTS DURING 1897-98 

During the winter 1897-98, only Turkish Red, Big Frame and Currell 
lies were grown. They were drilled in September 14 and yielded

In the fall of 1898 a very considerable number of varieties of winter 
wheat were sown. These wheats were supplied through Mr. M. A. 
(arleton, cerealist of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. The seed 
planted had been grown for at least one year in Kansas, but many of 
them were of Russian origin. In the table of results, under the head 
of "origin," is given, so far as known, the place where the seed was 
grown previous to its life in Kansas. The amount of see.l of each was

The U. S. Department of Agriculture sent to be tested four varieties 

of Hungarian winter wheat. The following statement regarding them 

is made in Inventory No. 8. Section of Seed and Plant Introduction. 
••This shipment comprises four of the best known of the Hungarian 

hard winter wheats. These wheats are the qualities from which the 

higher grades of flour are made at Budapest. Hungary is about the 

only European country which exports flour, and therefore comes into 

competition with America in this commodity. Experts on the stock 

&gt;nge at Budapest claim that some of the Hungarian hard winter 

wheats produce a better grade of flour than do the best American 

wheats. This, however, is doubtful. These varieties are worthy of 

ful trial wherever the winters are mild enough to permit of the 

&lt;h of winter wheats. Of the varieties included in this shipment 

the Bannt and Thrifts are the best known. Both varieties have a large 

quantity of gluten of a high quality. It is doubtful whether the 

names applied to Hungarian wheats, such as Thrifts and Banat, really 

represent distict varieties of wheats. They are rather to be con- 

sidered as indicating the locality from which the wheat was obtained. 

and these numbers may consist of a mixture of varieties. They prob- 

ably differ somewhat in different localities." 

These wheats were planted in the same way as the above, but owing 

to their late arrival not until October 27.

ADAPTATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF WINTER WHEAT. 

Blate planting placed these wheats *^t a disadvantage as far as 
ect of winter was concerned. 

During the same winter several other varieties were tested on a larger 

scale, among these being the Turkish Bed, Big Frame and Currell, 

which had proven so hardy in previous years. Quite a large acreage 

of these was grown to furnish seed for the co-operative tests by 

residents in the northern and western portions of the state. A few 

varieties were received from the U. S. Department of Agriculture, 

which on account of the fact that they had been successfully grown in 

Russia under climatic conditions somewhat similar to those of this 

region were considered deserving of a careful test here. They were 

drilled in September 11. The results were as follows:

In the fall of 1900 only those varieties were planted that had survived 

the winter of 1899-1900. The number was thus cut down very con- 

siderably, but no variety was discarded until after two years' trial. 

The quantity of seed was still too small to permit of determining the 

yield per acre. All were planted September 17.

Some other winter wheats received from the U. S. Department of 

Agriculture were tested. These were all of foreign origin and had not 

been grown here before except three of the Hungarian wheats, of 

which the home-grown seed was planted at this time, but of the Pester 

Boden variety that killed out completely during the winter of 1899-1900 

the original seed was used. 

Extremely hot weather at time of ripening caused the wheats har- 

vested this year and especially the later ones to reach the cutting 

stage prematurely. They have, therefore, not changed as greatly in 

time of ripening as would be indicated by the records. They were 

planted September 17.

A quite extensive and fairly accurate test of the comparative merits 

of the Turkish Bed and Big Frame varieties was made for the northern 

and western portions of the state by the distribution of seed of these two 

varieties in those regions. By taking only those counties in which both 

varieties were grown and comparing the total results for each variety 

we hare a comparatively fair method of comparison, the weak point 

being the fact that each variety was tested by a different person and 

hence there is no assurance that the conditions were the same, but 

it is expected that the large number of tests will largely counterbal- 

ance this source of error.

TESTS OP WHEATS IN NORTHERN AND WESTERN NEBRASKA. 

In the fall of 1900, three hundred and sixty-seven samples of wheats 

of the Big Frame and Turkish Red varieties were sent to parties living 

north of the Platte river or west of the 100th meridian. Each experi- 

menter received twenty pounds of wheat, and agreed to plant and 

care for it, threshing it separately from his other grain, and to report 

kthe following points connected with its growth,

The number of reports available for use in computing results from

killing, and the average yield per acre for each variety in each county 

in which the tests were made. Plantings later than October 1 were not 

included among the list of losses by winterkilling, but the omi- 

from this cause were very few. Average yields per acre were found by 

dividing the sum of all yields reported for any variety in a county by 

the number of such reports.

El distribution of winter wheat was made with two objects in 
namely, to help ascertain the possibilities of winter wheat culin 
that portion of the state lying north of the Platte river and 
lying west of the 100th meridian, and also to encourage experi»1 
attempts to raise winter wheat in those regions. 

Iie latter object is being attained in a very marked degree, as 
tically all those who made the test are planting the seed again 
year. In addition, large numbers of farmers have planted wheat 
year for the first time. There is great danger that the industry 
receive a setback should the winter prove a severe one resulting in 
loss of large areas of wheat. The adaptation of winter wheat to 
s of that region cannot be accomplished at once and should not be 
mpted on a large scale by single individuals with the belief that 
have found a sure crop for all seasons. 

Ii far as the attempt to gauge the possibilities of winter wheat 
ring is concerned, that cannot be determined by one year's test, 
something has been learned, and a beginning has been made by 
ishing the station with a corps of competent volunteer experimenwho 
are provided with winter wheat of known origin, and who 
disposed to continue its culture. In time, the results obtained by 
e persons will throw much light on the subject. 

E results of the first winter, as shown in the table, are very enging. 
Of the 194 tests reported, there were only nineteen cases

IMPROVEMENT BY ADAPTATION 

Undoubtedly the ideal winter wheat for Nebraska is yet to be developed. 
Whether some of the varieties now in use, like the "Turkish 
Bed," will form the basis for the improved wheat or whether some of 
the Hussion wheats will be found best adapted to this region cannot 
be foretold. It seems probable that varieties of somewhat different 
characteristics will be required in different portions of the state. The 
northern portion will require a hardier variety than the southern, and 
the western a more strongly drouth-resistant variety than the eastern. 
Early maturity is a desirable characteristic everywhere, but becomes of 
more importance as wheat culture proceeds southward and westward. 

That much can be done towards adapting some of the commonlygrown 
varieties to portions of the state not generally considered in 
the winter wheat area has already been demonstrated. One of the 
most promising varieties for this purpose is the so-called Turkey Bed 
or Turkish Red or Turkey. The three names doubtless represent a 
wheat of the same local origin, namely, the Crimea. It is grown extensively 
in Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska, and even farther east. As its 
original habitat resembles in some climatic conditions the trans-Missouri 
country, the characteristics that favored it in the Crimea have 
made it useful here. It has, however, exhibited quite a tendency 
towards variation, and in the different regions in which it has been 
cultivated shows markedly different habits of growth. An experiment 
designed to show the difference between representative samples of 
this variety from different sections of the country was carried on at 
this station in 1899-1900 and in 1900-01. Turkish Red seed wheat was obtained 
from the Ohio Experiment Station in eastern Ohio, the Iowa station 
in central Iowa, and through the Kansas station there was collected 
a sample from central Kansas. These samples and one of Turkish Bed 
wheat that had been grown at this station for three years were sown 
on contiguous plots of land. The record of growth shows a great difference 
in the habits of these four strains of what was without doubt 
originally the same variety of wheat. That the Nebraska and Iowa 
seed were originally the same is certain, for the Nebraska seed had 
been obtained from the Iowa station three years before. 

e winter of 1899-1900 was a very favorable one here for winter 
and a comparison of the stand in fall and spring showed that 
was no appreciable loss from winterkilling. 

The Iowa and Ohio wheats rusted and lodged badly, while the Nebraska 
and Kansas wheats dad not suffer in this way. The Kansas </seg>

before the Iowa and Ohio wheats. There was eight days difference between 
the earliest and latest ripening grain. The yield and weight of 
grain seemed to depend upon early ripening. 

I All of these differences in growth of wheat from different states, 
it of the same variety, denote a ready tendency towards variation 
aich enables the plant to adapt itself to its new environment. 

The possibility of adapting a variety of winter wheat to regions of 
more severe winters is thus indicated. Such adaptation has actually 
een going on for a number of years, which may in some measure 
ccount for the fact that winter wheat is now being grown in portion* 
f Nebraska where twenty years ago it was considered an impossible 
rop. Wheat planted in a locality where the winter weather is more 
evere than that to which it has been accustomed will ordinarily 
winterkill more or less. This may be enough to produce a practical 
ailure of the crop or it may not, but the plants that do survive may 
&gt;ecome the basis of a hardier strain of wheat and the more severe 
le season the more valuable for seed are the plants that are left. This 
lould be borne in mind when one is in the act of deciding whether to 
low up in the spring a field of winter wheat that has been badly 
winterkilled. Consider whether you can get seed that has survived 
uch weather when you come to sow next fall. 

THE SOUBCE OF SEED SUPPLY. 

Another point brought out by this experiment is the fact that the 
locality from whicB seed is brought will make a very great difference 
in the success of the crop the first year. The difference in the latiti/He 
of the various localities from which the wheats were brought was not 
great, but there was considerable difference in the amount of annual 
rainfall in these regions. 

The winter hardiness of the plants cannot be said to have been 
tested, as the winter was a very favorable one and all came through 
successfully. The characteristics that produced the differences in 
yield were, time of ripening, ability to withstand rust, to remain erect, 
and possibility to utilize economically the available moisture in the 
soil. 

The wheats from more humid regions were obviously at a di«ad-

vantage, and this is undoubtedly worth considering when purchasing 
seed wheat. Whether on the other hand there is an advantage in 
bringing seed from regions of less rainfall has not been demonstrated. 

IMPROVEMENT OF WHEAT BY SELECTING LARGE, HEAVY 
KERNELS FOR SEED. 

In 1896 the Nebraska Experiment Station began an attempt to 
improve the quality and yield of wheat by selecting for seed kernels of 
more than average specific gravity. To select these kernels and separate 
them from the lighter ones a solution of calcium chloride in 
water was used. The solution was sufficiently dense so that when the 
grain was thrown upon it about half of the kernels floated and the 
other half sank. Those that floated were, of course, the light kernels 
and those that sank were the heavy. This method of separation accomplished 
the desired object, but was slow and cumbersome. An 
attempt was then made to use an ordinary seed fanning mill for the 
purpose, but it was found difficult to get a sufficient wind velocity to 
make an equal separation of the grain. After repeated attempts to 
get the plan on a practical basis a machine was discovered that was 
originally intended for a different purpose but which accomplished the 
separation satisfactorily and rapidly and which after undergoing some 
modifications is now being manufactured especially for this purpose. 
Another machine is now manufactured that is claimed to accomplish 

The machine operates by directing upwards a current of air, the 
velocity of which can be regulated. Into this current the grain is directed. 
The result is that the heavy kernels and the large kernels fall, 
and the light and small kernels are driven out. The separation thus 
accomplished is somewhat different from that effected by a solution, 
the difference being that the latter separates the kernels entirely 
according to their specific gravity while with the air blast a large kernel 
of a certain specific gravity might descend with the heavy kernels, 
t;n if it were smaller although of the same specific gravity it would 
blown out. 

The number of light kernels that descend on account of their large 
size is relatively small owing to the fact that large kernels are ma a 
rule of higher specific gravity than small. The following test was made 
to determine the relation between the size of wheat kernels and their 
specific gravity. An average lot of wheat was nearly equally divided by 
means of two sieves into three portions representing medium, small 
and large kernels. Each of these portions was then thrown upon 
solutions of the same specific gravity, and the proportion by weight 
that floated, or light seed, and the proportion that sank, or heavy seed, 
was determined. 

rhe weight of light kernels among the small was nearly twice that 
light kernels among the large seeds. </seg>

During the last two years a number of experiments have been made 

to ascertain the effect of this practical selection of large, heavy aged 

upon the yield and quality. 

In the fall of 1899 a quantity of Turkish Red winter wheat trrown at 

the station and cleaned in the fanning" mill was separated by the air 

current into two approximately equal portions. Each of these por- 

tions was again run through the air current. Of the heavy portion 

the heavy kernels obtained on second treatment were retained and 

designed "Heavy wheat." Of the light portion of the light kernels 

obtained on second treatment were retained and designated "Light 

wheat." These were planted on adjacent plots of land and beside 

them was planted the same variety of wheat but not treated other- 

wise than being cleaned in the fanning mill. The yields were as 

follows:

In the fall of 1900 a sample of the crop grown as "Heavy wheat" was 

separated into approximately equal parts by the air current, and the 

heavier portion again separated, the heavier portion being retained 

and called "Heavy wheat." The crop grown as "Light wheat" w«s 

similarly separated, but the lighter portion was retained in each ease. 

This was called "Light wheat." The two portions thus secured were 

planted on adjacent plots of land, as was also some of the wheat 

grown from the "Ordinary wheat" which seed was not treated except 

to clean with the fanning mill. The yields in 1901 were as follows:

This shows an actual improvement from one year to the other in 

toe yield of wheat and a still larger relative increase as compared with 

the ordinary seed. 

This is a rational method for improving the yield and quality of 

wheat, especially when used as auxiliary to selection and breeding of 
individual plants. It offers the farmer a simple and practical method 
for improving his seed. It will be given a continued trial at this 
station, and an attempt will be made to determine what proportion of 
the wheat it is desirable to discard on account of lightness and 

smallness of kernel. 

SUMMAKY. 

Of the 118 varieties of winter wheat tested during the last five years, 

Turkish Red and Big Frame have — hardiness and yield considered — 

been the best. 

In 194 tests of these two varieties during 1900-1901 in counties north 

of the Platte river or west of the 100th meridian, Turkish Red yielded 

better, but Big Frame proved to be somewhat hardier. 

Of the 194 tests in the region above described, there were nineteen 

riin of complete loss by winterkilling 1 . 

Some Russian varieties of wheat tested indicate great hardiness, and 

promise well for the northern portion of the state, especially if they 

can be made to mature earlier. 

The selection of large, heavy kernels for seed resulted, on the whole. 

in increasing substantially the yield over seed wheat not so selected. 
Wheats of the same variety, but grown in different portions of the 

country, when grown side by ride showed much difference in their 
habits of growth, which were greatly to the disadvantage of the seed 

grown east of the Missouri river. 

The tendency shown by these alien wheats to adapt themselves to 

local conditions when grown here for a number of years, encourage* 
the hope that Nebraska-grows seed may become adapted to all arable 

portions of the state. 

The yields of these wheats were nearly proportional to their tend- 

ency to early maturity. 

Kansas-grown seed matured earliest and yielded best, but entirely 

winterkilled when Nebraska- and Iowa-grown seed of the same variety 

passed the winter successfully. </seg>

EXPERIMENTS IN THE CULTURE OF THE SUGAR BEET 
IN NEBRASKA. 

¦ Li LTON AND A. T. WIAIfCKO, AQBICULTURAX EXPERIMENT 8TATIO5, 
NEBRASKA. 

INTRODUCTION 

P: experimental work in the culture of sugar beets upon the farm 
e Standard Cattle Company at Ames, Neb., during the season of 
followed plans similar to those of some years past and consisted 
in the main of tests of varieties, tests of fertilizers, different times and 
different distances of planting, and various methods of cultivation. la 
conjunction with these experiments an extended examination of the 
moisture content of soils under different conditions was conducted 
throughout the greater part of the growing season. Experiments in 
the production of sugar beet seed were continued, and among other 
matters the treatment of diseases and insect enemies affecting the 
sugar beet was given some attention. 

Through the liberality of the cattle company and the large amount 
of land devoted to experimental work it was possible to conduct most 
of these experiments upon a scale so large that the results should be 
of especial value to the beet sugar industry. Aside from the purely 
experimental work, over 2,000 acres of sugar beets growing under 
various conditions were kept under constant observation, and the 
results referred to, though they cannot be taken as conclusive evidence, 
are at least interesting and suggestive. 

As was explained in Bulletin 60 of this station, the land upon which 
the experiments were conducted is representative of the large region 
of country watered by the Platte and Elkhorn rivers and varies from • 
sandy loam to what is commonly known as gumbo, incidentally giving 
excellent opportunities for testing the relative merits of light and 
heavy soils for the production of sugar beets for factory purposes. 

Pe rather low yields per acre obtained may be attributed to the 
re drought which lasted the greater part of two months, beginning 
the second week in July. Under normal weather conditions 
tonnage would probably have been fully twenty per cent higher. 
On the whole, the season's experience showed to a remarkable, extent 
the drought-resistant qualities of sugar beets in comparison with 
other field crops. They were found superior in this respect to anything </seg>

CHARACTER OF THE SEASON. 

Bre was no lack of moisture at the beginning of the season as the 
as well filled with water when spring cultivation began and there 
n abundance of rain up to the first week in July, as will be seen 
'. record of rainfall given below. After the rain of July 4 the 
er suddenly became hot and dry, accompanied by a hot south 
which lasted over two weeks, so that the soil rapidly dried out 
and in many instances baked and cracked open to a depth of two to 
three feet. Extremely hot weather continued for some time and the 
drought remained practically unbroken until the end of the first week 
in September. The average temperature for the month of July was 84.5 
degrees Fahrenheit. 

Record of Rainfall at Ante*. 

TESTS OF VARIETIES 

OF SUGAR BEETS. 

Ran abundance of seed was at hand, two fields were selected for 
experiment, the one a sandy loam and the other a medium gumbo 
comprising about fifty and sixty-five acres respectively. The same 
ties were planted upon both fields and were given the same treatment 
as the other beet fields upon the farm. The former field is known 
as the "North Hager" and the latter as "Division D." 

In 1899 the North Hager produced a crop of sugar beets and in 1900 
a crop of corn which received a liberal dressing of barnyard manure, 
while Division D was in corn and sorghum during these two years and 
has never been manured. The latter was prepared for sugar beets by 
deep plowing in the fall of 1900 with the exception of a few strips 
where sorghum stacks were standing, which were plowed in the spring. 
The North Hager was plowed early in the spring, about a month before 

Immediately before planting, the ground was thoroughly "double 
disked," rolled, and dragged with a light harrow attached behind the 

Planting was begun on both fields on April 25 and continued uninterruptedly 
until completed. For the sake of convenience only one 
drill was kept at work on each field. Planting upon the North Hager 
was completed on May 1 and on Division D on May 4. The North 
Hager was in excellent tilth throughout, but the spring-plowed por-

to properly cover much of the seed. A spell of hot, dry weather retarded 
germination to a considerable extent, especially on Division D, 
where the first appearance of plants was very scattering. A heavy 
shower on May 8 melted down the lumps and by a timely use of the 
roller and harrow a good, even stand of plants was eventually secured. 

¦ plats on Division D consisted of two acres each, while on the 
Hager they varied from one to two acres owing to an uneven 
of the rows. 

Horse cultivation was begun on the North Hager on May 16, and on 
Division D on May 20. Both fields were treated in every respect aa 
ordinary fields would have been. The North Hager received somewhat 
more hand labor than Division D owing to its being very weedy. It wu 
hand-hoed about the middle of June and afterwards gone over twice to 
pull the large weeds, while Division D, being exceptionally clean, received 
only horse cultivation. 

Bthe plats were carefully examined from time to time but no 
nee could be detected between any of the varieties in respect to 
h or outward appearance. 

It will be noticed in the table below that the plats on a considerable 
portion of Division D gave very light yields. This was due to the fact 
that here the necessary cultivation was not given soon enough after 
the last heavy rain of the season, July 4, to put the ground into good 
condition before the severe drought set in and consequently much of 
the field became very hard and the beets suffered considerably, becoming 
quite yellow in appearance. Later, another attempt to cultivate 
the field was made but without effect as the ground had become 
so hard that the cultivator could not be forced to enter to the desired 
depth and even where this was possible the ground broke up into lumps 
too large to form an effective mulch. 

In comparing the varieties as to yield the result* on the North Hager 
may be considered fairly reliable as the soil conditions were quite 
uniform. The yields as given in the table below represent topped 
beets and are computed from the factory tared weights. Both fields 
were harvested during the latter part of October. The sugar content of 
the North Hager plats was probably somewhat affected by the presence 
of some "leaf spot," which affected the whole of the field. 

Sugar tests were begun on August 22 and were made at interval* of 
one week for seven weeks. The two fields were sampled on two conive 
days and the samples consisted of five beets each. The figures 
in the table below are the averages of the seven tests. </seg>

basis of total sugar per acre on the North Hager plats shows a 
variation from 2280 pounds for the lowest to 4205 pounds for the 
highest, a very considerable difference. But to make close comparisons 
between the varieties with only one year's test would hardly be 
just and might be quite misleading. 

EXPERIMENTS WITH FERTILIZERS. 

The object of this experiment was to determine the effects upon 
sugar beets of various complete fertilizers, single fertilizing constituents 
and combinations of the latter. The single fertilizers were in each 
case applied in two different quantities with a view to getting at the 
relative value of light and heavy dressings. The mixtures were made 
up of equal weights of the constituents. The accompanying diagram 
of the field, which also contained the planting and cultivation experiments, 
represents the arrangement of the plats. 

Each of the fertilizer plats consisted of one-tenth acre having twelve 
rows of beets. A thirteenth row was planted with each plat to separate 
it from its neighbor and for convenience in harvesting. 

The previous cropping and manuring of the ground was the nnw 
as that of the North Hager variety field, of which it was originally a 
part, being now separated by a deep drainage ditch. The field was 1 
prepared for sugar beets by deep plowing early in April. The fertilizers 
were carefully broadcasted upon the plats a few days before 
planting, which was done on May 11. The preparation of the seed bed 
and the planting were conducted as in the case of the variety fields. 
The ground was in excellent condition. 

Unfortunately a flock of chickens from a neighboring barnyard destroyed 
portions of the first four plats soon after the beets came up 
and it was found impossible to secure an even stand by replanting, 
though two attempts were made. However, enough of the original 
planting of each plat was saved to provide samples for the sugar tests.

The much greater average weight of the beets on the last two plats, 
16 and 17, may be accounted for* by the shelter derived from a strip 
of sorghum along the south side of the plats. The yield per acre wms 
not heavier because on each of the8e plats parts of two rows were 
missed by the planter. 
An examination of the above table, while showing small variations 
such as might be expected on equal-sized plats in any field, shows, upon 
the whole, a slight increase upon the fertilized plats. The results, however, 
do not point to any material advantage in the use of fertilizer* 
upon this land. 
Leaving out of consideration Plats 1. 2, 3, 4, 16, and 17, and calculating 
the average results for the fertilized and unfertilized plats, we get the 
following:

By referring to Bulletin 60 and the Fourteenth Annual Report of this 
station it will be seen that similar fertilizer experiments conducted in 
1898 and 1899 showed a slight increase in yield of beets from the use 
of fertilizers but no difference in the sugar content and purity of the 

METHODS OF CULTIVATION. 

The object of this experiment was to determine the effects of various 
systems of cultivation upon the yield and sugar content. The different 
systems tested are shown in the diagram of the experimental field. 

All the plats were treated in the ordinary way up to the time of the 
second cultivation. The hand-hoeing, given after the third cultivation, 
was the same for all plats and was simply sufficient to clear the ground 
of weeds. All plats were horse-cultivated five times. 

The "ordinary" cultivation was that practiced on other portions of 
the farm, consisting in a gradual deepening of the cultivated area with 
each successive cultivation until at the end of the season a depth of 
about four to five inches is reached. On the first plat a depth of about 
six inches was reached. On the second plat cultivation was begun at 

a depth of five inches and gradually made shallower as the season 
advanced, but this was found difficult owing to the looseness of the 
ground. The fourth plat was cultivated five inches deep throughout 
the season. The last plat was cultivated two to three inches deep 
throughout, but it was found that the mulch produced was not sufficient 
to protect the soil beneath during the drought and as a consequence 
it became rather more compact and dry than the other plats. 

A comparison between shallow and deep cultivation was attempted 
upon a large field but the extremely dry weather made it impossible 
to satisfactorily carry out the experiment. 

In Table V, below, the sugar content and purity of the juice represent 
the averages of five tests made at intervals of one week beginning 
August 26.

the results on the first plat should be so low, a study of the above 
table seems to indicate that moderately deep cultivation should be 
practiced. It must always be remembered that very deep cultivation 
will, late in the season, interfere considerably with the fine lateral 
roots of the beets, but in this climate of hot, dry summers with high 
winds the soil mulch in order to be effective must be three or four 
inches thick. 

In conjunction with the cultivation experiments, soil moisture determinations 
were made upon the deep and shallow cultivated plats to see 
the effect 0;f the depth of cultivation upon the moisture content of 
the soil. As has already been explained the deep cultivation was five 
inches, while the shallow cultivation was two to three inches deep 

throughout the season.

Prill be seen from the above table that the shallow cultivated plat at 
contained more moisture in the surface foot, which was probably 
,o the smaller proportion of loose, dry soil upon the surface, bat 
later in the season the moisture in this plat decreased more rapidly than 
in the case of the deep cultivated plat, which seems to indicate that the 
tper mulch was more effective in checking evaporation and consently 
that cultivation in this country in order to be as effective as 
sible in conserving soil moisture should be fairly deep. </seg>

DISTANCE OP PLANTING. 

On one plat in this experiment an attempt was made to get as many 
rows per acre as possible without increasing the difficulty of horse 
cultivation. The rows were placed 15 inches apart with every fourth 
space 18 inches. The idea was to use a one-horse, four-row cultivator 
and let the horse walk in the 18-inch space. The plants were thinned 
to eight inches apart in all the rows. In order to increase the ease of 
cultivation without reducing the number of plants per acre, a second 
plat, having 21 inches between the rows and six to seven inches between 
the plants in the rows, was planted. These two plats were compared 
with one having 18 inches between rows and 8 inches between plants 
in the rows. This plat was that designated "ordinary" in the cultivation 
experiment. All plats were cultivated alike. 

The result as recorded in the table below are in every respect in 
favor of the 18-inch rows. In the case of the 15-inch rows more or leas 
difficulty was experienced in the cultivation. Owing to the difficulty 
of securing an even stand of plants in the row it does not seem to be 
advisable to plant so far apart as 21 inches. Experience upon the large 
fields on the farm shows that with a little care at the beginning a 
horse or mule will soon learn to walk in a comparatively narrow space.

TIME OF PLANTING. 

This experiment was rather unsatisfactory owing to the fact that it 
was found impracticable to plant early upon the ground chosen for the 
experiment, and the last planting was a complete failure because of 
adverse weather conditions at the time the plants came up. 

The first plat was planted on May 11, a second on May 22, and a third 
on June 13. The interval between the second and third plantings was 
longer than that between the first and second, on account of wet 
weather. A heavy rain, followed by a scorching sun just as the plants 
were coming up, almost totally destroyed the stand. 

Ene season advanced there seemed to be an increasing difference 
growth of the two plats planted May 11 and May 22. and about 
d of July there appeared to be almost a month difference bethe 
two. The following table shows the results: </seg>

obtained upon the farm as a whole. A 38-acre field planted about June 
IS gave a yield of 13.5 tons per acre with an average sugar content of 
about 15 per cent. On another large field about half of which was 
Wanted about May 5 and the rest about three weeks later, the later 
&gt;lanting beside giving a slightly heavier yield gave about 1 per cent, 
more sugar than did the earlier planted portion. But these results may 
K&gt;ssibly be accounted for by the peculiarity of the season. The late 
planted beets did not receive the same check by the extreme drought 
which suddenly set in. The early planted beets had, during the rather 
wet weather which preceded, developed an unusually large proportion 
of leaves, which, when the drought came, the roots were nnable to support, 
while the later planted beets seemed to somewhat adapt themselves 
to the conditions. . 

On the whole, however, the season's experience indicates that, while 
good results may be obtained from late planting under favorable conditions, 
the chances of success are in favor of early planting. The 
Kfficulty of securing a good stand of sugar beets increases very marially 
as the season advances past the third week in Hay. A small 
field planted on April 13 gave a yield of 17 tons per acre, and two large 
fields planted about April 25 gave yields of 14.7 and 14.17 tons per acre 
respectively, but in all these instances the sugar content was low, which 
may be accounted for by the presence of some "leaf spot" and by a 
greater "second growth" during the rainy weather of September. 

EFFECTS OF LATE CULTIVATION OF SUGAR BEETS. 

In general field practice, sugar beets are "laid by" when the leaves 
re large enough to cover the space between the rows, further cultiation 
being thereby made difficult. On several fields cultivation was 
ttempted after this stage had been reached, as the ground had beome 
compacted by heavy rains early in July. The passage of the 
iorse and cultivator broke and tore off many leaves and more or le«s 
ruised the crowns of the beets, so that it was considered advisable 
o determine the effect upon the sugar content later in the season. 
Several pieces of rows that had been badly bruised were marked, as 
well as pieces of adjoining rows that were left untouched. During the

be found beneficial where the ground has become unduly 
ted. The harm done by leaf pruning may be more than countered 
by the more vigorous growth of the beets, especially when 
y weather follows. If the cultivating be done during the middle 
day when the leaves are more or less wilted, few will be broken 

In order to determine more fully to what extent the late cultivation 
of sugar beets may be beneficial, soil moisture determinations were 
made on August 15 upon adjoining portions of a small field half of 
which was laid by about the 1st of July and the remainder cultivated 
about the 10th and again about the 24th of July. The soil was a medium 
loam and, at the time of sampling, the former portion was quite hard 
upon the surface as a result of the heavy rain of July 4, while the 
latter portion was found to be quite loose and the soil moist to within 
two or three inches of the surface, representing an almost ideal condition. 
Carefully made duplicate determinations showed 17.3 and 14.4 
per cent of moisture in the first and second foot respectively of the 
late cultivated portion of the field, while that laid by about July 1 contained 
only 9.4 and 8.5 per cent in the first two feet. Similarity marked 
differences were found in more extensive examinations of cornfields 
similarly treated. 

EFFECT OF WEEDY VS. CLEAN GROUND UPON SUGAR CONTENT. 

Ethe assumption that the growth of weeds in sugar beet fields, 
from lessening the yields, may have a deleterious effect upon the 
content of the beets, it was determined to make some tests with

The tests were made during the first and second weeks of Octothe

EFFECTS OF WET WEATHER AND "SECOND GROWTH" UPON 
SUGAR BEETS. 

Et the sugar content and purity of the juice of sugar beets are 
or less reduced in cases where wet weather sets in at the time 
the beets should be ripening is a fact that has long been reeogand 
the common belief seems to be that this reduction takes 
very rapidly. 

In order to determine to what extent this is true, an extended comparison 
was made, as the weather conditions from the first week in 
September to the middle of October were particularly favorable for such 
an investigation. Owing to the dry weather preceding this period, the 
beets ripened very early and the sugar content and purity were unusually 
high. Soon after the first rain the beets freshened up and began 
a vigorous growth which continued up to the time of harvesting, so 
that their foliage then was more luxuriant than at any period in their 
growth.

It will be observed that the drop in the percentage of sugar was 
quite rapid during the first week, but a study of all the figures will 
show that the drop was more apparent than real and can be fully accounted 
for by the increase in the weight of the beets, which was probably 
wholly due to the water taken up. The fact that the purity of 
the juice fell so little bears out this view. Now allowing, for the purpose 
of a fuller comparison, 25,000 beets per acre and calculating the 
yield of sugar from the data at hand, we have in the first instance a 
total of 2,412 pounds of sugar per acre with a purity of 84.8 per cent. 
In the second instance the result would be 2,428 pounds of sugar having 

a purity of 84.1 per cent. In the latter instance, a month after the 
fresh growth and the drop in sugar began, the result would be 2,515 
pounds of sugar per acre having a purity of 81.7 per cent. These figures 
indicate that while the drop in the percentage of sugar is very 
considerable the damage is not so great as is generally supposed and 
the ultimate results go to show that it is the manufacturer and not 
the farmer who is the loser. 

It was observed during the experiment that the increase in the weight 
of the beets was due to a natural, healthy growth and buds did not 
appear on the crowns of the beets until near the end of the periixl. 
Had the beets been quite mature when the wet weather began, the fresh 
growth would probably have appeared in the form of buds and there 
would have been little or no increase in the weight of the beets to 
compensate for the loss of sugar. It is well known that buds grow at 
the expense of the sugar in the beet and where such are observed hariff 
should not be delayed. Even if the weather should turn dry a 
la sugar content can hardly be looked for. The buds once started 
will keep on growing. 

DISEASES OF SUGAR BEETS. 

A few experiments were made in the treatment of "leaf - 
(Cercotpora beticola) and a form of root rot, which appeared to be a 
species of Bhizoctonia. 

The root rot made its first appearance about the 15th of June and 
affected patches in several fields. The disease was recognized as the </seg>


            <seg id="p229">
229 

Uhizixtonia described by Dr. Duggar in Bulletin 163 of the Cornell 
University Agricultural Experiment Station. About a week later it 
was found to be spreading quite rapidly upon a corner of a large 
that had been laid by. Knowing that Rhizoctonia had been foiu 
grow particularly well in acid media, an examination of the soil was 
made and it was found by the litmus test to give a decidedly acid reaction. 
It was, therefore, determined to try the effect upon the disease 
of a liberal application of fresh, powdered lime on and around the 
affected portions of the field. All diseased matter was carefully 
lected and carried from the field. The lime was then liberally 
on the remaining plants and around the affected areas. Later examinashowed 
that the liming was quite effective in stopping the spread 
of the disease, in some cases even curing slightly infected plants, w 
on other untreated portions of the field the disease continued to spread 
for some time. A later experiment showed that the liming had no 
apparent effect where the diseased matter was not first removed. The 
lime, although quite fresh, seemed to have no injurious effect upo: 
green foliage, which was in many instances completely covered. 

While not considered conclusive, the results were very satisfa. 
and indicate that removing the diseased portions of plants and liberally 
applying fresh, powdered lime may do much to check the spread of this 
particular fungus.* In cases of underground rot the application of 
lime upon the surface seemed to have no effect. 

To determine the effect of liming the soil upon the root-rot fungus 
iPhylUttticta), ten acres of a field that had borne sugar beets the 
previous year, and where they had rotted considerably, were given a 
dressing of fifteen to twenty tons per acre of the refuse lime from 
the factory together with some cinders. The lime and cinders were 
plowed under and the beets planted on May 14. Not a trace of rot wu 
found upon the beets when harvested. While the result of a single 
experiment of this kind does not furnish sufficient evidence upon which 
to base a conclusion, it indicates that heavy applications of lime may 
produce conditions unfavorable to the development of certain root-rot 

¦ "leaf-spot" disease did not develop to any serious extent, so that 
was not a good opportunity to test the effectiveness of methods 
itment. 

Rin the season more or less trouble from both insects and leaf 
anticipated, and a spraying machine was secured. In 
would be possible to spray thirty to forty acres of sugar 
a day. 

This machine consisted of a one-horse cart upon which was set a 
hundred-gallon tank fitted with a double-acting pump which was geared

to the wheels of the cart. The piping was specially designed for the purpose 
in view and consisted of a main cross-pipe covering eight rows and 
having a short branch pipe with a fine nozzle at the end for each row. 
The piping was so arranged that it could be tilted up or down to suit 
the height of the beets and to avoid trouble from the blowing of the 
•pray by the wind. The working of the machine was in every respect 
satisfactory. No difficulty was experienced in evenly covering the 
leaves with the solution without its forming into drops and running 
off the smooth surface of the leaf, which is so often a source of trouble 
in properly spraying sugar beete. 

Buly 'JT slight traces of "leaf spot" were noticed upon several of 
&gt;t fields and a strip upon one of these was sprayed with Bordeaux 
e. The following day a light rain washed off some of the poison 
p treatment was repeated on August 1 and again on the 10th. 
portions of other fields were treated twice. On Septemlia 
careful examination for the effects of the spraying was made. On 
the fields where portions had been twice sprayed with the Bordeaux 
mixture there was no apparent difference between the sprayed and the 
unsprayed portions. All were affected more or less with the di^' 
But where the beets had been sprayed three times there was quite a 
noticeable difference, the foliage of the sprayed beets having a (n 
gTeen color and less "leaf spot." The indications seem to be that if 
the Bordeaux mixture be applied as soon as the first traces of "leaf 
•pot" appear and the applications repeated at intervals, the disease may 
be considerably checked, but where it has once secured a good foothold 
there seems to be little use in applying this fungicide. 

11 Paris green and lead arsenate were successfully used as I 
for the striped blister beetle and grasshoppers, in conjunction 
ihe Bordeaux mixture. These insects both seemed to be 
off the field but the grasshoppers returned after the poison had 
¦ hat dissipated. 

E significant observation in connection with the prevalence of 
t" was that in every case the disease made the greatest ro^i 
the earliest planted fields. In no case did leaf spot appear 
ts planted after the 1st of June. A partial explanation of this 
non may be found in the fact that the earlier planted fields 
ed a more severe check when the drought set in than did those 
of later planting. In the case of the late plantings, although the 
growth was slow it was steady all through the dry period. But 
Bthe same observation seems to have been made in previous years, 
may be that where "leaf spot" is troublesome rather late plant&gt;uld 
be advisable. In all cases there was more "leaf spot" upon 
eta on the lighter soils than upon those on the heavier, but this 
may have been due to the fact that all of the lighter soils were 
• planted. 

Kontinuation of the observations begun in 1899, and recorded in the 
eenth Annual Report of this station,* the following table is de- 
I to show the condition under which the beets were grown where

nected with more or less avoidable conditions and these oh 
if carried through a number of years may point them out.

ON OF MOTHER BEET- KI) PBODUCTIOlf. 

The production of sugar beet seed is an important branch of tho 
experimental work at Ames, and gratifying progress has been m:i 

I the purpose of next year's work some four thousand mother 
-i lected and placed in sand silos over winter. The method 
•ction employed was that known as the "Pellet cold aqueous difprocess." 
which is fully described in Bulletin 60 of this station, 
intended to try the new method worked out by R. S. Hiltner and 
Thatcher, and described in the Fourteenth Annual Report of this 
i,* but as the necessary apparatus was not at hand in time it had 
abandoned for this year. 

The mother beets selected were classified according to sugar content 
three classes: 14 to 16 per cent, 16 to 18 per cent, and 18 per cent 
and over, and kept separate in the silos. These beets will be planted 
spring. 

gthe spring of 1901 about 7,000 mother beets were planted three feet 
t each way and cultivated as is usual in the case of corn. The t 
about a ton of clean seed of excellent quality. The best of this 
will be planted this year for beets from which commercial seed 
be produced the following season. 

It is believed that by careful selection good seed for factory purposes 
can be produced at home and a large part of the cost of importation 
away with. It is hoped, too, that this seed will be better adapted 
to home conditions and that more uniform results may be secured.

THE TUBERCULIN TEST FOR TUBERCULOSIS. 

¦ E. SALMON, D. V. M., CHIEF OF THE BUBEAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY, V. S. 
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. 

IMMUNITY BY INOCULATION WITH BACTERIAL PRODUCTS. 

In 1882 the writer became convinced from the experimental evidence 
at hjs command that certain disease germs produced a chemical substance 
during their growth and multiplication which, if injected into 
the tissues of an animal, would induce immunity from the disease that 
these germs cause. In other words, he thought that the liquids in 
which the bacteria were grown in the laboratory might be used after 
the bacteria were killed or removed to protect animals from the disease 
caused by these specific bacteria. The experiments made at 
that time with the fowl-cholera microbe failed to confirm this theory, 
but later exepriments with the hog-cholera bacillus gave unmistakable 
proof of its correctness. These results were first published in 1886,* 
and additional evidence was published the following year.t 

IMPORTANT RESULTS OF THE STUDY OF IMMUNITY. 

The demonstration of this new principle in pathology led to numerous 
efforts to apply it in practice and to renewed activity in the study of 
the general subject of immunity by the various laboratories of the 
world. The result has been the extraordinary development of knowledge 
of the toxins and antitoxins, and the application of these substances 
to the prevention and cure of disease. Koch took up the study 
of the tubercle bacillus from this point of view and experimented with 
the culture media in which it had been grown. The high hopes which 
were raised all over the world by the announcement of the discovery 
by him of a substance which would act as a specific for tuberculosis 
are well remembered, as is also the keen disappointment which followed 
the practical tests of the new remedy. 

Eh observed that the administration of tuberculin caused an elevaf 
temperature in persons affected with tuberculosis, and he found 
extremely valuable means of recognizing the disease in the early 
i before bacilli appeared in the sputum and before any informaould 
be obtained by physical examination. 

K discovery at once became of interest to veterinarians, who had 
en embarrassed by the great difficulty of detecting tuberculosis 
le. The diagnosis of this disease was often uncertain, even

THE TUBERCULIN TEST FOR TUBERCULOSIS. 

when the lungs were badly affected; but when it was confined to the 
glands of the chest or to the organs of the abdominal cavity its presence 
in the great majority of cases was not even suspected during the 
life of the animal. The value of tuberculin for this purpose was tested 
during the years 1890 and 1891 by Guttman, Roeckl and Schutz, Bang 
and Salomonsen. Lydin, Johne and Siedamgrotzky, Nocard, and many 
tit was at once recognized as a most remarkable and accurate 
of detecting tuberculosis even in the early stages and when 
ase had yet made but little progress. 

TUBERCULIN TEST IN PRACTICE. 

The tuberculin test came into existence through the most careful and 
thorough scientific experimentation. In practice it is applied by first 
taking the temperature of the aminal to be tested, at intervals of 
about two hours, a sufficient number of times to establish the normal 
temperature of the body under the ordinary conditions of life. The 
proper -dose of tuberculin is then injected under the skin with a hypodermic 
syringe. The injection is generally made late in the evening, 
and the temperature is taken every two hours the following day, 
beginning early in the morning and continuing until late in the eveninp, 
if the fullest information is desired. Prom average temperatures 
calculated by de Schweinitz in 1896 of about 1,600 tests of tuberculous 
cows, it appears that in general the rise of temperature begins from 
five and one-half to six hours after the tuberculin is injected, reaches 
its greatest height from the sixteenth to the twentieth hours, and 
then gradually declines, reaching the normal again by the twentyeighth 
hour. 

A certain number of errors in diagnosis were, however, recorded in 
these early experiments which raised some question as to whether 
tuberculin was sufficiently accurate for universal adoption in the examination 
of cattle for this disease. The failures were of two kinds. 
A small percentage of the animals which showed an elevation of temperature 
were apparently free from signs of tuberculosis when examined 
after slaughter, and about an equal proportion failed to react, 
which upon slaughter proved to be diseased. Subsequent investigation 
showed, however, that the supposed errors might be largely reduced, 
first, by not recognizing any elevation of temperature less than 2* F. 
ma a reaction; second, by requiring that the temperature should go to 
about 104° F.; third, by taking into account the tuberculin curve of 
the chart; fourth, by giving a sufficient dose of tuberculin; and, fifth, 
by making a more careful search through the carcase after slaughter 
for signs of the disease. The diseased animals which failed to react 
were found to be either in an advanced stage of the disease (and this 
was easily recognizable by other means), or the disease had become 
arrested, and for the time being did not affect the system of the </seg>

EFFICACY OF THE TUBERCULIN TEST. 

In 1898, Bang, of Copenhagen, one of the highest European authorities, 
in his paper presented to the Congress for the Study of Human 
and Animal Tuberculosis, at Paris, said: 

"Numerous tests made in almost every civilized country have demonstrated 
that in the majority of cases tuberculin is an excellent means 
for diagnosing the existence or the nonexistence of the lisease, but 
giving us no positive information as to the extent to which the disease 
has progressed. When tuberculin produces a typical reaction we may 
be almost sure that there exists in the body of the animal a tubercular 
process. The cases in which a careful examiner has not succeeded 
in finding it are very rare; and I am led to believe that when, notwithstanding 
all the pains taken, it has escaped discovery, the reason 
is that it is located in a portion of the body that is particularly inaclile. 
Nevertheless, it is not to be denied that a fever, entirely 
accidental and of short duration, may in some rare cases have simulated 
a reaction. However this may be, the error committed in wrongly 
condemning an occasional animal for tuberculosis is of no practical 
consequence. 

"A worse aspect of the case is that there are some diseased animals 
in which tuberculin fails to discover the existence of tuberculosis. 
In most of these, no doubt, the deposits are old, insignificant, and 
generally calcified, or they are cases where the disease is arrested 
and perhaps in process of recovery, and which are possibly incapable 
of disseminating the contagion. But it is known that there are cases, 
not altogether rare, where tuberculin fails to cause a reaction in a 
highly tuberculous animal, and consequently one in which the disease 
exists in an extremely contagious form. For this reason a clinical 
examination should always be made of an animal which does not give a 
reaction, but which shows symptoms indicating that notwithstanding 
the test it may suffer from tuberculosis." 

Nocard, of Paris, wrote, also, in 1898, as follows: 

"The degree of certainty of the indications furnished may be stated 
n precise terms'. The observation of a clear reaction to tuberculin is un"•al; 
the animal is tuberculous. The pretended errors imputi 
he method are explained by the extreme sensitiveness of the reagent, 
which is capable of detecting the smallest lesion. It often requires proonged 
and minute researches in the depths of all the tissues to discover 
the few miliary centers, the presence of which has been revealed, 
["he reaction is absolutely specific. In those cases where it is observed, 
with animals which show lesions of another disease (actinomycoals, 
lydatid disease, verminous bronchitis, distomatosis), it may be affirmed 
hat there exists, in addition to these conspicuous changes, a tuberculous 
center which alone has provoked the reaction. 

'The failure to react doe* not necessarily imply absence of tuberculosis. 
Such failures of tuberculin are very exceptional. They are seen most </seg>


            <seg id="p237">
237 

Iuently with animals affected with tuberculosis in a very advanced 
e and made evident by plain external signs. Sometimes, also, there 
found at the post-mortem examination of animals which have not 
ted small fibrous or calcified lesions in such a condition that one 
mpted to believe them cured. Whether sterile or not, these lesions 
i no tendency to increase and they are not very dangerous from 
point of view of contagion."* 

These opinions of two eminent authorities, living in different 
countries, after long experience of their own and after stud 
the results of the many tests made in different parts of the w 
should have great weight; they coincide throughout and are essentially 
the same. A similar conclusion was reached from experiments 
made in the Bureau of Animal Industry in 1893. In the extended 
herd of the Washington Soldiers' Home, 60 animals were 
tested, all of which were afterwards slaughtered and carefulh 
nmined. Of the 60 animals tested, 49 reacted and 11 failed to r. 
Tuberculous lesions were found in 48 of the animals which rea. 
Five animals which did not react were also found to be diseased. One 
of these had a high temperature (103.6° F.) the day before the test, 
and this animal had extensive tuberculosis. The disease had been 
recognized in this animal from external appearance, and it had been 
isolated from the herd for from fifteen to eighteen months. Three 
other animals which did not react were in all probability stuti. 
cases of disease; the nodules were small and largely calcareous. In 
the remaining animal which failed to react, the lesions were also small 
and apparently confined to the glands. 

In 1897 Voges compiled statistics of tuberculin tests, the accuracy 
of which had been determined by post-mortem examination. Of 7,387 
animals tested, it appeared that errors had been made with 20' 
2.78 per cent.f In the work of the Pennsylvania Live Stock Sanitary 
Board, post-mortem examinations were made on about 4,400 reacting 
cattle, and the disease was found in all but 8 of those which had t 
characteristic reactions. 

P results of a much larger number of tests might be compiled at 
me. but they would not materially change the average of those 
f mentioned. It is plain that tuberculin is a remarkably accurate 
f tuberculosis; that the animals which react may be safely 
;red as tuberculous; and that when a careful clinical examinapracticed 
in addition to the test, there are few animals in a 
ous condition which escape detection. 

IS TUBERCULIN INFALLIBLE? 

Rirst questions asked by those who oppose the adoption of the 
ilin test are, Is this test infallible? and, If it is not infallible, 
ould it be forced upon the cattle owners of the country?

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

P answer to these questions it may be said that tuberculin is not 
ilutely infallible, and yet it is by far the best method of diagnostuberculosis 
that has been discovered. It is much better than any 
test known for pleuropneumonia when that disease was eradicated. 
Practically all the animals which react are affected with tuberculosis, 
and should be separated from the herd, not only in the interest of the 
public, but in the interest of the owner of the herd. The best authori,dmit, 
after studying many thousands of tests, that there are few 
if any mistakes made in condemning cattle which show a typically tuberculin 
reaction. The errors are principally in the other direction, that 
is, some tuberculous animals are not discovered by the tuberculin 
but as the most dangerous of these may be picked out by ordinary 
clinical examination, this fault of tuberculin is not so serious as it at 
first sight appears. This being the case, it should not be necessary 
to force the tuberculin test upon cattle owners. They should be 
anxious to adopt it in their own interests and for the protection of 
their patrons. There is today no greater danger to the cattle and 
swine industries than that which confronts them in the form of tuberculosis, 
a disease already widespread and rapidly extending. Without 
the use of tuberculin it would be impossible to control this disease, 
and the farmer and stock raiser would be at its mercy. With tuberculin 
its control is not a difficult matter, and badly affected herds may 
be converted into healthy herds in a few years, and without very 
serious loss or hardship. Tuberculin is, therefore, a great boon to the 
farmer — one of the most beneficial scientific discoveries of modern 

Many cattle owners have been prejudiced against the tuberculin test 
by incorrect or greatly exaggerated statements as to damage caused to 
¦¦ by the injection of tuberculin. Some of these statements have 
been based upon attacks of illness in no way connected with the tuberculin 
test. It was, for example, widely published that a valuable Shorthorn 
bull was seriously damaged in the Garfield quarantine station by 
being tested for tuberculosis. The facts are that this bull was purchased 
in Cireat Britain by a Canadian dealer for a breeder in the 
ed States at a very high price — a price which should have in-1 
an animal in the best condition. The animal arrived at the 
quarantine station without appetite and suffering alternately from 
diarrhea and constipation. Either it had been unduly forced and overfed 
or the effects of the sea voyage had been unusually severe. Howthis 
might be, it did not recover its appetite or condition while 
at the quarantine station. After it had been in quarantine fourteen 
days it was tested. At this time it was suffering from constipation. 
It did not show any unusual symptoms after the injection of the tuberculin, 
nor did it appear to suffer from it. Two or three days after the 
tuberculin was injected, and when the effects of the drug could no 
longer have existed, the attendant gave a purgative to counteract the </seg>

constipation. This medicine did not have the desired effect, but caused 
nausea, and evidently frightened the man in charge, who reported the 
facts to Dr. George W. Pope, superintendent of the station. Dr. Pope 
did not consider the bull to be in a serious condition, and gave a simple 
remedy, which restored the animal to its usual condition of health. 
The importer and the attendant both appeared to attribute the lack 
of condition and delicate health of this high-priced animal to the tuberculin 
test rather than to the real cause. 

CONCLUSIONS OF AUTHORITIES ON TUBEKCULIN TESTS. 

e persons have in recent years studied the effects of tuberculin 
have been revealed by tests covering vast numbers of animals, 
the present uncertain condition of the public mind in this counthe 
subject the writer deems it advisable to quote the coni 
of some of the best authorities. 

Nocard and Leclainche say: 

"Direct experiments and observations collected by thousands show 
that the tuberculin injections have no unfavorable effect. With healthy 
animals the system is indifferent to the inoculation; with tuberculous 
animals it causes only slight changes which are not at all serious."* 

Bang has written as follows on this question :t 

Swill now consider the following question, a very important one 
application of tuberculin, viz.: Can the reaction produce a 
condition in tuberculous animals than before existed? Hess 
tically states that it can, and on this account he earnestly warns 
against its application.* My attention has been directed to this question 
from the beginning. In my first publication on tuberculin injection! 
I reported two cases in which acute miliary tuberculosis was 
proved in two high-grade tuberculous cows several weeks after the 
tuberculin injection. I then stated my suspicion that perhaps the 
tuberculin injection had some connection with this, just as is often 
supposed to be the case in human pratice. With my present very large 
amount of material for observation at hand I may express the following 
opinion: Such an acute development of tuberculosis as a result of 
tuberculin injection is to be feared only exceptionally, and then in 
cases of advanced tuberculosis. It must not be forgotten that acute miliary 
tuberculosis by no means rarely accompanies an advanced tuberculosis of long 
standing. It is, therefore, impossible to offer strict proof of the causal 
connection with the injection, and only oft-repeated observation could 
make this probable.! In support of my view I offer the following: In

the course of the last three years I have made careful post-mortem 
examinations of 83 tuberculous animals which have been removed from 
my experiment farm, Thurebylille. Among these were 18 (or strictly 
speaking 23) high-grade tuberculous animals. I have been able to prove 
miliary tuberculosis in only 4 of these. Among the others, which 
showed less developed tuberculosis, I have never found miliary tuber~is, 
and with very many I have never found any sign of a more 
rapid development of the process. On the contrary, it has been proved 
that the disease was restricted locally, often for years, in spite of 
yearly repeated injections. Dissections were made at very different 
periods after the injections —in 17 cases from four to twelve days after 
the last test. In all of these cases earlier tests had been made months 
or years before. I • s the injection took place from nineteen 
days to two months before the butchering; in 3 of these cases earlier 
injections had been made. In 38 cases from two and one-half months 
to one year intervened between the last injection and the disseciion. 
Dissection gives the best explanation of this question, but a clinical 
observation, continued for years, of a herd tested with tuberculin can 
render very essential aid. If Hess's opinion is correct, it is to be 
assumed that tuberculosis must take an usually vicious course in such 
herds, but this I have been unable to prove. At Thurbylille then 
existed for three years a reacting division consisting originally of 131 
head and now of 69. Although these animals are yearly tested, and 
although most of them react every year, the division certainly appears 
to be made up of healthy animals, and the farm inspector has expressed 
the decided opinion that the tuberculosis in this division is no more 
developed than at the beginning of the experiment. The testimony of 
many owners of large herds of cattle which have long ago been in'1 
is to the same effect. I will adduce statements from several. 
A farm tenant whose cattle were injected twenty months previously, 
when *:i pe r cent of the grown animals reacted, wrote me recently as 
follows: 'Only 2 cows from the division of 100 head had been sold as 
decidedly tuberculous. The majority appeared afterwards, just as before, 
entirely healthy. The fat animals which had been slaughtered 
had been pronounced healthy by the butchers.' Another farm tenant 
with a herd injected in 1894 had not been obliged to remove a single 
animal from the tuberculous division, numbering 70 head. A large farm 
owner in Jutland stated in September that he had traced no undesirable 
result from the injection. His herd of 350 had been injected in 
February and about 75 per cent reacted. Similar answers have been 
given by other owners and veterinarians. 

"A veterinarian who has injected 600 animals, among them a herd of 
a large farm eighteen months previously, expressed the belief that the 
injection had produced in no single case an unusually rapid or vicious 
course of tuberculosis. In spite of a demand made months ago, I hare 
received thus far no report from any veterinarian of an undesirable </seg>

            <seg id="p241">

"On a large farm, on which before the injection tuberculosis had 
appeared in a vicious form, the owner had the impression tha' 
Ma had afterwards become more numerous. He had, however, 
not suffered severe loss, and eight months later the large i 
ing division by no means made a bad impression. Finally, it is to be 
noticed that tuberculin has l&gt;een employed on a large scale in Denmark 
for years, and still the demand from farmers constantly increases. 
This could certainly not be the case if the injections were generally 
followed by bad results." 

Ksaid, after the tests of the herd of Massachusetts Agricultural 
, "that its use is not followed by any ill effects of a serious or 
ient nature."* 

Kon, of the New Hampshire College Agricultural Experiment 
, said: "There is abundant testimony that its use is not in any 
jurious to a healthy animal."t 

E, who made a special study of the present attitude of Kuropean 
: towards tuberculosis in cattle, reached the following conclu- 

"It has been, from the first, thought by some that the use of t&gt; 
culin produces a direct injury upon the inoculated animals. This. ; 
ever, is undoubtedly a mistake, and there is no longer any belief 
where on the part of scientists that the injury thus produced is worthy 
of note. In the first place, the idea that it may produce the disease in a 
perfectly healthy animal by the inoculation is absolutely falla. 
The tuberculin does not contain the tubercle bacillus, and it is absolutely 
certain that it is impossible to produce a case of tuberculoan 
animal unless the tubercle bacilli are present. The use of tuberculin, 
therefore, certainly can never produce the disease in the inocn 

"It has been more widely believed, however, that the inoculation of 
an animal with this materal has a tendency to stimulate an incipient 
case of tuberculosis. It has been thought that an animal with a 
slight case of the disease may, after inoculation, show a very rapid 
MMon of this disease and be speedily brought to a condition where 
it is beyond any use. The reasons given for this have been the *pp 
activity of the tuberculosis infection in animals that have been si m 
tered shortly after inoculation. This has been claimed, not on! 
agriculturists who have not understood the subject well, but al~ 
veterinarians and bacteriologists. But here, too, we must recogniae 
that the claim has been disproved, and that there is now a practical 
unanimity of opinion on the part of all who are best calculate 
judge, that such an injurious effect does not occur. Even those 
have been most pronounced in the claim that there is injury thn 
suiting form tuberculin have, little by little, modified their claim.

at the present time they say either that the injury which they formerly 
claimed does not occur, or that the stimulus of the disease is so slight 
that it should be absolutely neglected, in view of the great value which 
may arise from the use of tuberculin. Apart from two or three who 
hold this very moderate opinion, all bacteriologists and veterinarians 
unite in agreeing that there is no evidence for believing that any injury 
results. In Denmark, especially, many hundreds of thousands of animals 
have been inoculated, and the veterinarians say there is absolutely 
no reason in all their experience for believing that the tuberculin inoculation 
is followed by any injurious results." 

S1898 tuberculosis was found in the large Shorthorn herd belonging 
r . C. Edwards, of Canada, who with commendable promptness and 
ic spirit had his animals tested, and at once proceeded to separate 
diseased from the healthy animals. These were all finely bred 
als, and the very class which we have been told are most si. 
to the injurious effects of tuberculin. After using this test regy 
for two years, Mr. Edwards wrote as follows: 

B.ve seen nothing to lead me to believe that the tuberculin test 
y injurious influence on the course of the disease. It is by no 
our opinion that the disease has been stimulated or aggravated 
application of the tuberculin test. All animals that we have 
two or three times continue as hale and hearty as they were 
sly, and not one animal in our herds has broken down or failed 
way since we began testing."* 

E-. Edwards, in December, 1901, verbally stated to the writer that 
views as to the harmlessness of tuberculin remained unchanged, 
that he had not seen the least ill effect with any of his cattle from 

EXPERIENCE OF STATE AUTHORITIES IN THE SUPPRESSION OF 

TUBERCULOSIS. 

i order to learn the experience and views of the various state auities 
engaged in the suppression of tuberculosis by means of the 
rculin test, inquiries were made of them as to whether any inus 
effects had resulted from the use of tuberculin in their work, 
replies are summarized as follows: 

C. J. Bell, secretary of the Board of Agriculture and Cattle Commission, 
Vermont: My experience the last four years as one of the cattle commissioners 
in Vermont leads me to believe there is no injury to healthy 
cattle by the use of the tuberculin test in sections of the state that are 
troubled with abortion, and that is in nearly all parts. This trouble is 
just as likely to occur in sections where herds have never been tested 
with tuberculin as elsewhere. Since January 1, 1895, some 85,000 or 
90,000 head of cattle have been tested in Vermont, and the cattle commissioners 
serving before me will stand by the statement that up to

date we have no reason to believe any healthy cow has been injured 
by the use of tuberculin. But when cattle are diseased with tuberculosis 
its use is sometimes injurious. 

E Austin Peters, chairman of the Board of Cattle Commissioners, Mutt* 
l»: I do not think tuberculin does any harm to cattle if properly 
I think that cows just on the verge of calving are perhaps not fit 
•ts for the test, and also think perhaps harm may have been done 
j use of syringes that were not properly cleansed, or by tuberhat 
had been opened and allowed to stand, or something of that 
but, ordinarily, I do not think the tuberculin test does any harm 
ilthy cattle. 

In regard to its causing abortion, I suppose that all abortions among 
cows that have been tested with tuberculin are blamed to the use of 
this agent; but I doubt if any more abortions occur now than did 
before it was used. Prior to the use of tuberculin people had to try 
and blame something else. I remember an instance, when we had a 
great deal of infectious abortion in Massachusetts, where a farmer, in 
Worcester county, had 15 out of 16 cows abort during one winter. If 
this had been after the discovery of tuberculin, and that herd had been 
tested with tuberculin the previous autumn, the abortions, of course, 
would all have been blamed to tuberculin. I think the tuberculin test 
is used by some farmers and breeders as a scapegoat for all sorts of 
misfortunes, in many instances where the fault is due to their own 
lack of care. Many herds of cattle, owned by various farmers, have had 
tuberculosis introduced among them as the result of buying a purebred 
bull from some breeder; and many of the breeders of pure-bred 
stock have been breeding tuberculosis as carefully as they have cattle 
for a great many years. 

re I have been a member of the board (December, 1896) a large 
number of animals have been tested with tuberculin. In 1896, 8,909 
head of neat stock were tested, of which '4,694 were condemned as 
having tuberculosis. In 1897, 9,991 head were tested and 5,435 were 
condemned and paid for as tuberculous. In 1898 the legislature thought 
tin' commission had been spending too much money, and the board was 
given a smaller appropriation, and did not do much work, but animals 
lironp-ht into the state from without its limits were still required to be 
I with tuberculin, and during the year nearly 27,000 head of cattle 
for dairy or breeding purposes were brought into Massachusetts. In 
1899 about 25,000 head of cattle were brought in from without the state, 
which were required to be tested with tuberculin, and a few herds were 
d at the request of the owners, who wished to eradicate the disease. 
In the latter way 565 animals were tested, of which 480 were released. 
During 1900, 21,000 have been brought in from without the state, upon 
which a tuberculin test has been required, and a few herds have been 
tested at the request of the owners — 291 animals, of which 227 were 
released. We have had no complaints from any of the owners of injuries 
to their cattle as a result of the tuberculin test. </seg>

Franklin Dye, secretary of Commission on Tubermlnxls in Animals, Sew 
u: W« have the records in our office of about 10,000 tests, in round 
figures. ina&lt;le during 1 the last year (1900), and have been unable as yet 
tu trace satisfactorily a single instance where abortion has been produced 
by using the tuberculin test. There are a few dealers who claim 
that it is injurious to cattle under some conditions, but this MMMi 
from a class who do not like the law, and are opposed to it because it 
Mended with a little extra work and some expense; but no respectable 
dealer who is willing to comply with the law, and believes at th&lt;&gt; 
time that the protection it affords is beneficial, makes the least 
i ion. As there is no doubt as to the prevalence of tuberculoiv

into our country, we regard the precaution not only good, but an

l&gt;r. l.i o mini Vearmm. state veterinarian. Pennnyhania: I have made. 
iive had made under my supervision, about 100,000 tuberculin I 
and I have known of but one instance wherein it was even susp. 
that tuberculin had the effect of causing abortion. This case is one that 
occurred recently, wherein two cows aborted in a herd of about 7.1 
members on the day following the test. I do not, however, believe 
that the test had anything to do with the abortion in this case, and 
am inclined to ascribe the accident that occurred to causes disassociated 
with the use of tuberculin. I think I can be very positive on this point, 
because if tuberculin had any influence whatever in producing abortion 
it would certainly be apparent in more than two cows out of nearly

information in regard to the results of the inspections that have

lin was used. 

The three largest owners of dairy cows in the eastern states are the 
Fair-field Farm Dairy at Caldwell, X. J., Briarcliff Farms in Westcb 
county. N. Y., and the Walker-Gordon Laboratory Company, with 
branches in all of the principal cities. AH of the cows added to the herds 
on these farms are tested with tuberculin, and I have personal knowlthat. 
the herds have been in far better condition since this practice 
was inaugurated than before. Many of the cows that are purchased 
for these farms are heavy with calf, and' are tested in this condition. 
Instead of having any influence in the direction of causing abortion this 
accident occurs less frequently than before the test was used. The 
owner of one of these herds has told me than the tuberculin trwortli

tin' contrary, they remain in pood condition and are sold fat. 

In the report of thi- Pennsylvania department of agriculture for ISM 
it was stated that there was no reason whatever to belive that tuberculin 
ever injured cows, and no reports of suspected injury had been 
received. Such reports have been solicitd. and none have come t. 
attention with the exception of the one mentioned at the beginning of 
Vtter. It is my experience that the tul&gt;ereulin test is in grt 
demand in those parts of Pennsylvania where it has been used most and

of no alleged cases that have any foundation in fact. 

From January 1, 1809. to August 7, 1900, there were tested at I'nion 
Stock Yards. ( hicago. for shipment to points in this state, in round 
numbers. 7,000 head. The cow brokers, shippers, and dealers, who have 
used every possible argument that could l&gt;e trumped up in oppoto 
the enforcement of these regulations, have maintained that among 
the imported cattle tested there were frequent eases of abortion which 
they allege are chargeable to the tuberculin test; but this board is of 
opinion that the tuberculin test is not responsible for any of these 
I of abortion. It stands upon the record of observations made 
during its four and more years of experience. Among those dairymen 
in this state who have had their cattle tested annually for a number 
ars there has never been any complaint whatever from abor 
I am of opinion that an authentic case can not be produced. 

Dr. M. H. Reynold*, veterinarian tn M Hoard of Health, Minnesota: Two 
thousand two hundred and ninety-four cattle have been tested by me

duty to look over thousands of records in the course of our state I 
during the past three years. While doing this work nothing has 
occurred which would make it reasonably appear that any of these 
cows had lost their calves under circumstances that could fairly If.

the course of my experience with tuberculin is contained in a table

367-371). The station herd at the time of this test was composed 
mainly of nervous, sensitive, high-type dairy cows. Anyone at all 
familiar with this class of cattle ought to understand readily that the 
herd could not have given practically the same total milk and total 
butter fat during the week of test as during the week preceding test, 
if the agent used or any circumstances connected with the test had even 
moderately disturbed the cows. We have never had an abortion occur 
in the station herd since the test was introduced here that could be 
in any way attributed to the tuberculin test, although the test is conducted 
without any regard to the condition of pregnancy. The only 
point taken especially into consideration is that the test is probably 
not quite so reliable during the last week or so of pregnancy. 

Dr. J. I. Gibson, state veterinarian surgeon, Iow&gt;a: There have been tested 
under my supervision in Iowa upward of 4,000 cows, in all stages of 
pregnancy, and it has not come to my knowledge that a single cow 
has aborted apparently as a result of the test applied, which fact warrants 
me in saying that from my personal knowledge and experience 
with the test it does not produce abortion, and further, that it is not 
detrimental to nontuberculous animals. 

Riy opinion there is absolutely no reason for complaint of ini 
effects when the cattle are properly and carefully tested. A 
set of attendants can abuse a herd of cattle a great deal during 
and when they do the owners charge the ill effects to the action 
tuberculin which is not in any way responsible in my judgment. 

WAI. CONCLUSIONS KEGARDING THE TUBERCULIN TEST. 

Those who have had most experience with tuberculin have, consequently, 
failed to observe any injurious effects following its use upon 
healthy cattle. With tuberculous cattle it produces a fever of short 
duration, and in the great majority of cases all derangement of the 
system which it causes disappears within forty-eight hours after the 
tuberculin is administered. There appear to have been a very few 
f r ii in which the disease was aggravated, and a greater number in 
which it was benefited by the injection of tuberculin. The cases of 
abortion following the tuberculin test have not been numerous, even 
when cows were tested within a few weeks of the normal time of 
calving. The few cases of abortion which have occurred may be explained 
by the fact that abortion in cattle is a very common occurrence, 
and that it would inevitably happen sometimes after the tuberculin 
test as a mere coincidence, and without any relation between 
the test and the loss of the calf. The cases of abortion which hare 
cited to appear to be no more numerous than might be expected to 
have occurred among the same number of cattle within the same period 
if the test had not been applied.

it may be safely concluded — </seg>

RESPONSE TO ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 

(Delivered by John Wain. Pawnee City. Neb., before the Nebraska State 

Swine Breeders' Association at Lincoln.) 

Mr. Pretident and Fell ¦¦ Breeders: Some time ago your committee 
on program notified me that they had chosen me to respond to 
Professor Burnett's address of welcome. While I felt myself unequal to 
the occasion and thought you might have made a better selection from 
among the breeders of the state, yet I felt it my duty to comply with your 
request, and assure you that it is with a feeling of pride and sense of 
honor that I undertake the work assigned me. And as you did not first 
consult me, you will be held, in a measure, responsible for my success 
or failure. 

The professor's address is a very practical one, and full of good things, 
calculated within itself to give you much encouragement in your noble 
work. The cordial greeting and hearty welcome so generously extended 
on the part of the State University and citizens of Lincoln is another 
manifestation of the esteem in which you are held, and the merits of 
your worth as a factor in building up and developing one of the greatest 
and most important enterprises of our great state. Yes, every county, 
city, or town, and every enterprise in the state fully appreciates the results 
of your efforts, either directly or indirectly. And since the hog business 
represents so great a part of the wealth of our state, the greater the 
responsibility resting on each and every breeder to do good or harm to 
the interests of the state or county or locality in which he lives. 

I wish to state right here that the swine breeders are much indebted 
to our state experiment farm for valuable information rendered regarding 
their feeding tests, value and nature of the different kinds of feeds, 
and their efforts. And we also appreciate the valuable advice of our state 
veterinarian, Dr. Peters, regarding the care of our hogs in keeping them 
healthy and free from vermin. His advice along the line of disinfection 
has certainly done a great deal toward checking the development and 
spread of disease. While we have done a great work in the last few years 
In Nebraska in making two good pure-bred pigs grow where but one 
grew before, we have created two acres of alfalfa or clover to pasture 
them on where we had but one before; and in the same ratio have we displaced 
scrub pigs by the sale of good pure-bred ones. So that now every 
up-to-date farm in our state bears evidence of that fact. Yes, and while 
I think of it, I have been recently informed that Professor Burnett's best 
old Tamworth sow has recently farrowed eighteen pigs where she only 
had nine before; and that the whole business is alive; and that Lancaster 
county expects soon to be able to supply all Europe with all the bacon </seg>

she wants, without a bit of fat on it. Now -you breeders of broad-backed 
type of hog at first thought would naturally conclude that it is a mighty 
poor hog that has no fat, would you not? Such, however, is not always 
the case, for this old sow is not without merit. She has proven that she 
is prolific, and that she is a milker, — two very desirable qualities for any 
breed to possess; and without these qualities to a reasonable extent our 
hogs would be a failure, and would prove themselves impracticable in the 
hands of our farmers. This and some of the relative subjects are some 
of the things we breeders must think about. We are Drone to emphasize 
the blood of too many animals, which can win on their form in the show 
ring, but would fall in a contest in the farmer's farrowing pen, pasture 
fields, and feed lots. We base too many breeding records on show and not 
enough on intrinsic merit. We are inclined to follow too much after 
fashionable form and pedigree, and don't stick long enough to one type 
already possessing good form, feeding qualities, size, and proliflcnesa to 
get these characteristics firmly established, until the makers of fashion 
will again say, "Thumbs up!" And when Simon says "Thumbs up!" 
there appears to be no alternative. And we at once begin the operation of 
attempting to blend a type of hog with what we already have, possessing 
different characteristics, and tear down much that we have been yean 
at building up. Let me say again that these are some of the problems 
that each and all of us must think about and solve for ourselves, lest we 
tear down in the future what we have built up in the past. 

BACON SWINE IN THE UNITED STATES. 

(Paper read by Prof. Thomas Shaw, St. Paul, Minn., before the Nebraska 
State Swine Breeders' Association at Lincoln, Neb.) 

I This question has been considerably discussed by the agricultural press 
the country and on various platforms in the. same. Heretofore the dl»-ssions 
have been almost entirely in the one direction and the conclusions 
reached have all been in the same line. The growers of swine hare 
said, as it were with one voice, that there is no place for the growing of 
bacon in this country. In fact they have assumed that tone in their conferences, 
which implies that they look upon the discussion of the question 
as an impeachment of the wisdom of the methods which they have 
adopted in growing swine during past decades. And they are inclined 
to resent the bacon idea by poking fun and pointing ridicule at the men 
who dare to say a word in favor of growing bacon types of swine in this 
country. It should not be forgotten, however, that poking fun and polnt- 
t ridicule at men who are proclaiming the truth will never destroy the 
i. It may, like a dam, arrest its progress. But truth thus pent up 
at length so accumulate in volume that it will overflow and break the </seg>

dam and carry It away until its very sight is obliterated. That Is what is 
happening to the honest and well meaning men who. with ill considered 
haste, threw what they believed was an impregnable dam in the way of the 
dual purpose cow idea. Their dam is broken. Already are they beginning 
to call upon the rocks and the mountains to fall on their idea and to hide 
it from the face of coming generations. And this in our judgment will 
be the fate of the men who are filling the air with savage threatenings 
against the bacon idea. 

IMPORTANCE OF THE QUESTION. 

In our judgment no more important question confronts the growers of 
swine to-day. The question of breeds is only a little pigmy compared with 
the gigantic question of lard and bacon swine. It means more to the 
country than many shall ever know. Millions in our judgment are bound 
up in it, since it bears directly on the stamina of swine, upon their prolificacy, 
upon correct methods of feeding swine and also the soil, and upon 
providing for man the kind of pork which is most to his liking. With 
advantages so potent bound up in the Idea how can it be restrained? It 
may be fettered for a time, but it will sometime break those fetters as 
easily as Samson broke the green withs used by the Philistines in binding 
him. And like the released soul of old John Brown whose body lies a 
mouldering in the grave, it will go marching on. 

THE GROUND TAKEN. 

Bask where do I stand on this question. Farmers of the corn belt, 
answer. I am not creedless on this question. I have no faith in 
ho boast about their creed lessness. It is men who can give a reason 
; faith that is in them who move the world. I do not look for the 
idea to prevail in this country, as it does in Canada or in Denmark, 
for many years to come, if indeed ever, especially in the corn belt. I do 
not, therefore, plead for the bacon idea to capture the British bacon 
market as those countries have, but rather because of what there is in 
the idea for us. My contention is that we can grow bacon pork more 
cheaply pound for pound than we can grow lard pork. And when we do 
grow it we have a superior quality of meat. We can grow bacon more 
cheaply because swine thus grown are more prolific, they are less liable 
to disease, and can better resist disease when it comes. Such pork is more 
E'd by the consumer and will eventually command a higher price and 
&gt;diflcations necessary in growing it will have a beneficent influence 
Industry and on the maintenance of fertility in land. 

BACON SWINE ARE MORE PROLIFIC. 

That the bacon types of swine are more prolific than the lard types 
will not be questioned. The only uncertainty regarding it is the percentage 
of the increase in prolificacy. It is impossible to get exact figures 
on such a question. But the claim will be moderate which assumes that </seg>

            <seg id="p251">

BACON SWINE IN THE UNITED STTATE8. 

while the average reared litter from the lard types will not be more than 
six, the average reared litter from the bacon types will not be less than 
eight. This means, therefore, increased productiveness in the bacon 
types to the extent of 25 per cent. In other words the man who winters 
over 20 brood sows of the lard types to accomplish a certain result will 
only have to winter over 15 bacon sows to accomplish the same result. 
He will therefore effect a saving of the food of maintenance for five brood 
sows for a whole year, while the result in production will- be the mum. 
Apply this to the millions of brood sows in the United States and the 
sum will run up into the millions every year, and owing to the intimate 
relation between prolificacy and good milking qualities the bacon bows 
will feed their offspring better during the nursing period. 

BACON PIGS LESS LIABLE TO DISEASE. 

K bacon swine are much less liable to disease than other swine will 
questioned by those who know the facts. The unsettled point here 
the extent of that greater immunity from disease which they possess. 
They are less subject to disease than lard swine because they are 
more rationally fed. They are not so much restricted to a corn diet as 
swine usually are of the lard types, and as a result they have better bone 
and more activity than the former, and also more inherent stamina. 
When, therefore, hog cholera swoops down on the lard swine, in too many 
Instances they unresistingly, as it were, lie down and die, while the bacon 
types will make a brave fight for life, and in many instances they prove 
more than a match for the dread disease. It may well be called a dread 
disease. It is the great grim giant who, during the past decades has bean 
stalking all over the corn belt and throwing down the bold challenge 
"Give me a man that we may fight together." And up to the present time 
no one has been found who could send a stone in his forehead and bring 
him to earth. The giant has cost the swine growers in the United States 
millions and millions of dollars, even hundreds of millions in the aggregate. 
In our own experience with hog cholera at the Minnesota experi- 
B station, we found that the mortality among the bacon types was 
less than the mortality among the lard types. This experience has 
;eneral where the two types have been grown. The bearing of this 
:he question of relative profits is so direct that it is not necessary 
ill upon it further. 

BACON TYPES MORE CHEAPLY GROWN. 

It has been demonstrated that pound for pound bacon pork can be grown 
as cheaply as lard pork. Now comes the rain of shot and shell. Hold on 
farmers, one at a time. Let us reason this question out. This is contrary 
to the general idea. I know very well that the grower of the very 
compact lard swine will claim with much positiveness that his swine will 
make pork more cheaply pound for pound than the bacon animal, and the 
findings of the law of physical conformation bearing on this point are </seg>

            <seg id="p252">
252 


with him. Other things being equal, the compact animal is the Mriwr 
feeder. But in this instance they are not equal. The bacon animal has 
superior vigor. This extends to the digestive organs, hence it fully 
offsets the advantage the other has in physical conformation in its general 
bearing on easy feeding qualities. It is not surprising therefore, that at 
certain of the experiment stations it has been found that a pound of bacon 
pork may be made as cheaply as a pound of lard pork. The results from 
experiments made at the Ontario, Iowa and Minnesota stations have all 
shown that a pound of bacon meat can be made as cheaply as a pound 
of lard meat. The various experiments conducted under my personal 
supervision and covering a period of about 12 years tell the same story. 
If, therefore, a pound of bacon meat can be made from the living animal 
as cheaply as a pound of lard meat, and if, as has been shown, bacon 
swine are more prolific and suffer less from disease than the lard types, 
then we are shut up to the conclusion that bacon swine are more profitable 
than lard swine, unless it can be shown that lard swine will bring more 
pound for pound in the market. We will now look into this aspect of the 
question. 

It would not be correct to say that the difference in price between the 
bacon and the lard types of swine in this country has been very much in 
the past. Nor would it be correct to say that bacon meat has always been 
the dearer. But it is correct to say that during recent years this difference 
has usually been in favor of carcasses of the bacon types to the extent 
of 10 to 25 cents per 100 pounds live weight. That this difference Is 
likely to increase is what may naturally be expected, as, if the bacon carcass 
makes better eating than the lard carcass our people are going to find 
it out. They are finding it out now, hence the influence on price, and as 
time goes on we may naturally expect this preference to assert itself more 
and more and to compel growers to produce bacon swine whether they 
want to or not. 

But profit will arise in another way. To grow bacon swine much more 
protein is required than to grow lard swine. This means that legumes, 
the great soil enriching plants, must be more grown. This will mean that 
under the bacon idea the soil will grow richer, while under the lard idea 
it will grow poorer. Better crops will therefore, be reaped when bacon 
swine are grown and consequently enhanced profits. 

TWO METHODS OF GROWING BACON. 

There are at least two methods of introducing the growing of bacon 
Into the corn belt. By one of these two great bacon breeds, the Tarnworth 
and Large Yorkshire, will be introduced and by the other the 
existing breeds will be modified more or less in form, and also the 
method of rearing them. As is known to many these two breeds have 
only been introduced into the United States in their present form within 
the last decade. As a result their merits are not well known. The 
prejudice against them is strong and it is as unreasonable as it is strong. </seg>

            <seg id="p253">
253 



The Tamworth especially is an object of ridicule because his snout is 
long. These breeds have been compared to greyhounds. Men on institute 
platforms have called them razor backs. They forgot when they 
talked thus that the ancient Tamworth is one of the oldest of the improved 
breeds. They never knew perhaps .that the Tamworth gave the 
Berkshire breeds much that is best in them and through the Berkshire 
to the Poland China. They do not know probably that the sandy color 
of the excellent Duroc- Jersey comes from the Tamworth. They have not 
considered that the color and many of the characteristics of all the other 
white breeds in America come from the Yorkshires. 

By simply Introducing and growing these breeds in the pure form 
it would take a long time to appreciably affect the production of bacon 
in a country so large, but the work can be accelerated in another way. 
Good Tamworth and Yorkshire sires may be crossed upon the grade 
females of the other breeds, so numerous in the land. The outcome 
is an animal of fine development and excellent feeding qualities. Two 
or three generations of such crossing should make a really good bacon 
type. In this way the land would soon be filled with bacon swine. 
Experiments conducted by the writer to accentuate this idea have been 
markedly successful. The results from these crosses, wherever they 
¦have been judiciously tried, have in nearly all instances given much 
satisfaction. 

But there is another way by which pork may be produced that will at 
least more nearly conform to the bacon idea. By this method the prevailing 
breeds will be modified in form. They will be given somewhat 
longer bodies and sustained by somewhat longer limbs and they will be 
more grown on protein foods. The change in conformation will be 
brought about by selection in breeding. With the change will come increased 
prolificacy, more stamina and pork better adapted to the present 
trend of the popular taste. But it will be objected that such changes 
would turn backward the wheels of what was considered improvement 
during the last 50 years. The aim during all, or nearly all those years 
was to secure increased compactness and smoothness of form, and to insure 
easy feeding and quick maturing qualities. In these respects the 
breeders of the past have done a good work. But it has been carried too 
far. In our judgment the wheels should be reversed for a time at least, 
in order to recover what has been lost. 

It will probably be answered that the present standards for the breeds 
are in the way of such changes. Even so, change them if necessary. 
Standards were never intended to be stumbling blocks in the way of 
improvement, but rather spectacles for those who do not see well. The 
breeders are above the standards rather than the standards above the 
breeders. If the standard now calls for a short back it should not be 
a great task for the association to change it so that it will read moderately 
long, instead of short, and so of other needed modifications. </seg>

OBJECTIONS OFFERED TO THE BACON IDEA. 

The most common objections offered to the bacon Idea in the corn 
belt are, first, that it costs more to grow a pound of meat of the bacon 
type and second, that if bacon types were introduced they would soon 
revert to the lard types. The first objection has been anticipated and 
answered. I claim that it has been demonstrated that it is in the interest 
of the swine breeders to grow swine conformed more or less to the 
bacon idea. This will hold true regardless of the requirements of foreign 

The argument that the bacon types will revert to the lard types in The 
corn belt implies that the methods of growing swine in the corn belt, 
like the waters of the brook, will go on forever as they are conducted 
now. But why should these methods continue? Would it not be better 
to modify methods somewhat that would give better pork, healthier swine, 
and renovated lands? Such results would surely be better than present 
methods wt'.l swine vitiated in stamina and dwarfed in size and bone by 
feeding thcr oo much corn.

MY EXPERIENCE IN FEEDING LARGE RATIONS OF 
ALFALFA TO HOGS. 

(Paper read by G. H. Payne, of Omaha, Neb., before the State Swine 

Breeders' and Duroc-Jersey Breeders' Associations at Lincoln, Ne- 

braska, January 20, 1903.) 

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: When our most genial host, Dr. Peters, 
telephoned me he had honored me with a place on your program and 
assigned me the above subject, I was very much surprised, because I am 
not a public speaker, in any sense, and my experience in the feeding line 
is somewhat limited. Alfalfa is a great subject. The more you see of 
alfalfa, the more you hear about alfalfa, the more you want to talk about 
alfalfa. It is one of the handsomest field plants that grows, being the 
first thing to show green in the spring and the last to lose its beautiful 
color in the fall. The sheep love it, the cattle live on it, the chickens 
grow fat on It, the pig will run for it. It is claimed (?) the Mormon </seg>

makes tea of it and the Indian smokes it — but perhaps you can take the 
last two statements with a few grains of salt. I told Dr. Peters he would 
be sorry for assigning this subject to me and you also will be before I 
am through — but to the subject. 

My experience in feeding alfalfa to hogs is not extensive, although I 
have studied the subject very carefully for the last few years, being interested 
for some time in a small ranch at Sidney, Neb., where we run 
about 2,000 cattle and put up from 1,000 to 1,200 tons of alfalfa per year; 
and also being interested in several farms at North Platte and Lexington, 
in the heart of the alfalfa belt. 

We have watched with much interest the experiments that have boon 
carried on at the various state experiment stations. We also having 
noted the numerous claims made by various farmers and others in the 
alfalfa country, of the wonderful feeding value of this very productive 
forage, crop. Wishing to satisfy ourselves more fully on the subject, we 
determined, a year ago, on our farms at North Platte and Lexington, to 
make a thorough test of the value of alfalfa for hogs. I can describe 
our progress no better than by quoting from a report we issued on 
November 23, 1902, as follows: 

HOGS ON ALFALFA 

EXPDtlMENTS CONDUCTED ON THE SUMMER RANCH, NOBTII PLATTE, NIB. 

On the above farm there is a small tract of land, 21 acres old alfalfa, 
and S acres new alfalfa sown in 1902; total, 26 acres. The first crop of 
alfalfa was cut June 1, and from that time up to date has been pastured 
with an average of about 160 head of hogs, all ages. The man in charge 
has kept an accurate account of the weights of the hogs and food given 
them, the idea being to satisfy the owners of the property the value of 
the alfalfa as pasturage for hogs and as hay. In addition to running 
160 head of hogs on this 26 acres of land, the hay was cut three times, 
making a total of 88M. tons of hay. This was sold to a cattle company 
and fed out on the property, we doing the feeding at $5 per ton, netting 
the owners of the property over $13.60 per acre for the alfalfa, in addition 
to pasturing, as above stated, 160 head of hogs. The hogs were 
weighed on the 14th day of each month, with this result: 

First Experiment With Fifty-Nine Stock Hogs. 

K14, weighed an average of 108 pounds each. August 14, weighed 
ige of 144 pounds each. This was a gain of 36 pounds in 60 days, 
nths of a pound per day. 

These hogs were fed, as near as could be measured, one-half pound of 
shelled corn per day, the grain in weight per day being greater than the 
grain fed. A very satisfactory showing, the gain costing less than one 
cent per pound for grain fed. 

Second Experiment With Thirty Shoatt. 

August 14, weighed an average of 131 pounds each. They were put </seg>

            <seg id="p256">
256 

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AORirri/TCRE. 

in separate pasture and fed about four pounds of ground wheat and rye 
per day, with all the alfalfa they wanted to eat. 

October 14, weighed an average of 190 pounds each. A gain of 59 
unds in 60 days, or practically one pound each per day. 

This experiment showed an unsatisfactory gain in comparison with 
the large increase in grain fed, but the only solution we can give is 
that the ground wheat and rye, fed with the alfalfa, was not as good a 
balanced ration as corn fed with alfalfa, and that where the grain was 
increased they ate that much less alfalfa. 

Third Experiment — SG May and June Pigs, After Weaning 

August 14, weighed an average of 27.1 pounds each. 

October 14, weighed an average of 45.8 pounds each. A gain of 18.7 
pounds each in 60 days, or practically one-third of a pound per day. 

t November 14, weighed an average of 61 pounds each. A gain of 15.2 
unds in 30 days. 

After these pigs were weaned, from August 14 to September IB, they 
practically made very little gain. They were fed one pound of ground 
wheat and rye per pig per day, fed as slop, and plenty of alfalfa pasture. 
'he gain in this experiment increased as the pigs grew, the last 30 days 
eing half a pound gain per day against one-third of a pound per day 
or the first 60 days. These pigs were an ordinary lot and were hardly 

satisfactory experiment although the gain was made at a very low 

cost. 

Fourth Experiment — 22 Thoroughbred Duroc-Jersey Gilts. 

September 14, weighed an average of 100.1 pounds each. 

November 14, weighed an average of 151.3 pounds each. A gain of 
51.2 pounds each in 60 days, or eight-tenths of a pound per day. 

These hogs were fed one pound of ground wheat and corn per day, each, 
and alfalfa pasture. This is considered the best gain of all, the experiments, 
eight-tenths of a pound per day being considered a very large 
gain with such a small grain ration, and the grain being wheat and 
corn. These hogs were in excellent flesh and took very heartily to the 
alfalfa pasture. The small ration of grain named went direct to gain, 
almost pound for pound. 

THE RESULT. 

It has not been the intention to see how rapid a gain could be made but 
how much gain for the smallest amount of grain fed with the alfalfa. 

The first experiment was very satisfactory — six-tenths of a pound gain 
per day on half a pound of grain. 

The second experiment was unsatisfactory — one pound of gain from 
four pounds of grain, the additional gain not being sufficient to warrant 
the large increase in grain fed. 

The third experiment with the young pigs was not satisfactory and we 
came to the conclusion that a much better gain on alfalfa can be made </seg>

            <seg id="p257">
FEEDING LARGE RATIONS OF ALFALFA TO ! 

257 

The fourth experiment with gilts of over 100 pounds was eminently 

satisfactory — eight-tenths of a pound gain from one pound of grain, and 

the animal in prime breeding condition. 

It is generally conceded that it takes from four and one-half to six 

pounds of grain to make one pound of pork. The experiments above 

prove, beyond all question of a doubt, that a gain of one pound of pork 

can be made with from one to two pounds of grain and such alfalfa 

pasture as a hog will eat. 

EXPERIMENT ON FATTENING ALFALFA HOGS. 

After these experiments were completed we had a few head of hogs 

that we wished to finish for the market. It is generally claimed that hoga 

that have been raised on alfalfa pasture fatten and finish very rapidly 

when taken off the alfalfa pasture, much more so than hogs fed in the 

usual way. mostly on corn. To satisfy ourselves on this question, an 

accurate experiment was finished on this farm December 4, the hogs and 

corn being weighed to a pound and an accurate account kept. The ex- 

periment was made with 23 hogs that had run on alfalfa all summer, 

with an average of one-half pound of corn per head per day until October 

1, then with one pound per head per day in addition to the alfalfa pasture. 

and on November 15 were put in separate lots on full feed of corn and as 

much alfalfa as they could eat, the idea being to see how quickly they 

could be finished off for the market and at what profit. 

November 15, the hogs weighed 4160 lbs., or 180 lb». each. 

December 4, they sold and weighed (shrunk), 5368 lbs., or 233 lbs. each 

A gain in 19 days of 1208 lbs., or 52.5 lbs. each.

EXPERIMENT WITH ALFALFA HAT ALONF. 

About November 1 we commenced another experiment. It is claimed 

that hogs will live on alfalfa hay alone. To satisfy ouselves on this 

question we put five head in a lot about 100 feet square and fed them 

nothing but alfalfa hay. The experiment was so unsatisfactory and our 

sympathy for the animal was such that we only carried on this experi- 

ment about thirty days, because the shoats showed that they were going 

down hill very rapidly. We then commenced to feed these five shoats 

9 </seg>

            <seg id="p258">
258 

MBBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AllElrl I.TIRK. 

about a pound of corn a day and all the alfalfa bay they would eat, and 
we found within ten days a remarkable change for the better. 

Bere still not satisfied with this experiment, because as near as we 
¦11 we could not get the shoats to eat more than two pounds to 
rands of hay per day, which, with a pound of corn, was not summake 
a gain of any consequence. 

EXPERIMENT WITH CHOPPED ALFALFA HAY AM) COBS 5 TO 1. 

About the same time we commenced another experiment with a lot of 
about sixty shoats. We took the third cutting of alfalfa, which was very 
green and fine, and chopped it up in lengths of about one-fourth of an 
inch long, with a feed cutter. To five or six pounds of this chopped 
alfalfa we put about a pound of corn meal. We mix it up in a box, cover 
with water and stir it thoroughly, mil we feed of this from eight to ten 
pounds a day to each hog, or as much as they will clean up. We feed 
it on a feeding floor. 

We have no scales on the farm where we are trying this experiment, 
therefore are not in position to say now just what the gain is; but one 
thing we do know, that since November 1 these hogs are making as satisfactory 
gains as one could wish in stock hogs, and they will be in 
splendid condition to go on pasture in the spring and make big, heavy 
pork for early market next October. 

We have about 100 brood sows that are being fed one pound of ground 
corn each per day, mixed with all the chopped alfalfa they will eat, fed 
wet, and their condition is surely as satisfactory as any breeder could 

IN CONCLUSION. 

First, we do not believe hogs will thrive on alfalfa hay alone, nor do 
we think it pays to expect young pigs are going to do well on alfalfa 
pasture only. 

fd, we do believe that we can turn shoats on an alfalfa pasture in 
ng and with one pound of corn per head per day make a gain of 
to three-fourths of a pound per day, or from 125 to 150 pounds 
the six months grazing season, which is making pork at a low 

Third, we also believe, from experiments we have made, that by chopping 
alfalfa hay (this must be good hay, where the leaves have been 
preserved) and mixing this with ground corn, at the rate of about one 
pound of corn to five or six pounds of alfalfa, that it will make a ration 
that will carry stock hogs over the winter as satisfactory to the owner as 
the ordinary ration, mostly of corn, at one-third the cost, and the animal </seg>

It was the intention of the writer this year to vary the nature of hia 
reports, and instead of taking up a topic relating to some of the insect 
pests to present a report on the smaller mammals that occur within oar 
borders and which are quite closely related to the agricultural interests of 
the state. The preparation of this paper was allotted to Mr. Merritt Cary,

animals in question. Last fall Mr. Cary found it necessary to drop out

he had an opportunity to enter the services of the United States Department 
of Agriculture as a field agent in the division of Mammology and 
Sithology. This action on his part interfered with his work on the

¦ ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE GRASSHOPPERS OR LOCUSTS 
OF NEBRASKA. 

It was hoped that the continued presence, in more than normal numbers, 
of several species of our native grasshoppers or locusts would cease 
before now. However, since such has not been the case the farmers of 
portions of Nebraska have naturally become a little anxious for some 
relief from the ravages of these pests. Accordingly during the past two 
years more than the usual amount of attention has been given the subject 
by the entomologist and his assistants at the State University with the 
hopes of being able to do something or suggest a means for controlling the 
pest. Much field work has been prosecuted for the purpose of ascertaining 
more facts that might suggest possible causes for this abnormal increase; 
and, along with this, also to point out additional methods of warfare to 
those already in vogue. 

The legislature in its session for 1901, was asked for an appropriation 
from the state's general fund for the use of the State Entomologist in 
meeting such legitimate expenses as might arise in carrying out work of 
investigations of insect pests in the field. This appropriation was readily 
granted, but was afterwards transferred to the University fund. Not 
caring to draw too heavily upon this last named fund and thereby cripple </seg>

other lines of entomological work, an arrangement was entered Into 
whereby a portion of the field expenses in connection with the grasshopper 
investigations at least were born by the general government. At 
the close of the summer's investigations in 1901 two reports were prepared 
by the writer and transmitted to the United States Entomologist. 
One of these dealt with various topics connected with the life-histories 
and habits of different species of our native locusts, such as the effects of 
climate, animal parasites and other natural enemies, diseases, etc. The 
other, with the subject of "Killing Destructive Locusts with Fungous Diseaaes." 
Bofh of these papers are reproduced herewith since they sum 
up briefly all the facts in connection with the subject that came to light 
during that year of special investigation. 

During the months of June and July, 1902, instructional duties in the 
summer session of the university occupied the time that would otherwise 
have been devoted to field investigations. Later the experimental work in 
connection with the so-called "South African Locust Fungus" so fully 
filled the time not spent in answering letters that no field investigations 
could be carried save by such assistants as were to be picked up and engaged 
for the time being. Hence, aside from securing data relative to the 
distribution and food-habits of various insects belonging to our fauna, 
together with the nature of the food of many of our birds, but little information 
was added to the subject under consideration above that obtained 
during 1901 and prior to that date. 

Early in 1901 a brief bulletin entitled "Locusts or Grasshoppers" waa 
prepared by the writer and issued by our Agricultural Experiment Station. 
In this bulletin the subject was presented in a greatly condensed form. 
Some general statements were made concerning these insects. Aside from 
this the bulletin dealt more particularly with certain of the forms that 
had thus far been known as destructive forms within Nebraska and the 
regions immediately adjacent. Perhaps it would be well to include the 
greater portion of what appeared there also so as to give the reader the 
benefit of this general information, as well as that which follows and 
which is of a more special nature. 

Not all grasshoppers, or more correctly locusts, are to be dreaded; but 
It is, nevertheless, a fact that they all feed upon vegetation. This being 
true, we must acknowledge that all of them are injurious in proportion 
as they become numerous in individuals and attack cultivated plants or 
even wild ones that are utilized by man. 

Thus far there have been described from the United States and portions 
of North America north of the Mexican boundary about 600 distinct 
species or kinds of these insects. About 200 of this number are to be met 
with In Nebraska or close to our borders. As our investigations continue 
and the entire state is more carefully searched we will undoubtedly add a 

At least twenty or more species of these insects have been known at 
time* to increase sufficiently in numbers in the United States so that any </seg>

one of them when working alone was capable of much destruction to 
crops and other vegetation. Nine or ten of these are common to Nebraska, 
and have attracted the attention of entomologists, at least, on 
account of their undue increase and the consequent injury which they 
have caused to vegetation. It is for the purpose of rendering these especially 
destructive forms more easily recognized and understood by our 
citizens that the present paper is prepared. 

CLASSIFICATION. 

The especially destructive species may be separated by the subjoined 
analytical table: 

A. Breast between base of front pair of legs armed with a distinct spine 
or tubercle. 

6. Eyes elongate-oval; male abdomen tapering; the hind tibiae armed 
with eight to nine spines on outer edge. Insect large. 

8chistocerca americana. 

66. Byes oval; male abdomen more or less enlarged towards the tip; the 
hind tibiae armed with ten to twelve spines on outer edge. 

c. Front wings without spots. 
&lt;/. Inserts rather large and robust. 

e. The angles of closed elytra and sides of prothoraz marked by yellow 
lines. Melanoplus bivittatus. 
ee. The angles of closed elytra and sides of prothorax of same general 
color as balance of insect. fp Melanoplus differential™ 
dd. Insect smaller and less robust. 

e. Uniform rust-brown to dull straw color, hind tibiae red. Somewhat 
robust. Melanoplus foedus.

Most prominent among the forms separated by the foregoing table are 
the following four: 

The Two-lined Locust (Melanoplus birittatus). 
The Differential Locust (Melanoplus differentials) . 
The Red-legged Locust (Melanoplus f&amp;mur-rubrum) . 
The Lesser Migratory Locust (Melanoplus atlanis). 

These four grasshoppers, aside from the Rocky Mountain or migratory 
species, are more likely to become destructive in this section of the 
United States than are any of the others mentioned above for the simple 
reason that the climatic and other conditions which are usually present

favor them more than they do the others; and it is exactly these conditions 
that exist in the regions which have been overrun during the past 
few years in portions of Nebraska. The Two-lined Locust, as well as the 
Differential or large yellow species both thrive best on low, moist ground 
where vegetation is rather rank and succulent. The same is also true of 
the Red-legged and Leaser Migratory species. It is a very common occurrence, 
therefore, to find these insects plentiful where alfalfa is grown 
in irrigated regions. They are also more or less numerous upon old 
breakings, along roadsides, and on bottom lands. Then, too, the localities 
chosen by all of them in which to deposit their eggs coincide with 
the conditions Just mentioned. </seg>

The number of egg masses deposited by a single female grasshopper is 
quite variable, ranging from one to three or, perhaps, even four. Some 
kinds lay but a single batch, while others lay several at intervals of a 
few days to a week or more apart. In the smaller species and those that 
migrate fewer eggs are contained in the mass when deposited, but this is 
made up in the end by these insects laying additional batches later. In 
this manner each female grasshopper under normal conditions will lay 
a hundred or more eggs. 

Elly but a single generation of these insects is raised during the 
Sometimes, however, there are two raised. Still at this comely 
slow rate of increase, with favoring conditions, the time refor 
the development of a locust plague is not long. Should these 
be only normally plentiful, t. e., not more than one insect to each 
yard, they would deposit eggs sufficient to allow for there being a 
j fifty for each square yard during the following year. 

In choosing locations for the deposition of their eggs the females of 
various species select different places. Some seek out compact soil more 
or less free from encumbering vegetation, others lay their eggs among the 
roots of grass clusters or about the bases of various plants, and still 
others place their eggs in the bark of trees or in rotten wood. The migratory 
species choose gravelly hillsides, closely grazed pastures, new breakings, 
old stubble fields, and other suitable places where the ground is 
not too loose or where it is not too much covered by vegetation. 

Egg-laying occurs at different times with different species. Some lay 
early in the year, others during midsummer, but most of them attend to 
this duty in late summer or during the fall of the year, — each species 
attending to this necessary operation at the right time in its own peculiar 

Ecust or grasshopper eggs hatch either in fall, early spring, late 
g, or summer. The insects, the eggs of which hatch normally in 
live over winter as larva- or pups. Some few forms hibernate as full 
n insects, but most kinds pass the winter months in the egg state. 

The young work their way from the eggs in the pod to the surface of 
the ground through the dried froth which fills the hole, by a twisting or 
writhing motion. Almost immediately after attaining the surface the 
little 'hoppers shed a covering envelope and set free the antennae, mouthparts, 
and limbs. In a short time they become somewhat hardened and 
begin to hop about in quest of food. When first hatched they are nearly 
white but soon become dark colored. 

In the four species of locusts mentioned above, which are the ones 
chiefly concerned in the injuries to crops during recent years, the eggs 
are laid in rather loose ground that is not disturbed each year. For their 
breeding purposes, alfalfa fields, the margins of irrigating ditches, old 
breakings, and roadsides are generally the kinds of places selected. </seg>

REPORT OF THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 

IAC8E8 FOB THE EXCES8IVE INCREASE OF LOCIST8.* 

!ous causes may and generally do combine in permitting these and 
insects to' increase beyond the normal number of the species under 
eration. First of all, climatic conditions are to be considered. 
r related to these, and in a measure depending upon them, are the 
ce or absence of insect and other parasites. Diseases too, when 
, favor the development of the pest, as do the absence of birds and 
natural enemies aside from parasitic forms. Still other favoring 
conditions, like the supplying of uncommonly good breeding grounds, the 
non-interference of man. and the power of migration in a species, all 
tend to allow of its rapid increase. During a succession of abnormally 
dry years most locusts, whether "native" or "migratory" are permitted to 
increase beyond the normal because they are less liable to the attack of 
diseases which are prevalent during moist weather. Many of the parasitic 
insects and other animal forms which thrive and work best during 
wet seasons also die off when the weather becomes too dry, hence in this 
manner several checking influences are removed and the locusts are 
permitted to increase untrammelled. 

The removal of the above checks permits all kinds of locusts to increase 
alike. The species, however, which add to their other traits that 
of migration, are even more favored than their non-migratory relatives 
since they are enabled, to a certain extent at least, to escape from their 
enemies; to select suitable breeding places; to find congenial climates; and 
withal an abundant food supply when it is missing from the immediate 
locality where they occur. 

KILLING URA.SSHOPPEB8 WITH Fl 

It has been known to entomologists for a number of years that different 
locusts are subject to the attacks of certain diseases. Some of these diseases 
are also known to result from the presence and growth within the 
bodies of the victims of several kinds of mold or fungus. Not only are 
locusts subject to the attacks of these fungus diseases, but also many 
other insects fall victims to them. In fact, for several years past certain 
destructive insects have been combated more or less successfully by the 
artificial propagation and spread of different kinds of these insect-destroying 
fungi. 

I ist two, and possibly three, distinct species of locust-attacking 
ive been especially brought before the public in different parts of 
Id during the past few years. Not that they are the only ones of 
ants which select the bodies of acridians as proper places for dent, 
but because they, among the others, have been most persistactive 
in their results.

able ia the one known to botanists as the Emputa grvtoz. It Is the cause 
of the disease that frequently attacks and destroys myriads of both native 
and migratory grasshoppers. This disease sometimes becomes epidemic 
over wide areas, and at such times destroys almost every 'hopper in the 
region. If there is any particular condition of climate during which the 
disease works best it is in warm, rather humid weather from midsummer 
to early fall. It also seems to attack the mature insects much more readily 
than it does the younger ones, though at times these latter also suffer 
greatly from it 

Pen an insect has once been attacked by this native fungus it becomes 
r sluggish in its movements, and shortly before death climbs up 
tern of some weed or other plant and securely attaches itself by 
y hugging the plant with its front and middle pairs of legs, as aeon 
s illustration. In this position It dies and remains clinging for some 
after death. The bodies of the insects which die from the attacks 
of this fungus become somewhat swollen and quite soft, and afterwards 
brittle. A few days after death the body opens at the joints and permits 
the brown dust-like spores to escape and be blown about by the winds. 
Other locusts when eating vegetation upon which such spores may be 
resting or coming in contact with them, if the weather and other conditions 
are favorable, likewise become attacked and die from the disease. 
It is principally the presence of this fungus, with perhaps a few others 
working with the other natural enemies, that keep the various species 
of grasshoppers within reasonable limits during ordinary years. Thus 
far, however, we have not been successful in handling the disease with 
sufficient certainty to permit of its being generally used in checking these 

While in South America during the years 1897 and 1898 the writer discovered 
another locust disease that is quite similar to the fungus which 
is used in destroying chinch-bugs in some portions of the United States. 
Although considerable time has been spent in experimenting with this 
South American fungus upon our North American grasshoppers, thus 
far the results have all been negative since not a single insect has died 
from the disease. Locusts which have been attacked by this South American 
fungus (a 8porotrichum) , instead of climbing to the tops of various 
plants so as to get as much air as possible, creep away from the light 
and seek dark, moist places in which to die. Consequently, they are most

attacking fungi for the purpose of ascertaining the proper media 
used and methods to be employed in the laboratory. During these experiments 
he was enabled for the first time to successfully grow this 
Empusa artificially. This was not accomplished, however, till so late in 
the fall that there was no longer an opportunity to attempt the artificial 
inoculation of living locusts either in the laboratory or the field. The 
cultures were later removed from the dishes in order to use the latter for 
class purposes. </seg>

the mycelial threads and spores of the fungus. In many 
certain conditions, the spores also partly coyer the outside

Last summer what appears to be a third disease of this kind was observed 
to be quite prevalent among the grasshoppers in the vicinity of 
Sterling, Colorado. Its nature is somewhat similar to the South American, 
but seems to be distinct from that disease. Experiments with it have 
thus far also proved rather unsatisfactory, since but few of the trials 
away from the immediate region where it was discovered were successful. 
It will be seen, therefore, that while we have thus far been able to 
make these fungus diseases work under all conditions, or even under a 
few with certainty, it is hoped that before many years we may be able 
more easily to handle them and use them for the destruction of our 
grasshopper pest.* 

ARTIFICIAL REMEDIES 

Disking or Harrowing. — In the regions of the state that have suffered 
greatest, the most feasible and, at the same time, available remedy that 
can be suggested is the disking, harrowing, or otherwise disturbing of all 
ground in which eggs have been deposited. Especially is this disking or 
harrowing valuable for ground occupied by alfalfa since the stirring of 
the soil not only destroys large quantities of grasshopper eggs, but also in 
a measure cultivates the alfalfa and insures a larger crop. The proper 
time to disk this ground is in early spring before the alfalfa begins 
growing and after frost has left the ground. The disking can be done at 
least two inches or more in depth with the disks set nearly straight so 
as not to tear up the ground too severely. Even cross-disking has sometimes 
proved beneficial. By going over a field with a disk the egg-pods 
or capsules are disturbed in the ground and many of them are broken up 
so as to scatter the eggs and expose them to the drying influences of wind 
and sun, as well as to the keen eyes of birds and other animal forms 
which greedily feed upon them. Where grasshoppers have been very 
numerous in a region it is also advisable to run the disk or harrow along 
irrigating ditches and old roads, as well as upon any deserted breakings. 

Should a number of grasshoppers hatch after the above mentioned 

•Mr J. L. Sheldon was also successful in isolating late in the season 

n fungus that appeared to be a Sporotrichum ; but, as in the case of the 
culture of the Empusa. this was also destroyed in order to have the use 
of the dish in which it was growing for class work. 

Recently Dr. L. O. Howard, United States Entomologist, to whom 
specimens of the large migratory locusts from Argentine Republic were 
sent, wrote me that they were successful in isolating two fungi, one of 
them apparently a Sporotrichum. It is to be hoped that this last fungus 
will prove to be the one that was so effective in that country and that it 
will prove to attack our insects also. </seg>

treatment it would be well later to Introduce and work the "hopper 
dozer," or kerosene pan, described below. In addition to these artificial 
remedies such other as the raising of large flocks of poultry will also 
greatly reduce the numbers of locusts. Above all, the protection of the 
wild birds of the country is absolutely necessary in order to keep down 
this as well as other insect pests. It is probably due to the destruction of 
these natural enemies of insects that we are now suffering from so many 
depredations of the kind. Not until we become convinced of the necessity 
of preserving our birds, shall we be relieved from fighting insects. 

Tho Hopper Dozer or Kerosene Pan. — By all odds the best method of 
destroying these insects after they become half grown is the use of the 
"hopper dozer," or kerosene pan, which is shown herewith. This is made 
of stovepipe iron by turning up the sides and ends about four inches so

as to make a long, fiat pan about four inches in depth. This is than 
mounted on runners varying in height according to requirements. On 
the frame back of the pan is stretched a piece of cloth to prevent the 
insects from jumping over the pan. When ready to begin work the pan 
is partially filled with water and then some coal oil is added. If the 
ground is level no cross-pieces are necessary, but if the pan is to be used 
on sloping ground it should be made as indicated in the illustration to 
prevent the oil and water from running to one end. The height of the 
runners will necessarily vary from two to eight or ten inches, according 
to the crop to be protected and the age of the Insects to be captured. 
The machine may be of any length desired up to sixteen or eighteen feet. 
If small it can be drawn by uand, but when larger a horse, or two is 
preferable for the purpose. When full the insects can be removed with 
a perforated skimmer, a little more oil added, and the machine again 
started. In this way a number of bushels of grasshoppers can be de- </seg>

strayed in a single day. The cost of running this machine is trifling and 
the remedy very effectual. 

Poisoning. — Whether or not it would be advisable in many instances 
to use poison for destroying these insects depends largely upon existing 
conditions. It certainly would be unwise to do this, where the probability 
existed of killing native birds, poultry, and other domestic animals. 

For thus poisoning grasshoppers several methods have been followed. 
One of these is the use of poison sprays whereby the vegetation in form of 
weeds and other useless plants are treated, and the insects permitted to 
eat them and then be killed. This method is not as dangerous to wild 
birds or even to domestic fowls as one or two others; but it would be 
quite harmful to animals like sheep, cattle and horses should they feed 
upon the poisoned vegetation. Hence this particular method could only 
be used where fences are in vogue, or where stock is kept up and not 
allowed to range at will. 

A second is sweetened and poisoned bran that is scattered about over 
the ground or exposed in little heaps in out-of-the-way localities where 
the insects gather and are accordingly attracted to the baits, eat thereof 
and die. Being a substance that is likewise palatable to both birds and 
mammals these latter also eat and are frequently poisoned. Then too, 
there seems to be a temptation on the part of wild birds, as well as 
domestic fowls, to eat the 'hoppers that have been thus destroyed, with 
the result of frequently causing their destruction also. This method 
cannot, therefore, be strongly recommended in any case. 

A third, and possibly the best and safest of the poisoning methods, is the 
use of what has been termed the "Criddle mixture." This mixture consists 
briefly in the mixing of fresh horse manure and poison — either 
Paris green or London purple, and then scattering it about in such places 
as will most likely attract the insects which are desired killed. It is 
claimed that neither birds nor domestic fowls eat the mixture. Neither 
do they feed largely on the dead locusts that have been destroyed by its 
use. It is claimed that one pound of the poison to fifty, or even one 
hundred, as many of the horse dung is all right. The insects are greatly 
attracted to the substance, and it would appear to be practical for use at 
least where mechanical methods are out of the question. Before recommending 
its general use I wish to make some careful investigations regarding 
its effects, if any, on our native birds.

Krmal numbers of several species of the native grasshopper* or

Espeoially did the reports coming from portions of western 
Nebraska, eastern Colorado, and eastern and central Wyoming seem so 
serious in their nature that the writer was commissioned by the United 
States Department of Agriculture to make an investigation so as to ascertain, 
if possible, the true causes leading up to this undue increase among 
the several species of locusts concerned, and to later report the results of 
these investigations to the Entomologist. 

Accordingly on the evening of August 8, in company with Mr. M. A. 
Carriker, Jr.. an assistant, who was to make some special observations 
and collections of specimens for the Agricultural Experiment Station of 
Nebraska, a start on this tour of inspection was made. The route cr-osen 
was first to Southwestern Nebraska via the Denver branch of the Turlington 
4b Missouri railroad, and the first stop McCook. From this place 
the party proceeded by short journeys to Haigler, then to Akron, and 
Brush. At the latter place turning to the north and passing through 
Sterling. Colorado; Sidney, Nebraska; Bridgeport, Scott's Bluff, and 
reaching westward as far as Guernsey. Wyoming, before returning to 
Alliance, Nebraska, and Lincoln by way of the Billings branch of the same 
railroad. On this return journey the central Sand Hill region was 
crossed and some notes on locust abundance there secured. 

Again leaving Lincoln on the 18th of the month a second journey was 
made. This time via the Fremont, Elkhorn t Missouri Valley railroad 
up the Elkhorn Valley, the Niobrara, the White River, and the North 
Platte to Lusk, Douglas and Casper, Wyoming, where investigations were 
made concerning the locust problem as it existed in those regions. Then 
returning as far as Crawford in which vicinity some work was done 
before going to Denver, Colorado, where the meeting of the Economic 
Entomologists was attended. From here the return trip to Lincoln was 
made over the Union Pacific railroad down the Platte River valley, thus 
covering most of the remaining territory occupied by the locust past 
under consideration. In these investigations the writer was greatly 
aided by having transportation furnished him by the railroad companies 
mentioned. 

Other sections of the country were also visited and carefully studied 
both before and since the period embraced by the commission mentioned, 
and the results of such investigations included in the conclusions arrived 
at and which are appended. 

E following notes pertaining to the subject under investigation were 
down as the work progressed, and in part form the basis for the 
lions reached:

native grasshoppers which abound in this vicinity. Most of these

abundant. In fact it appeared to be the principal species that was causing 
the injury to crops and cultivated plants. It was aided, however, in 
this work by such other forms as M. bivittatus, M. atlanis, M. packardii. 
of the form usually referred to as it. frrdus. and the it. femur-rubrum. 
Among the other species which existed in unusually large numbers were 
Dissosteira longipennis, .Eoloplus turnbullii. it. occidentals, it. conspersus. 
it. lakinus. Amphitornus bicolor, Aulocara elliotti. Mestobregma 
kiowa, etc., but these latter were feeding mainly upon the grasses or 
weeds and other special food plants other than cultivated ones. 

Eing to ascertain just where the insects which were concerned in 
istation of crops had hatched, it was found that old breakings 
to furnish many, while the forsaken roads, edges of fields and 
ig ditches, railroad beds, and like places grown up to weeds had 
provided still others with the required breeding places. Alfalfa fields 
growing next to corn nearly invariably were the cause for much injury 
to the latter. Some of the fields of corn observed between McCook and 
Culbertson had been entirely destroyed and in some instances even the 
weeds between the rows and about the edges were badly eaten. A few 
fields showed only here and there the remnants of bare stubs in place of 
the good grain that should have remained growing— just as I had Men 
fields appear in the early seventies after a visit from the Rocky Mountain 
locust plague. 

Bibserving what plants, if any, were free from the ravages of the 
s locusts mentioned above, it was noticed that sorghum in most 
lad suffered but little, while Kaffir corn was nearly exempt. Only 
the latter was wilted did the locusts seem to touch it at all, and 
ut slightly where other food was available. Millet, too, seemed to 
-ly immune from their attacks. Of course most kinds of garden 
Buffered quite severely. 

One feature noted in connection with the abundance of the supposedly 
harmless locusts was the presence in large numbers of M. lakinus, and 
¦plus turnbullii on the Russian thistle and lambs' quarter. Nearly 
everywhere where these weeds grew the grasshoppers just mentioned 
abounded. Only a few years ago both of these species of locusts were 
rare — usually extremely so — and at the same time very local in their 
distribution. Since they have already been observed to attack the beet, 
Cey may both prove troublesome in the future should attempts be made 
sugar beet growing in the regions now overrun. 

On the prairies and other uncultivated grounds two or three of the 
grasshoppers aside from those mentioned above seemed also to be abnormally 
abundant. Mermiria bivittata, Opeia obscura, and Amphitornus 
bicolor or coloradensis being the chief ones. These, with the exception 
of the first, are found upon the higher grounds among the shorter cnim 
like the boutelouas, etc.

and inquiry among the fanners and other interested parties gave the 
same impression as to their comparative healthfulness. No Empusakilled 
'hoppers had been scan by anyone during the present year so far 
as could be learned, and only% few had been observed to die from "grubs" 
and what is apparently either a bacterial disease or such an one in conjunction 
with a Sporotrichum. At least this last surmise seems to be 
warranted since the conditions of death coincided with observations made 
a week prior in an alfalfa field on the North Platte about 17 miles to the 
I west of the little town of Ogallala, where the locusts of various 
•s had succumbed in large numbers. When these were placed in a 
'or the purpose of ascertaining the cause of their demise there was 
led a fungus growth pronounced by Dr. C. E. Bessey, of the I'niy 
of Nebraska, to be a species of Sporotrichum. Several bacteria 
also present in large numbers within the bodies of some of the 
mentioned dead locusts. 

Inquiries made among the railroad employes at McCook resulted in 
showing that these insects reached eastward as far as Red Cloud In numbers 
sufficiently great to perceptibly injure cultivated vegetation both in 
gardens and fields. 

In passing westward from McCook along the line of the Burlington A 
Missouri R. R., locust injury was observed all the way to Haigler, but 
seemed to be the most pronounced between the former place and Stratton. 

In asking different persons concerning the various measures that had 
been taken to combat the locusts in this portion of the state, it was 
learned that the kerosene pan had been used in a few cases, while disking 
had been resorted to by some, and several had even attempted the use 
of poison in the form of Paris green mixed with bran. Altogether, however, 
but comparatively little had been accomplished, and no concerted 
action had been undertaken by the settlers to rid themselves of the pest. 
In a few instances large flocks of chickens and turkeys were also employed 
with good results. But these, like the other attempts mentioned 
above, were only isolated and individual, and had but little effect upon 
the problem in its entirety. It would require a concerted action over the 
entire area affected and successively for two or three yars at least to 
obtain complete control of the pest. 

Whether or not the killing off of the native birds in this section of the 
state has been much of a factor in permitting the development of the 
locust abundance now being considered is a query. One farmer near Mc- 
Cook remarked that a couple years ago a certain locality near one end of 
a particular field of his had been protected by blackbirds, a hundred or 
t pairs of which built nests and reared their young near by. 
ly, however, the small willows among which these birds nested 
en removed and the birds no longer protected that particular field. 

At Haigler it was ascertained that various species of locusts have been 
more than normally abundant for the past six years. At least this can 
be said of the species which attack cultivated plants like alfalfa, corn. </seg>

wheat, garden truck, etc. If any change in their numbers can be detected 
It Is thought that perhaps there is an appreciable decrease from last year. 
Aa in the vicinity of McCook and further east, they seem to breed chiefly 
in alfalfa fields, along roadsides, or in old" breakings, etc. In addition 
to the breeding places here recorded the Russian thistles which have 
become generally dispersed over this section of the state seem also to 
offer safe and desirable retreats for several species of these insects when 
laying their eggs. Not only is this true with reference to egg-laying, 
but also at other times. The rank growing plants provide shelter during 
hot. dry weather, as well as from rain and hail storms, and offer safe retreats 
to the insects when pursued by enemies even like predaceous insects 
and birds. 

The non-cultivated-plant enemies among these insects most apparent 
bove normal numbers in this vicinity seem to be Opeia obtcura, Mestoregma 
kiowa. Melanoplus lakinus, M. bowditchi, M. packardi, Mermiria 
ivittata, M. neo-mexicana. and one or two others. As noted at McCook. 
several of these latter are partial to certain food plants such as have 
recently increased enormously, hence a good reason for their excessive 
numbers. On the other hand species like the Mermirias and other grass 
infesting forms now abnormally abundant have become so from some 
other cause. Perhaps the non-occurrence of prairie fires for a number of 
years may account for this in part at least, while the destruction of such 
birds as the Sharp-tailed Grouse and Bartramian Sandpiper with the 
Meadow Lark and a few other kinds of prairie inhabiting species will 
explain the excess in number of some of the remainder. Three species 
of Dectidnir were also quite abundant here, as was also one of the walklug 
sticks. 

In journeying westward from Haigler grasshopper injuries were detected 
nearly as far as Akron, Colorado: but beyond this point only about 
the normal numbers of these insects appeared to be present, since none of 
their injury was visible from the train. At Brush, where a great deal of 
alfalfa is grown, not many of these insects were reported or seen; hence 
it was judged that matters were nearly normal as regards locust abundance. 
From this point the direction of the journey was changed and we 
went north. At Sterling, which was passed before daylight, and where 
considerable injury was reported a year ago, the condition was not ascertained; 
but, judging from what was seen some distance beyond along the 
line of railroad towards Sidney, the locusts may be on the decrease, — a 
result perhaps, of some concerted efforts on the part of the farmers 
toward their destruction during the past two or three years. 

It was also found upon investigation that these insects were not nearly 
so numerous at Sidney as they were farther to the east along the Lodge 
Pole Creek and the South Platte River. Still, even here, (Sidney) wherever 
and whenever cultivated fields occurred, more of these insects were to 
be met with than is normally the case in the region. They were of the 
usual species observed under similar conditions the present year, — viz., </seg>

various of the Melanopli as differentialis, bivittatus. femur-rubrum, and 
atlanis. Some of the other forms that were not so rare as at times in the 
past were species like M. packardii, Si. occidentalis, St. luridus, St. infantilis. 
etc.; while a few of the prairie inhabiting species mentioned 
before were also quite plentiful. 

Knversing with Mr. George Oberfelder, a merchant of Sidney and a 
an, it was learned that at Lodge Pole the locusts were not nearly 
tiful on his ranch as elsewhere in the neighborhood. It developed 
from further conversation with him that on this particular ranch are 
located several quite extensive private fish ponds and other low and 
swampy ground where two or three species of blackbirds bred, and were 
at the time referred to gathered in immense flocks. The presence of these 
birds will undoubtedly explain this comparative freedom from locusts on 
the ranch in question. Mr. Oberfelder also mentioned the fact that a 
great destruction of the bird life in general of the region had been accomplished 
during recent years by local and other would-be sportsmen. 

While at this place and in conversation also with a gentleman from 
Gering, Scott's Bluff Co., It was learned that during the present year 
there were more grasshoppers in the Pumpkinseed Valley to the south 
of Gering and Mitchell than there were last year and also than during 
the present year at the places just named. This he accounted for on the 
ground of a partial migration southward, both last fall by the insects 
prior to their egg-laying, and since hatching during the past spring and 
early summer. Just what species of these insects were present in this 
last named region was not ascertained, but it is presumed that most of 
them were of the kinds noted at nearly all other points where cultivated 
vegetation suffered from grasshopper depredations. It is also quite evident 
that several of the prairie-frequenting species like if. packardii, M. 
accidentalis. the Aulocaras, some of the species of Trimerotropit, Trachprkachis 
kioica, Opeia obscvra, etc., were present in more than normal 
numbers since a scarcity of food on the ranges is reported notwithstanding 
the fact that more than the usual amount of rain has fallen during 
the pasi spring and summer. 

In running west from Bridgeport to Guernsey, Wyo., it was observed 
that locust depredations appeared to lessen materially as the train progressed 
westward after entering Wyoming. Still, even here more of these 
insects were to be seen among the weeds along the railroad track than was 
the case during their normal abundance in past years. There were a 
number of kinds to be met with in the grasses about Guernsey, but the 
prevailing species seemed to be St. packardii, St. occidentals, St. atlanis. 
Aulocara elliotti. A. femoratus and still others, which, like the M. differentialis 
and if. atlanis, seem to hatch among rank growing weeds as well 
as upon cultivated or disturbed grounds. 

King to find a reason for the greater increase among locusts in 
localities during different years, the matter of rainfall seems to 
explanation for at least a portion of this variation. It is quite

noticeable that when rains fall early ill the season the eggs of these insects 
hatch much earlier than they do when the rains come later, although 
the temperature might be normal or even above normal. Then, 
too, after each shower during late spring and throughout the summer it 
is seen that additional young hatch. During some years it may even be 
possible for many of the eggs that were deposited the previous fall to 
remain unhatched for lack of the requisite amount of moisture. Should 
the following year prove to be a wet one these eggs might then hatch 
along with those deposited a year later. The present year having been an 
exceptionally wet one in portions of the northwest may, therefore, account 
for the immense numbers of grasshoppers that were to be found in that 
section. Still, there are limited localities even in this region where 
scarcely any of these insects were to be met with during the present sum- 
Er, while Immediately adjoining they were literally swarming. While 
urning eastward from Guernsey a severe rainstorm accompanied by 
1 was passed through. Fully an inch and a half, or two inches, of 

ither large hail stones fell over a strip of country several miles in 
*idth and many miles in length. During the progress of this storm the 
thought occurred to me that possibly here was an explanation of the 
comparative freedom of certain areas right in the midst of others that 
were greatly overrun by destructive locusts. The hail in this instance 
just cited certainly fell with such force and in sufficient quantity to have 
crushed out the life of the majority of locusts inhabiting the region in 
question. Then, too, these sections of comparative freedom from the 
pest so frequently observed by the writer are such as are subject to 
severe hailstorms.* 

As intimated on a previous page, the Russian Thistle in addition to 
affording an abundant food-supply for certain species of the native locusts, 
provides excellent shelter for their eggs as well as the insects themselves. 
Tucked away beneath these formidable plants both the insects and their 
eggs are quite well protected from most of their natural enemies, as well 
as from sudden changes of weather. This being true, the Russian Thistle, 
no doubt, must have had something to do towards producing present conditions 
in portions of the region now covered hy the locust plague. 

By turning to my notes concerning the locusts in central Wyoming I 
find the folowing: 

Paper, Wyoming, Aug. 20: "Conditions, while rather bad, are not 
ly so alarming here as they are in some portions of Nebraska and 
ler east in Wyoming. In driving out among the ranches and over 
range some new light on the probable cause of the recent increase 
among grasshoppers in this and other regions of the country came up. 
C ether or not my surmises are correct to any great extent is' not 
nitely known." 

•Quite recently while in Sioux county the writer had an opportunity to 
verify this observation concerning the possible destruction of grasshoppers 
by hail. </seg>

            <seg id="p277">
277 


Upon driving up to the buildings on a ranch on Goose Creek about ten 
or twelve miles southeast from Casper, a very nice flock of Sage Grouse 
or more) was observed walking about the premises and picking up 
grasshoppers. These Grouse were so tame that they reminded one of 
domestic fowls, as they worked about among the vegetation in search 
of grasshoppers. During the day several additional coveys of these grouse 
were seen and opportunities offered in the remnants of several dead birds 
that had been shot and drawn by hunters, for examining the stomach contents. 
Such examinations invariably resulted in the finding of large 
quantities of grasshopper fragments. By inquiring around among ranchmen 
it was also ascertained that a great slaughter of these birds has been 
going on for the past few years in the sections of Wyoming now moot 
overrun by locusts. A careful survey of the field brought out the fact that 
a similar destruction of these birds, as well as of the Sharp-tailed Grouse, 
has been progressing over considerable country. It was learned that such 
slaughter had occurred at Chadron, Crawford, Harrison, McCook. Culbertson, 
Trenton, Haigler, North Platte, Sidney, etc., in Nebraska; and Lusk, 
Douglas, Orin Junction, Guernsey, etc., in Wyoming. At each of the— 
localities the grasshoppers were more numerous during the past summer 
than formerly. 

When this idea first came up in connection with other probable reason* 
for the Increase of the various species of locusts such as are to be found on 
the range, it did not seem at all conclusive, nor does it do so even now. 
The more I consider it, however, the more I am inclined to accept this explanation 
of matters as an important factor in the problem. However, 
when we take into consideration the fact that when man comes i i to take 
his place on the stage of action- — in the drama, nature js nearly or quite 
balanced, i. e., no one form of life has much the advantage over others, 
then does this explanation of the matter appear quite possible. The 
country at that time affords food for a certain number of individuals of 
each kind of life, mammal, bird, reptile, and insect, all of which are more 
¦or less interdependent. Now, for instance, remove a few hundreds of the 
individuals of any one species and we soon find a change taking place 
among the numbers of individuals of some other form. The birds feed on 
both vegetation and insects. If grasshoppers are included among this food 
a fewer number of birds will require a less number of 'hoppers and these 
latter would thereby be given the opportunity to increase beyond the 
rrmal. This surplus goes on increasing and the result very quickly 
a greater drain on the vegetation that forms their bill of fare. 

Esing that a single Sage Hen will destroy on an average one hunusts 
each day during the months of June, July, and August, the 
of this bird from the field of action would mean at least 9,000 
grasshoppers saved to swell the army of these insects that might be 
enabled to provide for the propagation of their kind. If half of these 
should be females and each one desposits its normal quota of 100 eggs 
there could be a possible 150,000 more of these insects than if the bird had </seg>

En killed. But when we destroy the birds by the hundreds of 
ds this possibility in the gap becomes startling — the problem as 
;d above seems more than probable. 

Aside from the killing off of these birds by man, it is stated that they 
are destroyed to a considerable extent by grazing sheep which break np 
their nests. While conversing with an intelligent sheep man and herder 
on this latter feature of the subject, he mentioned the fact that he had 
heard of more than a hundred nests being thus destroyed in a single 
year on Ham's Fork in western Wyoming. Whether or not the destruction 
of locusts by the trampling of sheep will equal the number that would 
have been killed by the birds thus destroyed, I am not prepared to state 
at this time. 

The species of grasshoppers concerned in the depredations in the vicinity 
of Douglas and Casper, Wyo., were as follows: On cultivated tracts, M. 
birittatus. M. atlanis. M. femurrubrum and Camnula pellucida, while the 
ones most abundant on the range were Aulocara elliotti, A. femorata, 
Mestobregma pardalinum. Melanoplus packardii. M. infantilis, M. occidentalit, 
and several others. 

While occupied in other work in portions of Dawes and Sioux counties 
during June, July, and August, considerable attention was given to the 
locust problem as it existed there. A couple of students who were engaged 
In making collections of various forms of the animal life of northwestern 
Nebraska were also instructed to pay particular attention to these insects 
in the region being worked by them. Both the forms that frequent cultivated 
and non-cultivated grounds were found to be unusually abundant 
over much of the country traversed, while investigating the subject. Still, 
some sections proved to be much more overrun by them than were others. 
Especially was this found to be the case in portions of Dawes and Sioux 
counties. In the latter county in particular the insects proved to be most 
plentiful on the slopes adjoining the Pine Ridge, and for a few miles 
away; but not so on the table lands nor in the Hat Creek Valley itself. 
In many places' the Insects were so numerous as to cause a shortage in 
the feed on the range notwithstanding the great amount of rain that fell 
here during the early part of the year. As noted in other localities some 
species of normally rare insects for this section of the state were also 
found to be present in large numbers. 

Not only were the "native" locusts abundant throughout the western 
counties of Nebraska, but in many localities even in the central and 
eastern portions of the state where they did much local injury to both 
garden truck and some field crops. Some of the localities where such a 
state of affairs exsted were in Antelope, Knox, Dixon, Cedar, Holt, Valley, 
Custer, Lancaster, and the adjoining counties. In these sections the Differential, 
Two-lined, Red-legged, and Lesser migratory species predominated, 
though others were also present in fair numbers both upon the 
prairies and in cultivated fields. A number of the local districts thus 
overrun by these insects were visited by myself or some member of the </seg>

PDgical Department of the University of Nebraska; while others 
t be reached and investigated. It was found that some of these 
s embraced only a few farms or several hundred acres of terrilie 
others extended throughout entire counties. The species of 
oncerned in these also varied with the districts and the nature 
surroundings and crops grown. It was noted, however, that 
us differentials and M. bivittatus were usually the chief offend- 

One of the most important of these local or detached areas of locust 
abundance was that in Custer County with Broken Bow as a center. 
In this region the plague assumed really alarming proportions, and 
caused not a little uneasiness among the citizens who earnestly sought 
aid from the State Entomologist and all other persons who might be in 
a position to give expert advice. 

After carefully going over all the notes which have been brought together 
during the various trips that were made while investigating this 
and other insect pests, and that were accumulated in other ways. It la 
found that the area now occupied by these insects in injurious numbers 
has become much larger during the present summer than it was a 
year ago. Practically all the state west of the 100th meridian is embraced, 
while the valleys of the Niobrara. Elkhorn, the Loups, Platte 
and Republican rivers are all more or less largely overrun for from 
fifty to one hundred or more miles eastward. In some instances this 
is true locally even to the extreme eastern edge of the state as indicated 
above when reference is made by counties. 

In order to show clearly the principal species of locusts thus concerned, 
and their distribution over the country, the following list has been prepared: 


Mermiria bivittata Serv. — McCook, Haigler, Sioux county, and in the 

sand-hills generally on unburnt prairies. 

Mermiria neomexicana Thorn.— Haigler and other southwestern Nebraska 

localities where it is found in company with the preceding species.

Aulovara femoratum Scudd. — With the preceding species but most abundant 
southward. 

Camnula pellucida Scudd. — This locust was seen only in the extreme 
western part of Nebraska and at Casper, Wyoming, where it occurred 
on low land about streams and in mountain meadows.

Schiitocerca alutacea Harr. — This insect was reported to be present in 
large numbers at Neligh, Albion, Haigler, Ogallala, and throughout 
the sand-hills of central Nebraska generally. 

¦ otettix pratensis Scudd. — Antelope, Holt and Wheeler counties, 
the prairies, but usually on low ground where certain species of 
denrod abound. 

Hetperotettix viridis Thom. — Eastern Colorado and Wyoming and western 
Nebraska, where it is restricted to certain localities. 

Hetperotettix speciosus Scudd. — Western Kansas and Nebraska and eastern 
Colorado, among different species of sunflowers.

usually mentioned as .1/. fordus is by far the most numerous. 

Melanoplus coceineipes Scudd. — Fairly abundant at Culbertson, Sidney, 
Ogallala. North Platte and Ft. Robinson in Nebraska, where they 
seemed to choose the Cleome serrulata as a food-plant, or at least 
upon which to perch.

than M. femur-rubrum. 

Melanoplus bivittatus Say. — In nearly every locality where locust depredations 
were reported, and especially in cultivated districts. 

Cnoplus differentialis Uhler. — Possibly the most abundant of all the 
species of locusts mentioned in this paper, and present in all localities 
except those in the extreme northwestern corner of Nebraska and 
central Wyoming. The chief insect in alfalfa districts.

¦le those which are especially noticeable as enemies of cultivated 
are Melanoplus differentialis, M. bivittatus, M. femur-rubrum and 
anis, along with M. packardi. The remainder are chiefly grass 
or feed upon various uncultivated plants. </seg>

WHY I.IKISTS INCREASE ABNORMALLY. 

P'ter having carefully scrutinized the notes relating to the locust 
lem in the region embraced in the investigations chronicled on the 
eding pages, together with all other available information on the 
ect in general, the writer has come to the following conclusions as 
hy grasshoppers increase abnormally: 

1. The growing of alfalfa without regularly disking the ground each 

2. The abandonment of once cultivated fields, and permitting thereon 
the growth of weeds and other rank herbage. 

3. The almost general carelessness of allowing weeds and other rank 
growths to flourish along roadsides, irrigating ditches, and railway 
tracks. 

4. The presence in great abundance of the Russian Thistle in portions 
of the country year after year. 

5. The non-burning of prairies over wide areas for a number of years In 
succession. 

6. The undue destruction of game and other insectivorous birds over 
wide areas. 

7. The recurrence of unusually wet years after several abnormally dry 

8. The absence of insect enemies and diseases brought about by various 
mow — chiefly climatic. 

It is but just to state here that the lack of space has not permitted a 
very elaborate discussion of these various reasons for locust increase. 

KILLING DESTKUCTIVE LOCUSTS WITH FUNGOUS DISEASES' 

BT LAWRENCE BBUNEB. 

The fact that various kinds of insects are at times attacked and destroyed 
by different species belonging to several distinct genera of fungi 
has been known to both botanists and entomologists for many years. It 
la, however, a matter of comparatively recent discovery that some of 
these fungi can be artificially grown and afterwards communicated to the 
insects which it is desired to destroy. Numerous examples of the propagation 
and spread of such fungi have been recorded in this and other 
countries. Some noted examples of this kind are the artificial spread of 
Itaria densa Link, the fungus that attacks the European Cockchafer and 
that has also been tried on the White grub here in the United States; 
Bporotrichum globuliferum Speg. as used against the chinch-bug and 
several other insects; Emputa musca; the common fungus of the house 
fly, etc. Along with what has been recorded concerning these attempts

at utilizing the insect fungi just mentioned, It might be well hen to 
outline some of the efforts that have been made during recent years 
towards lighting destructive locusts or grasshoppers by similar means. 
It is not necessary, however, for one to devote much time in investigation 
to ascertain that the whole matter relating to this subject is still 
in great confusion. It will at once be apparent that nothing very 
definite exists in the shape of reliable information concerning the' particular 
fungi that may be present and available in each of the regto— 
where there is need for waging war against the locust plague. Even 
the botanists who are interested in this group of plants seem to have 
done but comparatively little towards isolating and separating the species 
from the standpoint of the systematise 

During the early seventies, when such vast swarms of the Rocky 
Mountain or Migratory Locust were devastating the country be I we— 
the Mississippi river and the Rocky Mountains, attention was frequently 
called to an apparent disease which occasionally made its appearance 
among the devouring hordes of that pest in various sections of the 
country. After a little investigation on the part of members of the 
Entomological Commission and others this fatality among the locusts 
was found to be due to the presence of a fungus which is now generally 
recognized as Empusa grylli, although it has been several times described 
under other names. 

While locusts in general are more or less frequently attacked by these 
fungi, particular ones among those indigenous to each country seem to 
be more subject to them than others. These usually, though not always, 
happen to be the forms that at times become so greatly multiplied as to 
be pests. This fact would indicate that it is necessary for the insects to 
come in contact one with another in order to spread the fungus sufflciently 
to develop an epidemic. 

These epidemics of the disease usually occur during warm, wet weather, 
or after such conditions of climate have prevailed for several weeks 1b 
succession. They are also quite apt to develop among the insects living 
along the edges of irrigating ditches or on grounds which have been 
thoroughly watered, rather than on those which are comparatively high, 
dry and more or less widely removed from water or rank, succulent 
vegetation. 

Eirly in 1896 (March) the subject of utilizing locust-attacking fungi 
l means of destroying these insects came more prominently before 
public. In South Africa where a couple species of these insects had 
i a pest for several years it was found that a disease of a virulent 
nature had broken out and was prevalent in the form of an epidemic 
among the swarms in certain localities. An investigation instituted at 
the time -showed this disease to be due to the presence of one of these 
species of fungus. Armed with the assurance that other insects had bee* 
successfully inoculated and destroyed by fungous diseases in Europe and 
the United States, members of the staff of the Bacteriological Institute </seg>

g country took the matter in hand and were successful in their atto 
isolate a fungus which was thought to be the one that was deg 
the insects in question, a species of large migratory locust 
um purpuriferum Walk.)- A brief account of the methods foland 
results obtained, from this work is given by Alexander Edinge 
director, in his annual report for 1898 of the Colonial Bac;ical 
Institute, located at Graham's Town, Cape of Good Hope. 

About a year or so later (June, 1897), during investigations that were 
being made at the time in connection with the large migratory locust of 
the Argentine Republic (Schistocerca paranensis Burm.), the writer discovered 
what appeared to be still another and quite distinct species of 
these locust-destroying fungi — a Sporotrichum. This discovery was made 
at Carrarana. a little town in southern Saute Fe, on the Central Argentine 
railway; and some experiments conducted later during the same year 
demonstrated its usefulness, under certain limitations, as a means of 
combating that insect. The South African fungus referred to above was 
also tried on the same locust, but with exceedingly poor results so far as 
could be ascertained at the time. Still more recent attempts at destroying 
various kinds of our North American locusts with both of these 
fungous diseases (South African and Argentinian) have resulted in no 
marked degree of success so far as the writer is concerned at least. 

During the past two or three years other persons have also been conducting 
similar series of experiments with these same and apparently 
some other locust-killing fungi. A few of these recent experiments as 
carried on by other workers seem to have proven more successful than 
those just mentioned above. One of these in particular appeared to be 
very promising at the time it occurred. This was at Sterling, Colorado, 
and was conducted by a Mr. George W. Martin, who obtained tubes of the 
fungus culture from the Department of Agriculture in Washington. The 
writer on visiting the locality found that although the native locusts of 
two or three species were dying in large numbers they all fell to the 
ground instead of clinging to the vegetation as they should have done 
if death resulted from the South African disease as indicated by the 
account referred to above. Then, tod, reports of similar fatalities among 
the 'hoppers coming from localities widely removed from where the 
fungus in question had been distributed, seemed to indicate the presence 
of another and entirely distinct disease. During the present year (An- 
Est. 1901) a culture of a species of Sporotrichum has been secured from 
ch dead insects gathered on the North Platte River about sixteen miles 
&gt;m Ogallala, Nebraska. 

In Australia it is reported that a fungus determined as Mucor 
racemosus. cultures of which were obtained from South Africa, has 
proved so successful in destroying the destructive locusts of Victoria that 
It is no longer considered an experiment but has passed into a matter of 
everyday practice. Either this same Mucor or a closely allied one is also 
claimed to have been secured from insects which died as the result of 
an outbreak of a locust disease in Mississippi. </seg>

It will be seen from what has Just been said that there are, without 
doubt, several distinct kinds of these locust-killing fungi, and that they 
are not the same the world over. That such is a fact Is perhaps very 
fortunate if we are to profit at all in our attempts to make use of them 
in dealing with the locust pest. 

Since each species of locust differs in structure and habits more or leaa 
markedly from all others, and the climatic and other conditions by which 
they are surrounded in their respective habitats are so dissimilar in 
many instances, it must be true that a great diversity should likewise 
exist among them as regards their hardiness. Hence it is but natural for 
us to suppose that the various fungi which are apt to attack and destroy 
them must also vary in these respects. That such a conclusion is warranted 
can be gathered from what follows. 

Empusa gryllx Fres. 

Perhaps the most characteristic of these different locust-attacktng fungi 
is the one recognized the world over as Empusa grylli. It has been 
known, botaniclly at least, since 1856, when it was first described by O. 
Presenius in the Botanische Zeitung, Band XIV, p. 882 (1856). Not only 
does it attack the different species of destructive locusts (members of 
the family Acridiids), some of the hairy caterpillars, and a few of the 
crane flies along with their larvae, but It is also frequently to be found 
as an enemy of various other orthopterous insects. Among these latter 
it has been observed especially as an enemy of some of the representatives 
of the two remaining families of saltatorial orthoptera, — Locustidse and 

This malady is quite readily recognized since the host when affected 
by it has a tendency before death to crawl upwards upon the vegetation 
where it chances to be at the time of infection. Here it grasps the leaf, 
twig, or stem closely and fastens itself so securely that it remains clinging 
tenaciously even after death. As stated above, all kinds of locusts and 
also their relatives are affected alike by it; and many of their dead bodies 
may frequently be seen still attached to the vegetation In late fall and 
early winter. Just what the pathological effect is upon the victim which 
causes this tenacious grasping or clutching with the front and middle lev 
may never be known. Yet, in a general sense, it may be remarked that 
all insects dying from the effects of any of the allied species belonging 
to the genus Empusa exhibit this same characteristic of climbing before 
death. Even such characteristically subterranean insects as are the various 
species of Ceuthophllus, or Camel Crickets, when attacked by this 
fungus are known to leave their customary moist, dark haunts to climb 
up bushes and other vegetation even to the height of several feet, where 
their dead bodies may occasionally be seen hanging for some time after- 

Whether or not the Empusse which attack the various orthopterous 
insects in different portions of the earth are identical in specie* is not </seg>

Iely known, although they are supposed to be bo by some of the 
g mycoloRists who have studied these peculiar parasitic plants. 
s as it may, minor variations in growth and structure have been 
among the forms indigenous to the different countries where coland 
studied. These differences have led to the multiplying of 
, so that we now have at least three distinct names, if not that 
actual species. 

An insect when once attacked by this fungus soon shows signs of imrest 
and ceases feeding. It shortly becomes "dumpish" and in due time 
attaches itself to the vegetation as stated above. The whole body, but 
more especially the abdomen, swells greatly and seems to be literally 
filled with a mushy, granular substance which, upon drying, changes to 
that of a brownish dust-like character. A little later this dust which is 
made up largely of resting spores escapes through the breaks between the 
joints of the insect's body and is scattered broadcast by the winds. 

Comparatively little is known concerning the life cycle of this fungus. 
or of the methods by which infection of the host occurs from year to 
year. That it must be done by contact rather than through the alimentary 
canal is quite probable, judging from reports of experiments 
made by Dr. Roland Thaxter and mentioned in his Monograph of the 
Entomophthores of the United States. The resting spores must also be 
exceedingly tenacious of life since several years may elapse between outbreaks 
of the disease. Still no regular intervals of such recurrences of 
the disease have been noted which would tend to show a periodicity. 
Neither does there seem to be a regular time of the year for its appearance, 
nor has it a preference for insects of any particular age, since those of 
all ages seem at one time or another to succumb to its attacks. Sometimes, 
though rarely, it may be noticed first in late spring or early 
summer; at others, and more frequently, during midsummer; and again 
even in late summer, early autumn, or possibly not until just before cold 
weather commences in late fall, when it seems to be most common. 

P. Thaxter says, "The artificial propagation of Empuscr, by the in&gt;n 
of fresh hosts, I have found a much more difficult matter than one 
i suppose, even where the infected host was of the same species as 
from which the spores were obtained for this purpose" (1. c, p. 152). 
Not alone has Mr. Thaxter found this difficulty in securing artificial Infection, 
but other persons have also learned the same fact fully when attempting 
to make use of the fungus as a means of destroying locusts. In 
truth the writer has found it impossible to artificially impart the fungus 
to a single insect in either the laboratory or field. It might be well, however, 
to state here that these experiments as conducted by the writer 
were purposely carried on in a very crude manner, since they were made 
for the purpose of securing results that might also be obtained by farmers 
.who are not equipped with carefully arranged laboratories. 

If we exclude the matter on this subject that has been reported from 
the Bacteriological Institute of Graham's Town, Cape of Good Hope, it </seg>

            <seg id="p287">
287 


appears that up to the present time all of the experiment* that hare been 
attempted for the purpose of growing this fungus artificially In the 
laboratory have been very unsatisfactory. 

E'ter having studied the subject carefully by reference to the available 
ature, and noting critically such facts as appear pertinent and which 
given below, it is the writer's opinion that such an exclusion as that 
suggested is justifiable. 

The typical region for Empusa grylli is Europe, and it is in that conntry 
possibly where it has been reported most frequently. But the rrswlor 
should not infer from this statement that the fungus is of rare occurrence 
elsewhere, for such is not the case. Here in North America it is sjbmc 
the most abundant of these plants, and is to be regularly met with each 
year in suitable localities throughout the length and breadth of the land. 
In fact, it very frequently occurs as an epidemic among the locusts in 
regions where various species of these insects have developed as pasta. 
This same, or a closely allied fungus, was occasionally referred to by correspondents 
as indigenous to Argentina while the writer was in that 
country several years ago; and, quite recently, notices of its occurrence 
in Japan and the Philippine Islands have been seen. 

By referring to the annual report of the Director of the Colonial Bacteriological 
Institute of the Cape of Good Hope for 1898 it will be 
learned that the much advertised South African Locust Fungus has been 
determined by the working force of that institution as an Empusa, and 
the name Empusa acridii suggested for it since it was reported to have 
attacked other species than the Red Locust (Acridium purpuriferum 
Walk.), one of the chief destructive species of that section. Plates I, 
II, and III, which are photographic reproductions accompanying that 
report show these locusts as they appear upon the vegetation after tirath 
caused by the fungus. Judging from what is known concerning the 
actions of insects after having been attacked by different fungi, a person 
who is conversant with the subject would not hesitate to at once pronounce 
the malady as protrayed here that resulting from the presence 
of an Empusa. To in part verify this conclusion we have the following 
records: Mr. Charles P. Lounsbury, Government Entomologist, in the 
Agricultural Journal of the Cape of Good Hope, February 2, 1899, says 
that the disease is apparently identical with Empusa grylli, and quotes 
as authority for this statement doctors Schonland and Black of the 
Bacteriological Institute of Natal. Also Dr. Munro, in his book on the 
Locust Plague, p. 182, quotes from a Mr. Evans as follows: 

"On the 4th of this month I wrote a letter stating that a fungus had 
been found in a locust causing their death, and it was afterwards determined 
by Mr. George Murray, F. L. S., head of the Botanical Department 
of the British Museum, as Empusa grylli." 

Kthe insects in question have apparently died as a result of the 
of an Empusa, an entirely different fungus appears to have been 
from the dead locusts and afterwards grown in quantity and seat </seg>

out from the laboratory to be utilized in fighting the same pest. In this 
report, referred to above, we fmd a description and illustrations of a 
fungus which in no wise resembles or approaches Empusa. In fact both 
the descriptions and figures suggest a Mucor instead, and possibly the 
world-wide distributed Mucor racemosus Fres. which does not belong to 
the insect-destroying fungi at all, but to the ordinary molds. Strangely 
enough the tubes of the so-called South African Locust Fungus received 
by the writer, both while in the Argentine Republic during 1898 and 
here in Nebraska two years later, contained fine growths of what was 
evidently the above named Mucor. 

E glancing over the files of the Journal of the Department of Agrioul- 
Df Western Australia for July, 1901, a statement was found to the 
that "The destruction of locusts by means of a parasitic fungus 
or racemosus) has now passed from the domain of experimentation 
that of everyday practice. The method which has been tried in 
us places where swarms of locusts proved troublesome to vegetanotably 
South Africa, has been for the past two or three years sueilly 
aplied in Victoria," etc. 

The Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, vol. 10 (1899), p. 1213, 
contains "A brief report of locust fungus" by D. McAlpine in which the 
writer says that a fungus which has been used against locusts at Cape 
Good Hope with good success has also been introduced into New South 
Wales and identified by him as Mucor racemosus. 

In looking up the bibliography of the fungus called Mucor racemotut 
it was found that two quite distinct plants have received this name. One 
of these was described by Bulliard in Hist. Champs. France, and is said by 
DeCandolle to belong to the genus Botrytis as now limited. The name of 
this fungus would then appear as Botrytis racemose (Bull.) DC., while the 
other, which has been the one under consideration, should be known as 
Mucor racemotus Fres.. Beitrage zur Mykologle. The Botrytis has been 
found upon putrid oily or greasy substances in France and Germany: 
while, on the other hand, the Mucor occurs quite generally over the 
world as a common mold that attacks decaying starchy and other substances. 


Being bo generally distributed, and withal so readily grown, .there is no 
wonder that this last mentioned should have been the fungus isolated, 
as heretofore stated, instead of the Empusa which is extremely difficult 
to grow upon various culture media such as are used in the laboratory for 
the artificial propagation of bacteria, etc. 

It might be mentioned also that in our experiments here at the University 
of Nebraska we have experienced great difficulty in isolating any 
particular fungus, and especially has this been the case with reference 
to the forms belonging to recognized insect-attacking genera like Empusa, 
Botrytis, Sporotrichum, and Isaria. Almost invariably they would be 
accompanied by representatives of such genera of saprophytic fungi as 
Mucor, Fusarium, Alternaria, Macrosporium, Aspergillus, etc., which 
would very quickly crowd the others out. </seg>

REPORT OF THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 

If the reader will take the trouble to refer to the instructions which 
accompany the various tubes of this "South African Locust Fungus" when 
they are distributed he will find the following directions given for securing 
an abundant supply of the material: 

"Collect a large number of grasshoppers which have died from the 
fungus. Dig a hole in the ground about eighteen inches deep and one 
foot wide. Strew some grasshoppers over the bottom, then sprinkle some 
water over them. Repeat with grasshoppers and again sprinkle until 
the hole is full. Do not press the grasshoppers in the hole, but leave them 
lightly packed. Then cover with a piece of tin or board and keep the 
hole thus carefully covered for four or five days. If very warm weather, 
four days will be sufficient, but if colder a longer time will be required. 
At the end of this time remove the grasshoppers and spread them out In 
the sun for an hour or two, or until thoroughly dry. Now grind them 
into a meal. Of this meal, which may be kept dry for a long time until 
wanted, take two tablespoonfuls and add it to a large tumblerful of water, 
into which some sugar has been placed. Leave this in a warm place for 
12 to 48 hours, and then treat live grasshoppers by dipping, etc., just as 
one does when using the fungus when supplied in tubes." 

If such a proceeding as that just described does not result in the 
growth of a variety of common molds, Mucor racemosus among them, 
nothing will do so. Even had the insects which were collected and 
buried been killed by poison, boiling water, heat, or in some other violent 
manner, and treated in a similar way, the result would in all probability 
have been quite similar. But when these insects die from disease and 
drop to the ground in a variety of localities and later are gathered together 
there is no telling how many different kinds of saprophytic fungi 
may have come in contact with and adhered to them. Even Empusakilled 
insects attached to vegetation a considerable distance from the 
ground would themselves become infested, and under favorable conditions 
support a great variety of these molds. 

In 4&gt;ur experiments with the fungus mentioned in this paper as Mucor 
racemosus we have found that such locusts as have been dipped or 
sprinkled with sugar-water cultures of it are killed; but when turned 
loose in the field there is no apparent spreading of the fungus to other 
'hoppers. Neither did we have any success in destroying them when the 
inoculation was attempted by feeding the fungus to the insects along 
with bread crumbs, etc., that had been used for culture media. It is surmised 
that by thus dipping the Insects into the liquid containing the 
fungus some of the mycelial threads and spores of the latter enter the 
stomata. as well as the sutures between the rings of the abdomen and 
thorax, and start to grow, and in a short time uBe up the fluids and vital 
tissues of the body sufficiently to cause death. 

Since -none of the other fungous diseases of locusts, aside from that 
caused by Empusa grytli, seem to have received much attention heretofore, 
it has been thought best to devote some space to their discussion

here. Especially does this seem warranted because of the numerous 
references made to them in these pages. 

Rporotrichum — sp. 

The first of these other locust-attacking fungi that deserves mention 
was discovered by the writer in 1897 while investigating the destructive 
locust problem of Argentina, South America. In the month of June, when 
the insect then under investigation was hibernating and confined chiefly 
to the more northern districts of that country, it was thought best to 
occupy the time in gathering data of various sorts. It was on one of the 
field excursions which were regularly made at intervals as this work was 
progressing that dead fungous-covered nymphs of the destructive locust 
were discovered securely tucked away in dense bunches of a species of 
grass common to a large portion of the open country. These dead 
¦nas" (as the nymphs of these insects are called in that country) had 
¦ ntly been destroyed by the fungus in large numbers during the 
previous year. Still, so securely were they tucked away in these clumps 
of grass that fully eight months later they not only remained nearly 
perfect in form, but also retained their colors sufficiently to make their 
identity certain. 

Having had some previous experience with an insect-destroying fungus 
of a similar appearance in the destruction of quite a different insect in 
the United States, a preliminary examination of these fungous-covered 
locusts at onoe suggested a Sporotrichum. But in order to obtain a verification 
of this surmise, or to learn definitely the nature of the find, 
specimens of the dead fungous-covered insects were submitted to Prof. 
C. E. Bessey, of the University of Nebraska, who reported that the identification 
was correct. Although the genus to which this South American 
locust-killing fungus belongs has been definitely settled, various unavoidable 
curcumstances have thus far prevented its specific identification. 

Locusts which have been attacked by this South American fungus, instead 
of climbing to the top of various plants so as to get as mufih air 
and light as possible, creep away from the light and seek dark, moist 
places in which to die. Consequently they are most often found hidden 
away near the roots of bunch grasses, in the midst of dense juicy foliage, 
etc. Here, after death, their bodies become entirely filled with the 
mycelial threads and spores of the fungus. In many cases, under certain 
conditions, the fungus growth also appears upon the outside and almost 
completely covers the dead body of the insect. 

Some breeding-cage experiments attempted later in the year indicated 
that the fungus could be quite readily transmitted from these dead 
fungous-covered saltonas to live, healthy locusts of the same species. 
While out in the open "camp" the invading swarms soon began dying in 
rather large numbers in the vicinity where the fungus had first been discovered. 
By gathering the dead bodies of these latter and pulverizing 
them and afterwards strewing this powder upon others along with their 
food they too were found to sicken and die. </seg>

REPORT OF THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 

The action of this fungus upon the host is similar to that of Bporotrichum 
gtobuliferum on the chinch-bug. At first the victim becomes 
restless, ceases feeding, and begins to wander aimlessly about until 
shortly before death, when it seeks a secluded spot in some dark nook 
upon or near the ground. Quite frequently, after a passing flight of an 
infected swarm, the ground was found to be strewn with dead bodies of 
such insects as had succumbed to the disease. These soon turned bright 
pink in color, and where they failed to reach a sufficiently moist and 
shady place shortly became quite hard and leathery in texture instead 
of rotting and breaking into fragments as is customary with dead insects 
of this class. By visiting the "roosting" places of such swarms there were 
also to be found upon the ground many of these same pinkish colored 
locusts that had succumbed and dropped during the night. Some of these 
latter although winged have been known later to exhibit the characteristics 
of those shown in the illustration already referred to above. 

During the period in which this fungus was epidemic among the locusts 
tn the southern portion of Santa Fe, and while under the observation of 
the writer, only four distinct species of locusts were found that had died 
as the result of its attack. These were the large migratory species of 
Argentina and the neighboring countries, Schistocerca paranensit Burm.. 
Zoniopoda tarsata Serv.. Diponthus communis Brun.. and Dichroptut 
elongatus Giglio-Tos. It might be of interest, however, to know that 
each of these, aside from the paranensis becomes locally destructive at 
times. This fungus, like Empusa. nourishes best during warm humid 

Having obtained such satisfactory results in transmitting this disease 
to other locusts while conducting experiments in Argentina, a quantity of 
dead fungous-covered insects, like those described above, were gathered 
and brought back to the United States for use in attempts at destroying 
our North American species. Accordingly, in July and August, 1898, large 
numbers of several of our most common MelanopU were gathered and 
placed in breeding cages along with a goodly supply of green food and 
the bodies of the dead fungous-covered insects. The powdered bodies of 
such dead locusts were also strewn over the food and moistened earth 
at the Bottoms of the cages. In addition to these, similar experiments 
were attempted in fields where our native locusts were exceedingly 
numerous, but in all cases these experiments failed to show a single instance 
of the possible transmission of the fungus to our native species. 

More recent attempts at obtaining an artificial growth of this South 
American locust-killing fungus on various media in the laboratory have 
also proved utter failures. The reason for this being, no doubt, the great 
age of the material at hand. 

Notwithstanding the failures in the experiments just recorded above, 
this, in the opinion of the writer, is one of the most promising locustattacking 
fungi, since it was found to withstand considerable variation 
in climate and to attack at least four widely different insects. Then, too, </seg>

            <seg id="p292">

its close relationship with the so-called Chinch-bug fungus gives us some 
reason for encouragement in the future. 

On July 17, 1900, a letter was received from George W. Martin, of 
Sterling, Colorado, who had undertaken some experiments with the South 
African Locust Fungus, a supply of which was furnished him from 
Washington. This letter reads as follows: 

Beak Sir: I have succeeded in killing a large amount of grasshoppers 
) acres of alfalfa, covering the ground with them for one-fourth mile, 
disease is still spreading and is now 500 yds. from where the infected 
were placed. I do not see why it will not kill all of them. I use 
meal 2 parts, sugar 1 part, for dose feeding at 4 P. M., again at 
M., putting them out at 7. I drive over the fields to be infected, 
fungus seems to be better a week old than earlier. 

"Yours truly, 

"Geobge W. Mabtis." 

A visit to the locality, as already stated, revealed the fact that, although 
several species of native locusts were dying in large numbers, contrary 
to the rule with insects that had been attacked by Empusa. These Colorado 
'hoppers all fell to the ground instead of remaining fastened to the 
vegetation. About the same time, and also somewhat later in the season, 
other reports were received of similar epidemics occurring among the 
grasshoppers in localities where no infection of any kind had been distributed. 
This year again still other reports of similar epidemics occurring 
among these insects were received here at the University of Nebraska. 
One of these was so remarkable in nature that a representative 
of the Experiment Station visited the locality to make an investigation. 
He was also requested to secure specimens of the dead and dying insects 
so as to ascertain if possible the cause of the epidemic. Other material 
was received at the Station from correspondents, and from these was 
obtained among other things (Spirillum and Bacterium) a Sporotrichum, 
the specific identification of which was not ascertained at the time as the 
botanists were then all away on their summer vacations. Since their 
return school duties have prevented their giving the necessary time to 
the matter, hence we can only suggest that this may be a second species 
of the genus which attacks locusts. 

While most of these local outbreaks, of what is evidently this last 
mentioned disease of our native locusts, occurs in moist localities such 
as irrigated fields and bottom lands, the one near Ogallala, Nebraska, was 
in a field where irrigation did not reach and came at a time when little 
or no rain had fallen for several weeks. The species of locusts found 
among the dead with reference to numbers were Afelanoplus differentialis, 
M. bivittatus, M. atlanis, M. femur-rubrum, it. packardii, Spharagemon 
collare, Brachystola magna, and Dissosteira Carolina in the order named 

— a, very encouraging record when we take into consideration the differences 
in the habits and structure of these insects. All the occurrences 
of this last named disease were in fields of alfalfa. </seg>

The isolation of this fungus came so late in the year and at a time 
when other matters prevented further work with it for the present impracticable. 
It is impossible, therefore, to predict as to its probable 
future value as an artificial factor in the control of the locust pest in the 
region where it was found.

CONCLUSIONS. 

After having spent considerable time in experimenting under various 
conditions and in different regions, as well as in the study of the subject 
as carried on by others, it is the opinion of the writer that this whole 
matter relative to the killing off of insect pests by means of fungous diseases 
is greatly overestimated. Especially is this true with reference to 
their use against destructive locusts. The chief reasons for this are the 
difficulty with which pure cultures are obtained in the laboratory and 
later transmitted to the insects to be destroyed, and the great factor 
which climatic conditions bear to the growth of the fungi concerned. 

Much of this false notion as to the absolute effectiveness of the inoculation 
method of treatment as a cure-all, which has gained a firm lodgement 
in the minds of so large a proportion of our population throughout the 
land, is, no doubt, due to the careless way in which agricultural and 
other newspapers of the country make definite statements on incomplete 
information. Then, too, very frequently contributors to such papers 
write concerning matters they know very little or nothing about. This 
sort of business on the part of the press certainly places the economic 
entomologist in a peculiar position, since it creates a misunderstanding 
between him and the people in whose interest he is supposed to labor. 

Were the writer required to give his opinion as to which one or &lt;mm 
of these different fungi seemed the most promising, he would without 
hesitation say "the native ones." He would do this because the importation 
of these disease-producing, or rather locust-killing, fungi from one 
country into another depends greatly on the similarity which exists in 
the climatic conditions of the countries concerned, in the relationship 
of hosts to be considered, and in the ease with which the fungi can be 
handled in the laboratory. Between the Kmpuste and Sporotricha the 
latter seem the more preferable because they are more readily handled 
artificially, growing as they do quite readily on different culture media. </seg>

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF ARCHEOLOGY. 

BILE. BLACKMAN. STATE ARC UROLOGIST. 

To the Honorable Executive Board of the State Historical Society: The 
following is a report of the department of archeology for the last six 
months of the year 1901 : 

At your executive meeting in June, 1901, your honorable body set apart 
a fund of $300 for the purpose of starting a department of archeology and 
this report covers the expenditure of this fund and shows the results accomplished. 


MUSEUM. 

The additions to the museum may be classed under three heads 

1. The Coffin Collection. — This collection consists of recent Indian 
costumes and implements collected by Joseph R. Coffin, of Genoa, Neb., 
and is deposited for safe-keeping and exhibition in the fire-proof rooms 
of the Nebraska State Historical Society. It is not subject to purchase 
during the life of the owner. 

This collection contains 115 catalog numbers. A minute history of each 
article is noted in the catalog. It is exhibited in a glass-front niche, ten 
feet wide, nine feet high and two feet deep. While the collection is worthy 
of three times the space that can be given it, still it forms one of the most 
artistic and complete studies of recent Indian life in the state. Mr. Coffin 
came to Lincoln with the collection and spent four days in arranging and 
cataloging the same. 

E Hopkins Collection. — This collection was gathered by Mr. A. 
ins, of Oakdale, Neb. It embraces a very large assortment of 
e implements, mostly from Nebraska; some from western Iowa, 
» very valuable "ceremonials" from Ohio. 

There are 276 catalog numbers in the collection, but this does not give 
an idea of the number of pieces. One catalog number embraces thirty-one 
heads of candy pails, each of which is covered with perfect arrow-points, 
averaging twenty-five arrow-points to the head; thus you see one catalog 
number represents over 700 pieces. I may safely say that this collection 
contains nearly or quite 2,000 pieces. It may be purchased; the society 
has an option on the collection. 

3. Other Smaller Collections.- — This heading covers not only what I 
have gathered from the field myself but the numerous smaller collections 
donated or loaned for illustration and study; it forms one-third of the 
museum additions of the last six months. The complete list of donors and 
the description of objects will be given in the more extended report later. 

A summary of the museum additions shows the following facts 

Amount of shelf space used (approximately) 500 square feet. 

Amount of glass to cover the collection. 700 square feet. 

Value (on a conservative basis), $4,000. </seg>

EXPLORATION. 

Bve explored more or less hastily eighteen Indian village sites daring 
»rk in this line. Four localities have been mapped and villages 
d. Probably twenty-five dstinct excavations have been made, a deaccount 
of which will be published in my report. 

Kmot say that any of these villages have had more than a cursory 
, as you will note that the time employed has been too short to give 
hours to any one village, while each one is worthy of at least a 
of careful study. 

The village sites group themselves into two main classes, recent and 

RECENT VILLAGE SITES. 

The recent Pawnee Site, south of Fremont, or the "McClalne site." This 
site is in cultivated fields and is nearly obliterated. The relics from there 
are mostly hoes, axes, etc. A cross-section of a lodge-circle that had been 
graded down level showed the size and floor paving very nicely. A gopher 
threw up charcoal and thus led me to make the excavation. This village 
comprised forty or fifty acres enclosed with a sod wall. 

E recent Pawnee Site seven miles south on the farms of Geo. Feist 
S. Esty. Mostly obliterated, but caches may be found by a syste-1 
search which will yield a rich return. 

Recent Otoe Site near Yutan on the old Bryant farm. Some earthworks 
plainly defined, very few relics to be found. 

Et Pawnee Site at Genoa. — This site has few relics on the surface, 
y are taken from the graves near by as they are plowed up from 
year. Many people remember the time of Indian occupancy, so a 
tory of the site may be obtained without a resort to relics. 

ANCIENT SITES 

Before my official connection with the society two ancient sites had 
been explored quite thoroughly, which I wish to embrace in this report: 

The Roca Site. — Eight to ten miles south of Lincoln is an ancient camp 
Bite which embraces a number of small camps scattered with pot-shards 
and chipped flints. The hematite bust was found on this site which gives 
it a permanent place in the annals of the state. 

Ehe Lowe Site, six miles south of Nebraska City, was explored at the 
ue«t of Mr. Paul Morton, assisted by his father, J. Sterling Morton, 
s site overlooks the Missouri river and yields a few chipped implements 
pot-shards. It is very ancient and contains the only pottery kiln 
id in the State. 

NEHAWKA FLINT MINES 

Under this head I wish to call your attention to one of the most prominent 
archeological studies in the state. 

On the farm of Isaac Pollard, the Nehawka fruit farm, is found extensive 
excavations in the brows of the bluffs along the Weeping Water and </seg>

            <seg id="p297">

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF ARCHEOLOGY. 

Eanches. These excavations have attracted attention from time to 
and Mr. Pollard being of an inquiring turn of mind made a crow 
n excavation through one of these mines or pits on his farm. The 
excavation made was sixty feet long, six feet wide and ten feet deep in 
the brow of the bluff. It revealed the fact that three ledges of solid limestone 
had been removed and broken up. The lowest ledge contained 
nodules of flint, as shown by the face of the ledge when exposed. Action 
of fire was shown on the ledge face and charcoal was scattered throughout 
the debris. The surface which shows to be thus, mined or quarried in 
the vicinity of Nehawka is quite extensive. No tools were found and no 
pot-shards were perceptible in the immediate vicinity of the mines. 

B Pollard Site near these mines yielded many coarsely chipped flints, 
pultures and other evidences of a village site. 

The Griffith Site two miles south of the mines yielded large pieces of 
pottery and a number of lodge-circles on low ground which is peculiar. 
The whole area in this vicinity contains many lodge-circles in groups of 
from three to nine in a place. 

The HollingxDorth Site near Holmesville, south of Beatrice eight miles, 
is one of the most interesting sites in the state. It covers an area of one 
hundred acres and yields the coarsely chipped flints so numerous in 

The Wright Site, near Genoa, belongs to a different class of aborigines. 
It has been quite thoroughly explored and yields a fine grade of chipped 
flints and many pot-shards. All the sites along the Platte, Loup and Elkhorn 
rivers yield a large type of implements in which Nebraska excels, and 
which can not be duplicated. These are being destroyed and science is 
losing some valuable data. One specimen of this kind in our museum leads 
the world; it is twenty-one inches long. 

The Burkett Site, three miles west of the Wright site, contains two 
hundred "mound houses" and large quantities of implements. 

B Coffin Site is two and one-half miles east of Genoa. From this site 
forty-two perfect "war points" in one-half day. 

¦ Larson Site is a mile farther east. It has 'been but superficially ex, 
but the beautiful "ceremonial" flint loaned by Mrs. Larson came 
there. \ 

Bj Fullerton Site covering the bluffs surrounding that town is quite 
?sting. From there came the only whole pottery vessel found in the 
It was found by R. Dewitt Stearns and loaned to the society. From 
came the record-breaking flint, twenty-one inches long. 

The Horse Creek Site is twelve miles up the Loup river from Fullerton. 
It is quite well defined, on low ground, and shows an earthwork fort or 
embankment. This is doubtless where Ellsworth visited the "Skl-di" 
band of the Pawnees in 1832. 

The Miller Site is in Antelope county on the banks of the Elkhorn 
river. Many relics of very fine workmanship have been found here. 

Gibson Site. — When camping near Swedeburg, south of Wahoo, I found </seg>

evidences of an Indian -amp site or village. A number of sepultures as 
well as other indications. 

Ithaca Site. — This site is ovltp obR'ure H't -overs most of the townsite 
of Ithaca and reaches farther north on the farm of William Dech. 

Many other sites have been brought to my notice, but this covers the 
list I have visited. Along Shell creek from Schuyler to Monroe are many 
sites. Along the Platte river from Fremont to Grand Island on the south 
side and along the Blue the whole length I hear of Indian village sites. 
All these should be explored and charted while they may yet be seen and 
the relics should be gathered into the museum, not only from the fields 
but the private collections should be secured before others carry them 
out of the state. There are activities all along this line in the west; 
Kansas has lost five tons of "Stone-Age" implements to one man, but 
thank fortune, science has been the gainer in this case. 

INDIVIDUALS INTERVIEWED. 

Riber of prominent characters in early days have contributed remss 
which will be elaborated in my published report; the nomenclathe 
state has its deserved attention and many streams and landnot 
heretofore named, have received appropriate Indian names 
; long list of musical articulations not yet preserved to posterity. 

TRIPS OUT OF THE STATE. 

The chance was offered to visit the Minnesota State Historical Society 
for a day at little cost, last October, and I believe the study here proved 
beneficial in many ways. 

Hon. J. V. Brower, of the Minnesota Society, a gentleman of mature 
years and ripe judgment, spent two weeks in reviewing the Nebraska field 
with me last October and gave me material assistance along some difficult 
lines; after which I visited the Kansas field with him and was permitted 
to study the evidences of our sister state at close range. At that time I 
assisted in organizing the Quivera Historical Society which will take up a 
systematical study of the great question of "Quivera." 

MEMBERSHIP. 

A number of men have been interested in our work through the medium 
of this department and are desirous of becoming members. 

MILEAGE 

E prominent railroads of the state have been very kindly disposed 
this department and barring one or two unimportant lines, they 
iven us all we have asked for. The Union Pacific has been the 
al line used, as it seems to reach most of the sites so far explored. 

About four thousand miles were traversed by rail, and two camp trips 
were made, each employing about two weeks of time and two hundred 
miles of travel. </seg>

Amount of money received |30* •• 

When your honorable body set apart this fund for archeological pur- 

poses, I was aware that we were expected to prove the importance of the 

work to be done and show what could be accomplished. 

The results are before you for your consideration and I respectfully 

urge that you place this department on a permanent and living basis, that 
the great state of Nebraska may assume her proper place in the fore-rank 

of archeological fields. 

Respectfully submitted this 15th day of January, 1902.

JANUARY, 1902. 

This month was chiefly spent in office work. New cases were put in 
and the rooms were rearranged for the annual meeting. 

iThe Hopkins collection was displayed and new labels were put on many 
the curios. 

Some time was spent in making a list of books needed for the library- 
This list was checked from the catalogs of other libraries in the city so 
that we should not duplicate books in other libraries. 

Enber of new books on early Nebraska history were added to the 
and I spent some time in reviewing them as well as some of the 
in the library. 

¦inclement condition of the weather precluded the possibility of 
xploration. 

rg this month the honorable board of trustees of the society arthat 
the work '.-.egun in archeology should continue to April 1, 

FEBRUARY. 

During the inclement weather I made a trip to Genoa, Neb., where I 
took longhand notes at the dictation of J. W. Williamson. Mr. Williamson 
is familiar with the Pawnee people, having been in the employ of the 
government among them many years. He was acting as trail agent for 
the Pawnees in 1874 when they were on their last buffalo hunt and the 
Sioux fell upon them near where Culbertson now stands and killed fifty 
of the defenseless Pawnees. This affair I have elaborated from notes 
taken and I should submit it as part of this report (marked A). 

Mr. Williamson personally conducted the larger part of the Pawnee 
band from near Genoa, Neb., across the country to their new reservation 
in Oklahoma. This I have also elaborated into manuscript and submit 
as part of this report (marked B). 

I also prepared a study of the Lewis-Clark expedition of 1804 along 
our east border, and located each camp by means of section corners, as 
far as possible. This study, which I submit as part of the report </seg>

EBd C), was printed and mailed to all newspapers along the route. 
Interest was aroused thereby and not a few points of historical 
rill be preserved as a result. 

James E. North, of Columbus, Neb., presented a typewritten manuscript 
of the life of Major Frank North. This manuscript contains over 100 
pages and is subject to the action of the publishing committee at any 
time. I submit it as part of this report (marked D). 

But few additions were made to the museum during this month. 

MARCH. 

EThis month I made an extended exploring trip out from the Nehawka 
larries to discover the chipping fields of the people who quarried flint 
here. The trip did not reveal very extensive village sites near. Spalls 
are found in small quantities 011 nearly every acre of land, but no very 
extensive areas well covered. After a hundred miles of careful exploration 
I am forced to look farther for these extensive fields which must 
exist. I am informed that across the river in Iowa such fields exist and 
in time they will be explored. 

During this month I made a trip to Blue Springs at the suggestion of 
A. O. Hollingworth of Holmesville. About a mile southeast of the town, 
on the farm of Chas. E. Rice (S. E. % 16 and N. E. V* 17-2-7), I discovered 
bRice Site" and secured two Quivera tomahawks. This site is unedly 
the former home of the people who chipped their implements 
.-. No pottery and no finely chipped implements were found. 

A number of pamphlets were received and card cataloged. Also reviewed 
some new books added to the general library. 

APRIL. 

Benjamin Hempel, who was janitor of the Cass county court-house, 
had maintained a large collection of curios of various kinds in a room 
set apart for the purpose. After the death of Mr. Hempel the county 
commissioners desired this collection removed. I went to Plattsmouth 
April 7 and began negotiations to have this collection removed to Lincoln. 
After some delay it was packed and is now in the museum. A 
detailing catalog is submitted as part of this report (marked E). 

t During the negotiations and pending the final decision about the 
;mpel collection, I made a trip to Junction City. Kan., to arrange some 
itters pertaining to the Coronado monument to be unveiled August 
12. On my way back I stopped at Barneston and, in company with A. 
Huddart of that place, discovered an ancient village site about a half mile 
southeast of Barneston near the Otoe Indian cemetery, which I named 1 
the "Huddart Site." This site is situated on a point on a hill overlooking 
the Blue river on the west and Plum creek on the south. It contains 
four or five acres and is quite thickly strewn with broken flints. A 
few perfect implements were found which belong to the first or lowest 
order of the stone age as shown in this state. </seg>



            <seg id="p302">

Mr. Huddart gave a collection of Indian bracelets, a pipe and some 
beads for the museum. Hugh Spencer loaned some beads, a bell and a 
pipe found at the Otoe village near Barneston, and Mr. Nolan gave some 
dishes, etc.. taken from a grave while digging a cellar. 

I The Hempel collection was packed and sent to Lincoln and I visited 
ss Addie Searle, whose brother brought a fine collection of Philippine 
iterial from Manila. 

MAY. 

tThis month was largely spent in reading and making preparations for 
summer camp trip. I made a hasty trip to Ashland with but little real 
result. I delivered a lecture in Omaha before the Daughters of the 
rican Revolution on Nebraska archeology. 

JUNE. 

Mr. F. M. Barnes, after whom Barneston was named, lives near that 
place: he has spent many years among the Otoe Indians, whose reservation 
was near. An interview with this gentleman gave me a fund of 
data, to which I shall add other points of Interest gleaned elsewhere and, 
in time, I hope to prepare a complete account of this interesting tribe. 

During this trip to Barneston Mr. Huddart accompanied me with his 
horse and buggy across the Blue river to a high point of land where the 
aborigines once had a small village. This we named the "Henrick Site" 
in honor of the man who owns the land. This site is a half mile west 
of the Blue river bridge at Barneston, and is similar in every way to the 
Huddart site on the other side of the river. 

On June 10th I made a trip to Tecumseh and explored the surrounding 
country, as well as made inquiry of old settlers relative to existing evidences 
of the aborigines or of the Indians. .Nothing worthy of note was 
learned. While at Tecumseh I met W. L. Dunlop, county surveyor of 
Johnson county for many years. He presented the society a copy of the 
atlas of Johnson county. 

tAt Table Rock I received a very fine collection of Philippine curios 
ought over by Howard G. Cleaveland, Co. G, First Nebraska. This 
llection is given as a loan for safe-keeping in our fire-proof rooms. A 
mplete catalog is herewith presented (marked F). 

On Tuesday, June 17, I started on an extended camp trip, returning 
Monday, July 21. 

I The detailed account of camp life day by day is monotonous, but each 
,y has its incidents which, taken together, give historical data that 
n be obtained in no other way. One gets an idea of what is not in a 
ven area as well as what is there, and both points are essential to a full 
knowledge of the archeology of the state. A slow trip by team seems like 
a waste of time in this railroad age, but in the outlying precincts, far 
Em the railroads, one finds very interesting fields. Take it all together, 
re can be accomplished in a given time by such trips than any other </seg>

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OP ARi 

The summer of 1902 was so wet that travel by team was not only slow 
but uncomfortable and I did not do all the area planned. The numerous 
exciting incidents are more pleasant to review than they were in enact- 

One Sunday, July 20, as we neared the Platte river at Louisville we 
found very soft roads; the soil had washed from the surrounding fields 
until it lay two feet deep in the roadway; this was so soft that the 
ponies went through it at every step and the hubs of the wagon often 
nearly touched the top of the soft mud. After pulling a few miles in this 
condition of roads we were informed that the Platte was over the road 
near the bridge and were given directions how to get across. "You moat 
keep the middle of the road while in the water; if you get too far to the 
right the water is twenty-five feet deep; to the left it is seven or eight 
feed "deep. You can make it, but be careful." With these instructions 
still ringing in our ears we came in sight of the water, at least a quarter 
of a mile wide, one sheet of rapidly flowing water with only fence posts 
on one side sticking a few inches out of the great lake to guide us. 
Cross we must, as the river was constantly rising and there was no place 
for a camp on account of water on every side. We live to tell the story, 
but the experience was anything but pleasant. This serves to show 
that a camp trip is anything but monotonous. 

At Fort Calhoun we paused for a few days and explored the surrounding 
country in company with W. H. Woods of that place. 

Keful inspection of the ground where once stood the first military 
the state convinced me that "Council Bluff" of the Lewis-Clark 
on in 1904 may be definitely located. 

I inspected a number of places where these early explorers camped in 
this state. We discovered and platted the "Nelson Site" situated on section 
23, 17 N., 12 E. t and explored it partially. The vicinity of Fort Calhoun 
is an interesting field for investigation. Gustave Nelson loaned the 
society two very fine celts, Dr. Pettingill supplied a collection, as well as 
H. G. Schwager, who loaned a fine collection of coins and buttons from 
the old fort. Mr. Saltzman loaned a small pottery vessel that he found 
in a bank of earth where he was grading a road. Otto Frahm loaned a 
few specimens. 

B weather showed signs of being settled and we continued our way 
river to Decatur. 

The "Golden Springs" are on the farm of F. E. Lange, who came there 
in 1855. At that time there were many rude pictures carved on the soft 
sandstone near the spring which Mr. Lange is quite sure was the work 
of Indians. "Lewis and Clark 1804" was cut on the rock. While a few 
outlines of the rude pictures are still to be seen, the last historical landmark 
is entirely obliterated. 

Decatur is an old town and has many historical spots which the old 
settlers take pride in pointing out. 

Arrangements had been made before starting by which A. L. Hopkins, </seg>

            <seg id="p304">

of Oakdale, should meet me In the Sioux Valley, Iowa, and explore the 
extensive ruins there, so we crossed the Missouri and started to keep the 
appointment. The ruins were not explored, owing to the incessant rain 
and the failure of Mr. Hopkins to arrive. We have in the Nebraska State 
Historical Society a large collection of material from the Sioux valley and 
desired to study the locality. We hope to do so in the future. A numter 
of chipped flints from Iowa were brought to the museum. 

One very important discovery made on this trip must be mentioned 
before I leave it: While halting in the town of Tekamah to mail a card 
I met Mr. J. P. Latta, who invited me to his house to inspect a unique 
carved image found near the town twenty years ago. It proved to be very 
interesting; it is made of a very hard, gray substance, so hard it will 
scratch glass; it is two and a half inches long and one and a half inches 
wide; it has an oval form, and one side looks as if molded in a clam shell, 
the other has the full form figure of a child carved in relief. The art 
expressed is very fine. Upon my return home I consulted a note I had 
taken about a similar image being found in Plattsmouth and immediately 
started for that place. A number of people who saw the image took up the 
matter and the search for a classification and history still goes on. At 
Plattsmouth I was so fortunate as to find another exactly like the first one. 

Rhill near Tekamah is formed of a brown sand rock having geods 
irony nature scattered here and there through it. This hill overthe 
Missouri river and a careful exploration reveals an' Indian 
ry at the top. On a hill near by is an old altar, or a place where 
fires were maintained until the clay is burned like brick for three 
-ound. This shows the place to have been inhabited by Indians, 
the railroad built northwest from Tekamah they made a cut some 
Bixty reet deep; this was through the hill where Indians were buried. In 
the bottom of this cut not long after it was completed Ed. Latta found a 
piece of the sand rock mentioned and on breaking it open the little image 
fell out. The one from Plattsmouth was found about the same date by a 
son of G. Fickler below the water line in the Missouri river at that place. 
Mr. Lininger, of Omaha, thinks the images represent Raphael's conception 
of Little St. John, molded in a half shell. The story of St. John's 
connection with a shell is a long one which I shall let you dig out. The 
two specimens are unique and have attracted wide attention, but nothing 
of their history has been established for certain, yet. 

Eust 12 there was unveiled at Junction City, Kan., a monument to 
emory of Coronado. The exercises occurred at Logan Grove, the 
3f Capt. Robert Henderson. I participated in these exercises and a 
!te account is presented as part of this report (marked G). 

In my report for last year will be found an account of the so-called 
Flint mines or quarries at Nehawka. A question was raised in the mind 
of some people about these quarries and I was anxious that eminent men 
should examine the place and render an opinion, so on August 14 a com- </seg>

to Nehawka and spent the day in exploring these evidences of the Stone 

The company consisted of Prof. N. H. Winchell, president of the Geological 
Society of America; Prof. Warren Upham, one of the most eminent 
drift geologists of the world and now secretary of the Minnesota State 
Historical Society; Prof. J. V. Brower, author of eleven books on geology, 
archeology and geography and the one who rediscovered and explored the 
Quivera of Coronado, now archeologist of Minnesota, together with Professors 
Barbour of the department of geology, University of Nebraska, 
Caldwell of American history department, and Barrett of the State Historical 
Society. 

Mr. Isaac Pollard, who owns part of the land, entertained us very 
pleasantly. The day was spent in a careful study of the situation and the 
major opinion was rendered in accordance with the tenor of this and last 
year's report. A statement signed by the visiting gentlemen is herewith 
tendered as a part of this report (marked H). 

The Nebraska State Historical Society determined to make an exhibit 
on the grounds at the state fair in 1902. An unique souvenir was prepared 
at the suggestion of Mr. Barrett. It was decided to place a fragment of 
pottery and a fragment of flint in an envelope bearing a description of 
?arh and a brief notice of the aims and desires of the society. These were 
given to visitors. 

August 21 I started to Genoa and gathered 150 pounds of pot-shards 
from the Burkett Site, while Mr. Barrett gathered the flint at Nehawka. 
This scheme proved a good one and our attraction at the fair grounds 
proved interesting and a success. 

SEPTEMBER. 

On Monday, September 1, we were on the fair grounds arranging our 
tent to make an instructive exhibit. Much valuable data was gathered 
and many people came to know of the Historical Society, so that much 
benefit will accrue in consequence. 

Br moving from the fair grounds Mr. Barrett and I made a trip to 
ville, where we packed a quantity of books and pamphlets belongex-Governor 
R. W. Furnas. These early pamphlets are now in the 
rooms; they contain many very rare publications. 

OCTOBER. 

K labor became necessary in taking care of the museum at this 
of the year and many collections were removed, cleaned and red; 
new material had come in and room must be arranged for it. 

The last two volumes of society reports came from the press and were 
wrapped and sent out. 

I made a trip to Blue Springs at the suggestion of Hon. J. V. Brower, 
who bad discovered an Indian site not far north of that town. October 
7 I visited this site, which I have called the "Wonder Site," in honor of </seg>

G. Wonder, who owns part of the land. It is in section 8-2-7. This village 
consisted of about thirty acres and has an earth wall around it still well 
defined. When Mr. Wonder came there in 1877 the wall was four feet 
high in places. Lodge circles are plainly traced at this date. The implements 
are mostly of the second or intermediate class of the Stone Age. 
No beads were found, nor was any article found which showed contact 
except one piece of an iron ax similar to those found at the Pawnee Site 
near Fremont. This may have been dropped by later Indians. Many 
stone implements were found but they were mixed — all three classes of 
Stone Age implements, as I have divided them in the state, were found. 
I made a rough sketch of the site, but more exploration is necessary. A 
few pieces of pottery were found and Mr. Brower found a piece of 
steatite (soapstone) vessel — the first in the state — on this site. This 
site can not be classed with the Rice, Hollingworth, or Huddart Sites and 
is very differently located in many ways. 

ERora Site was explored more fully in company with Thomas Marof 
Clearwater, on October 21. On the 22d I started to Plattsmouth 
icked the Searle collection. This is a very fine collection of Philmaterial; 
a catalog of the same is appended (marked J). 

NOVEMBER. 

THE NIOBBABA TRIP. 

On Tuesday, November 11, I started over the Elkhorn railroad for 
Clearwater. On the trip I saw a number of collections which we will 
hope to secure in time and visited A. L. Hopkins, of Oakdale. Mr. Hopkins 
has collected from the fields and mounted a great number of specimens 
since we secured his collection about a year ago. He had sixty-four 
heads of candy pails covered with arrow points, scrapers and other implements 
as well as many heavy polished stone implements. He is a 
close student and a hard worker and should be compensated by the state 
for his diligence. He is not a rich man and some provision should be 
made to reward him for his toil while yet he lives to enjoy it. The entire 
collection I packed and sent to Lincoln before I left. -For a complete 
list of this collection see catalog. 

Bom Oakdale I went to Niobrara. Mr. B. Y. High, of that place, buys 
he articles manufactured by the Indians and offered for sale. When 
need money badly they often offer some very unique and valuable 
imens made for personal use or given them as presents. Mr. High 
has accumulated a very fine collection of the articles made by recent 
Indians, both bead work and pipestone work. It is the finest I have 
bin the state and contains many articles in porcupine quill work, 
entire collection Mr. High has sent to the Historical Society, promts-9

DECEMBER. 

Mr. Martin, of the Kansas State Historical Society, asked me to render 
a paper before the Kansas society on "Early Days in Kansas and the H. 
U. A." I have all the documents of a secret society which once settled the 
county-seat light in Sherman county, Kansas, and I prepared from memory 
and the documents the desired paper. (See Kansas Historical Reports to 
be published.) 

Ie in Topeka I discovered and brought home with me the flrst 
I of the "Palladium," a newspaper published at Bellevue, Neb., In 
This is the first newspaper published In the state and this volume 
is all the numbers published but seven, and is hence very valuable 
state. 

E rough the kindness of the officers of the Kansas society I was able 
Ing it here. After my return from Kansas City the rest of the year 
&gt;ccupied in arranging the cases and rearranging the museum. Much 
material recently brought in had to be placed and the crowded con-1 
of the rooms makes the matter difficult. 

The Morton history is in course of preparation and I have been asked 
to furnish a chapter on archeology. As this will give your honorable body 
a little idea of the systematical study accomplished, I beg leave to present 
it as part of this report (marked K). 

ADDENDA. 

K Librarian has requested me to make this report a complete museum 
and to that end I wish to add a word relating to other small 
ons. 

R. W. Furnas presented two swords used by him during the civil war, 
a number of unique pipestone curios, a quantity of geological specimens, 
a fishing rod of his boyhood days, a saddle which he rode during the war 
and other trinkets of historical value. Mr. Yule, of Lincoln, presented 
an ancient brass box, the gift of Prince of Orange to one of his ancestors. 
C. L. Belpar, of Rulo, Mrs. R. R. Livingston, F. F. Wils, A. B. Todd, J. H. 
Thrasher of Plattsmouth, Mrs. Van Valkenburg, Genive Wilsie of Niobrara, 
Laura McKinnon. Cass Jones of Rulo, Mr. Haile of Clearwater, J. D. 
Wood of Lancaster county, and E. M. Star of Geneva all made small 
donations. 

In making this report to your honorable body of the work accomplished 
in archeology during the year I have concluded it is better to divide It 
into months, and make it a summary of work done chronologically. There 
is one difficulty in this arrangement which will appear: Each collection 
is not cataloged and arranged regularly as soon as received, owing to 
the crowded condition of the rooms, so the catalog of the museums la 
also submitted as a part of this report, together with the various manuscripts 
prepared and the charts and maps of the various localities so far 
as they have been completed. </seg>

The museum is growing rapidly; the stimulus given by personal contact 
with people throughout the state who have collections can not be overestimated. 
It is not so much the work I really do as it is the work I 
stimulate others to do in their own locality that accomplishes so much 
for the museum. 

Efrom adding to the museum, the study of the Nebraska 
les is no small part of my duties. Along that line a little has 
complished during the year. 

Along with this study of the aborigines, as made by means of their 
chipped flints, pottery and habits, goes a study of the Indians as early 
explorers found him and early settlers knew him; this necessitates a 
complete study of all sources bearing on the matter that we may arrive 
at a true conclusion as to the relationship which may have existed 
between the Indian and the aborigines. This work is slowly progressing 
and is nearly complete. I append a brief resume of the study to assist 
students in determining the sites explored. (See '•Nebraska Indians" 
in appendix.)

but notes on matters which should be looked up when in the

1'pon the publication of this report I wish to add a word to the people 
who may read it. One person or one society can do little in any given 
line unless those interested will co-operate. Let the Nebraska State Historical 
Society get in touch with you; write us about the interesting 
historical spots and people in your vicinity; thell us about the Indian 
villages and send us the specimens you may have. We will take care of 
them for you and they will assist in our work. Your identity will always 
remain with your specimens, as they are cataloged in the owner's name. 
Our publications will grow more valuable every year if the great common 
people will assist. 

I am indebted to many very worthy friends of the Historical Society 
throughout the state for assistance in my work of exploration and study. 
The detailed account of the various trips made by me during the biennium 
must be omitted from this report on account of space, but I hope 
in time to publish my field books in which these matters are recorded.

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE. 

We find the Stone-Age implements distributed along the waterways 
so abundantly that we may readily conclude that primitive man gradually 
worked his way over the entire state by following the water way*. 

The archeology of the state can be determined only by the implements. 
The quantity of Stone-Age material found in the state naturally divides 
itself into three classes. While these three classes overlap each other 
in many cases, every implement may be readily placed in one of them. 
These classes may be subdivided, it is true, but in that subdivision some 
one implement will be found which is doubtful of classification, and at 
this stage of the study, lines of demarcation point out but three distinct 

¦ first, or most primitive class, is found, without pottery intermixed, 
the Blue river and in the southeastern portions of the state. 

The second, or intermediate class, consists of chipped implements of 
massive size, found along the Klkhorn and Missouri rivers. A few have 
been found along the Platte river. 

Siird class (which may most easily be subdivided) consists of 
flints showing fine workmanship; abundant pot-shards, some 
opper ornaments and a few "ceremonials" are intermixed. The 
rm, or lodge-circles, may be studied with this class, and are most 
t along the Platte and its tributaries. 

Bear in mind that these three classes of Stone-Age implements may 
belong to one people — that they may only, respresent a single tribe in its 
evolution from barbarians to a semi-civilized race; or they may belong 
to twenty or more tribes having no ties in common. Only years of careful 
study and comparison can settle that question, if, indeed it is ever definitely 
settled. 

It should be borne in mind that primitive man used stone implements 
entirely. The aborigine wandered over this state before the Bronze Age; 
in fact, there was never a Bronze Age in this state, so far as known now. 

One of the three following propositions is true, either wholly or in 
part: First, the aborigine was extinct before civilization came, to this 
continent; second, the Amerind with implements obtained from the 
whites- drove out the aborigine; or, third, he was, himself, supplied with 
implements of civilization and is now counted an Amerind. Tou will 
bear in mind that archeology has to deal with prehistoric man, the man 
who used the implements of the Stone Age, and when this same aborigine 
evolved to an Amerind, ethnology takes up the study where archeology 
leaves off. 

If the aborigine frequented a spot, there was certainly a good reason 
for so doing. Let us examine the conditions that would entice the primitive, 
Stone-Age man: White man cultivates the soil and produces his 
subsistence, but the aborigine followed the chase and supplied his wants 
from nature; to do this he must have flint or some kind of stone from 
which to make his implements. Flint is the most available material for 
this purpose, as it possesses the property of conchoidal fracture, as well 
as a great toughness, very desirable in stone-cutting implements. </seg>

BEPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF ARCHEOLOGY. 

Pe southeastern part of the state contains flint nodules imbedded In 
limestone ledges; the water-shed of the Republican river contains 

a brown flint or jasper in strata; -the northwestern part, along the 
Niobrara river, has a green quartzite which chips easily. Most of the 
chipped implements of the state are made from one of these kinds of 
stone. We may, therefore, conclude that this natural deposit of implement-material 
largely influenced the aborigine in his choice of location. 
The. numerous running streams and the near proximity of the buffalo 
plains, together with an abundance of small game, doubtless helped to 
make eastern Nebraska a favored place for the aborigine. 

THE EARLIEST TYPE OF STONE-AGE IMPLEMENTS. 

The Blue River Valley is strewn most abundantly with the implements 
which fall in this class. They are found on the high points of land which 
overlook the Blue river, and are usually not far fnjm a water supply. 
The material used for these rude implements was found near at hand. 
As far as the Blue valley has been explored (from Beatrice to the state 
line on the south), there is imbedded in the limestone which rests near 
the water line, many nodules of blue chert or flint. The quality of this 
material is much better than that of the chert ledges farther south in 
Kansas, but the nodules are not so abundant and are much harder to 

E making the Implements it is evident the work was done by beating 
dge with another piece of rock until the desired shape was obtained, 
edges are blunt and the implements very rude. Many fragments of 
are found with very sharp edges left by the fracture, showing that 
ng tools were used having very sharp natural fractures instead of 
lg been artiflcally chipped to a cutting edge. 

From the Blue river eastward to the state line, many high points of 
land have a few of the chips of blue chert mixed with the soil, showing 
that aboriginal man once had his camp at that point. But the most pronounced 
evidence of this first, or lowest, stage of the Stone Age is found 
near the mouth of the Weeping Water; at that point one may draw a 
circle five miles in diameter with the town of Nehawka well to the southeast 
side of this circle, and he will enclose a vast area of quarry pits made 
by prehistoric man. (See report of archeologist in Nebraska State Historical 
Society report of librarian for 1902.) The. exact surface area of 
these pits has not been measured, but they cover many acres. 

Mr. Isaac Pollard, who owns some of the land upon which the pits are 
found, made an excavation through one of them. The trench is sixty 
feet long, six feet wide, and from ten to twelve feet deep. This trench 
has its floor on a solid ledge of limestone, which is the fourth ledge from 
the top. The trench as dug from the hillside surface back to the edge of 
the pit on the brow of the hill, terminates at a solid perpendicular wall. 
Here appear marks of discoloration caused by fire. Quantities of charcoal 
and ashes were found at the base of the wall and scattered throughout 
the debris which the trench passes through for half its length. </seg>

            <seg id="p312">
312 

NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. 

Khe beginning of the trench, some forty feet above the water level 
hundred feet from the bed of the Weeping Water, broken rocks and 
debris was found for a few feet, then the trench passed through 

a bank of earth and stratified rocks that had not been moved. This bank 
is sixteen feet thick on the floor of the trench. After this comes a mixture 
of spalls, broken rocks and soil intermingled. This debris appeared 
to have been thrown out in layers resting at an angle of about forty-five 
degrees to the level of the floor. It is loosely packed in places, while here 
E there is a very closely packed stratum of brown clay filled with 
spalls and bits of limestone; it has every appearance of being well 
ed and is hard to dig through. 

Eraost abundant material in the debris is broken lime-rocks having 
fractures on them as if struck by some heavy body. Many of these 
show the rounded matrix of a flint nodule which has been removed, 
iurface near the pit is strewn with flint spalls. 

The first stratum of rock, as shown in a quarry near by, is a rotten 
lime-rock; the second is a fairly good building stone without flint 
nodules — and at the perpendicular wall where the trench ends, is from 
twenty-six to thirty-eight inches thick. The third stratum, which is very 
compact and from thirty to forty-two inches thick, contains the flint 
nodules, about two-thirds of the way down. The nodules are from the 
size of an egg to the size of a man's head and are about twelve inches 
apart each way. They cleave out very readily and leave a rounded matrix 
when the ledge is broken up. - 

No tools have been found thus far in the search, and no perfectly 
chipped implements have been found; in fact no flint upon which artificial 
chipping can be detected for a certainty has been found in the 
trench, and no pottery. A few of the first class of Stone-Age implements 
were found in the vicinity and a few shards of pottery as well as some 
of the third class of implements were found in lodge circles and graves 
near these pits; they doubtless belonged to other people who came along 
the Missouri at a later date. 

In this limited space one can give but a faint conception of the skill 
shown in quarrying, of the years spent in systematical labor, and of 
the vast numbers that must have been engaged. In one of the pits stands 
a burr-oak tree six feet two inches in circumference. 

THE SECOND CLASS OF STONE-AGE IMPLEMENTS. 

These are the massive, chipped stone implements found along the Elkhorn 
and Missouri rivers. Quantities of these are also found along the 
Sioux river in Iowa, as well as in the northeastern part of Kansas. They 
are shaped like the smaller implements of class three; they are undoubtedly 
chipped by the pressure process, and, at times, show much skill In 
their manufacture. With them we often find the finer and smaller implements 
of class three. 

The mystery which we note about these implements is their size; they 
are too large for use in the chase or in war, and may be classed as digging </seg>

            <seg id="p313">

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF ARCHBOIAXJY. 

tools. One Instance of study must suffice here: on the Wright site Mar 
Genoa, these massive Implements are abundant in a field near the lodgepi 
nies now to be seen there, but not at the same place. It seems that the 
newer village site is a few rods from the old one where the lodge circle* 
are not plainly defined but where these massive implements are 
abundant. This may lead to a better understanding of this second class, 
in time. Near the Elkhorn, where no lodge-circles can be noticed, these 
massive implements are abundantly scattered with implements of the 
third class, and pottery is found there too. 

THE THIRD CLASS OF STONE-AGE IMPLEMENTS. 

This class of material is abundant in most parts of the state and consists 
of the finely chipped arrows, scrapers and spears in use among the 
Indians when early hunters and trappers first came among them. I have 
said that this class may" be subdivided; every tribe which the early 
trappers and missionaries visited had a certain individuality and difference 
in their chipped flints. This difference is not easily studied from 
the meager data left by these early writers, and one finds many stumbling 
blocks in trying to classify them from their individuality of chipping 

This class is most abundant along the Platte river, where the lodgerircles 
are most plainly defined. These lodge-circles antedate the traditionary 
knowledge of the Amerind, but are so similar to the ruins left 
by the recent tribes that we can but connect the two as the product of 
the same people. In many cases we know that these ancient ruins were 
abandoned before contact, even indirectly, with whites, as the red men 
prized so highly the arts of the whites that he secured them on sight. 
There being not the slightest trace of such contact, we may safely conclude 
there was none, and therefore this latest class is properly a study 
in archeology. Space forbids a lengthy description of these implements, 
but the Nebraska State Historical Society museum illustrates the above 
three classes. 

POTTEBY. 

It is true in a limited degree only that we may judge the people by 
their pottery. The pot-shards found in the state are, mainly, of three 
kinds: that having fabric impressions, that ornamented with designs 
drawn on the plastic clay, and a poorer quality of more recent manufacture. 
The first two are black, feebly burned, and tempered with 
quartz pebbles, mica and pot-shards. The last is often very red, having 
been burned more severely; it is tempered with sand and at times small 
pebbles are found in it as well as powdered shells. 

Keful study of the pottery question reveals the fact that Buche 
1, 1842) describes a Scandinavian pottery which corresponds in 
ay to this Nebraska pottery. The Scandinavian pottery was made 
usand years B. C. 

It is evident that the first stage of the Stone Age, as described above. </seg>

had no pottery. It is equally certain that the third class had pottery in 
abundance; the second, or Intermediate, stage is so closely associated 
with both that it is difficult to say definitely. The third class had the 
pottery belonging the first two kinds mentioned, and the third kind was 
probably brought here by some later tribe. 

The study of Nebraska archeology has been in progress, in a systematical 
way, but little over a year, and I am loath to supply even this brief 
data. No state in the Union offers a more fertile field. It is complicated, 
as the aborigine was a nomadic creature, and so many tribes of recent 
Indians have made these vast buffalo plains their hunting-grounds, that 
it is very difficult to follow the line of demarcation which separates the 
ruins of the aborigine from those of the Amerind. 

Many relics have been gathered into the Nebraska State Historical 
Society museum, which forms the basis of this study. Many more are 
scattered over the state, not only in the fields and along the streams, but 
in the keeping of people who enjoy them because of the curiosity, but 
who do not realize their importance in completing this branch of our 
history. 

Twenty-four village sites have been more or less systematically explored 
and charted, from walled cities, whose bounds and metes are yet plainly 
defined, down to temporary hunting camps of a few tepees, thickly 
strewn over the state. Of the recent village sites, or those occupied during 
historic days, five have been explored. 

Eics of domestic economy and of art are being gathered, which will 
I the people who used them as truly as we may read the life of our 
iates in their everyday walks. Archeology will, in time, build the 
history of the race which lived, loved and worshiped on the soil of 
tate.

GEOLOGICAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL EXCURSION TO NEHAWKA, 

NEB., AUGUST 14, 1902. 

In our return to Minnesota, from the dedication of the Quivera monument, 
near Junction City, Kan., which took place August 12, we accompanied 
Prof. E. E. Blackmail and A. E. Sheldon, of the Nebraska Historical 
Society, and visited with them at the rooms of that society in 
Lincoln, Neb. On Thursday, August 14, accepting their invitation, we 
took an excursion with them and others for examination of localities in 
the vicinity of Nehawka, Neb., about thirty-five miles east of Lincoln, 
where Mr. Blackman and others, including Mr. Isaac Pollard of Nehawka 
and one (Mr. Brower) of our number from Minnesota, had identified, 
according to their opinion, ancient quarries of the American aborigines, 
Kively worked for obtaining chert for the manufacture of some lmits. 
Besides our general interest in archeology, we were led to 
Lamination by a difference of opinion concerning these localities, as </seg>

EEPOBT OF DEPARTMENT OF ARCHEOLOGY. 

they had been examined by others who considered the disturbances of the 
bedrock and of the overlying drift to be probably referable to glacial 
action during the Ice Age. 

Our party in this excursion consisted of three from Minnesota, namely, 
Hon. J. V. Brower of St. Paul, in charge of the archeoiogical field work 
for the Minnesota Historical Society; Prof. N. H. Winchell of Minneapolis, 
state geologist, 1872 to 1890, president of the Geological Society of 
America, and Warren Upham of St. Paul, secretary of the Minnesota Historical 
Society, formerly assistant on the geological surveys of New Hampshire, 
Minnesota, and the United States; and four from Lincoln, Neb., 
namely, Prof. Erwin H. Barbour, professor of geology in the State University 
and acting state geologist; Prof. Howard W. Caldwell, professor of 
history and jurisprudence in the State University, and secretary of the 
Nebraska Historical Society; Jay Amos Barrett, librarian of the Nebraska 
Historical Society, and Prof. E. E. Blackman, in charge of archeoiogical 
field work for the Nebraska Historical Society. At Nehawka we were 
joined by Isaac Pollard, one of the earliest and most honored pioneer* 
of that town, owner of a large fruit farm, on whose land the first locality 
rained by us is situated, being about a half mile south of Nehawka on 
Weeping Water creek. 

This locality is an extensive but low hill, mainly covered by woods, on 
the south side of the Weeping Water, above which it rises to the estimated 
height of about sixty to seventy-five feet, by moderate slopes with 
a gently rounded top. The bedrock forming this hill and the surrounding 
country, under the general drift deposits, is a buff limestone, in part 
heavily bedded, of nearly horizontal stratification. Its age is understood 
to be coal measures or Permo-Carbonlferous. On the northern flank of 
this hill the limestone occasionally outcrops, and elsewhere is covered 
by only a few feet of the glacial drift. Around the northern side of the 
hill, at the height of about forty feet above the adjoining creek, th« 
glacial drift had been extensively excavated in many pits, two to fire 
feet deep, ten to twenty-five feet wide, and thirty to one hundred feet long, 
or more. These pits are situated In a series at a uniform height along the 
upper part of the hill, following its curvature along the distance of about 
a quarter of a mile. 

A trench had been dug across one of the largest and longest pita by 
Mr. Pollard a few years ago, extending sixty feet, or more, with a width 
of about five feet, and attaining at its end (or rather part running into 
the hill) the depth of about ten feet. In cutting through the earth dump 
thrown out of the pit on its lower or downhill side this trench revealed 
an old surface soil, observed for ten to fifteen feet in length, covered 
one to three or four feet by the later earthy drift supplied from the excavation 
of the pit. Traces of a higher old surface soil were also noted, in 
the dump material, showing that the dump was accumulated at different 
times. At the end of the trench, about seven to ten feet below the surface, 
it revealed a thick stratum of the limestone, with fractured and </seg>

            <seg id="p316">
316 


I outlines as produced by rude quarrying, aided by action of fire. 
stratum is especially characterized by its containing many nodules 
»y chert three to six inches in diameter. In the dump and strewn 
It are abundant masses of the limestone, showing little or no effect 
*thering or decay since their fracture, and many of these masses 
empty hollows or matrices of chert nodules, which have been 
red. Several large pieces of the limestone, up to a foot or more in 
•ter. and also a few of the red Sioux quartzite from the glacial drift 
seen in and upon the dump, bearing on their ends or edges battered 
marks as if used in hammering and breaking the limestone masses for 
the purpose of securing the chert nodules. Artificially chipped small and 
large fragments of the chert were observed in the dump; but no perfect 
implements, nor parts of implements, were found by our search. No 
wood for wedges or levers was discovered; nor any iron, or other indications 
of work by Europeans. In one place the dump material was seen 
to have been loosely placed, with cavities among its cobbles or stone 
fragments, so that both hands together could be thrust into a cavity. 

From these features of the place on Mr. Pollard's land, carefully 
examined by all our party, we attribute the pits to quarrying by the 
American Indians. How long ago this was done, or during how long a 
period it was more or less in progress, we cannot estimate. It is noteworthy, 
however, that an oak tree two feet in diameter is now growing 
in this pit where the trench was dug by Mr. Pollard. 

I'mler his guidance, we also went about four miles north from N'ehawka 
to another large hill, rising, like the foregoing, somewhat above the 
average height of this moderately rolling and hilly region. This northern 
hill has upon a large undulating tract of some ten acres, more or less, 
forming its top, many pits similar to those before described, but mostly 
shorter and irregularly grouped, numbering thirty or more. The hill is 
mostly without trees, and consists partly of cultivated fields; but its 
top, where the pits are, is overgrown by rank weedy vegetation and 
bushes. These pits seem to us to be surely of artificial origin; but the 
lack of any trench, to show the section beneath the surface, forbids a more 
definite statement than to say that they were probably made for the same 
Ee as the others. Such pits are also reported by Mr. Blackman and 
¦ower as observed in several other places within the distance of a 
lies around Nehawka. 

In the southwest corner of Minnesota the red pipestone quarry, as is 
well known, has been occasionally worked by the Indians during many 
centuries before the coming of white men. 

The aborigines also had done much laborious copper mining on Isle 
Royale and in other localities about Lake Superior. Similarly, it is evident 
to us that a great amount of rudely systematic and roughly planned 
work had been done near Nehawka, Neb., by the aborigines to obtain the 
chert nodules of great value to them for making stone implements.

ADDENDUM. 

BJ01. at the request of Prof. E. E. Blackman, I fully identified the 
ka, Neb., quarry pita as artificial excavations by North American 
9 during an ancient period of time when fire-arms were unknown 
a. Hence it is important that any archeological survey of Nebraska 
include the Nehawka pits and earthworks as a basis upon which 
to determine a considerable portion of the literature which is to perpetuate 
the earliest history of that state. A very serious error would 
certainly occur should the archeologic history of Nebraska be proceeded 
with on a series of explorations which might distort the important fact 
that all of the Nehawka quarry pits were excavated by ancient man for 
supplies of chert.

The natural tendency of migration since history began is westward; 
The Amerind is not an exception to this general rule. As the streams 
which drain North America have a general trend from north to south, 
and as the rule for human activity is a procedure along the lines of least 
resistance, one might naturally suppose that the Amerind would follow 
up these streams and change the general order of things by moving forward 
from south to north or from north to south. There was a stronger 
influence than contour of the surface which drew the tide of emigration, 
although this had its effect to such an extent that the route of travel had 
a west by northwest trend. The food supply became the main factor in 
determining the direction of migration. 

The great herds of buffalo which roamed the central part of North 
America from the Appalachian mountains to the Pacific ocean formed 
the incentive which enticed the redman to roam over the plains. The 
buffalo was not only his food supply, but the source of supply for his 
every wan food from his flesh, raiment and shelter from his hides, 
implement : am his bones, vessels for holding liquids from his intestines, 
and fuel from his dung. The buffalo made it possible for great numbers 
to subsist in comparative ease on the treeless plains of Nebraska. How 
much of the food supply of the aborigines, before the advent of the 
buffalo, may have been derived from agricultural pursuits is unknown; 
but it is certain that as the tribes spread westward and the buffalo 
became more numerous the practice of agriculture became less until 
when white settlers first came in contact with the tribes of Nebraska 
little agriculture prevailed. 

By far the greater number of Indian tribes, which have from time to 
time wandered over the state of Nebraska, followed this general rule of 
migration from east to west. These tribes belonged to two linguistic 
families, the Algonquin and Siouan. Both of these great families sprang 
from east of the Appalachian mountains and in turn occupied nearly the 
whole of the Mississippi valley. 

The first people to occupy our state did not follow this rule. The 
Caddoan linguistic family had their home in the south near the banks 
of the Red river, and migrated northward, occupying the valleys of the 
Kansas river, and reaching northward to the valley of the Platte river 
and westward to the foothills of the mountains. 

Two other linguistic families encroach on our territory from the wast; 
the Shoshonian and Kiowan. While few if any of their permanent homes 
are to be found in runs within the present borders of our state, they 
claimed a part of our territory and hunted along the head waters of the 
Republican and Platte. 

Ese five linguistic families, only, were found in our state, and of 
but two, the Caddoan and Siouan, are of importance to our history, 
i of these two families had their permanent habitat within our 
-s and fought with one another and among themselves for supremi 
our eastern border, and along the Platte valley.

NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRK'l'LTI'RE. 

THE CADDOAN LINGUISTIC FAMILY. 

I original home of this family was on the Red river of the south, 
to the year 1400 one band, known as the Skidi, branched off from 
lin stock and drifted to the Platte valley. The exact line of migra; 
difficult to determine, but a tradition says this tribe lived as allies 
Omaha near the mouth of the Ohio river. It is not impossible that 
nay have followed up the Missouri river in coming to the Platte 
where they were located in 1400 according to Dunbar. 

Prior to 1500 another band branched oft from the main stock and 
drifted northward to a point near the present Kansas-Nebraska line. 
Here the Wichita turned back and went south while the Pawnee moved 
northward and occupied the Platte valley and intervening country. In 
1541 Coronado found the Wichita near the Kansas river and sent a summons 
to the "Lord of Harahey" (the Pawnee) to visit him, which he did 
with 200 naked warriors. This is the first authentic date, handed down 
to us in written history, substantiating Indian occupancy of our state. This 
is the first time civilized man (if we call Coronado's followers civilized) 
ever saw an Indian from what is now Nebraska. All history before this 
is legendary, and all legendary history is so conflicting that one can only 
say it is possibly true, — we dare not even say probably true, — but it is the 
best we have. 

How far Onate penetrated in his trip north eastward from New Mexico 
in 1599 is difficult to determine. He says he visited the city of Quivera. 
which was on the north bank of a wide and shallow river (very like the 
Platte). He says he fought with the "Escansaques" and killed "a thousand." 
This battle may have been in this state. Penalosa also claims to 
have visited the same locality in 1662, and to have met the same Escansaques. 
beating them in a like encounter. (See J. W. Savage in Nebraska 
Hist Reports, vol. II, p. 114.). 

Ehen these brief glimpses into authentic Spanish history are subtiated 
by proof we may be able to add some early data bearing on our 
in occupancy. 

The Pawnee (proper), consisting of three main tribes, the Choui (or 
Grand), the Pit-a-how-e-rat (or Tapage) the Kitkehaki (or Republican), 
emigrated to the Platte valley prior to 1500. They held the country fifty 
miles west of the Missouri river, and eventualy conquered the Skidi band, 
which came here a hundred years before, and adopted them into the 
Pawnee tribe. Before the Pawnee came, however, a band had drifted 
away from the Skidi band and established themselves on the Missouri 
river, out of the bounds of our state; I refer to the Arikaree band. The 
Arikaree came into Nebraska and lived with the Skidi tribe for three 
years, from 1832 to 1835, when they returned home. 

Ete visited the Republican Pawnee in 1806; they dwelt near the south 
of the state until about 1812 when they joined the rest of the band 
i of the Platte river. 

Dunbar gives the location of the various tribes in 1834. The Choui </seg>

band resided on the south bank of the Platte, twenty miles above the 
mouth of the Loup; the Kitkehaki lived eighteen miles northwest, on the 
north side of the Loup; the Pitahowarat eleven miles farther up the 
Loup. and the Skidi five miles above these. Dunbar says they changed 
their villages every eight or ten years. 

E3 the Pawnee ceded the territory south of the Platte to the gov. 
In 1857 they ceded the territory north of the Platte except their 
on in Nance county. The territory ceded, according to Chas. C. 
q Eighteenth Report of Bureau of Ethnology, embraced the 
hird of the entire state. The reservation above mentioned was 
1875, and the Pawnee were taken to Oklahoma, where they have 
ation now. 

THE 8IOUAN LINGUISTIC FAMILY. 

The various branches of this linguistic stock have come to this state 
in at least five relays. The first was the Mandans, shrouded in antiquity. 
Catlin claims to have traced their earthworks and habitat down the Ohio 
river and up the Missouri. McGee says the Siouan family began to 
eras the Appalachian mountains one thousand years ago. The Handans 
were one of the first bands to break off from the parent stock, and 
the only excuse we have for counting them in our history is the probability 
that they crossed our borders in their way up the Missouri river, 
sometime prior to the coming of the Skidi band in 1400. 

The above is legendary and not a proven fact. 

The Omaha: McGee says this tribe was near the mouth of the Ohio 
river in 1500, so the coming to this state must be some time after that 
date. They are traced quite accurately up the Missouri and Dea Moines 
rivers to their present home in the northeast part of our state.. The 
Osages branched off and remained at the Osage river. The Kansas came 
on the Kansas river and there built their permanent habitat. (The date 
of the arrival of the Kansas tribe is sufficiently early to allow the 
"Escansaques" of Onate to be the Kansas Indians.) 

K Omaha and Ponka remained together until about 1650, when the 
moved northward and occupied the country from the mouth of 
ibrara west to the Black Hills. 

The Omaha ceded the northeast third of this state to the government 
In 1854, retaining only their present reservation. (That tongue of land 
which was added to Nebraska in 1890, and which lies between the 
Niobrara, Keyapaha and Missouri rivers, was ceded to the government 
by the Ponca in 1858, except a small reservation.) In 1877 they w«re 
moved to Oklahoma. 

The third relay of the Siouan family to occupy our state consisted of 
three tribes, the Otoe, Missouri and the Iowa. The Otoe and Iowa have 
always been closely related. They were first seen at the mouth of the Das 
Moines river by Marquette in 1673. They are said, by tradition, to have 
sprung from the Winnebago stock. In 1699 it is stated that they wast 
to live near the Omaha. 

11 </seg>

            <seg id="p322">
322 


The Missouri have had a very checkered career. They were first seen in 
1670 at the mouth of the Missouri river. Soon after 1700 they were overcome 
by the Sac and Fox and other tribes. Most of them joined the Otoe 
tribe, but a few went with the Osage and some joined the Kansas. They 
have never ceded land to the government except in company with the Otoe, 
and they have been a party to every Otoe transaction. To all intents and 
purposes the Otoe and Missouri have been as one tribe during their occupancy 
of this state. 

The Otoe and Missouri ceded the southeast portion of the state to the 
government in 1853; this embraced the land south and west of the 
Nemaha. The remaining portion of land which they claimed lay between 
the Nemaha, Missouri and Platte rivers, reaching as far west as Seward 
county. This last tract was ceded in 1854 when they returned to their 
reservation south of Beatrice. This they relinquished in 1881, and now 
live in Oklahoma. Most of the Iowa remained east of our border until 
1836, when they were given a tract of land along the south bank of the 
Nemaha. This they retained in part until 1885 when they relinquished 
it and moved to Oklahoma. This tribe was always closely associated with 
the Otoe, but never under the same tribal organization as was the Missouri. 
All three tribes belonged to the same branch of the Siouan family 
as the Winnebago. 

B gives the United States title to the east two-thirds of the state, 
•liest treaty by which the government acquired title to land in 
te was made with the Kansas in 1825; by this treaty the Kansas 
semicircular tract along the south line reaching from Falls City 
Willow county and nearly as far north as Lincoln. So it seems 
&gt; Kansas at least claimed part of our territory. 

The next relay of the great Siouan family to invade our borders was 
a branch of the northern arm of this tribe which dwelt along the great 
lakes. From this arm the Assinaboines branched off as early as 1650. 
McGee says they were near the Lake of the Woods in 1766, so this relay 
had not long wandered over our soil when written history began. 

The Pawnee and Omaha joined in repelling the advance of these 
northern tribes and held them well back from the waterways for years, 
but they hunted on the head waters of the Platte and Republican and 
even as far south as the head waters of the Smoky Hill and Solomon. 

The Crow were doubtless the first of these tribes to encroach on the 
Platte valley; this tribe drifted to the Black Hills in an early day and 
hunted on the Platte from the northwest. The Blackfeet, a branch of 
the Saskatchewan tribe, encroaches later. The Yankton, Santee, Brule. 
Sisseton, Oglala. Teton, Minetaree and other bands and parts of tribes 
from time to time hunted or fought on the head waters of the Platte. 
They Joined in ceding the northwest part of the state to the government 
in 1868, reserving only a hunting right in common without tribes; this 
they relinquished in 1875. and are now on the various reservations in 
Dakota and Oklahoma.

The last relay of the great Siouan family was the Wlnnebago; they 
were moved from Minnesota and settled on a part of the Omaha reservation 
in 1862. They still reside within our borders. Schoolcraft says 
this tribe once lived on a branch of the Crow Wing river in Minnesota. 

A part of the Santee Sioux were moved to Nebraska at the same time 
but many of both tribes came across the country before. 

ALGONQUIN FAMILT. 

To this family belong the Cheyenne and Arapahoe and Atsina. who 
wandered over the western part of our state, as well as the Sac and Fox 
tribe, which had a reservation in the extreme southeastern part of the 
state from 1836 to 1885. 

The Algonquin family once occupied the greater part of the Mississippi 
valley. In a very early date the Cheyenne drifted westward through the 
Dakotas, where they left their name for one of the important streams. 
Later the Cheyennes wandered southward. Lewis and Clark in 1804 mentioned 
this tribe as occupying a position on the Cheyenne river, while 
Long in his expedition of 1819 found a small band which had seceded 
from the main stock on the Cheyenne river, and wandered with the 
Arapahoe on the Platte river. 

There is a record, by Fremont, of this tribe being on the Platte above 
Grand Island in 1843. They ceded the southwestern portion of this state 
to the government in 1861. 

The Arapahoe, like the Cheyenne, occupied our state as a roaming tribe. 
The impression left by the very limited number of writers who have 
spoken of this tribe seems to be that they came from the north. They 
were pressed by the Sioux from the east and the Shoshonean family from 
the west. The date of their coming to our state is obscure. The time 
of their separation from the eastern parent stock is shrouded in antiquity, 
and as early travelers found them a wild race and not easy to 
study little of their early history is recorded. They joined the Cheyenne 
and Arkansas Indians in ceding to the United States government the 
extreme southwest portion of our state. So far as I can learn the Arkansas 
Indians never occupied any part of this state at any time. 

The Atsina were closely allied with the Blackfeet (Suwan) and since 
whites have known them, wandered with that tribe. They are distinctly 
tquin, however, and have a legend telling how they came to separom 
the Arapahoes. 

8ac and Fox Tribes. 

As stated above, the Alonquin stock occupied most of the Mississippi 
valley at one time. The government purchased all of Missouri north of 
the river north, of Iowa, some of Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota from 
this tribe. They seem to be the original owners of the Mississippi and 
Missouri front, and the Siouan tribes as they drifted westward doubtless 
had the Sac and Fox Indians to deal with. This may account for the Otoe 
and Kansas tribes moving across the river west. However, in time this </seg>

powerful tribe lost all their possessions and were removed to a small 
reservation, south of Nemaha, a part of which was in this state. We had 
this tribe not in their palmy, prosperous days but after long contact with 
the whites. They were removed to Oklahoma in 1885. 

SHO8H0NEAN FAMILY. 

Powell, in the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. 
oes not class this linguistic family as occupying a part of our state, and 
t is doubtful if any part of this family had any more than a transient 
ome within our borders. It is certain that the Comanche wandered over 
ur territory during historic days and doubtless the "Padoucas" once 
ad a more or less permanent home here, at least the north fork of the 
'latte was known in the early days as the Padouca fork. This would 
ead one to believe that the Padouca Indians once lived there. Mooney 
says: "In 1719 the Comanche were mentioned under their Siouan name 
f Padouca as living in what is now western Kansas. It must be remem&gt;ered 
that 500 to 800 miles was an ordinary range for a plains tribe, and 
he Comanche were equally at home on the Platte or in Chihuahua 
Mexico). The great Shoshonean family occupied the mountain country 
rom the south line of Oregon to the north line of Arizona and extended 
rom the Pacific coast on the southwest corner of California nearly to the 
west line of what is now Nebraska. They were a powerful and numerous 
ribe. Later the Siouan bands drove the Comanche south and the other 
(ranches of the Shoshonean family west and north. 

Lewis and Clark, in 1805 mention the Padouca as extinct, all except the 
name. Bourgmont visited the Padouca on the head waters of the Kansas 
in 1724. The Comanche and Kansas were closely associated for 150 
years, says Mooney. 

There is no record of the Comanche ever having deeded any part of 
is state to the government. 

KIOWA. 

About 1700 this tribe migrated from the far northwest and took up a 
residence in the vicinity of the Black Hills. From thence they were 
driven by the Siouan tribes, and Lewis and Clark mention this tribe 
as residing on the North fork of the Platte in 1805, and numbering 
seventy teepees. They slowly drifted southward until they occupied the 
country south of the Arkansas river. As this tribe never lived far from 
the mountains their occupancy of our state was but transient. Powell 
shows this linguistic family as occupying the far southwest part of our 
state, but there is no record of this family ever ceding any part of our 
state to the government. 

ADDENDA. 

There was a "half-breed" tract situated between the Nemaha and Missouri 
rivers set apart in 1830, intended for the home of civilized Indians,

The Pine Ridge and Rosebud agencies are located just north of the 
north line of our state in South Dakota and a narrow strip in our state 
adjoining has Indian title not yet extinguished. There are titles in the 
old Sac and Fox and Iowa reservation in Richardson county, still Tested 
in Indians, and a few live there. 

The Santee agency, near Niobrara. still maintains an agent who reports 
to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for this tribe and also for 
the Ponca subagency, Santee, twenty miles west between the Niobrara 
and Missouri rivers. These reservations, together with the Omaha and 
Winnebago agency in Thurston county, are the only reservations near oar 
borders at the present time. 

According to the census of 1900, there were 3,322 Indians in our state 
against 6,431 in 1890. Three Indian schools are maintained by the government 
in this state, on the Santee, Winnebago and Omaha reservations 
respectively; while a boarding school for Indians is situated at Genoa, In 
Nance county. 

All land in the various reservations is now (1903) allotted in several ty 
to individuals of the tribes, and all Indians in this state are taxed and 
are citizens of the state the same as the whites. 

DESCRIPTION OF PLATES. 

Plate I. — This plate represents some of the finest specimens in the show 
cases. It is shown, that students of archeology may realize that Nebraska 
takes no second place in the production of finely chipped flints. 
Number 1 was was found twelve miles south of Lincoln by J. B. Halle 
some years ago. It is now the property of Amos H. Haile of Clearwater. 
Antelope county, Nebraska, who is quite interested in the study of Nebraska 
flints. This beautiful specimen came from the "Roca Site," and 
is only one of the numerous fine specimens found there. The Omaha 
Indians have a legend telling of their home at this point about 1775: however 
the study of flint forms has not gone far enough to certainly identify 
this flint as Omaha. Number 2 is a peculiar implement of blue chert. It 
is flat on one side and oval on the other; one end is finished and the 
other seems to be the side of a nodule. The implement is peculiar but 
not uncommon. Number 3 is of brown jasper, and found on the Wright 
Site. A number of these four-edged knives have been found in this state. 
Number 4 is a scraper used by the squaws in dressing skins. This bit of 
flint was attached to a piece of elk horn forming an implement very 
similar to a miniature hoe, with which to take the flesh from the drying 
hides. Number 8 Is a bird point. It was firmly attached to a shaft and 
used over and over until lost or broken, for the purpose of killing birds 
and small game; even buffalo were killed with points no larger than this. 
K others on this plate are "war points." They were attached to a shaft 
tly and when the shaft was withdrawn from a wound the flint re- </seg>

mained to kill the victim. All the war points on this plate came from the 
Platte Valley; some from Genoa, others from Schuyler or from the Elkhorn 
Valley near Oakdale. Mr. Hopkins has a great many of these small 
points in his finely mounted collection at the rooms of the society. 

B-ate II. — Numbers 18, 19, and 20 show the coarsely chipped flints from 
Nehawka. Number 21 is a drill found near Fullerton, Nebraska, by 
essor Nickerson. It is made of brown jasper and is a very unique 
Imen. 

Plate III. — All these coarsely chipped flints are from the vicinity of 
the Nehawka flint quarries on the Weeping Water. 

Plate IV. — Here is shown first a whole pottery vessel found near Fullerton, 
about thirty rods from the Union Pacific railroad bridge. It is 
the property of Prof. R. DeWitt Stearns, principal of schools at Kimball. 
Nebraska. The vessel holds about one-half gallon and was evldenty used 
in cooking. There has been, so far as known, but one other whole vessel 
found in the state. It is very small and was doubtless a paint pot or 
drinking cup, found near Ft. Calhoun by Mr. Saltzman. 

B flint at the bottom of Plate IV is a "Quivera tomahawk" found on 
m of Mr. Crawford near Blue Springs. Five very similar specimens 
een found in this state.

rOT IN RYE, GRASS, HAY, AND GRAIN AND ITS 
EFFECT ON CATTLE. 

(Address of Prof. John L. Sheldon, of the University of Nebraska, before 
the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders' Association.) 

Perhaps all of you know that investgations have been carried on at the 
Nebraska Experiment Station for some time along the lines of diseases 
caused by cattle eating poisonous weeds, dried cornstalks, green sorghum 
and mouldy corn. It became my privilege as a botanist to oooperate 
with Dr. Peters, and to isolate and make cultures of the mouldy 
corn fungus. A report of this work has been submitted to him and will 
appear as one part of a bulletin which will probably be Issued soon. 

There is another fungus which grows upon a number of wild and 
cultivated grasses and grains throughout the greater portion of the state. 
It is about this fungus, which is popularly known as ergot or ergota, that 
I have been asked to address you. 

During the past year it has been very abundant in some parts of the 
state on wild rye and wheat grass and occasionally on rye and wheat. 
Wherever I have seen these grasses I have almost invariably found ergot. 
Reports from various parts of the state confirm my own observations. 
Ergot is not confined to the grasses which I have mentioned. It occurs 
on blue grass in some parts of the country, but I have not seen it in this 
state, yet it may be on blue grass here. The abundance of not only this 
fungus the past year, but also several others that attack wild and cultivated 
plants may be attributed to the damp weather during the summer 
and autumn. 

The "ergot" may be recognized as the dark, purplish bodies which grow 
out of the grasses and grains where the seeds or kernels ought to be. 
At first sight these dark colored and curved bodies suggest to one that 
the seeds or kernels have grown to such an enormous size that they have 
protruded outside the chaff from one-fourth of an inch to an inch and a 
half. They not only resemble kernels of grain in shape but they are also 
hard and white inside, although nearly black outside. 

Unless the grasses and grains are eaten by cattle when they are green 
or harvested, the ergots when mature fall to the ground and remain dormant 
until about the time the grasses and grains begin to blossom the 
following spring. The small rounded bodies on slender stalks grow up 
out of the ergots. These little bodies are the fruits of the fungus and 
contain small pockets filled with spores. The spores serve the mum* 
purpose for the fungus that seeds do for other plants, that of reproducing 

In some way the spores are carried to the blossoms of the grasses and 
grains, just how, I cannot say from personal observations, but possibly 
the fungus has a way of throwing its spores out into the air when they </seg>

            <seg id="p328">
328

are mature or insects may carry them. At any rate, the spores get there 
somehow and if the blossoms are damp from rain or dew, the spores germinate 
and at once their thread-like filaments make their way into that 
part of the flower which ought to become a seed. The fungus is a true 
parasite on the grass plant or rye, as much as a louse on a calf or pig. 
Instead of earning its own living, it has found it easier to appropriate the 
food which should be stored up in the seed. It not only steals its living 
from the plant which it attacks, but during the earlier part of its development, 
the rather small and inconspicuous "ergot" secretes a sweet and 
milky juice in which float large numbers of another kind of spore. 

•Insects are attracted by this sweet juice, and the spores becoming attached 
to their bodies and are carried about as the insects go from plant 
to plant. The spores of the fungus may also be distributed by the swaying 
to and fro of the grasses and grains by the wind. Later on the ergots 
appear as a hard mass of closely interwoven filaments, at about the time 
that the seeds begin to mature. Such, then, is the life history of the 
fungus in brief. 

It is not so much the life history of the fungus that the stockmen and 
farmers are interested in as it is what the fungus may do to themselves 
and their stock. 

Since the fungus may grow anywhere where there are grasses and 
grains In the pasture, In the mowing and in the grain field, the cattle are 
liable to get it either while grazing or in the stable. With the modern 
methods of cleaning small grain, most of the "ergots," on account of their 
size unless broken by the thresher, would be removed from the grain. 

The effect of ergot on cattle belongs to the domain of animal pathology, 
to the veterinarian, and not to the botanist. Dr. Peters has kindly loaned 
me some literature on this part of the subject assigned me and I shall 
now attempt to summarize it briefly in order that it may be more fully 
discussed by you. 

It is well understood by the medical profession and accepted by people 
in general that ergot contains certain properties which are poisonous to 
both man and beast. As to just what these properties are and their 
chemical composition, we are not particularly interested here. Ergot in 
sufficient quantities acts as a poison when introduced into the system, yet, 
it is a very valuable medicine in the hands of a skilled physician or veterinarian. 
According to Friedberger and Frohner. "The poisonings which 
it produces, especially chronic poisonings, are rarer in domestic animals 
than in the human race. They have, nevertheless, been observed in the 
pig, the horse, the ox, the sheep and in poultry." 

Erd spring in those parts of the state where cattle are fed on bay 
1 with ergot, the poison may begin to manifest itself. It seems to 
the circulation to such an extent that the blood collects in those 
r the body farthest from the heart — in the ears, in the feet and 
tail. The affected animals become lame and swellings appear 
ielr ankles. Later on sores may occur around the top of the hoofs, </seg>

            <seg id="p329">
329 

r&lt;t\* j* *i i x o Eiri^Gf- x * *jn i a i l IjE* 

on the teats, the ears and the mouth. In extreme cases there may be a loss 
of the entire hoof or sloughing away of the leg just above the hoof at 
the fetlock, leaving the bony stump protruding. The slough is for the 
most part a dark red or nearly black. Parts of the tail and ears may also 
drop off. Usually there is not a loss of much blood nor the formation of 
pus to any extent, only a dry, gangrenous sore. This form of the disease 
is what is called "gangrenous ergotism." It is similar in appearance to 
the "foot and mouth disease" when present in those organs; however, it 
may be distinguished from the "foot and mouth disease" by the sloughing 
away of the flesh instead of the sores appearing as vesicles. Unlike 
anthrax, which it also resembles, it is not contagious. 

¦le the diseased animals sometimes appear mopy and inactive, this 
always the case. The action of the poison on the brain may be such 
iroduce delirium and spasms. 

It is thought that abortion in cattle may at times be traced directly to 
the feeding of hay or grain that contains ergot. Law says in his work on 
Veterinary Medicine, "There is. however, a great difference of opinion as 
to the action of ergot. Various experiments with large doses of ergot on 
pregnant animals have failed to produce any sign of abortion. The agent, 
however, varies in its nature according to the condition under which It 
grew and the stage at which it was collected, so that the failure to produce 
the expected results in a given case can by no means be accepted aa 
disproving its pathological properties under other conditions." </seg>

With the advent of the press drill and the introduction of hardier, more 
drought-resisting varieties of winter wheat, Nebraska has demonstrated 
within the last few years that its productive capacity is not limited to 
corn alone. In the year 1889, our crop of wheat was 10,571,059 bushels. 
Ten years later (1899), we produced 20,791,776 — double the crop ten years 
preceding. In 1900 our crop was 24,801,600 bushels; in 1901, 42,006.885, 
doubling this time in two years. During the past year, we produced 53,-463,472 
bushels, an average yield of 22 bushels per acre, the highest 
average of any state in the union. The increase in our wheat production 
during the past three years has been little else than marvelous. Three 
years ago Nebraska ranked tenth as a wheat producing state. Today she 
stands fourth. 

Now that this cereal crop has attained such prominence in our state, 
the question of its value for stock feeding arises. Ordinarily the demand 
for wheat flour for human consumption is great enough to make this grain 
too high-priced for stock feeding. Occasionally, however, there are years 
when the supply is such as to force prices down to a level with corn. 
Again, there are seasons of excessive moisture, like the one just passed, 
when considerable wheat is so damaged as to make it unfit for human 
consumption. Under such circumstances the farmer can well consider 
its feeding value. 

Recognizing the need of further experimentation along the line of 
wheat feeding, the Nebraska Experiment Station has been conducting 
tests during the past year for the purpose of determining the 
value of wheat as compared with corn for both cattle and swine. 

For fattening steers the wheat ration in this trial proved five per cent 
more efficient that the corn. In other words, 100 pounds of the wheat 
ration produced as much beef as 105 pounds of the corn ration. These 
results would have been less surprising had we fed timothy, prairie hay 
or corn stover for roughness. In that case the corn ration would have 
been too starchy, and the wheat ration, on account of its greater protein 
content, would have furnished a more properly balanced ration. In this 
experiment, the roughness consisted almost entirely of alfalfa hay, about 
eight pounds to each steer per day. It was found advisable to add some 
prairie hay to counteract a tendency to scours, probably caused by the 
alfalfa. 

The grain ration was about double the hay ration. During the first half 
of the experiment, 15 per cent bran was added to both the corn and 
wheat fed. This overcomes to a certain extent the objectionable feature 
of wheat, namely, its tendency to be sticky and to adhere to the mouths of </seg>

the cattle. It also lightens up the corn, thereby improving its character 
for heavy feeding. 

A little oil meal was added during the last half, to give a little more 
finish for the market. 

When marketed, the wheat steers were just as good as the cornfed, but 
no better. All topped the Omaha market by a considerable margin. 

The Ohio test made in '94 shows wheat to be 3 per cent better than 
corn for steers. The '95 experiment, however, places corn nearly 20 per 
cent ahead of wheat. In the '95 test the corn steers were fed in a shed 
and the wheat steers were fed in a barn. Since that time it has been 
demonstrated, by several years of careful work on the part of Director 
Waters of the Missouri Station, that an open shed is conducive to much 
larger gains than a closed barn. This probably accounts for the difference 
that year in favor of corn. 

We are safe in concluding that wheat is fully equal to corn for fattening 
cattle. 

For pigs we found that ground wheat produced 9 per cent larger gala* 
than the same weight of ground corn, each being fed as a single food. 

EL893 the South Dakota Station made 100 pounds of pork from 458 
s of corn, whereas 481 pounds of wheat was required to produce the 
gain. This was a difference of 5 per cent in favor of corn. 

Ohio found that it required 438 pounds of wheat or 453 pounds of corn 
for 100 pounds of gain. This shows wheat 3.2 per cent superior to corn. 

Utah in '93 made this gain on 402 pounds of wheat and bran, while It 
required 462 pounds of corn and bran. In this trial the wheat produced 
15 per cent larger gains. 

Wisconsin in one test made 4.6 per cent larger gains on corn, and In 
another 6.7 per cent larger on wheat. 

Kansas found wheat 6.8 per cent superior to corn. 

Making an average of all these trials, wheat is found to be 4 per cent 
more efficient than corn. With corn, then, at 60 cents per bushel, we can 
afford to feed wheat when it is worth not more than 68 cents. However, 
when corn is 30 cents, as at present, wheat must be as low as 34 cents 
to feed. If wheat is fed, it should not be fed dry and whole, since the 
kernels are so small and hard that many escape mastication and digestion. 
In the Nebraska test, ground wheat produced M per cent larger gains 
than the whole dry wheat. Wheat soaked one day produced almost as good 
gains as ground wheat, at much less expense, and is therefore the most 
economical way of feeding this grain. 

These experiments show wheat slightly superior to corn as a single 
food for swine, not because it is a better stock food, but simply because 
it is less deficient in protein and mineral matter and therefore is a better 
balanced food stuff.

relished by farm animals and no food will give more satisfactory results 
when properly fed. As a single food It is deficient in protein and mineral 
matter, and should therefore be reinforced by something rich in these 
materials. 

As previously stated, wheat is ordinarily too expensive to feed. The 
by-products of wheat, however, bran and shorts — are available at reasonable 
prices. They are not only low-priced, but furnish to the animal Just 
what corn lacks. 

It is impossible to mill wheat without more or less of the starchy 
material going into the bran. 

Be the three coatings of the kernel constitute but 5 per cent, the 
layer 3 and 4 per cent, and the germ 6 per cent of the entire kernel, 
i to 40 per cent of the kernel is removed in milling as by-products, 
ire considerable of the starchy material goes in with the bys 
but not enough to make either shorts or bran perfect single foods. 

For fattening animals, shorts is too rich in protein, while corn is too 
deficient to give the best returns. The two together, however, make a 
strong combination. 

gi results of a single experiment conducted by Prof. Henry of Wisconveral 
years ago will substiantiate this statement. In feeding three 
if pigs, one on corn meal, another on middlings, and a third on 
parts of each, one hundred pounds of gain was produced from 
ounds of corn by the hogs of lot 1, 522 pounds of middlings by lot 
i but 439 pounds of the mixture of both corn and middlings. A 
weight of the mixture therefore produced nearly 20 per cent more 
than the same weight of either alone. 

In a pig feeding trial now in progress at our Station, we are feeding 
com with three different protein foods, namely, wheat shorts, alfalfa hay, 
and skim milk.. One lot was fed on corn alone for comparison. There 
are five pigs, mostly Poland Chinas, in each lot. 

tier six weeks of feeding, I find lot 1, on corn alone, has gained 193 
ids; lot 2, corn and skim-milk, 2 pounds of milk to 1 of corn, has 
ed 399 pounds; lot 3, on corn, 80 per cent, and shorts, 20 per cent, 
gained 243 pounds; and lot 4, corn 80 per cent, alfalfa, 20 per cent, 

The addition of 20 per cent shorts has increased the gain over corn alone 
40 pounds in six weeks. With corn at 30 cents per bushel, shorts at $12 
per ton, alfalfa hay at $7, and skim-milk 15 cents per hundred, I find 
each hundred pounds of gain costs — on corn alone $3.80; corn and milk, 
$3.45; corn and shorts, $3.17; corn and alfalfa, $3. 

With the so-called protein food stuffs selling as follows: oats 30 cents 
per bushel, wheat middlings $12 per ton, bran $12 per ton, and new process 
oil meal $26, dried blood $40 per ton, alfalfa hay $7 and skim-milk IS

FBBDING VALUE OF WHEAT AND ITS BY-PRODUCTS. 

Pthe nutrients in a roughness like alfalfa are in a form less 
le to the animal, requiring more energy in mastication and digesd 
therefore somewhat less valuable. For cattle and sheep, alfalfa is 
y the cheapest source of protein in Nebraska. This may also be 
ith fattening swine when fed In very limited quantities. 

Dried blood and meat scrap are both on the market as protein-rich 
foods. Iowa and Indiana both secured much larger gains when dried 
blood was added to a corn ration. In a trial at our Station Just recently 
closed, we found dried blood produced no better gains when added to a 
mixed ration consisting of wheat 40 per cent, shorts 40 per cent and corn 
20 per cent, and alfalfa pasture. In this case the protein was already 
furnished by the shorts and alfalfa. 

In last summer's experiment, published in Bulletin 75, we found 5 par 
cent dried blood did produce somewhat better gains when the ration 
consisted of corn and alfalfa pasture without the shorts. 

Ean contains too much indigestible fiber to be suitable for fattening 
e. For breeding swine a little does fairly well. But the food is par 
Hence for sheep and cattle, not only because it supplies protein and 
mineral matter, but also because when mixed with corn meal it so lightens 
the heavy grain ration as to make it more readily acted upon by the 
digestive Juices and more easily moved forward through the stomach 
and intestines. It acts as a mild laxative and thus keeps a heavy grain 
fed animal in a thrifty condition. 

Bry boy on the farm knows the value of a hot bran mash for the sick 
r horse. If these by-products of wheat were mixed with corn in fair 
rtion, it would hardly seem necessary to purchase condimental stock 
at high prices. 

The increased wheat production of Nebraska will lessen to some extent 
our corn output. More grain will be shipped out of the state, thus 
depriving our soil of some of its natural fertility, but if we mill the 
wheat within our borders we shall not only be able to make our corn so 
further in the production of beef, pork, mutton and milk, but will also 
keep the rich fertilizing material found in these by-products upon our 
own soil and make it continue to be the wonderfully fertile soil that it is. </seg>

r! IMMUNIZATION OF NORTHERN CATTLE: ITS 
ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE TO THE SOUTHERN 
STOCKMAN AND TO THE NORTHERN BREEDER. 

(Address of W. H. Dalrymple, Baton Rouge, La., before the Nebraska 
Improved Stock Breeders' Association.) 

It is extremely gratifying to me to be with you in this progressive 
section of the country to participate in the deliberations of your Improved 
Stock Breeders' Association. 

tTo one who has been born and brought up in a part of the world where 
e raising of improved livestock is considered of prime importance to 
i general well-being, and then to have been transported to another region 
here improved animal husbandry has, until very recently, been almost 
as much neglected, a feeling of warmth, even in this rigid season of the 
Er, begins to glow all over one, when he is surrounded by such a concert 
livestock enthusiasm as is so very much in evidence here on this 
ision: and I know that when I return to the home of my adoption in 
"Sunny South," I will feel that "It was good for me to have been here." 

The subject which is to occupy our attention for a short while, viz.: 
The Immunization of Northern Cattle, and Its Economic Importance to 
the Southern Stockman and to the Northern Breeder, is one the intrinsic 
value of which is almost beyond computation to the livestock interests 
of both north and south. In fact, we in the south consider, so far as 
our cattle interests are concerned, and we might also say, those of the 
northern breeder who aims at creating a market in the south, that perhaps 
the most valuable discovery ever made, is, that when a few drops 
of blood are drawn from one of our native tick-infested animals, and 
injected underneath the skin of a susceptible one, it will produce in the 
latter a mild attack of Texas fever, from which, in the great majority of 
cases, the animal so treated will recover, and afterwards be able to withstand 
subsequent attacks of the disease, brought about by transmission 
of the specific organism through the medium of the common cattle-tick, 
or, in other words, become immune. 

I do not know just how it is up here in Nebraska, but down our way, 
there are still to be found a few people, the exact number, I have never 
attempted to estimate, who have a sort of ingrained aversion for anything 
to which the term "scientific" is applied, but who, at the same time, seem 
absolutely oblivious to the fact, that scientific investigation, about which 
they appear to possess such crude notions, and at which they are inclined 
to sneer, as if there was some sleight-off-hand jugglery connected with it, 
is nothing more nor less than persistent, painstaking searching after the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. In this very work of 
immunization, we have an excellent illustration: Texas fever, the hitherto </seg>

IMMUNIZATION OF NORTHERN CATTLE. 

Pd bane and bugbear of every southern stockman, below the fever 
.hose desire It was to purchase, in northern latitudes, pure brad 
for the purpose of upbuilding and improving his degenerated herds, 
of beef or dairy animals, has almost as many names as there are 
breeds of cattle, and just as many theories as to its cause and methods 
of treatment. And it is probable that such a chaotic state of affairs would 
still have existed, had it not been for the indefatigible. dogged, and persistent 
efforts of the scientist in his search after the truth, which has 
Ed in the acuracy of the knowledge now possesed relative to the true 
and nature of the disease, and the more intelligent and effective 
res by which to combat its ravages. 

As has been previously hinted, the actual, or exciting, cause of Texas 
fever is a germ — a malarial type of germ — belonging to the protozoa, the 
lowest form of animal life. Technically, this organism is known as 
"piroplasma bigeminum," and it can be found within the red blood cells 
of any of our native southern cattle that have been exposed to tick infestation. 


It may be of interest to state at this point, that we have Southern 
natives, however, that are non-immunes. This may appear rather strange 
to some of you, as it did to many. Including some of our leading stockjournals, 
when a South Carolina herd of cattle became infested with Texas 
fever after exhibition at the Charleston Exposition in 1901. The explanation 
of such an occurrence, however, is quite simple, when we realize 
that the tick is, so far as we now know, the onlyl intermediary host of 
the disease-germ, and that there are many places in the Southern States, 
as, for example, the alluvial lands of my own state, or lands subject to 
periodic inundation, on which ticks are rarely to be found. Consequently 
animals born and raised on such tick-free places are non-immune, because 
they have not had the opportunity to become inoculated by the natural 
method, viz., through the intermediation of the tick. But, If animals so 
raised, are afterwards placed upon ticky pastures, they will contract the 
fever just as surely as if they had been imported from north of the Federal 
quarantine line. In short, it is, with us, a question of ticks or no 

It is through the knowledge, then, of such scientific facts as these, 
established by careful and patient investigation, that the south is now 
able to import, with comparative impunity, animals of the improved 
breeds from the north and west. 

The discovery that the tick was capable of transmitting the organism 
of Texas fever, was of enormous import, but, without further and fuller 
investigation and experimentation, the knowledge of this fact, alone, 
would have done but little toward the accomplishment of practical ends. 
For some time, of course, it had been known to human medical scientists 
that immunity to certain infections or contagious diseases could be conferred 
by producing, though inoculation or vaccination, a mild or nonfatal 
form of the same disease. It is quite probable that this knowledge </seg>


            <seg id="p336">

led to the experiment of endeavoring to produce immunity to Texas fever 
in susceptible animals by the hypodermic injection of blood from the 
southern native, knowing that in that blood there existed the protozonic 
germ which the tick was capable of transmitting. For not only was it 
found that the blood drawn from the native was noxious, but that that 
taken from the body of the tick itself — after feeding upon the animal — had 
the effect of producing the fever. 

Pen after reaching this important stage of our knowledge, further 
xperimenting had to be undertaken. It was found that, at first, 
ility was excessive, a considerable number of animals succumbing 
ver as the result of artificial inoculation, which, of course, must

nts. however, led to considerable modification with the result

Bhout attempting to show who, in this country, were the first to try 
lood-inoculation method of treatment. I believe we are indebted to 
ueenslanders for the first setting forth its .practical affects. Mr. C. J. 
1, director of the Government Stock Institute, and Mr. J. Sidney 
Hunt, government pathologist, in that coumtry, showed that the disease 
known as "red water" in Australia, was identical with what we call 
K fever, and that if inoculation be made with the blood of animals 
had recently recovered from the disease, the degree of immunity 
lg from it was sufficient to enable the animal to withstand the 
in its most virulent form. 

Ph this valuable information obtained, a number of our Experiment 
ns, notably Missouri, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and probably 
others, took steps to further solve the problem for themselves. 

Er earlier experiments were to determine whether sterile blood-serum 
immune southern cattle contained any product, of the nature of an 
toxin, that could be utilized, practically, to confer, at least, a temry 
immunity in susceptible cattle. The result of this experiment 
ed, however, that this material possessed no protective properties. 

Emd experiment aimed at immunizing cattle with the germ of the 
by means of infesting the animal with ticks. But, although it 
accomplished by this method, there were numerous considerations 
idered it impracticable. 

R&gt; third attempted experiment was to produce immunity through the 
lation of infected blood, and it is by this method that the greatest 
nt of success has been achieved, and which we are using at the 
nt time. 

As previously mentioned, the chief causative factor in the production 
of Texas fever, is a micro-parasitic organism found in the blood of 
southern cattle, and conveyed to susceptible animals through the medium 
of the cattle-tick (Boophilus annulatus). This organism, when introduced 
into the circulation of the non-immune animals, attacks and destroys </seg>

ntegrlty of the red blood-cells and causes great reduction In their number, 
which' can be ascertained by means of one of two special Instruments — 
the haematokrit or the haemocytometer; the former showing the percentage 
of the solid constituents of the blood in a given quantity, and the 
atter, the number of red blood-cells. The breaking down of such gnat 
numbers of the cell elements of the blood interferes very seriously with 
the vital forces, with the result that there is produced large amounts of 
&gt;roken down cell-tissue and waste material that require elimination from 
the system through the excretory channels. Such a condition necessarily 
calls for increased activity on the part of those organs and tisanes concerned 
in blood-cell production, and the speedy elimination of waste 
material from the animal economy, for, on such activity and capability 
rests the main power of resistance to the pathogenic, or disease-producing, 
action of this fever. This, during the artiflcally-produced fever-period, is 
accomplished by intelligent management in the care and feeding of the 

Immunity to a fatal form of Texas fever, then, is only conferred after a 
genuine attack of the disease itself, either through the medium of the tick 
or by artificial inoculation of the infected blood. Just how long this 
immunity will last, in the absence of ticks, has, I think, not been acca 
rately determined; nor does it seem to be of very vital importance to us 
In the south, as it might be said of the ticks, as of the poor, that "they are 
always with us," and, therefore, the immunity in our cattle is being con 
tnually kept up through inoculation by these parasites. 

I believe I am correct when I say, that artificial immunization, as is 
generally practiced does not, at the time, confer absolute immunity; but 
that the degree of immunity, thereby conferred, is sufficient to enable the 
animal to ward off fatal effects during the transition period, as it were, 
between partial immunity and absolute safety. This is illustrated by 
occasional relapses in inoculated animals exposed on pastures grossly 
infested with ticks, until the stage of complete immunity is reached. In 
order, therefore, to obtain a greater degree of resistance, before giving 
cattle their freedom on tick-infested pastures or ranges, it has been the 
more recent custom with us in the south to administer two, and, in some 
cases, three inoculations of deflbrinated blood, and with satisfactory 
results. 

Of course, as you may readily conceive, the chief advantage of artificial 
inoculation over the natural method by ticks, is, that the amount of the 
former can easily be regulated, while the control of the number of the 
latter is a matter attended with some difficulty, on account of the possibility 
of re-infestation before the establishment of a sufficient degree of 
immunity to withstand their effects. The second and third inoculations, 
therefore, are simply to bring about a greater degree of resistance before 
the animal is left to the "tender mercies" of the tick. 

Although not, perhaps, generally known it is apparently a fact that 
our southern calves, at birth, are not immune to Texas fever, but that </seg>

            <seg id="p338">
338

they early contract the disease through tick-infestation, and being continually 
exposed to these parasites, the inoculation is kept up, the effects 
of which, however, gradually become less and less severe until permanent 
immunity is established. 

It would seem with this disease, as with some others, such as black-leg 
for instance, that the very young calf is more resistant to its virulence 
than is the case with older animals. 

To test the question as to immunity, or otherwise, of southern native 
calves that had never been exposed to ticks, we selected two animals, one 
under six months old, and the other, some eight or nine months, neither 
having been previously exposed. We inoculated each with blood from 
a tick-infested animal, and passed them through the treatment just as we 
do in the case of susceptible northern cattle. The older calf gave a typical 
febrile reaction, while the younger one, although giving a decided 
rsponse, did not seem to be visibly affected. As further proof of this fact, 
may say that the Mississippi Station inoculated several Northern 
animals with blood drawn from native calves that were born and kept 
on tick-free pastures, without producing any effect in the susceptible stock. 

Notwithstanding the fact that sufficient is known, and has been proved 
by experiment, regarding the immunization treatment, to show its immense 
importance, as an economic factor, to the cattle interests of the 
country, there are always points cropping up that furnish food for thought 
and add to our general knowledge of the subject. 

In the fall of 1901, our Experiment Station purchased in Illinois some 
thirty-five head of grade Angus calves and yearlings, and inoculated them 
in the customary manner, giving to each 1 cubic centimeter (about 18 
drops) of defibrinated blood. During the past summer and fall, which 
proved to be an exceptionally prolonged tick-season with us, a number of 
these animals appeared to suffer periodically from relapses, brought about 
no doubt, by excessive and recurrent infestation by ticks. Still, I am 
inclined to the opinion that there was probably another active factor In 
the case, although verified, only, by circumstantial evidence. 

In laboratory experiments with bacterial organisms, it is found that 
when they are passed and repassed through the bodies of highly susceptible 
animals of the same species, their virulence is much intensified. 

These animals, after having passed through the two stages of the 
inoculation-fever period, were placed upon a pasture by themselves, or 
mainly so, none of the other stock being what might be termed natives, 
although they had been inoculated about three years previous. 

In another herd of some sixty head of grade Shorthorns, imported from 
above the "fever line" by a local stock company, and inoculated about the 
same time, we had similar results as to relapses. These cattle occupied 
the pastures alone, no natives intermingling with them at all, after they 
had been turned out. 

On the other hand, single males, or small bunches, of immunized Northern 
cattle, that had been permitted to mingle with greater numbers of</seg> 

            <seg id="p339">
339 

IMMUNIZA \TTLE. 

native animals, did not appear to experience recurrences of fever, to the 
same extent, at least, so far as we have been able to ascertain. 

Em these observations, the following deduction seems feasible: That 
possible, or we might say, probable, that, in the case of the two 
alluded to, and their comparative isolation from native cattle, the 
ticks were passing and repassing the organisms of Texas fever through the 
bodies of highly-susceptible animals, with none, in one instance, and an 
insufficient number, in the other, of highly-immune, and, therefore, highlyresistant 
ones to modify the virulence of the germ or its products. But, 
with the conditions reversed, in the other cases mentioned, there seemed 
to be a modifying effect upon the virus, by passing it through the bodies, 
not of highly-susceptible animals exclusively but of a larger number of 
powerfully-resistant natives, as well, that had been immune from shortly 
after the time of their birth. 

These observations are perhaps not sufficiently extended to enable us to 
draw positive conclusions; yet, we are inclined to the opinion that they 
point in the direction suggested. So that, even although results from only 
one inoculation have been extremely satisfactory, we believe, that with a 
second, or even a third, in the case of range cattle that are more out of 
control, and with the assistance of a sufficient number of hardy, resistant 
immunes — where practicable — to mix with the recently inoculated cattle, 
and take their share of tick-infestation, thereby modifying the intensity 
of the virus, that even better results may be anticipated in the future. 

With regard to the relationship of high susceptibility in animals to increased 
virulence of the disease, we think we have a pretty good illustration 
in reports received from Rhodesia, in South Africa, a part of the 
world which has also suffered extensively from the same malady, and 
caused by the same organism, although referred to by the authorities there 
as "red-water." 

During the period of hostilities in South Africa, the native cattle In 
various sections, were, of course, almost totally used up for food purposes, 
and many had to be imported from other countries. In one lot of about 
987 head, brought to Rhodesia from Australia, only three survived; all 
the others succumbing to the ravages of this disease. 

In a communication to myself, the chief veterinary surgeon of the 
British South Africa Company, stated, with reference to the condition 
of affairs in Rhodesia: "We are still in the throes of a red-water epizootic, 
which is, I think, of almost unique intensity. When I say the disease 
seems to be of unique severity, I think I make the assertion with reason. 
On microscopic examination, we frequently find 75 per cent of the red 
blood-cells invaded- by the specific organism, and sometimes as many as 
7 or 8 can be discovered within a single cell. The mortality is very 
high, sometimes up to 100 per cent, and the immunity conferred by one 
attack seems to be broken down after an interval of about three months; 
hence, as you may understand, the ordinary method of protective inoculation 
does not give satisfactory results. How far this severity of type is </seg>

E) over-Infection by ticks, which have this season been present In 
mal numbers; how far it is due to the passage- of the disease 
;h a large number of highly-susceptible animals; and how far to 
1c influences, I cannot at this moment say; but I believe the second 
is the chief one, and that the intensity of the disease will abate 
the less resistant animals are weeded out." 

This South African experience we are inclined to look upon as an aggravated 
instance of the conditions with which we had to contend during 
the past summer, in the two lots of animals referred to ; and it is possible, 
we think, that had there been a sufficient number of tick-infested native 
cattle in Rhodesia to run with the susceptible importations the intensity 
of the virulence might have been greatly modified. 

The decisive proof of any treatment can only be obtained by subjecting 
it to severe test. In the case of artificial immunization to Texas fever, 
the test is, of course, the exposure of treated animals to infestation by 
cattle ticks, which are the natural transmitters of the disease. And 
when for one moment the heavy mortality that occurred in non-immunes 
brought south in previous years, amounting anywhere from 50 to 90 per 
cent, and compare that with the results now obtained, viz., from zero to 
perhaps 8 or 10 per cent, in cases where the proper after-care has not been 
bestowed upon the animals, we beg to realize the immense boon this valuable 
discoverey is destined to be to the cattle interests of the southern 
states, and, necessarily, to the northern breeder, as well, in opening up a 
market to him for the improved breeds of cattle that will be required in 
the south for some considerable time to come. 

So far as the technique of the operation of immunizing is concerned, 
I think we may pass that over in a very few words. It is merely the 
injection of a small amount of blood, taken from a southern native animal, 
or one previously immunized and that has had ticks on it, underneath the 
skin of a susceptible one, the latter being kept free from ticks for about 
60 days, or until the patient has passed over two fever periods, which it 
usually does in that time. The blood is drawn from the jugular vein of 
the "supply" animal, after the hair has been clipped, and the skin thoroughly 
disinfected, where the vein is to be punctured. The blood in the 
receiving vessel is then stirred, and the clot, or fibrin, removed. That 
remaining is taken up with a suitable syrings, and the proper quantity 
injected, hypodennically, at the most convenient spot, such as the neck, 
dewlap, or on the side of the chest close to the shoulder, the skin being 
previously treated as in the case of the supply animal. All instruments, 
and other paraphernalia connected with the operation, must, of course, 
be thoroughly sterilized in order to avoid septic infection, and obtain the 
most satisfactory results. 

Eiut the 10th day after inoculation, the temperature begins to rise, 
ains elevated for about a week or ten days, after which, it begins 
A second fever period commences from about the 25th to the 30th 
1 we find elevation of temperature for another 8 or 10 days. It </seg>

341 

then begins to lower, and at from about the 50th to the 60th day, the 
animal is ready to be discharged and exposed, during our cool season of 
the year, on pasture that is only moderately infested with ticks, to keep 
up the inoculation. 

When a second inoculation is used, it has been our custom to operate 
after the animal has recovered from the second fever period, and we hare 
been in the habit of using double the quantity of blood to that used as 
the primary dose. 

During the whole course of the immunizing fever the patients should 
be kept comfortable, and be carefully fed, so as to afford them strength 
and vigor to combat the depleting and debilitating influence upon the 
system generally, produced by the specific organism in the circulation. 

Prior to the days of artificial immunization, a profitable business in improved 
cattle raising in the southern states below the fevqr line, was almost, 
if not altogether, an impossibility. How could it be otherwise? The 
risk of importing high-priced animals was too great to be undertaken by 
the many, and those who could afford to take it, usually had to purchase 
more than their requirements demanded, in the hope of saving but a few. 
Young calves often pulled through, but adults were almost sure to meet 
E certain death. This has resulted in an abundance of "scrubs," of 
sexes, and with a corresponding degeneracy in our herds, for the 
of pure blood to build them up. 

It will be Been, then, that the south is in great need of improved cattle. 
Cattle we want and cattle we are going to have. Since the knowledge of 
the efficacy of this treatment has become spread amongst our people, It is 
surprising the number of fine animals, both of the beef and dairy types, 
that have already been brought south of the Federal line. Texas, as no 
doubt many of you are aware, has imported extensively. Louisiana and 
Mississippi, and other states within the tick-belt, are also annually contributing 
their share to the general and steady influx. 

But a few years ago, the large beef breeds were almost entirely unknown 
to cattlemen in my own state, except through hearsay or printed illustration. 
To-day, high-priced representatives of the Shorthorn, the Polled- 
Durham, the Hereford, the Angus, and the Red Poll, can now be seen 
scattered here and there throughout the commonwealth, and all doing 
well and thriving in their new homes in the south. The field, however, 
is still large, and the southern market still wide open, and must continue 
so for some time, for the northern breeder of improved animals. For, 
with our almost perennial season of growth; our endless variety of food 
products (concentrates, succulent foods and roughages), and with our 
genial climate, nature sems to have specially adapted our conditions to 
the requirements of an ideal stock country. 

But, besides the local demand already created in the south, through the 
removal of this menacing danger to imported cattle, we are strongly 
of the opinion that, sooner or later, there is the likelihood of a market 
being opened in some foreign countries for pure-bred immune southern </seg>

cattle. Take South Africa, for example. This fever has wrought such 
devastation, as has been shown, among the highly-susceptible stock imported 
into that country during the war, that in order to restock the 
farms, and re-establish the cattle-raising business on something like a 
normal basis, the authorities, there, are seriously considering the project 
of importing animals from other countries, whose cattle are immune to 
Texas fever. In fact, from a somewhat recent issue of the Agricultural 
Journal of the Cape of Good Hope, we find the experiment is already being 
tried in Natal in the introduction from Australia of cattle immune to 
Texas fever; and if these animals prove to be strictly immune to the 
disease, it is suggested that further extensive importations will probably 
be made from Australia, and from North and South America. 

Here, then, would seem to us to be a possible future for the south for 
the exportation of our cattle that are thoroughly immune to this dine— e; 
and if we should be fortunate enough to be able to create a demand in 
that country for our stock, and, with our excellent shipping facilities at 
the port of New Orleans, which are well known to the authorities in 
South Africa, it would have the tendency of stimulating our people to 
greater effort in this industry to meet the requirements. 

Should such a market materialize (Cuba, also, may probably want our 
cattle), and we see no good reason why it should not, if properly looked 
after, besides benefiting our southern stockmen, the probability is, that 
it would pay breeders and raisers, generally, located above the tick-fever 
line, to have stock immunized, or even raised, in the south, so as to be 
able to take advantage of such a market, as. owing to present conditions, it 
is likely to remain open for some years to come, and ought to be worth 
making a "bid" for. 

In concluding this paper. I desire to say, from my own personal experience 
and observations, that there can be no longer any doubt as to 
the success of being able to render Northern cattle immune to Texas 
fever by the blood-inoculation method; that there is at present, and must 
continue to be, for some time, a market in the south for the northern 
breeder of the improved varieties of cattle; that the southern states, or. 
at least, that section with which I am most familiar, is an ideal stock 
country, on account of favorable climate conditions and large food production; 
that the great markets of this country, and of the world, are easily 
accessible, the former by rail, the latter, through the great shipping port 
of New Orleans, or some other of the Gulf or South Atlantic ports; and 
that there are evidences of the probability of markets being established, 
for our immune pure-breds, in foreign countries requiring such for the upbuilding 
and improvement of their cattle industries. 

Pe value of the inoculation treatment cannot be estimated in dollars 
cents. It is beyond computation. The possibilities of the southern 
8, in cattle production, are undoubtedly great, and are assuredly 
worthy of careful investigation by the Northern breeder. We are by no 
means overcrowded; there is room and to spare. And if only some of our 
western stock-growing friends would come down amongst us, and assist 
in the development of this great industry, they would receive a warm 
welcome. For, to use a familiar saying, "the latchstring always hangs on 
the outside of the door." </seg>

BEES ON THE FARM. 

(Address of E. Kretchmer. Red Oak, Iowa, before the Nebraska State 
Beekeepers' Association.) 

I: ideal place to keep a few colonies of bees is on the farm, for there 
&gt;ney producing plants are all around them, and secondly, the fanner's 
should be supplied with the most delicious health preserving sweets 
? has placed before man through the medium of the honey bee. 

8e many concede these facts, a large number overlook the more 
int benefits of the bees on the farm; nor can some be blamed for 
¦e not acquainted with the more recent developments and the 1ments 
of the bees themselves. For instance, in the past we relied 
i on the second crop of red clover for seed because the first crop 
contained very little or no seed. Why? The pollen from one bloaeom 
must be conveyed to another; In some flowers other than clover this may 
be effected by the winds, but in red clover, with its deep cell shaped pod* 
growing close to the ground, the winds produce no pollen fertilization, 
and insects are the only practical agents to convey the clover pollen. 
Heretofore the bumble-bees were the principal agents; yes, we may truly 
say the only agents to distribute this pollen; but unfortunately for the 
clover seed producer, only the queen of the bumble-bee lives over winter. 
She starts a nest in spring from which eventually, usually not until midsummer, 
a colony of bumble-bees are produced. But there being «»—iw* 
no bumble-bees when the first crop of clover was in bloom, no seed was 
obtained as a result. Prof. Charles Burkett covered a patch of clover 
heads six feet square with mosquito netting. He gives the result as fol- 

Ee number of seed in one hundred heads of clover was as follows: 
crop which was covered gave no seed; first crop uncovered gave ten. 
lover in the second crop which was covered gave two, the uncovered 
itx hundred and twelve." 

But improvements and advancement is the order of the day. While we 
improve our horses, cattle art! hogs, the bee keepers and queen raisers 
were equally active in the development of the honey bee, and today we 
have strains of Italian bees with a tongue-reach of .21 of an inch and 
physical development to force the end of that long tongue to the bottom 
of the red clover blossom, and as they pass from flower to flower convey 
the pollen necessary for seed formation. Some red clover growing within 
reach of our bees gave the following result from one hundred heads: 

E-st crop, 510 seeds: second crop, 580 seeds. Therefore the time is near 
ind when by the help of the bees on the farm we may obtain not only 
crops of clover instead of one, but also a crop of honey in addition 
t to. 

Not only this honey, but tons of honey are annually lost on our farms </seg>

for want of bees to gather it. While we would not advise the keeping on 
our farms of a hundred or more colonies on every farm, large or small, 
we certainly would urge every farmer to keep enough bees to supply his 
family with all the honey they may wish to eat. It always appeared to me 

a mistake for a farmer to devote part of his ground and eight months of 
his time and hard work to raise a crop of corn, then take part of that 
crop to buy abominable health-destroying glucose called "sugar drip" or 
"maple syrup" with perhaps not more than 25 per cent of maple syrup in 
the mixture. I am not speaking at random when I call it a mixture or 
when I name 75 per cent glucose. At various times these syrups have 
been purchased in the open market at many places, which after careful 
chemical analysis were found to contain as high as 90 per cent of glucose. 
I called this mixture health-destroying for the best medical authorities 
assert that glucose is in many cases responsible for Bright's disease and 
the eating of it will aggravate this malady. On the other hand, honey 
is the most healthful sweet obtainable. A pound of honey will produce 
kre tissue in the human body than five pounds of pork and will prove 
re beneficial than 50 cents' worth of drugs. Every well arranged farm 
has an orchard, produces small fruits and also has a part of its grounds 
devoted to the cultivation of melons, cucumbers, squash, etc. The flowers 
of these require fertilization through the medium of pollen from another 
flower specie, which is accomplished in various ways, but mainly through 
the bees. The honey-bee as a pollen distributor is perhaps of greater 
value to this country than the entire crop of honey produced. That we 
are largely indebted to the honey-bee for both quantity and quality of our 
fruits there is but little doubt. Not only is this true In fruits, but vegetables 
and cereals commonly grown on the farm. 

An all-wise Creator placed nectar in nearly all the flowers to entice the 
bees to them. He covered the body of the bee with a covering of fine hair 
and made their diet to consist of honey and pollen. To obtain this the 
bee* visit the flowers to extract the nectar and while doing so' a single bee 
visits sometimes as many as fifty flowers before obtaining a 
load to carry to the hive. At each visit to the fifty or lew 
of different flowers, the flower pollen of the various flowers becomes 
entangled in their hair-like covering and in their effort to extract 
nectar from the next visited flo.wer a sufficient quantity of 
pollen obtained from a previously visited flower is dropped, and fertilization 
Is thus effected. Not only does a bee visit the same flower once, 
but hundreds may visit the same flower in a day or for a number of days 
In succession and thus the most perfect fertilization is brought about. 
Who has not seen the cornfields with their heavy-laden tassels of pollen 
swarming with bees? As well as the clover fields, the buckwheat fields, 
orchards and garden. Farmers in general have awakened to the fact 
that the honey-bee Is their best friend, and that farming bees and fruit 
growing must be closely combined. As an example of the value of bees 
in fertilizing flowers, let me cite the case of Senator Smlnk of Rocky 
Ford, Colorado. Years ago he raised melons in several separate fields, </seg>

            <seg id="p345">
345 


one of which was wlthtn the reach of the bees of a neighbor. This particular 
field yielded over 200 per cent more and much better melons than 
the other fields. Today he owns over a thousand colonies of bees, and 
says he would keep those bees if he did not get a pound of honey; for no 
bees means no melons. But I seem to hear some one say: "I can't make 
bees pay," "I have no luck with bees," "I am afraid to handle them," "We 
ran buy what little honey we want," and so on. I will endeavor to answer 
each one in succession. 

"I can't make bees pay" is usually said by those who buy a few colonies, 
set them in the most out of the way place they can find, and being somewhat 
afraid of them never go near again until fall when they expect to get 
a crop of honey. Now right here I will state that bees need little care 
when compared with other stock, but what little they do need should be of 
the right kind and at the proper time. And for that little care bees pay a 
higher percentage of profit than any other farm stock. You provide pasture 
or feed your horses, cattle and hogs three times a day summer and 
winter, while an average of five minutes per colony of bees once every 
fifteen days for about seven months, or about one hour per colony in a 
year, is all the attention the bees actually need, and that attention Is 
mainly to ascertain their real condition. If they are weak they should be 
strengthened by giving them a comb of just hatched brood from a stronger 
colony that can spare it. If short of food they may need a little feeding 
until they can gather outside. On the other hand, if left alone they will 
either starve or dwindle down until so few in number that they cannot 
protect their combs and the moth soon finishes the colony. 

"But there are seasons with no honey," says one. Another says "Feeding 
is too expensive." Let us see about this. Personally I have never 
known a season where colonies kept strong by judicious feeding did not 
yield some honey. To prove this assertion let me state the actual cost 
and result of the worst five successive seasons, with a number of colonies 
at an out apiary. The bees cost $6 per colony; we fed them 40 pounds of 
sugar, costing $2; work, a little less than five hours, $1; 10 per cent interest 
on the cost of the bees, $3, making an expense of $6 per colony for 
the five years. The returns in honey per colony were as follows: First 
year, 5 pounds; second year, 9 pounds; third year, 13 pounds; fourth year, 
11 pounds, and fifth year, 70 pounds, a total of only 98 pounds, which 
sold for $9.80, and one swarm worth not less than $2. After deducting 
all expenses we have an annual net profit of nearly 20 per cent, while 
other seasons and other localities have given us a profit of over 400 per 
cent. 

In the foregoing computation we have not mentioned that the wax obtained 
paid for nearly all the work. If after the first four poor seasons we 
had said "Bees don't pay," we certainly would have sustained a loss instead 
of 20 per cent profit: or if we had not fed them just a little during 
the seasons of scarcity there would have been a total loss of comb and 
bees. Just the same would result if you did not feed your stock when 
they needed it. For home consumption I would suggest obtaining ex- </seg>

traoted honey. Two or three neighbors could buy jointly one of the 
cheaper extractors; or if you prefer comb honey, secure it as chunk or 
bulk honey, not in small sections, but in shallow frames. Bees work to 
better advantage when their cluster is not divided as with sections, nor 
does it require as much attention and expense as when producing fancy 
comb honey. 

Earn afraid to handle them," says another. This is mainly due to the 
that you have not learned to handle them properly, and on this perhinges 
the whole matter of success or failure. Get a good smoker, 
i veil to protect your face and one of the standard books of bee cul- 
During the long winter evenings read up a little on bees, and if 
;et once well started you will find it very interesting reading matter. 
1 spring comes commence to practice what you learned during the 
:r. You will soon thoroughly subdue your bees, and teach them you 
are master of the situation as well as acquire confidence. Should you 
perchance see some of the number of bee-keeping girls handle their bees 
as though they were flies, you would feel ashamed to admit you were 
afraid. Well, let me tell you that one of my daughters, when only four 
years old, assisted me in queen raising, carrying my book and handing me 
the tools required. Hundreds of times she has had her face within six 
inches of the bees looking into the hives for the queen without fear or 
without being stung; and you can do likewise; it is all in knowing how; 
and this at the present time can be acquired when a good text book on 
bees can be obtained for $1. 

And still another says "I can buy what little honey I want." I fear that 
if you go to the grocery store to buy your honey it will be but little honey 
that you will eat. But why do you want to buy what is wasting on your 
very farm, just because you have not the bees to gather it? If you will 
persist in buying your honey, buy it from your son or daughter. Get them 
interested and pay them for it and you will be the gainer for the presence 
of the bees in more perfect fruit, more and finer berries and increased 
Held crops. 

I will add just one more fact on more perfect fruit, Just mentioned. 
The apple, as its blossom indicates, is strictly a fusion of five fruits into 
one. Each blossom has five stigmas and to each belongs a division of the 
core of the apple, which demands for its production in perfection no less 
than five independent fertilizations. If none are effected, the calyx dries 
and soon drops. An apple often develops if only four of the stigmas 
have been pollinated, but it rarely hangs long enough to ripen and if it 
does drop prematurely it will be ill-shaped, lop-sided and small, as the 
unfertilized portion seldom develops to the same size. 

Before closing let me admonish you to get some bees on your farm and 
furnish your family with health-producing and health-preserving sweets 
and fruit. Begin now by reading up a little from a text book and when 
spring comes put into practice what you have read and I believe you will 
not regret it. </seg>

THE LOSS OF SOIL CAPITAL. 

THE LOSS OF SOIL CAPITAL OR THE DENUDING OF (UK 

AGRICULTURAL LANDS. 

(Address of L. C. Burnett, of Nebraska City, Neb., before the Nebraska 
Improved Live Stock Breeders' Association.) 

It has been roughly estimated that there is an annual loss of 269 square 
miles of soil, one foot in depth, from the great Mississippi basin, and 
a very large per cent of this enormous loss comes, from the Missouri 
river and its tributaries. The loss of 269 miles includes the whole 
drainage system of these great rivers, but we must bear in mind that 
large areas, such as our semi-arid regions, all of the lower levels and 
much of the prairie lands lose but a small per cent of the whole. Hence, 
this great loss must come from our rolling lands, and none suffer more 
than Eastern Nebraska and Kansas. 

To the above amount of soil that is lost to the Gulf of Mexico we 
should add a like amount that is transported from rolling lands to all 
lower levels. Imagine, if you can, a body of soil, ten by sixty miles, 
moving like a mighty avalanche river and ocean-ward, and the very 
cream of our broad acres. While the loss of this soil represents untold 
values to our farms, the government and the states, bordering the lower 
Mississippi river, are spending millions of dollars to get rid of our soil. 
Then again, the torrential rush of these waters causes other losses of 
great magnitude. 

"Some idea of the vast destruction of property due to floods may be 
gathered from the statement that the floods of 1881-1882 caused a loss 
of not less than $15,000,000 to the property interests of the Ohio and 
Mississippi valleys alone. In 1884 the region about Cincinnati alone 
suffereo a loss of $10,000,000.' 

Well may Captain Eads exclaim: "Forestry must come to the aid of 
the engineer." A half-uttered truth. 

Eaim that the farmers of this mighty mid-west must come to the 
the engineer. The damming up of one draw, the creation of one 
oir, is an aid. The good effects of one thousand will be felt away 
in the south-land. 

Be hundred and eighty miles of eastern Nebraska contains 129,600 
ter sections of land. If waste land to the amount of two acres 
quarter section is dammed up, we will have a water surface of 
00 acres. If combined*, would make two lakes, one mile wide, 161% 
long. The holding back of this much flood water will be felt along the 
levees and jetties of the Mississippi. And if our sister states should do 
as well, the great problem of taking care of our flood waters will be 
solved, and Uncle Sam can use his millions of dollars in building great 
reservoirs. Our semi-arid west will have been redeemed from our hot </seg>

winds, and for generations this mightly inter-ocean will continue to 
be America's great stock farm and granary. And we again can sing the 
song of our childhood 

"To the West! to the West! to the land of the free! 
Where the mighty Missouri rolls down to the sea." 

When we bought our farm fifteen years ago. it was badly run down. 
On the higher portions and their slopes the soil was very poor. The 
cornstalks had been regularly pastured, regardless of the weather or 
condition of the soil. The result was a poor crop of corn for two years, 
only thirty-five bushels per acre. I at once kept one man hauling manure 
from two to six months each year, putting on about 50 loads to the acre. 
Since then I never got less than sixty-five bushels with the exception of 
1894 and 1901. It having cost so much to bring the land up to a good 
condition, the loss of soil from heavy washing rains began to worry me. 
My first efforts at prevention were along the line that most farmers 
yet pursue, putting into the draws hay, straw, manure, brush, or any 
old thing that would help fill up. These all proved to be more along 
the line of preventives and helps for the gullies and ditches here and 
there through the field, but were worse than useless for combatting the 
water erosions in the larger draws. 

All the information I could get from my .neighbors was more discouraging 
than helpful, but to give up, I could not and would not. In the 
meantime I had been putting dirt dams across small draws, on one 
draw, 30 rods long, 6 feet deep and 12 feet wide. I built four dams in 
two years; this draw was a thing of the past, all nicely leveled up, over 
which I have been farming ever since, but I keep two dams solid all the 
time. Further down the draw was a fish pond, 15 yards wide by 90 
long, and 12 feet deep. A sad accident having occurred there we determined 
to let it fill up with soil, which it did in a few years. Below this 
pond we created a lakelet 400 feet long by 60 feet wide, 5 feet deep. 
This has filled up with soil in the past two years four feet. By this 
time I began to be a crank on soil-saving. For years, by night and day, 
at every heavy rain, I would put on my rubber boots and coat and go 
forth to battle with the storm. A little help here or there with the spade 
would often turn the tide in my favor; although twice I stood by and 
saw one large pond empty I had overlooked, but these were only the right 
track: success was assured. 

Three years ago I determined to try conclusions with the largest draw 
on my place, through which a large body of water flows when it rains 
hard. On this I put two dams and they stick, too; already they have 
filled up four to eight feet. The amount of soil caught in the two draws 
equals a foot of soil from seven acres of ground; or, in other words, my 
neighbors have given me one-ninth of their surface soil, only sixty acres 
Sg contributed to these results. If these surprising results have 
brought about in so few years, what might have been accomplished 
i past forty years? No wonder that I lifted my hands in astonishment

THE LO88 OF SOIL CAPITAL. 

I can hear some of saying, "I cannot afford to build so many dams." 
Ton can better than to say so many d — s because your lands are being 
cut to pieces. You are wrong. A dam made as I will describe it will 
stand an immense amount of washing and pressure before giving way, 
and only a little care and watching will preserve it against any freshet 

In the making of a dam, if a large one, clean off all the black*soil till 
you are down to the clay subsoil. Then clean off the black soil from 
the pond side of proposed dam; utilize this dirt at the ends of the dam 
on the highest ground. Now you are ready for business. You have a 
clean foundation, say, fifty feet wide by 100 long; begin and lay six 
inches deep over the whole bottom at once, and so continue until completed. 
A dam ten feet high should be at least fifty feet wide at the 
bottom with a long slope both ways. 

A mistake is often made in making the dam too steep. When properly 
made, the constant tramping of the horses' feet, especially if the soil is 
moist, will so toughen it that it will resist washing of the water more 
than most people will believe. Have a scraper of your own and whenever 
it is too wet to plow or cultivate, go and do a half or a full day's work, 
and you will soon be surprised at what you have accomplished, and 
the results will make your hearts rejoice. 

PIr. John Overton. my neighbor, seeing the good work I was doing, 
an the construction of ponds. He too wanted a place for the children 
skate and plenty of water for his stock. So he built five dams. All 
the ponds thus created are now full of soil. One was nine feet deep in 
its deepest and 900 feet long. Astonishing as it may seem, one rainfall 
E enough soil to fill this about full. He was so pleased with the 
that he told me, if he had not sold his farm, he would have 
up every draw on his place. He now regrets that he did 
d the good work years ago. 

Mr. Edgar Clayton, living .near the mouth of Camp creek, on the 
Peru bottoms, has caught soil wash to a great extent. This year alone 
eighteen inches on an eighty-acre piece of land, and has this year 
200 acres of corn above high water mark, where a few years ago there 
was a slough and low bottom land. On this piece of land there is a 
fill of about 8 feet. If you please, how many hill farms has this 
impoverished? 

Tom. King of Percival, la., a few years ago. bought a very poor quarter 
section of land near the Wabaunsie creek. Today he considers it the 
most valuable land he has. It is a magnificent pasture field, self-made, 
as to soil and seeding. The soil coming down from the hill farms brought 
plenty of clover, timothy and blue grass seed. 

I could mention many others. 

During one of our heavy rains last year, Mr. Sheldon, of Nehawka. was 
standing on the banks of the Weeping Water, thinking deeply, when Lee 
Applegate came up and I don't wonder at his exclamation as he viewed 
the heavily laden waters flowing by — "Lee, just look, there go our 
farms." </seg>

"Water moving at the rate of three Inches per second will take up and 
carry along fine clay; six inches per second will carry fine sand; eight 
inches per second, sand; twelve inches, gravel; twenty-four inches, 
pebbles; three feet, stone — fragments as large as hens' eggs. A current 
running- three feet per second equal to 2 mils pr hour." 

I follows from above law that a current ten miles per hour will carry 
ients of 100 tons weight. We can thus easily understand the destruc[fects 
of mountain torrents when swollen by floods." If a fall of three 
«r mile is a mountain torrent, how about many of our farm lands 
ng three feet per second equal to two miles per hour." 

"If a current bearing sediment has its velocity checked by any cause, 
in the slightest degree, a large portion of the sediment is deposited. But 
If on the other hand the velocity of a current be increased by any cause. 
In ever so small a degree, it will again take up and carry on materials 
which it had deposited, and these effects are surprisingly large on 
account of the great change in erosive and transporting power, «ven 
with slight changes of velocity." 

In the upper portions of great rivers, the erosion is very great, while 
in the plains near the mouth there may be no erosion. 

"The whole amount of water falling on any land surface that concerns 
us may be divided into two parts: 

¦ That which rushes immediately off the surface and causes the 
of the rivers, especially the smaller streams. 

"2. That which sinks into the earth, and after doing its chemical work 
of soil-making, reappears as springs, and forms the regular supply of 
streams and rivers. Of these the former predominates in proportion as 
the land surface is bare; the latter In proportion as It Is covered with 

From the above facts gleaned from geology, and from our own experi 

The water that flows off from the surface of our fields always does 
harm, more or less, according to the rainfall and its duration. That 
portion that soaks into the ground always does good. 

I wish I could burn these facts as deep down into your heads and 
hearts as they are in mine. It just makes me heart-sick to stand by 
our swollen streams after a heavy rainfall and see the water and soil 
flowing seaward. Men, farmers of Nebraska, shall this loss go on? God 
forbid, that we should throw away the heritage of the ages; but so far 
no profligate ever threw away his fortune faster than we have our soil 

Some persons are like the man that was praying. When he got In 
real earnest he said, "Dear Lord, comparing earthly things with heavenly 
things, they do not amount to a hill of beans." And some of you that 
hear me may have the same opinion of this subject. 

But it does, and when you have given the subject a fraction of the 
thought and observation that I have, you will think so too. </seg>

THE LOSS OF SOIL CAPITAL. 

351 

And yet, lest I forget: the publishers of one of the largest farm papers 
said this question did not concern one farmer in ten thousand. 

In the making of artificial ponds and reservoirs, we are creating springs 
for ourselves on our own place or our neighbor's. 

Ewish to emphasize this fact, as it should be well understood. If 
have high and low land on your place, the springs are very likely to 
k forth on your own place. On my farm of fifty acres, I can show 
ral that never existed before. 

What we want on our Nebraska lands is water, and if anything else, 
more water. If it were possible, I would say, hold all that falls on your 
place and all that comes from your neighbor's. But if you cannot 
stop his surplus water, you can trap or impound his soil, and soon that 
ugly draw will be your richest meadow land. 

The Agricultural Report, year 1885, page 153, says: "The same agencies 
which form the soils are also wasting and carrying them away. During 
every rain storm, transportation of soil goes on, as the brooks and 
rivers show after long-continued rains, by the yellow, muddy color of 
their waters, that they are carrying a vast quantity of sediment towards 
the sea. The running streams bear along the transported matter and 
gradually deposit it as the current diminishes its velocity. When the 
stream reaches a flat or level track, and over which its waters can flow 
in flood, the suspended matter, consisting principally of sand and mud, Is 
deposited and constitutes the alluvium or new land. 

"Of themselves, the brooks and rivers would carry far less sediment, 
were it not furnished so abuntantly from our farms: every corn row, cow 
path, roadway, ditch and draw is a miniature brook and it is their tumultuous 
torrents, combined during heavy rains that swell our rivers to their 
flood levels. If every farm had its lakelet or pools, instead of a rush 
of muddy water carrying away untold wealth we would have a steady flow 
of spring water; as the rivers drop their burden of soil when they reach 
quieter waters, so will the waters, as they rush down our corn rows 
deposit their burden in our ponds, and in a few years we will have more 
meadow land, and make glad the waste places." 

Again the writer says: 

"The amount of moisture retained by the soil is generally in direct ratio 
to its contents of organic matter. A proper degree of fineness in the 
particles of soil is very important to obtain, especially if it is subjected 
to drought. During dry spells plants require a soil that is both absorptive 
and retentive of moisture, and that soil which has this faculty will evidently 
raise a more vigorous growth." 

Ball know how very true the above statement is, so we want, by all 
and all ways, to keep this soil on our farms. 

Kurse as long as waters run down hill they will carry their burden 
and as long as land is tilled this will go on. But let us see to it 
is valuable soil shall not leave us. Catch it on our meadows or in 
lws. and soon we will have more meadows and then let us see to </seg>

            <seg id="p352">

Eat these meadows are never plowed up again; and as the years come 
go they will constantly grow richer and our rolling lands will graduand 
surely level up. The most fatal mistake ever made by the farmers 
ebraska was committed when they plowed up their draws and all 
r levels subject to overflow. 

Ei'hy is it that the North, Middle and Loup rivers have such a steady 
r of water the year round? It is because all the rain that falls on the 
dhills and valleys of northwest Nebraska sinks into the ground; it 
not get away. 

Eaim that we ought, all over Nebraska to construct very many such 
as are at Curtis and Cambridge and reservoirs without number. Of 
; it will require work and lots of it, but for every dollar so spent we 
et back ten in a very few years. Besides the satisfaction of always 
5 plenty of water for all purposes — ice, fishing, boating, bathing, etc. 

K.icle last summer called forth a good deal of comment and disand 
I must say I am surprised that far abler hands than mine 
written burning words on this subject. 

The masses move slowly and can only learn by example, so our best 
farmers must push out and show what can be done. The power of habit 
is so tenacious the great majority of people today in the making of 
gardens, throw the land up into beds, just as our ancestors did along the 
bogs of Ireland, or in the low lands of Holland or the mosquito districts 
of New Jersey. 

Years ago, while traveling in northern California, I stood on the bridge 
at Auburn, that spans the American river; while looking at its shallow, 
wide stream, an old settler came up and said to me: "You would not believe 
me, if I told you that only a few years ago, steamboats came up 
here." "What is the matter?" I said. "Oh, the channel is filled up with 
wash from the mines and farms." 

Em days later, while traveling along the Feather river, I noticed large 
were being raised again. I asked the residents, "What is the reason 
i?" Same answer: "The river is filling up with wash from the 
and farms." And the same could be said of the Sacramento river, 
steamboats used to run, is now great sand bars, and when the 
freshets come down, it overflows the banks. 

Between the washing from the mines and farms and denuding the 
mountains of their forests, man is fast destroying Nature's safe balances. 
Now, it is our prerogative here in Nebraska and along the Missouri valley 
to restore nature, help her along. Yes, it is in our power to make things 
better than they were fifty years ago. We owe it as a duty to our 
children and grandchildren, and they too can sing the jld song, 

"To the West! to the West! to the land of the free! 
Where the mighty Missouri rolls down to the sea." 

Professor Ornton of Ohio, illustrating the gradual impoverishment of 
the soil of this country, gives a striking example in the case of southwest- </seg>

areas of uplaud. where the soil possessing less depth and being less easily 
worked than the valleys, has so far deteriorated that the average product 
of wheat is less than ten bushels per acre. A frequent recurrence of failure 
in staple crops is mainly attributed to the depreciation of land. The 
largest corn tract of this district lies at the mouth of the Miami river, and 
intelligent farmers who have resided on it for forty years, state that during 
that period the average yield of corn has fallen from seventy-Ore to 
forty bushels of corn to the acre. We are no better or more wise than our 
forebears that settled in Ohio, for that state has furnished many statesmen 
and generals. 

can't we profit by their mistakes, or are we to see our lands go 
wn in value, as sure as the surface soils are washed away? But as long 
as we pasture our meadows, turn our stock Into the cornfields, when the 
ground is sodden, tramp it, pound it, burn up the cornstalks and straw 
tks. let the waters rush down the hillsides at their own sweet will, and 
same will be said of the Missouri valley as the Miami. 

Rainfall does the crops little or no direct good until it enters the soil. 

It is said that during our prosperous times we should lay by some of 
our surplus for a rainy day. It is equally as Important during our rainy 
spells to lay up as much of the surplus as possible for the dry days.

The filling up of our draws with water and then soil, is making glad 
the waste places. 

How they begin and grow, and the damage they are to our farms! As 
to their beginning, I need say but little. A cattle trail through your 
pasture this year may be a gorge twenty years from now, and of the many 
other ways, you all know too well. „ 

I know of one draw that has been but ten years in making, that is now 
eighty rods long, forty-four feet wide, with an average depth of fifty feet, 
over which a bridge, costing $110.00, was built the past summer. Will you 
tell me the harm this is to this eighty acre farm? 

On another eighty, there is a draw which, with its branches, divides the 
field completely into four parts. Only twenty-five years ago this was all 
fine meadow land; caused by cattle paths. 

On one of my neighbor's farms is a ravine three-quarters of a mile long, 
made in the past thirty years. This is more than a ravine — almost a

Kre canyon. It has not only eaten away a vast quantity of soil, but 
(1 up several fine springs. 

On another farm, west of Nebraska City, are draws to the extent of 
seven acres: all the result of recent years. Think you that this only destroys 
seven acres of soil for cultivation? I say fourteen: yes, I say, 
twenty-one. There must be turn rows from both sides of the four draws 
and their branches. The extra amount of work it takes to cultivate this 
field. Oh. it is a loss every way you look at it. 

These draws act as a great drainage system. During every hard rain, 
row and furrow become a miniature mountain torrent. They dump 
their burden of soil and water so quickly into the larger draws and again 
these ravines open up the water levels, frequently drain even the water 
from the subsoil or destroy adjacent springs. If the draws had grown to 
full size in one year, the owner would have held up his hands in mute 
astonishment, but they grew so gradually, he got used to the annual losses, 
but the sum total of all the loss is large in dollars. 

»farm is to be regarded as the capital of the farmer, which is Inat 
its best only when every acre is producing its most valuable 
its greatest quantity of which it is capable. Unproductive land is 
dead stock. 

Kiy of our banks were losing their capital as fast as many of our 
are losing their soil capital, you would not trust them over night 
le dollar. 

I wish here and now to quote some of the glowing words to the loss of 
our soils. Oh, how I would like to shake hands with the man that penned 

"Then the hills, no longer protected by the forest foliage, no longer 
bound by the forest roots, no longer held together by the grasses, no longer 
guarded by the brush and dirt dam of the careful farmer, were attacked 
by rain drops and rain-born rivulets, and gullied and channeled in all 
directions. Each streamlet reached a hundred arms into the fields; each 
arm grasped with a hundred fingers a hundred shreds of soil, and as each 
was torn away the slope was steepened, and the theft of the next storm 
was made easier. So storm by storm, and year by year, the old fields 
were invaded by gullies, gorges and ravines, ever increasing in width and 
depth, until the whole hillsides were carved away, until the soil of thousands 
of years' growth melted into the streams, until the fair acres of fifty 
years ago were converted by hundreds into unproductive lands and all 
this havoc has been wrought within a quarter of a century. 

"The processes, too, are accumulative; each year's rate of destruction 
is higher than the last. Moreover, in much of the upland the loss is not 
alone that of the soil, 1. e., the humus representing the constructive 
product of water-work and plant-work for thousands of years. The mantle 
of black loam, most excellent of soil stuffs, Is cut through and carried 
away by erosion and sapping, leaving in its stead the Inferior soil. In 
such cases the destruction is irremediable by human craft; the fine loam 
once removed can never be restored. </seg>

rate of loss is increasing in geometric proportion."

the wintry blasts; even the snow, thy mantle of purity, cannot find a 
lodgment place, if the angry winds blow, but must drift off into the draws

THE PRWJRKSS OF FORKSTRY. 

(Paper read at the annual meeting of the Nebraska State Forestry Association, 
held at York June 16th, 1903, by William H. Mast, 
Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Forestry, stationed at Halsey. 
Neb.) 

Many years before the woodsman had begun work in America's great 
timber areas, forestry in Germany had become a well known and diligently 
studied science. Those thrifty people had learned the value of wood and 
had measured the supply. Their waste lands had already been covered 
with forests, and were yielding good returns. The wood crop received 
close attention and was harvested with great care. That it was a thing 
of concern, both for the present and the future, could not be overlooked. 

The Germans had gained much knowledge by experience; they had 
solved, and were solving, many important problems, and their comprehension 
of forestry principles placed them foremost in this science, which

position they still rightfully hold. We have much to learn from them 
about forestry, and a great deal to find out for ourselves, for, though they 
may have solved the problems correctly, we realize at once that their 
results cannot always be accepted by us, because American conditions 
are vastly different from European. The size of our country, the distance 
lumber is transported, the kind and quality of material demanded 
— all differ from that In Germany. These, with many other things, make 
their methods impracticable for our use. 

In this country the timber was once considered worse than worthless, 
because It covered good ground, and its removal meant much hard work. 
Our forefathers thought the supply too vast to be exhausted. We have 
now only begun to realize the necessity of reserving a wood supply for 
the future generations, and, awakening from our stupor, we are brought 
face to face with immense problems which must be solved without delay. 
For many years our ancestors were anxious to rid themselves of the 
timber that cumbered their land, but there began to appear men who 
were thoughtful for the future, and recognized the importance of forest 
conservation. Public opinion was gradually changed, and laws for regulating 
and prohibiting the cutting of timber were made. ' Among the 
earliest of these laws, we know that in 1640 certain regulations as to the 
cutting of oak were established in Exeter, N. H. In 1662, William Penn. in 
his ordinances regulating the sale of land in Pennsylvania, demanded 
that for every five acres cleared, one should be reserved in timber growth. 
About fifty years after this, the Provincial Assembly of New Hampshire 
prohibited the cutting of timber suitable for shipmasts from ungranted 
lands, under a penalty of 100 pounds. At this early date New Hampshire 
had a Surveyor-General of Forests who received his commission from the 
English crown. 

Between the years 1785 and 1805, two French botanists, Andre Michaux 
and Francois Michaux, in their study of American trees, did a great deal 
to enlist public sentiment in the belief of the necessity of rational 
treatment or our forest resources. During this time a New York 
society published a report on on "The Best Method of Preserving 
and Increasing the Growth of Timber." In 1799 the Federal 
Government recognized this necessity, and passed public laws dealing with 
the timber supply of the country. Congress also appropriated $200,000 
for the purchase of standing timber, especially forest lands bearing timber 
suitable for use in the navy. The selection of these tracts was left to the 
President, and under this act 19,000 acres were reserved on islands off the 
coast of Louisiana and other gulf states. In 1818 Congress made another 
appropriation of $100,000 for the purchase of land on Santa Rosa Sound, 
Florida, where seeding and planting were first attempted. In 1831 provision 
was made for the punishment of anyone cutting or destroying live 
t cedar or any other tree growing on public lands of the United States. 
Ills time 244,000 acres of land were reserved in Alabama, Florida, 
ilana and Mississippi. It was not a conception of the need of a </seg>

THE PROGRESS OF FORESTRY. 

national forestry policy that caused the enactment of these laws: the real 
Incentive was the saving of special kinds of timber necessary in the nary. 

As late as 1840 lumbering operations, such as we have to-day, were never 
dreamed of. At this time the value of the total annual cut was $2,946,507. 
fifty years later it had increased to over 31 times that amount, or 
105,668,000. The rapid consumption of forest supplies, coupled with 
wastefulness and destruction by fires, with no attention paid to reproduction, 
caused considerable agitation on the part of many citizens, who 
gave vent to their opinions through the daily press. . Two important 
publications that helped to shape public opinion were Dr. Warden's report 
on "Methods Used Abroad in Forests" and Marsh's "Earth as Modified by 
Human Action." The first canvass of the United States forest reserves 
was made by Prof. Brewer of Yale in 1870, and published in the Census 
Report of that year. 

In 1875 the "American Association for the Advancement of Science" 
presented Congress with a memorial, and, as an outcome, three year* 
later. August 15, 187G, an Agency of Forestry was established in the 
United States Department of Agriculture. This, in a few years, became 
a Division and in July, 1901. a Bureau of Forestry- Under the provisions 
of the act which established the agency. Franklin B. Hough of Louisville, 
N. Y, was appointed as an agent to make a special report to Congress of 
the forest resources of the United States. This act was the first to give 
the subject of forestry a place in the government departments, and insure 
for it public recognition. 

! Prior to 1876 a number of states had begun forestry movements. In 
67 Wisconsin had appointed a commissioner to report on the disastrous 
ect of forest destruction. Two years later, Maine appointed a board of 
;n to report on a forest policy for the state. Shortly after this, laws 
couraging timber planting, either under bounty or exemption from 
les, were passed iti Iowa, Kansas, Wisconsin, Nebraska, New York, Missouri. 
Minnesota, Illjnois, North Dakota and Connecticut. The Federal 
Government then joined in this legislation, and the "Timber Culture 
was passed March 3, 1873. By this act the planting of timber on forty 
acres of land in treeless territory conferred title to 160 acres of public 
domain. Amendments to this act were made in 1876 and 1877, but, like 
the state laws, it had little effect; therefore, on account of the crude 
provision and lack of supervision, it was repealed March 3, 1891. It had 
already been much abused, and given rise to a great deal of fraud. Few 
of the claims that were planted with trees ever amounted to anything. 
During the first seven years after this act was passed, 38,000,000 acres 
had been entered as tree-claims. However, the passing of these acts waa 
an aid to forest culture, though the private interests of settlers in the 
treeless regions was a greater and more influencing factor. 

The establishment of Arbor Day, which was originated by J. Sterling 
Morton in 1872, did much to awaken public interest, especially in the 
treeless states. In the wooded states Arbor Day has a rather retarding </seg>

influence on forestry, as it leads people to think that the forester's tmsines8 
is only to plant trees, while, to a large extent, it is to care for the 
existing timber. 

I first association to advanr-e forestry interests was started at St. 
Minn., in 1876, by Leonard B. Hodges. This organization publiRhe&lt;l

Ization has been a great stimulus to forestry movements through 
Icial organ. "Forestry and Irrigation." This publication is. at the 
it time, the foremost advo-ate of the development of the unclaimed 
The following states now have associations: Maine, New Hampshire. 
Connecticut. New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, 
South Carolina. Ohio. Wisconsin, North Dakota, Colorado, Washington 
and Iowa. In recent years a number of states have appointed forest commissioners. 
These officers inquire into and report on a proper forest 
policy. In certain states these commissioners have become permanent 
parts of the state organizations. 

Laws regarding the protection of forest property have been enacted in 
nearly every state, but the efficient laws of this nature date from 1885. 
The inefficiency of the laws prior to this time arose chiefly from the lack 
of responsibility of carrying them out. New York was the first to recognize 
the need of official responsibility for the execution of the law, and therefore 
a force of firewardens was appointed throughout that state. Maine, 
New Hampshire. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota soon followed 
New York's example. At present Michigan. Wisconsin, Maine and Minnesota 
have the best fire laws, but the law of Minnesota is the most 
efficient in the Union. The state auditor is forest commissioner, and he 
appoints a deputy known as the chief firewarden who has charge of the 
firewarden service of the state. If the firewardens are unable to suppress 
a fire, deputies may be appointed. Tbe firewardens receive |2.00 a day 
when working. Penalties arc provided for willful, malicious, or careless 
setting of fires. 

In 1888 the American Forestry Association placed before Congress a bill 
providing for the withdrawal or entry or sale of all public timber lands 
unfit for agricultural uses. This failed to pass, but modifications were 
made from year to year, till in the Fifty-first Congress the following 
section was passed calling for the withdrawal of the "Timber Culture 
Act": Section 24: "The President of the United States may from time 
to time set apart and reserve in any state or territory having public lands 
bearing forests any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered 
with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or ' not, as 
public reservations, and the President shall by public proclamation declare 
the establishment of such reservations and limits thereof." 

Under this law, which was approved March 3, 1891, nearly 60,000,000 
acres of land have been set aside as Forest Reserves. When these reserves 
were being set aside, it became evident that some system of protection </seg>

            <seg id="p359">

and management must be inaugurated. In 1896 Secretary Smith of the 
Department of the Interior, impressed with this necessity, requested the 
National Academy of Sciences to investigate and report on a national 
forest policy for the United States.. He especially desired that, as far aa 
possible, the forests be managed in such a way as to exert the greatest 
influence on climate, soil and conservation of water. The commission 
gave a preliminary report in February, 1897, in which they recommended 
the creation of thirteen additional reserves. The whole number were 
proclaimed by President Cleveland. In May the commission submitted 
their complete report as Senate Document No. 10. A widespread discontent 
arose among cattle and sheep men on account of the curtailing 
of their grazing area. . They then succeeded in getting a bill through 
Congress in June, suspending all reservation made that year till March, 
1898. This bill provided our first system of forest administration by 
setting aside $150,000 for the survey of reserved land. Congress appropriated 
$300,000 yearly to care for the reserves. There are three grades 
of officials appointed, superintendents, supervisors and forest rangers. 
The superintendent has charge of a number of reservations, while supervisors 
and forest rangers are confined to a single reserve or a part of a 

The forestry work is now conducted under three sections of the government, 
namely: Division R and the Geological Survey of the Department 
of Interior and the Bureau of Forestry of the Department of Agriculture. 
The reserved land in the United States is about 8 per cent of the total 
land area, excluding Alaska. The Indian and Military reservations, reser 
voir sites, etc., set aside by the government, comprise an area of nearly 
twice that of the Forest Reserves. In 1898 there were about 159,0O0,«W 
acres in reserves; 83,500.000 of this was Indian reservations, nearly 
3,500,000 in national parks, and about 1,000,000 in military reservations. 
The Indian reservations are more or less in forests. The national parks 
are mostly wooded and probably will soon be managed under a forest 

Five years ago more than 50 per cent of the total area of the country 
was unreserved public land. Most of this is in the West where there Is 
estimated to be 125,000,000 acres of forest in reserved land. Almost all 
the best timber land of the country has passed from the government Into 
the hands of private individuals. The private forests exceed in area both 
the state and national reserves combined. 

The enormous consumption of forest products has made rapid inroads 
upon the private forest supply of timber. Recognizing that the treatment 
of private forests usually tends to destroy rather than increase their productivity, 
the Division of Forestry in 1S98 inaugurated the policy of 
co-operation with the owners of forest land. This was done in order to 
instruct private owners in the best methods of handling their property. 
The two points considered in giving advice are, the present interest of the 
owner, and, second, the protection and improvement of the forest. It has </seg>

been the aim in this co-operation to show that improved ways of handling 
timber land are advantageous both to the owner and the crop. It was 
thought that by assisting a few owners and publishing the results, it 
would be beneficial to the public at large.

extended to that of the establishing of forests. The reason for this

In this the plan of the government is to give expert advice and 
ire planting plans. 

The growing of forest trees for economic purposes can not be successfully 
undertaken without some knowledge of the habits of the species 
and their adaptability to the place where they are to be planted. The 
owner must know how and what to plant, as well as how to give bis trees 
the proper care after they begin to grow. Therefore we plainly see the 
need of expert advice in the establishmnt of forests. Although forests 
that have a protective value concern the state rather than the individual, 
our government does not exercise any control over forest land, whether 
protective or not, after it has passed into private hands. Trees require a 
long time to reach a marketable size, and in this country they are exceedingly 
liable to injury from fire and other causes, so it seems there is everywhere 
a strong inducement for the owner to cut all of his timber that is 
of any value. Even taxes are a great detriment to forestry, because the 
assessment is not made on the yearly productive capacity of the land, but 
on the standing crop of timber, thus the owner of timber land may pay 
tax for the last five to ten years before harvesting a crop. This tax may 
amount to as much as the increment of the forest in that period, and he 
has gained but little in allowing his timber to stand. In trying to develop 
S methods for carving out economic forestry principles, we have eony 
met such obstacles, but American ingenuity has gradually and 
etely overcome these obstructions, and our progress in the last 
;r of a century has been rapid. 

Rhave no considerable area of native forest in Nebraska; our work 
plant trees; let us insist that more of it be done. We can add a 
deal to the value of our farms by growing woodlots. We can make 
our homes more attractive by surrounding them with trees. We can 
beautify our towns and villages by placing small plantations of trees 
within them. May we become more energetic along these lines, but let 
us ever firmly adhere to our best knowledge of forestry principles, when 
we attempt to grow trees.. The next decade will call for greater progress 
in forestry than the last. There is little doubt but that our most sanguine 
expectations will be reached or even surpassed. We now have three wellestablished 
schools of forestry, and a number of institutions throughout 
ountry are adding forestry work to their curriculums.. The public 
will give more thought to the subject of forestry in the future, and forward 
movements will receive ready support. Our most earnest efforts must go 
to help diffuse the best forestry principles, for mistakes in forestry are 
not easily rectified. </seg>

PROPAGATION OF FOBE8T TREEK. 

PROPAGATION OF FOREHT TREES. 

E. F. STEPHENS. 

In the effort to develop trees for windbreaks, shelter and profit, mm 
knowledge of the best methods of growing trees from seeds may be useful 
to the planter, who has more time than money at his command. While 
the amateur, planting only a few seeds and growing a few thousands, cannot 
hope to grow trees as successfully or as cheaply as the commercial 
nurseryman, still the ability to grow trees from seeds, though it requires 
more labor, may ofttimes result profitably. The pleasure the tree lover 
finds in growing trees either in the seed bed, in the garden or in the 
forest, is ofttimes ample compensation for the work. 

General suggestions for the preparation of the soil will be useful in 
growing all the different varieties of seedlings. The soil should be carefully 
prepared; should be in as good condition as to tilth and fertility as 
a vegetable garden. It must be remembered that the seeds of some varieties 
of trees are so light and delicate as to require the most favorable conditions 
of soil and treatment. The nurseryman prepares the ground for 
all kinds of forest seedlings with as much care as a gardener gives his 
onion beds. To grow seedlings at a reasonable expense requires careful 
preparation of the soil, judicious planting of the seed and such after culture 
as will secure a perfect stand. 

There is a best time for procuring seeds of different varieties of forest 
trees. With those ripening In the spring and early summer, gathering 
and planting cannot be delayed. The seeds of the elm and maple must be 
collected as soon as ready and planted quickly or the seeds will perish. 
In attempting to grow seedlings of the elm, it should be considered that 
naturally the elm is found along the borders of streams. Ordinarily the 
seeds ripen in late April or May, fall upon a moist surface under the shade 
of the trees and. the seedlings naturally are not exposed to dry winds and 
blistering sun. Success in planting the elm requires that the tender seedlings 
shall be shaded until strong enough to withstand the conditions of 
our trying climate. It not infrequently happens that an excellent stand 
of elm seedlings growing in an unprotected nursery row, are destroyed by 
the hot sun and dry wind before the tiny plants have secured such leaf 
surface and root hold as will enable them to survive the trying conditions 
of Nebraska spring and summer. 

S Where the amount of seed planted is too small to warrant the trouble 
screening, something is gained by other protection. About the time 
ants are ready to appear above ground, protection may be given by covering 
the drill with fresh grass or clover or a sprinkling of green grain. 
The evaporation from this green covering increases the humidity of the 
atmosphere and affords some mechanical shelter. 

The soft maple is more easily grown than the elm, and does not require </seg>

such extreme care, still should the weather be very trying the first week 
after the plants appear above the surface, serious loss may result. Some 
shelter may be given by lightly covering the drills with fresh grass. This, 
however, is a suggestion for the amateur who is growing but a small number 
of seedlings, and can afford to give especial care. 

The nursery depends on quantity, on sowing the seeds thickly, that the 
plants may protect each other, and that even the loss of three-fourths of 
those started n-.ay still leave a fair stand. 

If the maple seed is of good quality, we would suggest planting forty to 
fifty seeds to the foot of the drill. Seed of the Russian mulberry ripens in 
June and July and runs 200,000 to the pound. It is secured by gathering 
the fruit, washing out the seeds and carefully drying them in the shade. 
While it has sometimes been planted in midsummer and plants grown the 
same season, this method is not recommended, since the season must be 
very favorable to secure even reasonable success. The ordinary method 
ts to carry it over until spring and then plant in the latter part of April 
or early days of May. 

Since the seed is very fine, it should be covered to a depth of not more 
than three-fourths of an inch to one inch. The soil should be preparedwith 
such extreme care and should be of such texture as will allow it to 
be prepared before planting in the finest condition of tilth. We would 
suggest to plant about 50 seeds to the foot of the drill. 

tieds of the box elder and ash-leaved maple ripen in September and 
iber. They should be gathered and planted in the month of November, 
later the better. Since box elder seed is ofttimes infested with insects 
quite frequently defective, it is wise to plant at least 50 to the drill 

P planting, cover to the depth of one inch, and then with a wheel hoe 
wo-horse cultivator, turn a little ridge of earth over the drill. The 
;t of ridging over is to prevent the soil crusting from the winter snow, 
so gives a ridge which can be broken by j-aking in early spring, giving 
assistance in early germination, and killing the weeds just starting. 

Ash seeds ripen in October and should be planted at the rate of twenty 
bushels of dry seed per acre, using the same method and care as with the 
box elder, and ridging over in the same manner. It will, doubtless, be 
found easier to -grow the seedlings of the ash than almost any other variety 
of forest trees. The nurseryman having planted twenty bushels of good 
seed per acre, regards 200,000 plants as a full stand. 

The catalpa speciosa grown from Northern seed should be found hardy 
as far north as Davenport. Iowa, and over the greater portion of eastern 
Nebraska. The seeds are borne in long pods. Naturally these pods remain 
on the trees until late April and early May, then burst open, and 
the feathery seeds are scattered by the wind. They run in the neighborhood 
of 20,000 to the pound. Plant at the season nature plants them, 
when the ground is beginning to warm. Plant three quarters to an inch 
in depth, 50 seeds or more to the foot of the drill, that the young seedlings 
may help to protect each other from the blighting sun and wind. </seg>

            <seg id="p363">
363 


Cultivation with all these varieties of seedlings should be as often as 
once a week, with such hand raking and weeding as may b« required in 
addition. 

Most varieties of nut bearing trees have long tap roots, and are also 
deficient in surface roots. They do not transplant with the same readiness 
and success as the ash. catalpa and maple. Since they do not, it is ofttimes 
wise to plant the nuts in ground where they are to remain and be 
grown into trees. Should nuts of most varieties be allowed to become dry 
before planting, they may not germinate. In natural forests they fall 
upon moist ground, and nature covers them with leaves to retain moisture 
and insure germination. 

Sis wise to gather walnuts while they still have the protection of the 
i husk. It is an advantage to plant these nuts before they are allowed 
7, covering in moist, well prepared soil to a depth of two inches, 
•e it is not practicable to plant in the fall of the year, they may be 
sd in moist sand in the seed bed and carried over until spring. It la 
possible to grow walnuts thickly in seed beds and to transplant them 
e age of one year. 

Bory nuts should be planted in the fall of the year before the meat 
shells has become dry. They may be stratified in damp sand if pre- 

Should chestnuts dry they are not likely to germinate. The fact that 
many thousands of chestnut trees have been planted in Nebraska, while 
growing trees are very rarely seen, would Indicate that the soil and climate 
of Nebraska are not well suited to this variety. 

The cultivation of seedlings of all kinds during the first year should be 
so frequent and thorough as to conserve needed moisture and stimulate 
vigorous growth. Most seedlings are large enough at the end of the first 
season to transplant readily into the permanent plantation. Those of the 
catalpa and mulberry are not ordinarily hardy enough to be allowed to 
remain over winter in the nursery row without protection. The nurseryman, 
therefore, late in October or early November, using a digger suited to 
the purpose, cuts under the rows, pulls the plants, grades and buries them 
in earth over winter. 

Bwise to spread a foot of straw on the beds, and over this straw two 
of soil. This gives the young seedlings suitable protection for the 
. after which all varieties discussed in this article are hardy enough 
ui Nebraska winters. 

When transplanting seedlings into the permanent plantation, the ground 
should be carefully prepared, and in better tilth than is usual for a corn 
field. There is no objection to planting the first spring after breaking the 
ground. The additional labor needed to prepare sod land for planting 
is more than offset by the lessened expense of cultivation; because of 
fewer weeds to contend with. 

On contract work the writer has often broken the sod plowed to double 
depth; thoroughly disked and harrowed, and planted forest seedlings the </seg>

            <seg id="p364">

Eeek the breaking was done, with entire success. In a day's time 
any Nebraska sod can be put in suitable condition for planting. 
3, however, less work required to secure proper tilth when using 
it has been under cultivation one or more years. 

The most convenient method to transplant is to mark out the land for 
the proposed grove with a corn-marker, planting the trees 4x4 behind the 
spade. Each acre, therefore, requires about 2,700 trees. We found in 
our contract work, planting something over seven millions of trees, that 
an active workman, after he had gained a little experience could plant 
an acre a day. It is very important to plant seedlings three inches deeper 
than they grew in the nursery row. It Is also of the utmost importance 
that the earth should be tramped compactly about the roots of the seedlings. 
We have often noted that the trees which did not grow were 
planted by some unskillful workman who slighted his work in an effort to 
keep up with the others. Careful preparation of the soil, solid planting, 
frequent and clean cultivation should secure a stand of at least 95 per 

The object in planting 4x4 is twofold: First, by the time the trees 
get too tall to cultivate with a two-horse cultivator, they should be 
large enough and leafy enough to shade out the weeds. Secondly, in a 
natural state, young timber grows thickly. In this way the trees are 
compelled to grow taller for air and light. Before the seedlings have 
exhausted the limit of soil moisture, it will be necessary to commence 
thinning the plantation. By the time they are 2 to 2K inches in diameter 
it will be advantageous to thin first one way, leaving them 4x8, and 
later, the other way, leaving them 8x8. In fifteen or twenty years it 
may be necessary to thin again. In this way no more timber is allowed 
to stand on the ground than can be supported by the available soil 
moisture. Surface rooted trees like the cottonwood, box elder and soft 
maple must have more room than trees which root deeply like the ash. 

In small plantations intended for windbreaks very great assistance 
will be given to the grove after cultivation ceases by heavily mulching 
with straw. This straw should be renewed as often as it decays. In 
this way land can be made to support a denser growth and produce 

a more effective windbreak. Careful observation of the foliage of the 
plantation will indicate when it is suffering from lack of soil moisture 
and what percentage of the trees to remove. </seg>

FORESTRY AND ITS EFFECT ON WESTERN CLIMATE. 

(Address of H. C. Price, Professor of Horticulture and Forestry In Iowa 

Agricultural College, before the Iowa State Parks and Forestry Asso- 

ciation.) 

The value of a forest planting is two-fold: first, as a protection, and 
second, as a source of income. The former I regard as the more important 
for the greater part of Iowa. If our forests were to be planted simply as 
a source of income we could ill afford to plant on our richer lands, worth 
$60 to $75 per acre, and expect to compete with forests grown on land 
equally well adapted to their growth In neighboring states, and worth only 
$15 to $20 per acre. 

Bat the commercial value of timber produced by a forest is not Its only 
value by any means, and although Iowa has such rich land and it is so 
valuable, nevertheless she can well afford to devote a portion of every 
farm to forestry, and it may prove one of the most valuable features on 
the farm. The average size of the farms of the state, according to the last 
census. Is 154 acres, and I believe that every farm containing 160 acres of 
land would be more valuable if it had ten acres of it planted to forest 
trees, and there are some farms that would be more valuable If they had 
15a of the 160 acres in forests. 

Forests serve as a protection, first, from severe winds; second, from 
floods; third, from drouths, and fourth, from extremes of temperature. 

The protection that is afforded by a forest planting (and under this I 
nclude windbreaks, shelter belts and groves) from severe winds is appreiated 
by everyone. Not only does planting of trees afford immediate proection 
to the areas to the leeward, but the force of the strong winds is 
roken. A wind, striking a forest or planting every quarter of a mile, 
cannot gather anything like the force that it would have if it had com* 
or ten miles unbroken. Simply as a modifier of climate by protection 
rom winds. I believe windbreaks and shelter belts will pay for themselves 
n prairie farms. I believe the actual protection afforded by a good plantng 
and the saving in fuel and feed is seldom realized. There is nothing 
larder on stock than to be exposed to a hard, cold, west wind, and yet 
lere are thousands of feeders, feeding under such conditions every winer, 
when by the planting of a good windbreak or shelter belt their stock 
might be protected. Governor Bailey of Kansas a few years ago in speaking 
of a windbreak on his ranch said that it was planted by his father 
from seedlings less than twelve inches high, and that an old gentleman, 
a neighbor, in passing by, laughed at his father, saying that his grandsons 
might live to see the trees grow of good size If his grandsons lived to an 
old age. At the time Governor Bailey was telling It he said the trees were 
about twenty feet high, and the old gentleman who had made the predic- </seg>

¦I each year, and Governor Bailey said that all of the stockmen in 
on said that he could fatten much quicker than they could, and on 
i. He attributed this to the protection afforded by his trees, and 
Lt during a "norther" his cattle could often be seen lying down in 
Her of the trees while his neighbors' were huddled together or 
; around to keep warm. 

Forest plantings will protect not only from the cold winds of winter but 
also from the hot winds of summer which come sometimes like the blasts 
of a fiery furnace. 

Forests serve as a protection from sudden rise of high water and serve 
to equalize the flow of water in the rivers and streams. The trees and 
their leaves which fall to the ground serve as a mulch to check the flow 
of water over the ground, and act as a sponge to take it up. On hillsides 
the water will run off in a few hours from grass land or plowed ground, 
but the same amount falling on forest land, will be held and given up 
gradually. The high waters that follow heavy rains in our eastern states 
and the drying up of streams in time of drouths is due to the cutting 
away of the forests. If the steep portions of each farm could be planted 
to trees it would equalize the flow of the water in our streams and prevent 
the washing of our farm lands. 

It is a popular belief that there is a close relationship between the 
amount of forest in a country and the rainfall of the country. That is, the 
rainfall may be decreased by cutting away the forests or increased by adding 
to the plantings. There is no question that there is a greater amount 
of rainfall where there is a large amount of forests, but the question is as to 
which is cause and which is effect. Are there forests because there is rainfall 
or rainfall because there are forests? A study of the map of the 
United States in relation to the distribution of forests will show that the 
areas having the heaviest forests are those having the largest amount of 
annual rainfall. For example, on the Pacific coast where the rainfall 
amounts to 60 or 70 inches each year the densest forests are to be found, 
while in the subarid regions with a rainfall of only 15 to 20 inches each 
year the forest growth is almost absent. The records of the United States 
Weather Bureau do not show any depreciation in the amount of rainfall 
in areas that have been deforested. If we had grown settled in our belief 
that our rainfall was growing less each year on account of the cutting 
away of forest lands, the experience of last summer's floods would certainly 
unsettle our convictions. Professor Fernow, in his recent work on 
the Economics of Forestry, in speaking of this question says: "The tendency 
of a forest growth would be, on account of its cooling effect, to keep 
the air within and to some extent above it nearer saturation, and as a 
consequence it might occur that moisture bearing currents passing over 
would precipitate their moisture more readily above or near the forest 
growth. Whether they do is still doubtful, and, indeed, to make an apable 
difference in the amount of rainfall it would appear that the </seg>

FORESTRY AND ITS EFFECT ON WKSTEBN CLIMATE. 

Although it is an open question whether forests actually increase the 
amount of rainfall, yet there Is one way in which they do exert an influence 
to check drouths, namely, the checking of evaporation from the 
soil. It is a well known fact that the rate of evaporation from a surface 
Ends upon the velocity of the air passing over it. If we perspire freely 
then sit down in a draft of air we know how quickly we feel cold, 
to the rapid evaporation of the perspiration. 

In some experiments made by Professor King of the Department of Agriculture 
in determining the influence of windbreaks on lessening the evaporation 
from the surface of a bare field, he found that the evaporation to 
the leeward of an oak grove, 15 to 20 feet high, was 25 per cent greater 
300 feet to the leeward of the planting than at 20 feet to the leeward. 
Approximately it may be said that a planting will affect the evaporation, 
to the leeward one rod for every foot in height of the trees. That is. a 
windbreak 40 feet high will check the evaporation to the leeward for 
40 rods. Although trees do take up the moisture from the ground immediately 
under them to such an extent that crops cannot be grown, yet 
I believe that the influence that they exert on the evaporation of the land 
to their leeward far more than counterbalances the loss immediately 
under them. The protection thus afforded from drouths will be in proportion 
to the amount of wind, and in our prairie states we find it a much 
more important consideration than on broken country. 

Tree growth equalizes temperature. A forest is cooler in summer and 
warmer in winter than the open prairie. In the same way a forest planting 
affects climate. In the daytime trees protect the ground from the 
sun's rays and the ground is cooler than where exposed. At night the 
trees check the radiation of heat from the ground and equalize the temperature 
of the soil and the air under the tree and also in the immediate 
vicinity. Aside from this fact of equalizing temperature by protecting 
from the sun's rays and checking radiation of heat from the soil, the protection 
from trees afforded from winds serves to equalize temperature and 
to protect from extremes of temperature. So much for the influence of 
trees on climate. Prom what has been said it would seem that if the 
greatest amount of protection is to be secured from a planting it should 
be distributed over the farm in strips rather than in one body. What is 
a practical way of doing this, is a question that will arise in the mind of 
everyone who has a farm to plant. I believe that it may be done in a way 
that will not take up as much ground as it would if planted in one body, 
and at the same time prove a more profitable investment. 

Ie", for example, a quarter section which is 160 rods square and 
a strip 25 feet wide all around it and then a strip the same width 
ih the middle each way. That would divide it into four forty acre 
. planted on all sides. This -would make a total strip of 960 rods 
ind 1% rods wide, which is 1,440 square rods, or nine acres. This 
take up land that would partly be given up to fence rows, and nine 
could not be taken on the farm that would be less appreciated. On a </seg>

strip 26 feet wide six rows of trees might be planted, 5 feet apart, and if 
the trees are planted 4 feet apart in the row it would take 23,760 trees to 
plant the entire strip. I believe that the producing value of the land 
would be increased by having every forty acres surrounded by trees, and 
at the same time have approximately 24,000 trees that are growing into 
money each year. It is a paying proposition from a financial standpoint, 
to say nothing of the benefit to the country and the beauty it adds to the 

¦e this method of tree planting can scarcely be called forestry, but 
shelter belt planting, yet it is the kind that is best adapted to our 
iirie soils, and I believe it can be made profitable on any parm, and 

marked influence could be produced on our western climate. </seg>

WATEB SUPPLY OF NEBK

THE WATER SUPPLY OF NEBRASKA. 

(Address of J. C. Stevens, Assistant Secretary State Board of Irrigation, 
before that body at its annual meeting.) 

Kdy of the water supply of Nebraska and of the uses to which this 
has been put, leads one to the conclusion that the development of 
ource is still in its primitive state. 

The lands drained by the North Platte river and its tributaries have 
undoubtedly received the greatest attention, and from an agricultural 
point of view have reached the highest state of development of any within 
the state. But there are yet large areas of arable lands now used for 
grazing, and some hardly fit for that, that need only the application of 
water that yearly goes to waste, to make them immensely productive. 

This river, rising as it does in the northern part of the range of the 
Rocky mountains of Colorado, and flowing in a northerly course across 
nearly half of the state of Wyoming, thence bending to the east and 
south, is fed throughout its course by numerous mountain streams, receiving 
their waters from the melting snows. 

Whenever, as in the last two or three years, there is a scarcity of winter 
snows in the mountains, a like diminution in the flow of this stream is 
plainly evident. Inspection of diagram published in the Fourth Biennial 
Report of the State Board of Irrigation, shows this at a glance. During 
the present winter, if reports are true, there has been abundant snow in 
the mountain regions so that for the coming summer we may safely 
predict a large increase in the discharge of the North Platte river. 

Rnext question that presents itself is the conservation of this supply, 
natural course of things, this stream furnishes its greatest amount 
er before the crops in the valleys are ready for its application. The 
greatest floods occur in May and June, when water is in little demand, 
and there is plenty and to spare for everyone; but in August and early 
September, when the application of a little water would aid so materially 
in the maturing of these valuable crops, there is none to be had. What 
water may reach Nebraska is soon lost in its transit through the sandy 
river bed. Now what is needed to equalize this flow and make the supply 
vailable when most needed, are impounding reservoirs in Eastern 
Wyoming of sufficient capacity to hold the flood waters of the spring till 
uch times as they are most needed. A calculation of the probable capacity 
f such a reservoir based on the results of the U. S. G. S. reports of the 
aily flow of this river for the six years previous to 1901, show that in 
rder to utilize the entire supply, and make it available when needed, 
hould have a storage capacity of 2,300,000 acre feet, or water enough to 
cover two entire townships to a uniform depth of 50 feet. Such a single 
reservoir site does not exist, but a series of sites may be found that may 
e made available only by the outlay of an immense amount of capital. </seg>

and this the federal government 'must take in hand in order to insure 

K South Platte is in many respects similar to the North Platte. exit 
it goes dry much earlier in the season. The lands contiguous to 
-earn are capable of excellent cultivation; most of its waters, flood 
and all, however, are appropriated for irrigation purposes in 
lo, so that it is of little value to the Nebraska irrigator. 

Similar in many respects to the two Plattes is the Republican river, 
draining the southern portion of the state, though the period during which 
the surface flow is extinct is of much shorter duration, and it not infrequently 
happens that water is found throughout most of Its course during 
the entire season. Yet the value of this stream may be greatly increased 
by storing the flood waters. A measurement of the river at Superior 
during the flood in July of the past year showed a discharge of nearly 
15,000,000 cubic feet per second, while another in September of the same 
year gave a discharge of 154. These are the maximum and minimum 
measurements for 1902. 

The streams heretofore mentioned show that during some seasons an 
infinite ratio exists between the maximum and minimum discharge. But 
now we come to a river where these conditions do not exist. I refer to 
the Loup in which this ratio is sometimes as low as 1*4 for the season 
and seldom reaching above 4. The lowest actual measurement made on 
this river since continuous records were begun in 1895 was at Columbus 
in July, 1901, which showed a discharge of 1211 second feet. The greatest 
amount similarly found at the same station was on August 10, 1902, 
giving a discharge of 7685 cubic feet per second. The ratio of this maximum 
to minimum for the extremes in eight years is 6.34. The exceptional 
uniformity in the flow of this river is nicely illustrated in a diagram 
published in the Fourth Biennial Report of the State Board of Irrigation, 
entitled "Nebraska and Colorado Streams, Comparative Mean Discharges 
for Six Years, 1895 to 1900 Inclusive," showing at a glance the means for 
the six years of the mean daily discharges for the months of April, May, 
June, July, August, September and October of the Loup at Columbus, 
North Plate at Camp Clarke, Arkansas at Canon City and the Cache La 
Poudre at Fort Collins. The agricultural district in the neighborhood of 
Greely, Colo., depending entirely upon the Poudre river for its water supply, 
has a world-wide reputation. What the possibilities for development 
along this line in the water-shed of the Loup river with nearly three and 
one-half times as much water and a unifomity of flow, that it is not excelled 
by any other river in the country, can only be imagined. Extensive 
surveys have been made for the utilization of the waters of this 
stream for power purposes, and we are undoubtedly living in a period 
that will see the construction and operation of some of these plants. 

Kin importance, I would name the Niobrara river, draining the 
Btern part of the state and emptying its waters into the Missouri.

agricultural purposes as the southern and eastern parts of the state. 
The country is rough and heavily rolling and the river banks are high, 
so that although it has a discharge, measured at Valentine, of from 800 to 
1200 cubic feet per second, and is remarkably uniform in its flow, Irrigation 
throughout a large portion of its course is impracticable. It has, 
however, a heavy fall. Surveys made near its mouth show a fall of over 
10 feet to the mile, so that the condition on this river makes It principally

PROGRESS OF IRRIGATION IN NEBRASKA. 

(Address of Hon. A. G. Wolfenbarger, president of Nebraska Irrigation 
Association, before the late meeting of the Association.) 

I assemble in annual convention and conference after a lapse of more 
the regular term, and it has been deemed a matter of great imlce 
that this Asociation, which was the pioneer of practical irrigation 
broadest and most comprehensive view, should again take up educaand 
promotive work looking to the material, economic and general 
re of our great commonwealth. 

Ee we last met congress has passed an important act providing for 
il aid, and to a limited extent, national supervision along certain 
if irrigation. But this only increases the importance and urgency 
ntaining our organization and keeping it in step and touch with the 
ss of our day. 

This new national enactment calls for a most careful analysis and consideration 
on the part of our committee on legislation, and it is the hope 
of your president that this new committee will be selected with great care 
and with especial reference to the fitness and ability of its members to 
grasp in a timely manner the vital problems that confront our people in 
assisting in the wise administration of the present law, and in suggesting 
and urging necessary amendments, which are practically certain to be 
needed as time progresses. 

Irrigation, although practiced in the great West for more than a third of 
a century, may be still truthfully said to be in its infancy. Only a small 
proportion of the waters available for irrigation purposes have as yet been 
applied to beneficial use. Uncounted millions of cubic feet of storm and 
flood waters pass over the surfaces of our soil, carrying with it more or 
less of injury and destruction, before it reaches the Gulf, and the present </seg>

generation and its successor owes it to civilization to see that man utilizes 
his great opportunity in turning this great force of nature into an engine 
for his advancement, protection and legitimate enjoyment. 

Our present law is poorly understood, and in fact remains uninterpreted 
by our supreme court, with conflicting decisions pending on appeal or 
error from the district courts of our state. In certain sections of western 
Nebraska the right of prior appropriators is wholly ignored and confusion 
and dissatisfaction exist among many who have staked their all 
on the promises of protection held out by our present and antecedent statutes. 
It is hoped that the atmosphere will soon be cleared, and a broad 
and comprehensive policy — as broad and comprehensive as the statute and 
our constitution will permit — will be adopted and declared by the expounders 
of our law. 

Irrigation in our state presents a most promising outlook to the man 
who is ready to be reasonable, diligent, studious and patient. The man 
who undertakes to irrigate too much land with too little water will always 
be disappointed. The man who undertakes to Irrigate his land with 
water which rightfully belongs to his neighbor will ultimately come to 
grief. But he who realizes the value of priority of appropriation, consummated 
and vested by beneficial application of the water to the soil, and 
who has the courage to go forward until he has made a success of his 
undertaking, will not know defeat. 

P cannot at this time discuss the various branches and methods, but it 
been demonstrated by William A. Sharpnack of Harlan county during 
past two years that the cultivation of sugar beets by irrigation will 
yield a net profit of over $90 to $110 per acre per year. This he has 
demonstrated by two years of cultivation of thirteen acres of land irrigated 
from a small private plant. A well known farmer in Scott's Bluff 
county, in 1902, marketed $700 worth of potatoes from two acres of irrigated 
land. A cattle rancher about forty miles south of Brush, Colo., 
produced on a little truck patch containing less than one-half acre, over 
$129 worth of miscellaneous garden vegetables by irrigation from a windmill 
plant, the storage reservoir of which did not cost to exceed $23. 

Our people need to learn that on thousands of farms there are opportunities 
to construct and put into operation small irrigation plants, which 
would increase the value of farm products over $100 to $300 per year to 
the farmer putting in such a plant, and in the aggregate the increased 
value of agricultural production in our state would amount to, at a safe 
estimate, over two million dollars. 

Bting and believing that this meeting will result in reviving interest 
vital subject I cast the burden of duty upon everyone present and 
your aid in placing our organization in its rightful place at the 
r the procession which is marching steadily to the goal of success. </seg>

THE VALUE OF CAI 

THE VALUE OF CAPONS AND CAPONIZIN(i. 

(Address of Wm. G. Unitt, Seward, Neb., before the State Poultry Asao- 

ciation.) 

Eion bears the same relation to a cockerel that a steer does to a bull : 
castrated rooster. But a capon is more quiet, relatively, than is a 
i compared with a bull, lays on much flesh and fat and remains 
tender for many months. They will weigh from 60 to 75 per cent more 
than a rooster of the same age, and in eastern markets will bring from 
20 to 30 cents per pound. The comb and wattles do not grow after the 
operation of caponizlng, if done before they become very prominent. But 
in some cases it is the practice to cut off the comb and wattles. The 
feathers of the neck and saddle grow very long and glossy. A capon does 
not care for the hens, nor crow, nor fight. But they will make the finest 
of mothers for chickens. 

If in the operation you do not succeed in removing all of the testicle, it 
will in course of time develop into a very large size and will be found to 
contain water. Such a bird is known as a slip. F. L. Washburn in Oregon 
Experiment Station Bulletin No. 31 says: "A slip gains flesh and fat and 
better flesh than a rooster. But in three or four months after the operation, 
the comb and wattles grow, the bird develops a crow and chases the 
hens worse than a cockerel. I would advise a person to kill such birds If 
he has any, as they are a great bother upon a poultry farm. In some 
Ei they will bring as much money as a capon of the same weight. But 
person is careful in doing the operation there will be no slips to put 
the market." 

It has been asked by several, is the operation cruel? It is no more cruel 
than performing the same kind of an operation upon pigs, colts, and 
calves. It does not take long to perform the operation, and the birds will 
begin to eat directly after being released from the caponizing board. I 
would advise a person to operate upon a few dead birds first, so as to 
become familiar with the appearance and position of the testicles. A person 
can use any of the large breeds and secure some very nice capons. 
b birds that you wish to caponize should be fasted 24 to 36 hours before 
&gt;peration; they should be fed very lightly the first day or two after 
&gt;pe ration. 

R operation, as I have said before is not difficult. The only difficulty 
-ator will have is in tearing open the lining between the two testithis 
thin membrane contains arteries, and if you should rupture 
these your bird is lost. But he is just as good to eat as if you had 
beheaded him. After the operation he should be put in a pen where there 
are no perches, as flying up to them will tear open the wound. The wound 
heals up in a few days. In some cases there will be "wind puffs" formed 
</seg>
            <seg id="p374">

after the wound heals. That is caused by the air that has got under the 
skin. When you notice this all that is necessary will be to puncture it 
with a large needle and let the air out. The birds are generally in condition 
to run with the flock within three days after the operation. 

Eeat care must be taken not to let any dirt or bits of feathers fall into 
cavity when operating. The sunlight is a great help in performing 
kind of an operation. The incision is made between the first and 
id rib from the hip and great care should be taken not to go too near 
backbone. 

Does it pay to raise capons? Every person that has had any experience 
with them will acknowledge that it pays well to raise capons. If a 
farmer is asked why he does not raise them, he generally answers that 
he cannot, or has not nerve enough to caponize. Such persons should follow 
the example of a lady who once wrote for W. H. Wigmore's patent 
caponizing set and instructions, as follows: "Dear Sir — After receiving 
your patent set I read the instructions over several times and then operated 
upon four dead cockerels. I then tried to cut a live one, but could 
not. I took up the knife and laid it down several times. At last my 
nervourness all left me and I made my first incision upon the live cockerel. 
The following two days I caponized 120 cockerels and lost but three, besides 
attending to my other work." According to Mr. Wigmore this lady 
would have 120 cockerels weighing 4 pounds each or 480 pounds at eight 
months old and sell them at 13 cents per pound, which would net her 
f62.40. If they were caponized, they would weigh 6 pounds each M 
pounds at 8 months old, and would sell for 18 cents per pound or $129.60. 
By this you can see that she made over 100 per cent profit over the 
rels. 

Mr. Wigmore also relates the following: "Mr. Blake of Cardington. 
Ohio, caponized 22 roosters without losing one. They did well and 
averaged lO'.j pounds dressed. He sent them to the New York market 
and they sold for 21 cents per pound, or $48.50. After deducting all of the 
expenses the lot netted him $43.75. These same birds if not caponized. 
would have weighed but seven pounds each, and, sold in the same market, 
for 15 cents per pound, would have brought but $23.10, without deducting 

I have related other persons' experience and will now give you my own. 
I caponized 16 last summer, losing but two. I had never performed any of 
this work myself, but had seen some of it done while attending the School 
of Agriculture last year, and decided to do some of the work at home the 
following summer. At the present time I have but ten of the capons left. 
as 4 were killed last fall. The capons average 7 pounds each and I was 
offered 13 cents per pound for them, which would net me $9.10. Now. ff 
I had sold them as young roosters they would have weighed but four 
pounds each and sold at 7 cents per yound. or $2.80. So now you can see 
that it pays to raise capons. I kept out one rooster from the same flock 
as the capons to use as a comparison. He weighs but a little over four </seg>

pounds. He has the same feed and care, but be is not as quiet as the 

The principal points to observe when canonizing are as follows: 

1. The fowls should be atout ten weeks old. 

2. They should be fasted long enough so they will be empty, for in that 
way you will have no trouble in finding the testicles. 

3. It will be found most convenient to make the incision between the 
first and second rib from the hip. Do not make it between the third and 
fourth rib, for you are sure to strike the lung cavity. Be careful not to 
go too near the backbone for fear you might rupture a blood vessel or 
puncture other organs. Take plenty of pains in finding the second 

The operation of caponizing is neither dangerous nor difficult, and does 
not take long to perform. If the precautions noted are taken into consideration 
you will no doubt have good success. </seg>

WHY DOES THE BOY BECOME DISSATISFIED WITH 
THE FARM? 

(Address by Mr. G. Babson, of Seward, Neb., before the Farmers, Institute 
held at Tamora, Neb.) 

Kibject Is an assumption that I think it will be unnecessary for me 
your time to prove, for is it not the experience of the majority of 
and mothers that as soon as their boy begins to arrive at manestate, 
and often earlier, he manifests a very strong desire to 
ie farm and seek something more congenial? 

It is undoubtedly true that there Is a tendency among humanity to congregate 
in cities. Han is a social animal and seems to derive a certain 
pleasure in being jostled by the crowd, even when there is not one to give 
him the nod of recognition. He soon seems to get used to it, and if he has 
any grudge against the conditions, he works it out on his next door neightwho 
belongs to the great army that are constantly marching from the 
try to the city. 

Bboy on the farm sees his old schoolmate return from the city on a 
m. He wears better clothes, or at last more stylish ones, he tells of 
Batres and pleasures of the city, and the boy who has had secret 
;b for the city now plainly becomes dissatisfied. 

K colts he has raised and been very proud of have lost their beauty, 
•8 interest in his work, he compares the conditions that exist on 
m with that rosy picture of life In the city and he becomes disd. 


In a little while he, too, will Join that great army marching to the city 
and we have lost our boy. In spite of the fact that he will find that he has 
to sleep in a 7x9 room, live on a scanty fare, such as he never knew at 
home, work all day by gaslight in a cellar or some equally unattractive 
place, and the only kind of weather he will know of is that it rains or. 
don't rain, in spite of these discomforts and many more he compares the 
drudgery of the farm, where he was awakened before light to do the 
chores, and remembers how tired he was when the evening chores were 
done, how few pleasures of any kind he had at home, and he stays in the 
city. Father and mother miss their boy, and he often thinks of home and 
mother, but with the thought of home is the thought of the long weary 
days of work, work, work, with little or no recreation, and no positive 

We will now leave the general tendency of people to crowd together, and 
we will examine some of the specific causes that caused the boy to become 
dissatisfied with the farm. I will assert, without fear of contradiction, 
that nineteen fathers out of twenty forget that they were ever boys themselves, 
and of the pleasures they got from their boyish treasures and </seg>

            <seg id="p377">
377 


sports. They now insist on looking on their boyhood days as being a 
period of their foolishness, and a thing not be repeated in their children. 

About fifteen years ago I was calling on a farmer of Seward county, in 
a business way. His boy of say six or eight years was playing on the 
sunny side of the house with a box of wheels, spools and cords, and, so 
Intent was he on his work that he didn't hear his father call for a basket 
of cobs. Instead of a second call the father took the basket, himself, and 
got the cobs, but went out of his way to give the box a kick, which demolished 
it and destroyed what the little boy had worked for days to 
make. I can remember how that little boy looked as he gathered up that 
hopeless wreck, and how he sobbed as he thought that the machine he waa 
making was destroyed forever. This boy had worked for days in getting 
these wheels together, and although he was working probably at an Impossible 
machine, his father's thoughtlessness and forgetfulness that he 
was ever a boy, and had found pleasure, and I may say profit. In making 
Just such machines, was undoubtedly the prime cause of the boy leaving 
the farm at the first opportunity. I may here add that this boy is now 
a locomotive engineer on one of the eastern roads. 

The boy on the farm seldom gets any time he can really call his own. 
He is called early in the morning to do the chores, and after a hard day's 
work with an old plow or cultivator, that neither the father nor hired hand 
would use, and probably some severe reprimands from the father because 
he has not done good work, he is only too glad to get to bed and rest his 
aching legs and forget his troubles in sleep. How often does the father, 
after giving his boy of ten or twelve the old and condemned tools and a 
team that no one else would use and whose only recommendation for a 
boy team is that it is safe, discourage his boy by telling him what he used 
to do when he was his age. "Oh, yes," he used to do just as good work 
then as now," and more of it. But, boys, you know all about that, don't 
you? As a side remark I will say to the boys here, for your encouragement, 
that your father has probably let his imagination run riot, and 
that he could no more do the impossible than can you, but In charity for 
father try and think, boys, that father has told these stories until he 
really believes them himself. 

A few years ago I wished to see a farmer and found him and his son 
in the field plowing corn. The man had a .new riding cultivator, and the 
boy, who was about ten or twelve years old, had the old one, which could 
only be forced into the ground by riding the handles. As the boy came up 
the furrow, sweating and puffing, and as I had not finished my business, 
I suggested that the boy take a round with the new rider, and the father 
very unwillingly assented. I adjusted the cultivator for the boy and he 
made a round, doing, as his father admitted, as good work as he could do. 
I had quite a talk with the father and as a result the boy got a new 
cultivator, and the father must have been pleased with the experiment, for 
the next spring he told me to make a new harness for the boy, just as he 
wanted it, and boasted that Charley could do as much work as he. Since </seg>

then they have bought all their machinery together, and now the boy. 
who is taller and stouter than his father, takes the hardest part of the 
work and seems perfectly contented with the farm. 

Now, when you see your boy getting weary and restless on the farm, 
don't cuss him and tell him how much harder you had to work, and how 
much smarter you were, first, because it probably isn't true, and second, 
it won't do any good. Recall the times, when you were a boy and felt you 
were dissatisfied, you thought you had real grievances, and probably think 
so yet. Put yourself in the boy's place and see if you can't make the 
work pleasanter. Try and get the boy's confidence and consult him in 
reference to matters on the farm. Take his suggestions when you can. 
and make him feel that he is of some account. Interest him in his work. 
The boy who has by force been compelled to do all the drudgery of the 
farm grows stronger year by year. It is with secret pleasure that he 
finds he can lift more or do more work than the old man ( for that is what 
he has learned to call his father by this time). 

He don't say much, but he now does about as he pleases, and he goes to 
town and comes back when he gets ready. A mother's anxiety and a 
father's threats have no effect on him, except that they are disagreeable, 
and to avoid both he just "gets out." The boy has left the farm, and why? 

In my mind's eye, as I read this paper, I can see the good mother look 
over to father, with a look that plainly says: "John, I always knew it 
was your fault that Charley left the farm." But, mother, I have a word 
for you. too. You have been a good mother at heart, and you wonder what 
fault I can find with you. Why. the earliest recollection of almost every 
boy is the association of his mother's voice, pitched in a rather high key: 
"Now. Charley, don't make so much noise; you had better go outdoors if 
you are going to be so noisy," and as the boy must make noise he goes, 
and not wishing to give his mother any more trouble he stays out as long 
as he can, and returns only to hear about the mud he is tracking on the 
new carpet. Now the mother meant well and the boy meant well, he was 
only living his boy's nature, and mother's sharp words hurt just the same. 
I will admit that a boy is a trial, but he is also a trust. He did not come 
into this world because it was his choice, but he is here all the same, and 
let us make all we can out of him. 

w this boy has one or two sisters, whom he is all the time compared 
with, to his disadvantage. He must always give up to his sister, if she is 
older because she is older, and if younger he is told it is because she is 
younger. The boy gets the short end all the time. Sister always has lots 
of new clothes; in fact, she is dressed far better than mother, while the 
boy wears father's cast-off clothes made over, and when the family goes 
to town he is left at home, because his mother says "he has no clothes fit 
to be seen." A little later mother insists on sister having a piano and 
three hundred dollars goes into a piano for sister, and she goes to town 
every week for lessons. 

The boy has a little musical taste, too, and he wants a horn, but he </seg>

            <seg id="p379">
WHY THE BOY IS DISSATISFIED WITH THE FARM. 

379 

don't get it. Mother holds up her hands in holy horror and says a horn 
would drive Her crazy, and father assures her that she need not worry aa 
money is not so plentiful that he could spare ten dollars for a horn. 
Sister has her girl friends come and spend the afternoon and stay to 
supper. If supper is an early one, and they have not gone before the boy 
gets in, mother says: "Charley must wait, as his clothes are so dirty." 
In any case he gets what is left — "short end" again. 

Kht extend this comparison to any length, but your time is valuable, 
however, give you an illustration that you will recognize has at 
e elements of truth, even if you can"t locate the house I refer to. 

Emany years ago I was out in the country and took dinner with one 
customers, who had prospered, largely by the labor of three good stalboys, 
and had that year put up a new two-story house, moving the 
and a half shell that had been the home for many years, up to the 
for an addition. 

S naturally talked about the new house, and after dinner the good 
r wanted me to see her nice things, and she took me over the house, 
the new carpets, the piano, the pictures, and all those things a 
n prizes. On my admiring a certain picture she wished me to go upto 
see some pictures in her daughter's room, and really they were 
This room was fitted up almost like a little palace, having everything 
o make it pleasant. Then I went to the parents' room, and the spare 
both of which were finely furnished. 

Just then it occurred to me that I had not seen the boys' room, and I 
said, "Where do the boys sleep?" and the mother pointed to a door I had 
seen her shut as we came upstairs, leading to the attic of the old house. 
Here my curiosity got the better of my politeness, perhaps, and I pushed 
open the door and looked in. It was not a large room and in it was a 
double and a single bed, there being just room enough between the beds to 
squeeze through. There was no carpet, and the cottonwood boards, of 
which the floor was made, were very uneven. The double bed was undoubtedly 
the bed that had done service from the time of marriage, and 
the single bed was a homemade affair which was designed to be put 
under the other bed in the daytime. The bed clothes were undoubtedly 
those that had done service for many years, and were so worn that it 
would have been difficult to have guessed their age. There were no pictures, 
except a few cut out of newspapers, and I noticed one or two calendars. 
A small mirror was suspended in the middle of the room, which was only 
part high enough for the boys to stand erect in. 

I politely suggested that I would give the boys a better room, if I had to 
take the spare room, but the good mother replied: "Oh, they don't care, 
a boy is never in his room except to sleep or change his clothes, and boys 
don't know how to take care of nice things anyway." 

I politely differed with the mother and gave her my views on the matter, 
but I do not think I made any impression. As a sequel to this I will add 
that the boys, one by one, went away as soon as they were of age, and the </seg>

old folks, after trying hired help for a few years, moved to town and the 
old farm is now rented. Had there been more recreation for those boys, 
and had home been made more pleasant, it is more than probable that 
these boys would still be on the farm. 

Ethe father and mother would not forget that they were once young, 
would enter into all the plans and pleasures of their children, the 
would be a far more attractive place and the desire to leave it would 

There Is another suggestion that I wish to make here. The Agricultural 
Department of the State University has a winter school which is of incalculable 
value to the farmer. Every boy who intends to farm should go 
there at least one winter. It is within the reach of every farmer hoy, and 
if every father would interest himself and get his boys to attend this 
school they would have the farm brought to them in a new light, and find 
an interest in the farm that they never dreamed of. Now, father, send 
and get a prospectus of this school, and make every arrangement to have 
Charley go next year. Have him go the first day and stay all winter. It 
will pay you and it will be worth to the boy many times what it costs. 

I.ther and mother, never forget that you were once young, or better 
never grow old. Always recall your young days and your early 
t&gt;les. and see to it that your children shall not have the same troubles 
you did. With some of you it is too late; you have made the mistake 
iany. and the boys have gone. You used to think of the mud on his 
i, you can recall that his old room was not what it might have been, 
today you would give the world, if you had it, to have Charley come In 
his muddy boots on your best carpet, to hear him blow that old bor•d 
horn again would be a pleasure now, and if he were only back again 
you would see bow pleasant you could make his home — but it is too late. 
Eo you wno have the boys yet with you, it is not too late. Remember 
own childhood, and if it lacked anything that might have made it 
ter try and see that your children shall not at least lack these things. 

Eits, it is hard for us to realize that our children are fast growing 
hood's estate. You think it the height of youthful foolishness that 
int a buggy to take their best girl out for a ride, and yet you and 
were married when you were only a year or two older than 
'. A boy Is a boy and a girl is a girl, and they will grow up as 
nature has designed. We can't change the course of nature, but by keeping 
an interest in everything that interests our children, we shall retain 
their confidence and love. By making home pleasant and by making the 
boys feel that it is their home you will keep them from town, with its 
dissipation. It is perhaps a little hard for mother to keep her rooms looking 
real nice when Charley, Frank and John spend most of their spare 
time at home, but after all it is not as wearing as to lie awake until midnight, 
wondering "Where are my boys tonight?" 

Father, give your boys something they can work with, and do good 
work. Don't expect them to do good work with an old plow that you or </seg>

            <seg id="p381">

your hired man would not use. There is no better way to disgust a boy 
with the farm. Talk and consult with him about the work, the tools you 
will buy. let him order his own harness, and if he comes home with a 
bunch of red, white and blue line rings on his harness don't tell him that 
it was a dollar thrown away, but instead go back in your own mind to 
the time when you did a similar thing, when about his age, and got ten 
dollars' worth of enjoyment out of it. 

Plan next winter to send at least one of the boys to the winter school 
of the Agricultural College. He will learn a great many things which yon 
don't know, and the knowledge that he will get, combined with your 
mature judgment, will make a combination hard to beat. He will hare 
such a new world opened up before him that if the mother tries to make 
home what it should be, he will stay at home until he goes to make a 
home for himself. 

In closing, I will say that I have talked only from one standpoint. I 
might say as much in regard to the girls as I have about the boys, and I 
could say a great deal more to both the boys and girls, in regard to their 
privileges and duties, than I have said to the father and mother, but 
neither of these were my subject. 

I hope I have said something that will be helpful in keeping our boys on 
the farm, the best place on earth for a boy. </seg>

THE AGRICULTURAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE SOIT1I

¦n assure you I esteem it an especial privilege and honor to have

your association, and endeavor to tell you something of the poses 
of the southern section of our great country. 

The agricultural possibilities of the south, as a whole, is. I must confess, 
rather more extensive a field than I would care to attempt to cover; 
nor could I adequately do so, as you are no doubt well aware, within 
the limited space of a paper of this character. I shall, therefore, have to 
crave your indulgence if I confine my remarks, chiefly, to my own state, 
Louisiana, v) ere already numbers of former citizens of this, and other of 
the great vr stern commonwealths, have found congenial associations, 
fertile lands, and happy homes. 

In epitomizing the unequaled combination of advantages afforded by 
the south, however, Richard H. Edmonds, editor of the Manufacturers' 
Record, of Baltimore, states, in his "Pacts about the South," that, "Nature 
has given this section advantages unequaled by those of any other 
country. About 75 per cent of the world's cotton is raised in the south. 
Iron ore and coal are in unlimited supply, and owing to their proximity 
and to the low cost o£ mining, pig-iron and steel can be made at smaller 
cost than in any other part of the country, if not in the world. Nearly 
every southern state has an abundance of the best waters-powers to supplement 
the advantages of cheap coal. It is not an exaggeration to say 
this favored land has greater advantages and resources, such as mineral, 
timber, and agricultural potentialities, than any other section; it has 
greater advantages for the profitable utilization of these natural resources 
than any other country in the world ; by virtue of its rivers and long seacoast 
it has the guarantee of the lowest freight rates; it has a climate that 
is conducive to health and long life — a climate that reduces the cost 
of living to a minimum; it has all of these mighty factors to insure its 
prosperity, and with fewer disadvantages than any other equal area in the 
world. It can produce nearly everything, from the widest range of agricultural 
growth to the widest limit of manufacturing and mineral diversity 
at the lowest cost. It is becoming a great iron and steel center; it is 
monopolizing the manufacture of coarse cotton goods, and is turning its 
attention to the finer grades; it is becoming the market-garden of the 
north. Its people can live more cheaply, because of natural advantages, 
than those of other sections, thus always insuring the maximum of profit 
on everything that the south produces. • • • Some countries have iron 
and coal, some have timber, some have oil, some have phosphate, some 
have good agricultural lands, some a good climate, some have water </seg>

C;rs, some have other advantages, but no other country combines all 
lese. and to them adds cotton, which Is the foundation of the greatest 
ufacturing interests in the world. Nowhere else is this combination 
found. • • • And because of the advantages bestowed upon this section 
by nature for profitable farm operations, and of the enormous areas of 
tillable land, no limit can be get to the possibilities of southern agricultural 
advancement." 

Coming now to my own state, more particularly, it may be said that 
Louisiana is essentially an agricultural state. That is to say, owing to 
her geographical position, denying her the existence of mineral products, 
other than salt, sulphur, mineral oil, etc., and with her generally low 
topography, furnishing but little water-power to move the wheels of 
factories of various kinds, she must remain so for some time to come. Her 
varied soils, embraced under the agricultural divisions of the state, all 
contribute to her capabilities of maximum and varied production. These 
divisions may be enumerated as follows: Alluvial region, bluff soils, good 
uplands, long-leaf pine region, and central prairie region. She has a 
total area of some 45,440 square miles, not to speak of her several thousands 
of acres of fresh and salt water, which are distributed in the 
following manner: Alluvial, 13.225 square miles; bluff and bluff prairies, 
5,739 square miles; oak and hickory uplands, 8,103 square miles; longleaf 
pine hills. 7.582 square miles; long-leaf pine flats. 2.556 square miles: 
central prairie region, 785 square miles; coast marshes, 7.420 square miles. 

The statement has been made, that, "there is nothing that grows in the 
soil that Louisiana cannot produce to advantage." If we accept this assertion 
at its face value, and then take into consideration what she docs 
produce, and the value of those products; and when we still further consider 
that of her 28 millions of acres of fertile lands, only about 3 millions 
of them are in cultivation, some approximate conception may be 
had of her possibilities. 

The forest-wealth, alone, of Louisiana, is no mean item. Over 60 per 
cent of the entire forest-wealth of the United States is situated in the 
south, and of this amount the Pelican state produces the lion's share. 
All of her timber is distributed along the tributaries of the Mississippi 
river, or the Gulf of Mexico, and can be cheaply delivered by water to our 
Gulf and Atlantic ports, or to the ports of foreign countries. Millions of 
dollars have of late been invested in our timber resources, and the sawmills 
and planing machines of the northern section of the country, like 
the cotton factories, are wending their way southward for greater profits. 
Hard wood in abundance prevails on our alluvial and bluff lands and on 
our oak and hickory uplands. Our oak furnish an immense supply of 
staves for both local and foreign markets, while our ash, walnut, magnolia, 
beech, persimmon, gums, cotton wood, maples, etc., are capable of maintaining 
hundreds of factories for the manufacture of wafrons, spokes, hubs, 
trays, boxes, paper, etc. Our greatest timber wealth, however, is in the 
Immense area of long and short leafed pines, and our unparalleled forests </seg>

of cypress. Of total available timber, the United States census gives 
Louisiana nearly 50,000,000,000 feet, distributed as follows: 

Covering a total wooded area of 28,300 square miles. Next to the wealth 

in the sugar, cotton, rice, etc.. annually taken from our soils, comes that 

already drawn from them in the form of forest growth. 

It is quite probable that some of my auditors may have seen for them- 

selves samples of Louisiana's forestry in the exhibits made at our recent 

large expositions. 

To those not conversant with conditions as they exist with us in 

Louisiana, the impression is apt to, and I think does, to some extent, prevail, 
that her agricultural possibilities are altogether confined to the production 
of what might be termed her staple crops: cotton, sugar cane, rice, 
tobacco, etc. Such, however, is quite an erroneous impression, and has a 
tendency to mislead. I think I am by no means reaching beyond the 
"danger line" when I say, that almost anything that can be produced in a 
temperate or subtropical climate can be successfully grown in Louisiana: 
and her possibilities in the breeding, feeding and development of 

Riest breeds and varieties of live stock, are only bginning to be 
and appreciated, not only by our own people, but by many northern 
estern stockmen, who are earnestly and anxiously looking southor 
a land of large and cheap production in which to develop this 

important and profitable agricultural industry. 

Forage crops in great variety grow with a luxuriance and vigor that 

rid "tickle the palate" and whet the appetite of the most epicurean of 
herbivorous animals. The unexcelled alfalfa, or lucerne (Medicargo 
sattva) is being extensively raised in many portions of the state, some 
farms being exclusively devoted to the production of this "prince of leguminous 
forage plants," which yields, with us, from three to sometimes 
¦even and eight cuttings in a season. The Cowpea (Dolichoi sinemit). 
lmost equal to alfalfa in nutritive value for feeding purposes, revels in 
11 its glory in its southern home. Japan clover ( Lespedeza striata). a 
most valuable legume, and, when cured, a most nutritious hay, has tended 
considerably to enhance the value of our pastures by spreading over our 
ands and mixing with the native grasses. Many of our farmers make a 
usiness of raising this crop and marketing it as hay, for which they 
btain from $10 to $15 per ton. Clovers grow quite vigorously, as also do 

the vetches. In short, we have quite an abundance in quantity and in 
variety of those most important nitrogen-gathering and protein-yielding 
forage and soiling plants, so valuable for the upbuilding and maintenance 
of the fertility of our soils, as well as the nutrition of our farm animals. 
Bermuda (Cynodon dactylon), the native pasture grass par excellence in 
oar section of the country, is capable of great "carrying power" and when

cured into hay makes one of the very best roughages for farm stock. 
Pasturage in our latitude can be obtained all the year round, by sowing 
almost any of the small cereals, as catch crops, after our corn and cotton 
hare been harvested. Oats, barley, rye, wheat, etc., yield excellently during 
the fall and winter months, and furnish succulent pasturage at a 
time of year when such is in greatest need. A mixture of oats and hairy 
vetch (Viola villosa) has given us exceedingly satisfactory results as 
pasture, and is much relished by our animals. Dwarf Essex rape, as well 
as other varieties of cruciferous plants, produce abundantly upon our soils, 
and in our climate yields another succulent food when our regular pastures 
have been depleted by the summer's grazing. I allude specially to 
these winter-pasture crops, because they are at this present moment being 
utilized to great advantage, both as pasturage and as soiling crops, at 
our experiment station at Baton Rouge. 

Smair grains of different varieties can be successfully raised in various 
sections of the state, and make maximum yields; and if corn received 
similar attention and methods of cultivation, generally, as is given to 
it in the great corn-growing states in this section of the Union, its 
average yield per acre would be little, if any, short of yours. This great 
American cereal can be profitably raised in any section of our state, 
and by a proper system of rotation, fertilization, and cultivation, can be 
made to yield largely. As an illustration: On the alluvial soils of our 
Sugar Experiment Station, in southern Louisina, over 100 bushels per 
acre, as an average for several years, have been obtained; on our bluff 
lands, on which our State Experiment Station is located, an average of 
from sixty to ninety bushels have been procured; and on the yellow sandy 
loams of North Louisiana, the Station there has raised an average of 
from thirty to sixty bushels. If you consult the tabulated statistics 
of the United States government reports for the year 1900, covering the 
hay production of the various states, you will find that the average tonnage 
of five Northern and Western states leading in total hay production, 
is 1.24 tons per acre, while the average of the live cotton states. 
Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Mississippi and Georgia, is 1.81 tons, Louisiana 
heading the list with an average of 2 tons per acre. If we calculate 
the difference between the average of the five northern and western 
states and the ftve cotton states above mentioned, we find an advantage 
to the southern states of 0.57 of a ton per acre. The same statistics 
show that the State of Nebraska produces 2,639,489 tons, with an average 
yield per acre of 1.38 tons, an average farm price of $5.15. and an 
average value per acre of $5.11; while Louisiana raises only 50,802 tons, 
but with an average yield per acre of 2 tons; an average farm price of 
Eand a value per acre of |18.8O.&lt; These statistics make a pretty 
showing for the South and her possibilities in hay production, if 
nto in a business-like manner. 

In addition to the food products already enumerated, we have the 
valuable by-products from our cotton fields, our rice fields, and our

P factories. Most of you, no doubt, have realized the value of our 
-seed meal; and perhaps some of you may have returned it to us 
in the form of the finished product, western butter; for we are 
still guilty of keeping our butter factories in the west. Cotton-seed-hulls, 
also, have proved to be an important economical roughage for cattle. 
Yet, but a few years ago. cotton seed was thrown away as a totally worthless 
article. 

Erice bran and rice polish, which we have in great abundance, and 
is largely produced by Nebraska-Louisianians, and others from 
Western States, have become important factors in economic stock 

Low-grade molasses from our sugar houses and factories, which previously 
had been emptied into the ditches, has now impressed its value 
upon its high carbo-hydrate content, and its almost total digestibility. 
and is being extensively utilized, with gratifying results, in the feeding 
of both work horses and mules, and fattening cattle. 

With such possibilities in the production of corn, and by the employment 
of the "shredder" to render more usable a most valuable, but, with 
us, as yet, too much neglected, and even wasted, by-product, "corn fodder." 
which it Is claimed is almost, if not altogether, equal in feeding value 
to timothy; and. added to this the rest of our many nutritious roughage 
supplies, our winter pasture crops, and the rich concentrates in the byproducts 
from our cotton, rice, and sugar, the fact cannot but appeal 
strongly to the mind of even the casual observer, that the question of 
economics in the matter of successful animal production, with us. at 
least, should come very near being solved. 

Ennecessary for me to state, before this audience, that improved 
k is a necessary adjunct to every well-regulated farm, the 
he progressive agriculturist being to possess animals, not out 
lent, but to use them as factories, so to speak, to convert the 
raw materials of the soil into a higher-priced finished product 
rm of beef, mutton, or pork, besides securing the excrementitious 
which have only lost some 10 per cent of their fertilizing value 
g through the bodies of the animals, making them almost a free 
gift, to place back upon the soil to maintain or increase its fertility, 
and adding plant food for future crops. An arable farm without Its 
adequate quota of improved live stock, is an inharmonious enterprise. 

a sort of discordant undertaking, which Fitzherbert, away back in the 
sixteenth century realized when he said: "An husbande cannot well 
thryre by his corne without he have other cattell, nor by his cattell 
without corne, for els he shall be a buyer, a borrower, or a beggar." 
In many parts of the south we. unfortunately, have not as yet fully 
realized the truth of this true though somewhat trite statement. This 
is no doubt due, in large measure, to the one-crop system of farming. 
so long in vogue, and to the energies of our agricultural population being 
bent almost totally upon the production of the "fleecy staple" to the </seg>

well nigh total exclusion of other varieties of farm crops, or of live 
stock. The latter, therefore, have had to raise themselves as best they 
could, more especially cattle, sheep, and hogs; raised crops have been used 
for the work stock, and when those gave out, we simply drew upon our 
reserve corn-cribs, hay-stacks, and I may add, smoke houses and beef 
pens, up here in the West, which we have for so long a time rented 
from you good people. 

Well, "its an ill wind that blows nobody good." Still, there is perhaps 
another way to view this state of affairs. Where can you find another 
country, or another section of this country, that can support its citizens 
under such conditions? And yet the majority of our people are contented, 
happy, and fairly prosperous. 

R remark is frequently passed, that, Louisiana is the finest "poor 
country" to be found anywhere. If we Interpret this to mean, that 
g can be made with the minimum of effort, we believe it to be virtrue. 
In fact, the thought has often presented itself, that if it were 
r the laviahness with which nature bestows her gifts upon our 
State, and. therefore, the ease with which the "wolf is kept from the 
door." many of us would succumb to privations. But, on the other hand, 
people are but creatures of environment, and if conditions were changed, 
they, too, would most likely change with them. And, if some are con- 
So exist without any extra effort on their part, it is their business. 
10 one has any special right to be dissatisfied. It is simply their 
fortune that their lot should have been cast in so "goodly a country." 
i the good things of this life have been dealt out to them in such 
lant profusion. And, besides, it is extremely doubtful whether any 
. who have to toil hard for six months of the year to sustain life 
irselvea and in our animals for the other six. would have to be 
ly tempted to swap conditions. 

But. if Louisiana, and probably some other of the Southern States. 
is such a good poor man's country, in the sense, that, by scratching 
her fertile soils, planting the seed, and permitting nature to do the 
rest, with very little further assistance from the hand of man, what would 
be the result, did her lands receive the treatment which should be bestowed 
them by the more modern, up-to-date, intelligent husbandman, who 
made a thorough study of his profession: made a business of farming, 
rather than a means to eke out a mere comfortable existence; who built 
up his soils; aimed at maximum production; kept up with the markets, 
varied his products including improved live stock, of course; rotated 
his crops, and strived to produce nothing but the very best his land 
would yield, and that the market wanted? This is indeed a question to 
which it is almost impossible to find a feasibly accurate reply. In these 
remarks, however. I do not include the great majority of our large sugarcane 
and cotton planters, for, as a class, their superiors, as agriculturists, 
are hardly to be found anywhere, although, of course, their efforts are 
directed solely to the production of sugar and cotton. But my reference </seg>

is more especially to what might be termed our farming class, who try 
to make the proceeds of one crop — cotton, and that often a fluctuating 
one. meet all the expenses of both farm and home, and frequently 
enriching the coffers of the merchant for the actual necessaries of life, 
the majority of which ought to be raised upon the home farm. Yet, 
although all this is perhaps capable of being construed into a reflection 
upon our methods of procedure, it is also an eloquent endorsement of 
the great fertility of our soils, to be able to support such methods. 

A change from the former methods, however, is bound to come. In 
fact, it has already set in. In the language of the "good book," "old 
things are passing away and all things are becoming new." The markets 
of the world are growing closer through greater facilities in transportation: 
competition is becoming keener; and to keep up with the procession, 
we are becoming alive to the fact, that we have got to "get a move 
on." We are realizing the necessity for greater diversity in our agricultural 
products; the maintenance of the fertility of our soils, and more 
thorough methods of cultivation. We are becoming convinced of the 
importance of "living more at home:" raising what the farm and home 
needs, with a cash-crop to be placed to our credit at the bank. Cotton 
is almost bound to be one of, if not our main, surplus crops, because 
the South is its home, and we are accustomed to it. But the tendency 
will be to make more of it to the acre, and devote other acres to other 
crops, on the intensive system. 

Improvement in our live stock has made remarkable strides within 
the past four or five years: or, in other words, since the valuable 
discovery of artificial immunization to Texas fever has enabled our 
stockmen and farmers to import from the North and West, cattle of the 
improved breeds to build up our herds. In the state of Louisiana to-day, 
and it is similar in other southern states, we have some magnificent 
specimens of all the more important breeds of cattle: Shorthorn, 
Aberdeen Angus, Hereford. Polled Durham, Red Poll. Devon, Jersey, 
Guernsey and Holstein, and all seem to be doing well, where proper .care 
and management are bestowed upon them. Only a few weeks ago, a friend 
of my own spent $4,000 in blue-blooded Shorthorns and Polled Durhams 
to add to his already excellent herd. We have nuclei all over the state, 
in fact, and we have the food materials in abundance. But, with very 
few exceptions have we the third essential success, viz., stockmen, to 
handle these Improved and highly-developed animals and bring them to 
the highest state of perfection. 

Such an achievement can only be reached as the result of experience; 
and as our attention in the past has been directed along entirely different 
lines, and, therefore, our education in this branch of industry neglected, 
it will take some time before we are sufficiently versed in the subject 
to make the most of the improved livestock business; and this is where we 
need help. We are trying to encourage the youth of our country, 
-hrough the agricultural colleges, to take an interest in this work; we </seg>

are harping upon the same theme to our farmers at our fanners' institutes, 
our agricultural and stockbreeders' associations; we are endeavoring 
to give ocular demonstrations at our experiment stations, but nothing 
seems to the farmer like the object-lesson of a neighbor-farmer's success. 
Many of our agricultural students drift into occupations or professions 
other than agriculture. If a college professor, or an institute worker, 
makes a suggestion to the farmer, it is looked upon as "all theory." 
or that they are paid by the State to talk that way. If the experiment 
station demonstrates to him clearly what can be done, oh, its all right for 
the station to do bo and so, because it Is backed up with State, or 
United States Government funds, or both, and the stimulus to "go 
and do likewise." is only too often ineffective. But. if a neighbor-farmer, 
one of his own "kidney" so to speak, succeeds in some advanced undertaking, 
then it is all right! it is practical! there is no "book-learning" 
about it at all. Now, this is something like what it is down our way; 
but I feel sure it is entirely different in Nebraska. 

Good object lessons are what we need; and this is the sort of help 
we want to assist in developing our great natural resources, along the 
line of animal production, as well as other branches; and I firmly believe 
that there are none so capable of rendering us such assistance as our 
progressive western friends who care to turn their faces southward. 

It is unnecessary to refer to the rice section of Southwest Louisiana. 
as. no doubt, it is already familiar to many of you. further than to state, 
that it almost presents the appearance of a miniature "western world." 
and has already yielded up fortunes to many of the pioneers, and even 
more recent settlers. 

The raising of truck, vegetables, and fruit, for the Northern market, 
strawberries being a specialty, is an industry that has developed into 
the State along the line of the Illinois Central Railroad. This work is 
being engaged in chiefly by western settlers, who have made an unqualified 
success of it, special facilities being tendered them, by the railroad mentioned, 
for rapid transit to the Chicago and other large markets. 

Each region of the state, with its slightly different climate, raises 
its own variety of fruit with success. The Chinese type of pear grows 
all over; the peach is to be found everywhere, but the hill lands produce 
it to the greatest perfection. Plums, native and Japanese varieties, do 
well generally. Grapes can be grown all over the State, but succeed 
best on the uplands. Blackberries, dewberries and mulberries grow Wild 
in every parish; and all are familiar with Louisiana oranges. These, 
with kumquats and pomelos, are grown throughout the southern portion. 
Figs are to be found in every home garden throughout the 
parishes, while the apple is grown in the northern part of the State. 

If you will pardon a slight digression, I may be permitted to say 
that the state abounds in game of all sorts, including bear; and the 
great mistake President Roosevelt made, when on his recent southern 
trip, was to have stopped short of Louisiana. If he had honored the </seg>

I have so far endeavored, in a sort of rambling manner, to tell you 
something of the possibilities and of the good things of our region of 
the country, which are undoubtedly great and numerous compared to 
our disadvantages. In fact, I should say of the latter that they are 
relatively few. The healthfulness of our climate is good and people live 
to a ripe old age. 

Yellow fever, which used to be the dreaded scourge of the southern 
States, has been shorn of its terrors. The disease is an exotic, and 
has always been imported; and since the fact has been positively established 
that the mosquito (stegomyia fasciata) is the sole carrier of the 
germ; and since war has been ruthlessly waged on these insects; also, 
since the ¦Gem of the Antilles" has been getting her seaports placed in 
better sanitary condition, and with our rigid system of Mississippi river 
quarantine, we now fear "yellow jack" no more. 

Malaria, also, is a mosquito-borne disease, as has been proved by 
several noted scientific investigators, and can be controlled by proper 
efforts strenuously directed against the propagation of these puncturing 

Our heated term is, perhaps, a little long drawn out, and a trifle 
enervating, yet the mercury seldom reaches the century mark during the 
whole course of the summer season. In fact, the illustration of comparatively 
robust health now standing before you, should be sufficient, I 
think, to verify the statement that we have a healthful climate, notwithstanding 
a thirteen years' sojourn in Louisiana, with scarcely a 
day's sickness, although born and raised to manhood in the "land o' 
cakes," among the Clydes, the Aryshires and the Galloways, in the southwest 
of Scotland. 

Like all other countries, and sections of our own country, Louisiana 
is afflicted with her live stock diseases, although I have yet to see my 
first case of specific hog-cholera in the state (a fact, I should imagine, 
calculated to make a Nebraskan envious). I omitted, when previously 
alluding to live stock, to mention that although we still have our share 
of the "track hog," the far-famed "razor-back"— I say "track hog," because 
of his unlimited speed when a "cullud brudder" gets on his track — we 
also have as fine specimens of the improved breeds of swine: Berkshire. 
Poland-China, Red Jersey, Essex, Chester White, 0. I. C, etc., as are to 
be found anywhere. Our principal troubles in the line of hog diseases 
are parasitic, dietetic, and, therefore, preventable. The chief victims 
are the range animals, which are of the genus "scrub," mainly, and live 
in the woods on forest mast and anything else they can get hold of, which, 
however, does not include good attention. 

¦is fever is, of course, indigenous with us, and does not seriously 
our native* cattle; and, with the assistance of the immunization 
ent, we do not now dread its effects in imported stock. </seg>

AGRICULTURAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE SOUTH. 

Anthrax, or as we use its French synonym, "Charbon," ia to some extent 
enzootic in some of the alluvial districts of the state, although unknown 
in the hill lands. Before the true nature of this disease was known to 
our people, the loss of stock in some years was quite heavy. But now 
that they are more educated to the necessity for strict sanitary measures 
in combatting the disease; and since preventive inoculation has been annually 
practiced for the past six or eight years, its control is very much 
simplified, and the results have been extremely gratifying. 

Of blackleg, we have a little in some sections, which, however, is 
held in check by timely preventive vaccination. 

Outbreaks of glanders occasionally occur, due, in almost every instance, 
to importations from other states, and, perhaps, to the lack of sufficiently 
stringent live stock sanitary legislation, which we hope to have improved 
in the near future. 

Tuberculosis, although some of our large city dairy herds may be affected 
with it, is a disease we rarely hear of in our open-air animals in the 
country districts, where close housing is altogether unnecessary during 
any time of the year. 

In truth, although my statements, regarding the possibilities of ou 
southern part of the country, and the many advantages it offers, may 
appear to some to sound somewhat optimistic, I feel convinced I can 
assert, without reasonable fear of contradiction, that the more souther 
section of the southern states offers greater advantages to the progressive 
agriculturist, and with fewer disadvantages, than the great majority o 
£r sections of the country, or of any other equal area on the face o

you will receive a most generous welcome from high-toned, warm-hearted, 
chivalrous and hospitable people.

need you! ! Come, and continue to keep coming, until our 25,000,000 
of acres of rich uncultivated lands, that at present exist, are converted 
into well-tilled farms, with happy homes, and the hum of agricultural 
machinery is heard all over the Commonwealth taking the place of the
