"The day when a man could sell himself into slavery is in the of all civilized countries. A further interference in the field of the so-called 'freedom of contract' cannot be considered bold. The law can tell a girl just hew many hours of her Uw she shall sell. "I don't know that limiting the working hours to eight a day will accomplish a cure, but it will help. The great thing would be to lessen the strain." This strain that Protessor Ross speaks of is not at present very str.nuous in Nebraska; but it is undoubtedly increasing from year to year. This increase of female labor is heaviest in the "genteel" occu - pations, clerking, stenography and the like. The ke-n competition of business men is no greater than the fierce competition of "living." A large proportion of th: young women at work are not laboring because they actually have «;. which was the sole and only reason in the earlier day, but because they have caught the industrial spirit of the times and are ambitious to be "in business;" and because they have become en rapport with the fashionable striving for a larger degree of luxury and richness in personal adornment and possessions. Thus a purely fictitious need, or craving, has brought into the industrial field a large number of workers of high intelligence, sharp mentality and fine address, with a resulting loss of chance to many less ably equipped, who really need a weekly income, but must accept the minor opportuniti s I However, there is n:&lt; much cause for worry over the status of lale labor in this state at present. National statistics indicate t one-third of the women of the country between the ages of 16 and years are engaged in gainful occupations. In Nebraska the i&gt;ercent - of women so engaged is very much smaller. United States Census letin No. 71 11906) showed there w &gt;re r.ns.OOO females in the ;e aged 16 years or over. Of this total 2,"&gt;4 2 were employed in nful work of one kind or another; one in about every 200 of popu - on.

Taking Central Nebraska records as a basis for estimate, the average increase in the market price of land in the last seven or eight is stated at about 100 per cent. In many instances it has been ;&gt;er cent or more. Farms not well located and hence at the bottom of the market, sell for $10 to $20 per acre, instead of $4 to $6 an acre ten years ago. The best farm land has brought $100 an acre in so many instances that such a figure is no longer especially notice- able.

Otis, of the I'niversity of Wisconsin. By actual experiment he proved that young cows not giving milk can be kept in good condition during the winter and gain from t.SG to t.I pounds per day when fed nothing but alfalfa hay. Prof. Otis ■ "In composition alfalfa is nearly, if not quite, equal to bran, pound for pound. The excellent feeding value of alfalfa lies in its high content of digestible protein. With an average yield of four tons, alfalfa will produce 800 pounds of digestible protein per acre. If this mt of protein is supplied from oil meal, which is usually pur - chased for its protein content, it would require l.C tons, which would it present $52.50. K"A summary of feeding trials with dairy cows shows that alfalfa be made to take the place of at least one-half of the grain usually our dairy cows, and as the nutrients needed by dairy cows can be uced much more cheaply with alfalfa than with grain, the cost roducing milk may be greatly reduced by its use. t'The cash returns from feeding this crop at the various experi - t stations range from $10 to $20 per ton. With four tons per , these figures show the excellent returns from the land devoted ilfalfa. A conservative estimate would indicate that the dairy ler can increase his profits from 50 to 76 per cent by a liberal, judicious, use of alfalfa grown upon his own farm." tDr. Axtell, of the Kansas State Agricultural College, after exper - t:ng. asserts that alfalfa contains from eleven to sixteen and one - parts protein and forty parts carbohydrates, while corn ranges : one-half that amount of protein and one-third that amount of 'hydrates. "It will thus be seen." he says, " that it requires considerably more corn to afford an animal the same amount of protein that he would get from a given quantity of alfalfa meal. Now, we have found that an an - imal (horse or cowl needs about two and one-half pounds of protein and twelve and one-half pounds f carbohydrates per day. K "Alfalfa is wasted feeding as hay, and the meal is too rich as a le feed, so we mix pound for pound cf alfalfa meal and ground corn, in a twenty-five .pound feed we have the required amount of both ein and carbohydrates. I "When feeding alfalfa as hay we foun1 that the average amount en by each horse per day was from sixty to eighty pounds. They now allowed fifteen pounds of alfalfa meal per day and are doing well as on the heavy hay feed. "A cow giving a good flew of mik gets an average feed of about six or seven and one-half pounds of alfalfa meal and one-half to three-fourths gallons of ground corn, while our driving horses get a mixed raticn of thre^ pounds of alfalfa meal and two pounds of ground corn three times per day. with one feed a day of about five </seg>

Instruments will be used to measure heat and cold, moisture and dry ness, both above and below ground; to -ier the force of the wind near the wind-breaks and some distance away: to measure light intensity, and take note of the effects of register frost at different distances from the trees; and to keep iint of the effect of the wind-breaks on the snow which covers the ground to leeward In winter. Many other measurements and tests be made, and elaborate data will be collected by experts of the forest service at Washington, who will have charge cf the study. Many disput-d questions will thus be settled and the data gathere will be placed at the disposal of the farmers who desire it. Th ' service will study all sorts of conditions. including the relativ \alue of wind-breaks, consisting of a single row of trees, and shelte made up of a number of such rows. A wind-break is usuall planted for protection alone, a shelter belt for both protection and th growth of timber. ' tCorn will be the crop studier behind the wind-break this year, tworthy conclusions cannot be obtained by comparing results from rent crops. Each crop makes its own demand upon the soil, so that : would destroy one might do little harm to another. Corn is a icularly good crop to experiment with because it is easily injured by dry winds, will not stand shading and is very sensitive to frost. I The work will continue until crops are gathered, when the il yield of sheltered fields will be measured, and results compared near-by unsheltered fields. Some of the observations will continue igh the winter. I In connection with this work, efforts are being made to have the e portions of farms made profitable by means of tree planting. In mat ion of this, one of the officials of the forest service said: "Many poor soils, now waste spots on the farm, would become profitable if planted with the right kind of forest trees and cared for in the right way. Trees will often grow where grain anr grass will not. Swamps, stony ridges, exhausted fields and washed hillsides need not be abandoned. There is money in most of them if they are set to work producing wood lots and forests. But knowledge and judgment are -sary, and a bad guess may be costly. t"Many trees do well in their soils — cone-bearing trees In partic- The farmer is fortunate whose land has no poor spots. Few land ers are so well off. Fertile acres are usually fairly profitable, the gravel bars, rocky knolls, marshy swales and exhausted eroded slopes are not. Scarcely one of them need remain unpro - ive. They will grow timber — pine, locust, poplar, Osage orange, chestnut or some other kind. But the soil must be studied and the species selected to suit it. Failure might follow the planting of walnut on soil suited to white pine, or vice versa. </seg>

Cambridge. Lincoln, Norfolk. Soffolk and ■ I payments in these counties ranged from about £6 10s. t though more was earned by some men on piece-work in th' :ricts. In parts of Norfolk and in Suffolk and Essex the usu tern of payment is for the laborer to contract with the farmer form the harvest work for a fixed sum. irrespective of the numbe days occupied. A short harvest is thus a profitable one for th laborer, as he gets back to ordinary farm work at weekly wages sooner than in a year when the harvest is lengthened by unfavorable weather. I In the Midland and in the Southern and Southwestern counties systems of payment are frequently on a time-work basis, so that ■vest earnings fluctuate from year to year according to the duration the harvest. various methods of payment are as follows ( apart from that ady described for certain Eastern counties): To give the work in Erate portions as piece-work; to give the ordinary weekly wages, in addition, a bonus of a pound or two at the end of the harvest; ve extra time wages for a month certain, and then pay the ordinary tly wages during harvest; to pay double the ordinary weekly wages Number of Mvn ' dur\u r nn e ,&gt;f *'■— Aver»ire </seg>

Nebraska. They have taken options on 40,000 - of land, adjoining the four thousand acres which they own. Pros - pecting for oil, gas cr coal is being carried on. Howe, in Nemaha County, is very likely to become, in the •inure, the home of one of the greattst brick-making plants in the world. There is said to be located right in the town an apparently in - exhaustible deposit of shale, which has been proven by experiment of the finest quality for the manufacture of high grade brick. L Beatrice is. for the time being, sleeping on its chances for a big nt factory. Two miles south of the city there is a hilly section fa which good building cement was made twenty-five years ago. s fact recently has been recalled, and a revival of interest is not at unlikely. I During I»o7 there was shipped out of Nebraska 7,150,000 pounds silica. Of this amount 4,4si;.ihiO pounds, or sixty-seven carloads, » shipped from Orleans, in Harlan County. The total value of silica liped was over $64,000. Harlan and Furnas counties have the prin - al silica deposits so lar worked, and at Orleans the Cudahy Packing npany. of South Omaha, is building a spur track four mil's in length the deposits at a large cost. The silica beds near Edison, in Furnas inty. are yet undeveloped, but some Cleveland people have options them. t Angus, in Nuckols County, is also a shipping point for a con rable quantity of silica.

Nebraska is coming to be chief source of supply of that material for the neighboring states, sidewalks and cement buildings of a great part of Iowa are made i sand taken from the mines of Nebraska. Prof. Condra also licts that when the Platte River sand mines are fully developed will be the greatest in the 1'nited State. The quality is of the best; and later on a large amount of money will be realized from raska sand every year.

I will be seen from the following statement: ome - 400 bushels rammer apples at "r&gt; cents Crop of winter apples on trees for 750 bushels culls and windfalls at 10 cents n from tl lowin tatement: at T.'i cents $300.00 1,000.00 75.00 rop of winter apples on trees for 7."&gt;n bushels culls and windfalls at 10 cents T Picking and packing 4»o bushels at 7 cents $28.00 k 4 barrels at 40 cents 53.60 ing 730 trees at 12 cents 90.00 ithering 7",n bushels culls and windfalls at 3 cei 29.50 ng 194.10 I' Kn &gt;tl rchard near Barada.

Tl- as a 60-acre orchard 13 years old w ientiflc spraying, may be judged owi hundred and twenty Winesap trees in the block set apart for praying demonstration yielded practically two barrels per tree of i lpples as are produced anywhere. The Jonathan yielded even heavier. The Ben Davis and the Gano. except for s. few acres of low land, were certainly carrying nearly two barrels ?r tree when I saw them at picking time. There are about sixty tree acre (the orchard has not yet received its final thinning). Thl would figure up five thousand barrels. No fruit has been sold for less than $3 per barrel and the Winesaps, Jonathans and Ganos sold thus far have brought $3."&gt;0 per barrel. The Ganos went to an Indianapolis firm at the latter figure. The owner refused $3.50 per barrel for much of his choicest fruit and has put it in cold storage. The cost of barrels, </seg>
            <seg id="p178">178 of picking, packing, hauling to town, etc., will not be over $1.00 per barrel. At $2.50 per barrel net, five thousand barrels will yield a net return of $12,500 — over $200 per acre. What if this orchard has not made any money before? I do not know that it has not — I believe that it has, though it is yet young. Suppose it has not. Two hundred dollars per acre estimated net returns from this year's crop is equivalent to nearly $16 per acre for the whole thirteen years of the orchard's </seg>

The result is enlightening, a touching these features of the farming industry. Figures pre •ented will be of decided interest to many people, judging by inquiries irst time. The figures are not as complete and satistactory as ga cculd be wished: but so far as they go they can be regarded as correct.
