PRESIDENTS AODRE88 Members of the State Board of Agriculture : The year 1916 was one in which many things were encouraging and many were discouraging to the State Board of Agriculture. This is always true to some extent, but seems to have been more true in 1916 than it usually is. The war in Europe created more or less uneasiness in the minds of the people, and the fear was always present that the United States might at any moment be drawn into It. The season was very dry in most sections of the state, and at least a partial loss of crops seemed unavoidable. The call for troops to go to the border in July upset calculations for a time; and last but not least, a general strike of railroad train- </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 PBCXEEDINU8 NKHKASKA STATE BOAMU OK AUBK VI.TURK men, scheduled to commence the very day our Fair opened, made things look mighty blue. The Board had incurred the necessary expense and planned to pull off the biggest and best Fair ever held in the state; and when the wire flashed the order to all agents to accept no business of any kind after Sunday, the Board felt that they were up against the real thing. A large part of the live stock exhibit comes from Iowa. We re - ceived a wire from the President of the Iowa Fair on Thursday saying they were releasing their stock Thursday instead of Friday to give the stockmen a chance to get home before the transportation facilities stopped, and that everybody was going to load for home that night. You can imagine that this was not encouraging news to us. We immediately wired him to get busy quick and tell them that the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture said that there would be no strike, and to come ahead anyway: that if the worst came to pass, we would take care of their stock until it could be returned home. The Des Moines papers got out extra editions with big headlines giving our message and urging everybody to come ahead, and that they would be cared for. The result was that everybody there was shouting hurrah for Nebraska; and while we had originally expected twenty-five or thirty cars from Des Hoines, we got forty-nine cars. Our own papers spread the news far and wide that the Board was not afraid but still maintained that the biggest Fair ever held would be pulled off the next week. And everybody or nearly everybody came; and when the history of the 1916 Fair was written it showed that we had the largest and best exhibit in most departments that had ever been assembled in the state; also that 13,000 more people came to see it than ever before. In spite of the many discouragements the Fair was a success from a financial standpoint and from the exhibitors' view; last but not least, the visitor found more to Bee not alone of exhibits but of other attrac - tions: best of all he found the sanitary condition of grounds, eating houses and refreshment stands up to such a high standard that it can truly be said that no State Fair ever had better. The State Fair is a school where more information is gained in a given time than can be secured anywhere else in the state. All school officials recognize the fact that students must have recreation along with their work; so the State Board of Agriculture, while making the agri - cultural, the horse, cattle, hog, machinery, educational, and a number of other things the predominant features, also furnish a good line of free entertainments, always keeping in mind that all entertainments must be clean and of a moral standard. The Secretary will give you a detailed report of the entire year's work, so I will not take your time in mentioning things that will be repeated. There is one thing, however, that I want to speak of: the Boys' Camp is so valuable a feature under the leadership of Mr. Strader, assisted by our friends from the State Farm, that I believe if we could </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 PBOCEED1N08 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRKULTUBE go forward twenty-five years and know just what it means to bring two boys here from each county and send them back with the inspiration they receive at the Camp, we would find that all the expense of the State Fair is more than paid for in this one feature alone. The Board last year spent some twelve to fifteen thousand dollars in improvements, the largest being the new dining hall, 200x60, with a basement 12x60, all cement floors, with complete sewerage and water system. Considerable new cement and stone sidewalk was put in, new roofs were put on several buildings, and several hundreds of dollars were spent in painting, with much more still needed. A large amount of filling was done, and the old creek bed west of the hog and sheep barns which has so long been an eye-sore is a thing of the past. There is a crying need for several extensive improvements in the way of buildings, the ones most needed being a hog barn and a dairy barn. The old hog barns are rotten and practically past being usable at all, and we have no dairy barn. The dairy breeds have been housed in the main cattle barn, but the beef cattle exhibit has grown until it now fills the entire barn. Last year we had to scatter cattle around in places not at all suitable. The State Fair is the one state institution that is making money for the state. The property belongs to the state, and is now worth at least twice as much as the state has ever put into it. This is because the Fair management has been able to put from ten to twenty thousand dollars anually into permanent improvements besides running expenses. No one receives a dollar of profit out of it more than just fair pay for the time spent. All the balance goes back into the grounds in the way of improvements. In conclusion I want to say that the success of the Fair last year was not due to the president or to any one man but was due to the fact that the whole twenty-nine members are a bunch of able, enthusiastic men, and to the fact that every man of them just took off his coat and waded in, ready to do anything assigned to him. I would like to mention names, for there are so many good things that could be said of each individual, but I would have to go through the whole list and it would take too much time; again, I know that these men are not looking for praise, but are doing this work because their hearts are in it. The Board has been united not only in working for the State Fair's success but also in grief over the loss of a valued member, Mr. George Dickman, whose long service as Treasurer was deeply appreciated by his co-workers. Every member will agree with me when I say that we had no abler man on the board and no one better loved by his associates than was Mr. Dickman. I want also to say that no small part of our success is due to the loyal support that most of the newspaper boys of the state have given us. I would like to see them better paid for advertising; but they, like </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE many other friends, in order to make the ledger balance, have to credit a big sum to the satisfaction of seeing a good work go on. No president ever had or ever could have more loyal support from all the officers and members than your President has had during the last year. 1 want to thank especially the county presidents and delegates from county fairs for your presence here. It is a pleasure and a help to have you here. We feel that your advice is valuable, and we want you to take an active part in the deliberations of the meeting. We want you to enjoy being with us, and we want you to go home deter - mined to boost for a still bigger and better Fair next fall. I want to say to both members and delegates that if any difference of opinion should exist, let us straighten it out here in an honorable way, and when we get through, then everybody get together for another year's pull. J. A. OLLIS, President Ollis: I presume the nominations for members of the Board had bet - ter be made at this time, as under our practice we get tickets printed to be used in tomorrow's meeting in voting and it is necessary to get the copy to the printer as early as we can conveniently. We will start with the first district. Lawrence: I would like to ask that before the business of nomina - tions be taken up I may put a motion before this house and discuss it, if it will be so ruled in order by the president. Ollis: Yes, it is in order; a motion is in order any time when noth - ing else is before the house. Lawrence: If I can get a second to my motion I would like to move that the sixth district, what is known as the sixth district, be allowed ona extra member on the State Board of Agriculture, the said extra mem - ber to be taken from the fourth district in order to conform to the statute. Ollis: Do I hear a second to the motion? Agee: I will second it, to get it before the house. Ollis: Moved and seconded that the sixth congressional district be allowed one additional member and that that member be taken from the fourth district. Any remarks on the motion? Lawrence: You will notice I stood up to stop any eggs or potatoes that might come this way while waiting for a second. Men, I have just one little item to bring before you in the way of an element of fairness as regards the State Board of Agriculture, in the western part of the state of Nebraska. I have spoken with a good many men since I have come to town in regard to representation on the Board from western Nebraska. I would ask you to take a look at the members of this Board as they are distributed over the state and see if western Nebraska is played fair with. I would ask you to imagine a map of the state of Nebraska with a line drawn through the middle part from north to south and that </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE would be like about at Broken Bow. Now there are twenty-nine members of this Board; on the western side ot that line you will find two; twenty - seven lie to the east of the middle of Nebraska — two to the west. Now is that really what you actually think of us out there? Is that all we are good for? Now that is not all the proposition; suppose we draw a line the other way, east and west through Broken Bow, and count the number of members of the State Board of Agriculture north of that line, and the number south of that line. You will find five of them north of the half way line drawn through Nebraska east and west; twenty-two members out of the twenty-nine live in the southeastern quarter of the state of Nebraska. The northeast quarter, the northwest quartsr and the south - west quarter are capable of representation in this state by only seven members. Do you want the other twenty-two in tha southeastern corner of Nebraska? Is that fair? Many of the men to whom I have spoken say "No, it is not fair, but it is impossible to fix it, that is the way it stands; you fellows should have more representation, but we cannot fix it." I brought before you in this motion a plan to fix it; that is, stealing a mem - ber from the fourth. I have taken the fourth into consideration simply for this reason — there are six members from the fourth district and by some hook or crook or circumstances, five of them go off this year. I can - not sea where any one individual going off is injured by this proposition I am making to you and, as an element of fairness, men, I bring it to you. I have the vote as filed with the secretary of state showing at the. last election the vote in the different congressional districts, and will ask you to compare them with the representation on the State Board of Agricul - ture and see if it conforms to the vote of the district. This was evidently a fair proposition when this apportionment was made, but we are grow - ing in the western part of the state and consequently we have more people there now than we have" had. In the first congressional district there are 38,608 votes; there are five representatives on this Board. In the second district there are 46,117 votes; three representatives on this Board. I understand there has never been any objection as to the repre - sentation for that district because that is the Omaha district and they are satisfied with the representation they have there for they have not such a heavily rural population. The third has 54,344 votes with five rep - resentatives on this Board. The fourth district has 43,532 votes and six representatives on this Board. The fifth district has 42,041 votes and flfive representatives. The sixth has the largest vote of any — 58,541 votes and five representatives on the Board. Compare the fourth and sixth, there are 15,000 more votes in the sixth district than there are in the fourth and we are not allowed as many representatives on the State Board as the fourth has. That is the standing now of the vote as it was cast at the last election, showing that the sixth district, which comprises more than one-fourth of the total area of the state is allowed only five representa - tives on this Board. Men, I do not think there would be any objections un - der ordinary circumstances as regards this representation, but it seems from the people in the west end of the state, and I have spoken to a good </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 PROCEEDINGS NKHKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE many and a good many have spoken to me, if the membership were not crowded down to the eastern border, all of the five men on the Board and they are active, ardent, workers for the State Fair and the State Board of Agriculture, are living in the eastern part of the district, and wa feel we are entitled to a little better representation out there and I will tell you why. I do not want to stand here for very long, but I do want to pound some things into your heads because I think it is a fair proposition; as I told you a bit ago three-fourths of this state, so far as area is concerned, is represented by only seven men on the State Board. In the southeast quarter of the state every county is either represented by a member on the State Board or is adjacent to a county represented. Do you think the western part does not amount to anything? We are the leaders in the sugar beet industry of this state, Scotts Bluff county is the leader in the sugar beet industry and we are coming to the front in alfalfa raising; in grains we are in the lead and, as I told you last year, of the forty banner counties in the state, as designated by Mr. Bushnell of the Trade Review, eleven of the forty of the entire state were in the thirteen counties in western Nebraska, that is the Panhandle, as we call it. On our stock raising proposition there is no question but what we are leaders. I just want to tell you about this. I came down with the Sheridan county delegation, believe me they are some delegation; they let me ride with them. One of the men on that train shipped seven cars of hogs, one day apart, one car one day, one car the next day and so on for the seven days. He topped the market sax days, the other day coming within five csnts of it, showing we are doing something in stock raising. And as far as blooded stock is concerned, in the western end of the state, in propor - tion to the number of people and area we have the best Herefords there are in the state. I am asking this of you simply because there is an element of fairness in it. I do not want to slam the fourth district at all, believe I have some friends down there, but it is merely an element of fairness to give us a representative in western Nebraska. I did not get the motion right, I intended the one extra member should be chosen from one of the eleven counties in the Panhandle territory of western Nebraska so as to get the member there, that is my plea, I think it is fair. One should come from the thirteen counties, my intention was to put that in the motion, but I want to see what you fellows are going to do with, it, — that is the proposition. I thank you kindly for listening to me, we want this and we are entitled to it. Ollis: I guess we all understand the motion, gentlemen, are you ready for the question? McArdle: This has been threshed out before, a word in regard to the fourth. As I understand the reason why they have six, and also the reason why the second got three, my friend said the second was well sat - isfied with three — we are because we had to be. As I understand the prop - osition fifty per cent of the attendance at the State Fair comes around the fourth district and I think about fifty, sixty or seventy per cent that </seg>
            <seg id="p017">17 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE &lt;: actually goes to make the Fair comes from the inside districts. With all due respect to my friend, I do not think we get much attendance from that part of the northwest and you will have to look at the attendance at the Fair, you will have to look at the exhibitors. That was the situa - tion at that time, in giving the big fourth representation, we were sure of attendance and they were given six, the rest five with the exception of the second which got three, and I guess that is all they are entitled to. Blake: I am really not an accredited delegate at this meeting ana may be my remarks might be cut of order. I am delegated by the Adams County Fair Association to this meeting, but inasmuch as we are not com - pletely in line working out there at the present time I understood I could not be rsgistered properly and if, therefore, I am unable to talk I would like to be told before I sit down. Ollis: I suppose you could be barred from talking, but if there are no objections you will be allowed to talk for a short time. Blake: In 1910 I was at that time living in Cheyenne county, in one of thos3 thirteen counties and I brought down, as near as I can learn, the first of our exhibits from that western country. From then on have come exhibits each year until at the present time I think you will find from those thirteen counties not less than six of them repressnted each year with exhibits at your State Fair. Is it not true, Mr. Mellor? Mellor: I think so. Blake: I know positively Mitchell, Scotts Bluff, Morrill, Cheyenne, Deuel, Kimball and I think Dawss were all on deck this last year, which is seven out of the thirteen. I think if I had time to look up the matter I would find more. Those people in 1910 starting to bring seven exhibits from the far west meant much. I live in Adams County, as I stated be - fore, and I think it is essential that the east and west get a little bit closer than they are at the present time, for our western country is growing fast and the attendance and exhibits from that part of the country are grow - ing each and every year, and I think, gentlemen, as Mr. Lawrence said a few moments ago, I think it would be a great injustice and if you will look into the matter and study what they are bringing in each year, it would be a great injustice if those thirteen counties are denied a repre - sentative on the State Board when seven of them, and I think from now on the majority of them, will be seen here with exhibits. I thank you. Agee: I seconded the gentleman's motion over here wnen ue made it. When he made the motion I did not know what he was going to say, but he has convinced me he is right. That portion of the state is entitled to the representation and I for one am going to vote that way. You say it is taking it from the fourth district; the sixth district has the most peo - ple, they have the farthest to come, the fourth is right here and it does not cost them so much to come, consequently more come from there, but in the past years those people in the sixth have been poor and could not afford to come, but in the last few years they have been making money and now come down in train loads to the legislature and to these meetings and I </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE believe we should recognize them and give them another delegate. 1 believe it is only fair, that they are entitled to it and I for one will vote that way. Mitchell: I would like to ask for information, if the number of this Board is limited, if it is impossible to make any additions. Ollis: Limited to twenty-nine members by statute. Mitchell: I happen to be in the fourth district and while I feel there should be more representatives, if possible, in the western end of the state, we are all proud of the progress the western end of the state is making, at the same time our fourth district is also making progress. In Thayer county, we are in the fourth, we have established one of the big - gest little county fairs in the state of Nebraska in the last four years and I do not believe there has been a member on the State Board from our county since Page Hendershot was a member of the Board. We are growing in the fourth also in Interest in fair work and it works injustice to pick a man from there and put him on the other side. Smith: I live in the sixth, south line of the sixth district. It has been stated here by our friend McArdle from the second district that our at - tendance at the State Fair is generally made up of people close at home. That is true. McArdle and myself hesitate about paying our railroad fare the last few years when we have to go a long ways from home, and the people from the northwest part of the state feel the same as we do. It is true we draw from close at home, they are increasing in the fourth, as the gentleman from Thayer has stated. It is also true that the peo - ple in the sixth are increasing in population faster than any other district in the state and the vote shows it. If the vote as given by the gentle - man from the sixth district, from Chadron, is not correct then we have nothing to guide us; we know it is correct. When the apportionment was made it was right, no one denies that fact, the sixth district then had no right to come here and ask for an extra delegate; they did not ask for it, they did ask for it two years ago and a committee was appointed to side track it and it was put to sleep to rise no more. I do not believe in pilfering from the fourth when they cannot afford to lose any, it might work a hardship on some of my friends, were it not for the fact that five should be elected at this time and I believe in putting the five in the jack pot and letting the chips fall where they will. The sixth is entitled to another delegate; if the association wants to be fair — I take it we have only one interest in this house and that is the betterment of the agricul - tural districts of Nebraska — it will not be an injustice on the fourth to ask them to give us another in the sixth, therefore I feel at this time prompted to vote for an increase in this district. Graff: Gentlemen, and Chairman of the Board of Agriculture; this is not a new matter. The boys from the big sixth have been down here be - fore and set up a holler. I remember my friend McArdle and myself were on the committee, with our old friend Charlie Mann, now deceased, and a couple of others. They had taken this up two yean ago and the re- </seg>
            <seg id="p019">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AQE1CULTL BE 19 port we made, I guess, was not any good — in fact nothing came of it. The feeiing at that time existed that the big sixth was not being represented according to its population and agricultural resources, compared with other districts in the state. 1 can imagine this, that the most popular man who will have a vote in this body from the fourth district will be the man who, in the goodness of his haart, will take the floor and be willing to give to the sixth from the fourth one delegate. Being from the third, I do not want to take anything from the fourth; there are some mighty big men in the fourth — bigger than I am or perhaps any other delegate from the third. I would like to see this thing brought about from the men in the fourth congressional district. I want to say to you men that if you turn these men down, with the plea they have made, with the rights on their side, you will not get rid of it. These fellows are growing so fast that they will be coming down here next year and thay will make a bigger holler and will unhorse a whole bunch of us if we do not give them a fair show. Just think of it — a special train of Pullman cara carrying a bunch of hayseeds, coming clear across the state of Nebraska to take in these winter meetings. Stop and realize what it is, stop and compare that bunch of men in numbers with perhaps the bench from the fourth district. I tell you we owe these fellows something, ana I believe if I were in the fourth district and my mother was here I would be compelled to stand up and fight for the men from the sixth congres - sional district on this proposition. Roberts: I feel there is a great deal of merit in this resolution just offered from the western part of the state. The sixth district a few years ago had a representative, as good and able a man as we have ever had on the State Board of Agriculture — Uncle Charlie Mann. When Uncle Charlie Mann left this Board, it was my duty to appoint a man from the sixth district. I did that after studying the matter over carefully and thought the western part of the sixth was entitled to a representative and I appointed a man from the western part of that district and candidly believe, gentlemen, that if the western part of the district had a representative at the present time this delegation would not be so insistent for making a change from the fourth to the sixth. So far as the attendance at our State Fair from the sixth district or the district sur - rounding Lincoln is concerned, if we put a delegate out there would not that be an incentive to those men to come here as they come to Lincoln this time with a delegation. If you could have seen the delegation as I did, I came with them on from Fremont, it seems to me they were one of the most enthusiastic bunch of men 1 have ever met. One man made the remark, "If it was necessary we could come to the Lincoln State Fair with a train the same as we are doing now," and I believe if we belp our western Nebraska in this way they will help our State Fair. Those men will be interested and will come here with a delegation that will be a benefit and we will be proud of the western part of the state.

            <seg id="p020">20 l'RIX KEDINCiS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tendance from the fourth district, but it has been my pleasure to be at two or three county fairs that lie in this part of the country which we have under discussion, these thirteen counties, and I believe the way they turn out to a county fair out there if you would move the State Fair for one year to Scottsbluff, you would have a bigger crowd there than you ever saw at Lincoln. I want to tell you they go somewhere out there and they keep going until they get there. At one county fair 1 was at there were ten thousand people on the grounds and you would have had to take in two or three counties to get those people. We see more people here all the time and it has been stated that seven out of those thirteen counties made an agricultural exhibit last year at the Fair. I do not know how many exhibits there were altogether, nineteen I think. Seven out of nineteen from the Panhandle district, that left twelve out of the other eighty counties that exhibited here and from the points of an agricul - tural exhibit in those western counties, they can skin some of you in the eastern counties to death. I have looked over the exhibits in the eastern part of the state and the western part of the state; now in some of the stock departments they perhaps have not as good a show but in one par - ticular county in the west they have the best cattle exhibit I ever saw, in Chadron, they have the best show of white faced cattle in that country I ever saw anywhere outside of the State Fair and they should be recognized. Wake: I am the youngest member of the Board, in point of service, and am from the fourth district and believe it is up to me to say to the big sixth that I will step down and out and give the sixth my place on the Board. Ollis: I do not believe any member should step down and out. Keedle: I think that depends on how the ballots are cast tomorrow, who will be out and who in. Hoffmeistar: I do not believe there is a man in here but what takes pride in our State Fair and in our great state of Nebraska, and its re - sources. It was my pleasure to represent our district in the legislature for several seasons and I stood on the floor of the house there and have talked to the members of the eastern portion of the state and tried to bring before them the great westsrn portion of our state. I have intro - duced a resolution to appropriate money to send for newspaper men to come west and see what we have, because the greatest enemy western Nebraska has is eastern Nebraska, simply because a few years ago we had to beg for a little bit of aid you have held that against us ever sincu. You do not realize that the little short grass county I represent, Chase, Mr. Mellor will tell you raised more wheat than any other county in ths state of Nebraska. You can beat us on fruit, but not on grain. You cannot beat us on cattle, we ship five or six car loads every week from our little county. I think I see the solution of this, the big fourth is not willing to grant a delegate to the sixth. I think we should introduce a bill to the legislature to take in another member, make it thirty, thirty- </seg>
            <seg id="p021">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE llOAIU) OF AGRICULTURE 21 one or thirty-two in place of twenty-nina because this legislature consists of farmers — forty-four farmer members — and I do believe with forty-four men on the floor of that house to advocate another member or two in addition to the twenty-nine we have now, that it would give us a fair so - lution of the problem. Lawrence: I do not believe in this argument brought up, that there is any such feeling existing between the western part of the state 1 repre - sent and the eastern. That is not the proposition, it is merely that we have the goods, we have the people, we are entitled to it — that is all. There is an element of fairness that comes into the proposition, we are entitled to it and we want it. My friend from the fourth says he will give up his plats. I have not felt it is up to any individual member to give up his place o\ the Board, it is only because there are five men to be elected in the fourth district at this time. No one individual, unless he has a great deal of intuition, or else knows how these fellows are going to vote, knows which one will be turned down, if one member was taken from the fourth and given to the sixth. While I thank this gentleman kindly, still I do not believe he himself knows he is the man to be turned down. If there are four to be elected there may be six nominated,. it de - pends upon the vote as to who gets there. I do not ask any individual to give up his place, I ask that one of the five places be elected from the sixth and only four elected from the fourth. Is that clear? Agee: 1 move — McArdle: I do not believe the motion was fairly understood, that im - plies two propositions. You want to transfer one from the fourth to the sixth, but you also stated you wished to pick some specific part of the sixth for this particular one. Now those are the two propositions, get it clear; I think the last would be out of order and you could not pick out any particular part of it. Lawrence: I did not have it in the motion and did not know whether it was in order. The motion as I made it was merely that the sixth dis - trict be allowed one extra member on the State Board of Agriculture and that the one extra member — since the total number is limited by statute — would have to be taken from another district, be taken from the fourth district. Ollis: It is moved that a member be taken from the fourth and given to the sixth. Seconded and carried. Danielson: I want to say, gentlemen, it seems that I am a member from the fourth district and we have been more or less, picked on and one of our members has seen fit to get up and sacrifice himself to this cause. I do not think it is necessary because of five of us who come up in the fourth this year, some one is going to have to sacrifice and I am willing to abide by the vote of this body on that matter and if it comes to me to sacrifice, I shall take it like a man. </seg>

SECRETARY'S REPORT State Fair A diversifying feature was added to the usual preparations for the Nebraska State Fair in 1916 which was entirely new to the manage - ment. In the month of August news flashed over the country that a general tie-up of the railroads of the United States would occur on September 4th— the opening date of the Fair. The week before the Fair the railroad sent out orders to their agents not to receive for shipment stock or merchandise which could not be delivered at its destination by September 2nd. Many agents throughout the state advised our exhibitors not to ship, in accordance with such order. This caused a cancellation of space assigned from some of the more timid and a multiplicity of telegrams and telephone calls from others anxious to exhibit. Our Board issued an order that all stock would be housed and fed at the grounds from the Sunday subsequent to the State Fair, left there by reason of inability to move same on account of the railroad strike. This order satisfied our exhibitors go that very few </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE failed to come. This condition caused concern to the management and the Lincoln boosters of the Fair. The "Lancaster County Citizen" voiced the sentiment of our people in the following article: To the Rescue, Lancaster County If the threatened railway strike becomes a reality it will bring a great hardship upon the Nebraska State Fair. All arrangements have been made for a stupendous exposition this year. These preparations and the exhibits will cost an enormous amount of money. With a general strike on the management will stand to lose the bulk of this expenditure, for the railways will be unable to bring the people to Lin - coln. This will cut down the attendance from distant points. Lancaster County can play the role of the rescuing hero, in this situation. Every man, woman and child in the county should come to the Fair, not once but many times. Lincoln can be reached from every part of the county in a short time by auto, buggy or Shank's mare, if you please. With Lancaster County folks lined up solidly behind the Fair in this emer - gency, they can make up the deficit which may be caused if the strike takes place. This co-operation will pull the management through without lass. Municipal Assistance The additional work placed upon the sheriff, his deputies, the police force and the water department of the city in the holding of a great exposition on its border is little appreciated by our people. For two weeks prior to the Fair every suspect arrival in the city is under police surveillance. The known crooks who come to the city are thrown into jail on some charge or other, and then given their choice of leaving town until after the Fair or laying in jail. One of the biggest jobs to handle is the traffic at the business inter - sections of the city during the period when the Fair crowds are the largest. The great increase in the visiting automobiles is a matter of considerable moment. Officers are often times compelled to be on duty from fourteen to eighteen hours at a stretch. The small amount of pocket picking and crime during the Fair is largely the result of the official activity preceding and at the time of the Fair. The immense increase in demanded capacity of the water depart - ment of Lincoln can be faintly comprehended when it is realized that the ordinary amount of water used by the normal city is doubled during the State Fair. This peak load at a time when so many visitors are in the city is a matter of concern and preparation for the water depart - ment; from my observation the city commission and these public de - partments are entitled to our commendation for their untiring efforts to make the Nebraska State Fair a success. Guard* A departure from the ordinary policy of the State Fair was neces - sitated by the absence of the State Militia in service on the Mexican </seg>
            <seg id="p025">PROCEEDINGS MillKASKA STATE HOAKli OK AUBKULTUBE ■M&gt; border. Adjutant General P. L. Hall, Jr., retained command of the guards, who were made up of private citizens from over the state. The work of these men was highly satisfactory under the handicap of not being able to properly clothe them in uniform suits. Car Service The Burlington railroad secured permission from the Railway Com - mission to cease running their shuttle trains to and from the Fair grounds on a basis of the proposed strike and although the strike failed to materialize they did not run the shuttle train or make any effort to do so. The City Traction Company exerted themselves to their utmost and during rush hours moved a car from 11th &amp; P streets at the rate of one every minute and twenty seconds, a capacity of about 4,500 people per hour. On the days of heavy attendance, to-wit: Wednesday and Thursday, the people could not all come without some delay but the excellent service maintained did not permit of serious delay. Thousands walked to and from the grounds, in addition to those coming in vehicles. In former years public gatherings were altogether dependent on the rail - roads where the distance to be traveled exceeded ten or a dozen miles, but now, in keeping with the age of advancement, railroads are but one factor towards the transportation problem. During the Fair the automobile brought thousands of people to Lin - coln and parking space was at a premium. The number of machines applying for admission at our 17th street entrance is a matter of serious concern, to the management. If the cars continue to increase in the next year or two as in the past, more gates of entrance and exit will have to be provided. Some plan of checking a car must be worked out so that no car can be taken from the grounds without a badge of specific ownership being delivered at the gate. This is due as a matter of diligence for the care of a patron's machine. To park three or four thousand automobiles is a tremendous job and can only be done by a master mind, clothed with the proper authority. To handle a force of men necessary to see that each car goes to the place assigned is not one of the smallest contracts at the State Fair. National Guard During the months of June and July the Nebraska State Militia mobilized for duty on the State Fair grounds. This mobilization puv the Board to a considerable expense for city water, plumbing, and extra labor — a bill which has been in course of allowance by the United States War Department for more than six months, has been paid. We cheer - fully commend Adjutant General Phil L. Hill, Jr., the officers and indi - vidual members of the militia for the care exercised in keeping the buildings and improvements from damage during their stay. The report to the war department found fault with the mobilization ground for the reason that "the men were compelled to camp on overflow </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE land." This, under present conditions, is merely a dream of bygone years. Some eight years ago we constructed a dam on the west side of the grounds extending about 3,200 feet from the south edge of our land to the Rock Island switch track on the north. On about one-half of this distance the dyke averages more than six feet in heighth. Since its construction no overflow has occurred on the land used for State Fair purposes, although the valley has been flooded annually. The Oak Creek drainage ditch put through some two years ago and running north of our land limits the heighth of the floods materially. Grading During the year, up until December 21st, the Board contracted and paid for a total of 18,241 cubic yards of grading. This, with the excep - tion of 1,942 cubic yards in the excavation and fill for the new dining hall and 2,324 cubic yards in grading the race track, has been for the purpose of filling the old bed of Antelope Creek. The total expenditure for same is $4,804.96. If the same amount of dirt can be secured and dumped on this low ground west of the swine barns and within the dyke during the coming year we shall have added several acres of very valuable land to our grounds, and in a location where it can be the most useful, being but a short block from the street car entrance and by far the most easy of access for live stock accommodations. Restaurants Nineteen Hundred and Sixteen witnessed a marked improvement in restaurant facilities on the west side of Dunham Avenue. The old, unsightly buildings were razed and a modern State Fair restaurant building 60x200 feet, divided into five separate dining rooms and kitchens, was erected at an expense of $5,000.00. Walk* During the year a cement walk from the street car entrance to Dunham Avenue, and a stone walk from University Hall square to the Dairy building on the east side of Dunham Avenue has been laid at a cost of 1310.00. Repairs, Race Track Subsequent to the holding of the 1916 Fair the race track has been re-braced, inside ditches dug and a new inside fence constructed. In this particular work $348.60 was paid for moving dirt; $20.00 for engineer; $254.45 for labor; $58.00 for paint and $141.33 for lumber— a total of $822.58. Sheep This is the first year an experiment has been tried by purchasing sheep for the purpose of keeping down the weeds on the grounds. The </seg>
            <seg id="p027">PBOCEEDIN08 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 27 Board of Managers bought 239 Merino ewes last April at a cost of $1,857.15, delivered on the grounds. The shearing of same cost (28.32 and about $20.00 was paid for feed, when first received. The wool sheared from the sheep brought $439.52 and the sale of the flock $2,295.00, part of which has been paid since the first day of January and does not appear in the financial statement of last year. The purpose for which the sheep were purchased resulted quite satisfactorily to the Board as the flock effectually kept down all weeds on the grounds. This is the first year since we have had charge of these grounds that we have not paid out for cutting weeds. Live Stock In view of the threatened strike the exhibit of live stock was one of the wonders of the 1916 Fair. When, under such conditions, the barns are completely filled it speaks well for Nebraska as a recognized breeding center and market for pure bred stock. The cattle and swine departments are making insistent demands for additional quarters, which must be recognized very soon. We are really in need of 1,000 swine pens for the 1917 show and it is hoped that the bill for a new swine barn with such capacity will be successful before the present legislature. The present cattle barn is required to house the beef breeds and a new dairy cattle barn is almost a necessity. Ladies' Department It is truly wonderful that the ladies' department continue to improve under the handicaps to modern methods of showing with which they have to contend. As now arranged, it is impossible to study the great mass of costly workmanship with which the textile department is filled to overflowing. Some method for showing under glass should be arranged so that our patrons might make a close study in order to secure edu - cational advantages such as is our aim to impart. When we think of the absolute necessity for a woman's building so that the women and girls can take part in their sphere for making the Nebraska State Fair the peer of any in the United States, which cannot be done until the facilities are provided, and which we hope it will be possible to recog - nize in the near future with a substantial building suitable for all the requirements necessary for all woman's field of activity. Exposition Hall We hope the Agriculture-Horticulture people will excuse us for call - ing their splendid exposition building "Exposition Hall." If it does not fit. we know of no building on any state fair grounds in the United States more entitled to the name. President Cameron of the Iowa State Fair said, when viewing the remarkable showing of agriculture and horticulture made by the county </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 l'KOl KKDINGS NK11K.VSKA STATE BOARD OF AUKll.UI.llKt exhibitors, "Nebraska is in a class all by itself," and we think his judg - ment expresses the actual condition. This (act has been attained by years of hard work by the showmen in these departments. That we are especially fortunate in having such a number of loyal, public spirited citizens as those who make such a show in agriculture, horticulture and floriculture possible — a set of men whose first and only ideal is to benefit and help advertise their home state in such a manner as to command the respect and attention of the entire exhibit world, a show which is often measured not only by hard labor, small recompense and often times absolute loss, still they are always at their post of duty in their effort to uphold the fair name of Nebraska. Such loyalty will emblazon their names on the roll of agricultural achievement, a golden link in the memory of their lives. This Exposition Hall also included within its capacious dimensions the very best educational exhibit shown in the United States. More than 9,000 square feet of wall space was covered, a school in Home Economics was maintained, rural schools demonstrated and many other features of present interest in advanced public school work. Last but not least in this wonderful Exposition Hall was held the best of all— the "better babies" exhibit— of such interest this year that timid exhibitors under the balcony on which the crowds viewing same congregated imagined the balcony rafters were cracking so additional uprights were placed to allay all fears. This particular department should be moved to the center of the Art and Textile building. University The University of Nebraska entirely fills their large building with an increasingly interesting exhibit each year. In addition to the meritorious departments of last year was an excellent showing of drug plants, doctors and pharmacists implements by the new college of pharmacy lately established. The complete display of various types of plant diseases was a department especially appreciated by our rural patrons. The journalism classes, debating organizations, engineering college and legislative reference bureau had meritorious exhibits, while the customary thousands viewed the Nebraska scenes in the "movie" theatre to which one wing of the building has been assigned. The exhibits from the State Farm covered all phases of auimal and plant life and is an exhibit deeply appreciated by our farmer friends. Boys' Camp The Boys' Camp of 1916 was a highly successful and appreciated department. Forty-six counties were represented with 109 boys and nine camp leaders in addition to the officials and teachers in charge. As one boy reports: "I was benefitted, first, morally; second, intellectually, and third, physically." Another says: "We are taught lessons in loyalty and obedience; the association with leaders, the camp fire talks </seg>
            <seg id="p029">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 29 and the splendid instruction will be a help and inspiration to me all through my life." Such ideals are a composite of nearly all reports re - ceived. Nine of the boys are now enrolled in the School of Agriculture, therefore this camp may be the stepping stone in the development of some of the great men of the future. If this is a possibility, this Board will receive another added star in its crown of usefulness. Better Babies This exhibit still demands the attention of parents in a growing degree with each succeeding year. One hundred and eighty-nine babies were examined, of which six were defectives. The defective depart - ment was added as an experiment this year. One disagreeable feature heretofore practiced in this department should be eliminated: in the past if two or more babies tied in the score each would be given the same position and the money divided. For example, in the rural class, girl 18 months and under 27, two girls tied on score for first and the money divided, each receiving $5.00 while the fifth in point of score received $8.00. Although a full list of ribbons was purchased and on hand, still, by the method adopted, they could not be awarded at the proper time and neither can the necessary ribbons be anticipated. Music Two years, ago, owing to restricted finances, the large foreign band was dropped from our program and in its place the best bands of the state were employed. At the last Fair, in addition to the Nebraska State band and the George Green band was employed, the Kilties, the Canadian Concert band, carrying twenty-five men and a soloist. These three bands were employed for the entire week and in addition, the state bands from Scottsbluff, Ainsworth, Superior and Berdon furnished programs. The Grand Opera Double Quartette, the Messiah Chorus and the soloists with the with the bands were very much appreciated by our patrons. A strong demand, however, is constantly made for a large foreign band and grand opera company of singers. Machinery The machinery department has again regained its old time pro - portions in point of exhibit. While two or three firms still hold out a number of new ones with growing exhibits have been added and this department is of such a magnitude as to be fully appreciated by this Board and our patrons. Automobile* The automobile exhibit entirely filled the great hall to overflowing. Many exhibitors could not secure space inside so pitched their tents and made a display on adjoining ground. We are glad to see that the dealers are alive to the opportunity presented at an exposition gathering. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The automobile has done as much to change conditions on the farm as the telephone and rural delivery- It is no uncommon thing for a farmer to get in his auto after supper and go ten or fifteen miles to town. This elimination of distance and ease of travel brings a closer relationship between the resident of the farm and the city and goes to better farm conditions especially for young people. Auto Racing. It is not often that patrons have so many thrills as were provided in about three minutes of the twenty-five mile auto race on Monday, September 4th, at the Nebraska State Fair. Three tires on different machines blew up in as many minutes, one of them on a Chrevolet driven by Red Schaeffer, near the last end of the first turn on the thirty-third lap. The car, going at the rate of a mile a minute, became unmanageable and ran into the outside 56-inch heavy wire fence, break - ing off three of the large posts before it could be stopped. The driver was unharmed and the strict adherence to the I. M. C. A. rules which provide for a clear field for forty feet away from the fence was deeply appreciated in its observance by the management. Such drivers as "Wild Bill" Endicott, Eddie Hearn, Johnny Mais, Clark, Woodbury, Schaeffer, Lecocq and Elfreida Mais are not often gathered together for one State Fair meet and their work, under the management of Sloan &amp; Dorward, was of a high order of excellence. Auto racing with proper safeguards will be an excellent attraction for some time to come. Speed The old standby of horse racing still gathers its adherents (and they are legion) at the grandstand. The breeders of fast horses for the past several years have been in a struggle for existence but we confidently believe the bottom of the hill has been passed and the indus - try is again on the up-grade. We have been exceedingly fortunate in the assembling of satisfactory fields of horses and our patrons have not been disappointed with the contests offered. Treasurer George F. Dickman, a man who had filled more positions at and attended more consecutive State Fairs than any other man in Nebraska since the death of Robert W. Furnas, passed away on March 6, 1916. At the time of his death he was treasurer for this Board. On March 27th Mr. Jacob Sass, of Chalco, was appointed and qualified as treasurer, to fill the vacancy for the balance of the year.

Legislative Bills The Board has prepared and will urge (or passage a bill for $100,000 with which to build a modern swine barn. This seems at first thought a large sum to ask for this improvement, but when we stop to consider that we must erect a building larger than could be placed over an entire city block in order to have space for the 1,000 necessary pens, with accompanying aisles, to properly house this great department even at the present time, we can readily conceive that the magnitude of the space to be covered with permanent construction calls for this amount under existing building conditions. Another bill introduced is for the purpose of securing more reliable data as to acreage planted to crops, so as to improve the statistical service with which this Board is entrusted under the law. Statistic* The gathering of agricultural statistics is one of the duties per - formed by our office in accordance with the Revised Statutes, Chapter 1, Article IX. The real basis for all statistics gathered is the acreage as found by the assessors in the various counties. The law says the assessors are charged with this work. Many of them are lax in the performance of duty, which entails additional burden on the office In securing the information from other sources. If they would realize that we are the farmers' safeguard, and the only one, from the wiles of speculators they would make an extraordinary effort to give accurate information. The United States Bureau of Crop Estimates gathers these statistics, the manipulators on the Board of Trade have men traveling over the state making their reports and such men are employed for the purpose of placing advance information in the hands of their employers, who are not particular as to the farmers' interests above their own, so that the gathering of these statistics by our Board is the farmers' real safeguard. No man is hurt by knowledge but his ignorance Is often quite costly. If the gathering of this information ceased, we should have no safeguard from the manipulation of designing money-makers. Take the report on corn for the year 1916, as an example. The preliminary report of the U. S. Department was 209,000,000 bushels. We called their attention to the fact that we could find but 190,070,449 bushels and their report came down to 193,000,000 bushels on the first of the next month. This difference may not appeal to the unthinking mind but still such a difference has an effect on the price received for the corn on the farm and such difference is not in favor of the farmer. The law specifically states that our duties are to compile, collate and publish. This duty adds about three months labor to our entire office force, as a tremendous amount of detail figuring is necessary. We are </seg>

As we have already published a full statistical report on the crops for 1916, as issued in Bulletin No. 210 and in the annual report, we shall not give further figures here. Publicity Our office has mailed out 42,000 copies of "Nebraska," an edition devoted to the growing crop conditions and items of interest for the annual State Fair; 18,000 advance sheets containing sectional parts of the premium list; mailed and distributed about 90,000 of the bulletins which have been published each week, Bulletin No. 172 having had a circulation of 23,000, numerous demands for same having been received from outside the state which were furnished to those who requested same when accompanied with funds for printing; 5,000 copies of the premium list; 5,000 calendars; 5,000 boys' caps, together with 5,000 copies of our annual report make up the balance of the larger items handled in the office, in addition to the regular mail pertaining to the State Fair, agriculture and publicity. It is safe to say that items sent out from our office have been published by practically every newspaper in Nebraska. This is primarily due to the constant weekly visit we make them; many were stony at first but it is said that "constant dripping wears away a stone." The United States Department of Agriculture, in the tabulation of the estimated total value of thirteen crops, to-wit: Corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, flaxseed, rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes, tame hay, tobacco and lint cotton, gives the total valuation of the aggregate of the above named crops. From these figures, of all states with a valua - tion of more than 100 million, we have taken as a basis the rural popu - lation in each state named and find that the per capita in the various states from the agricultural production of the farms for 1916 is, in order, is follows: Rural Population Total 13 Crops Per Capita 1 NEBRASKA 2 South Dakota 3 Iowa 4 North Dakota 881,362 507,215 1,544,717 513,820 $343,655,000 165,598,000 470,159,000 155,816,000 $389.00 326.00 . 304.00 303.00 5 Kansas 6 Illinois 7 Washinton 8 Minnesota 9 Texas 0 Indiana 1,197,159 2,161,662 536,460 1,225,414 2,958,438 1,567,041 276,719,000 439,854,000 105,739,000 234,790,000 561,578,000 253,992.000 231.00 203.00 193.0G 191.00 189.00 163.00 </seg>

These county fairs took in $236,254.98 and paid out $233,067.48, showing but $3,187.50 on the right side of the ledger. However, a close study revealed the fact that a considerable amount of new improvements had been made and in a few instances old scores paid and, by the members, was considered a profitable season. Fifty-four of the fairs received county aid, which aggregated $43,196.20 or practically an average of $800.00. However, nine received less than $400.00, while Douglas County — in which Omaha is located — received over $6,000.00. One received over $3,000.00 and four over $1,000.00. all others between $400.00 and $1,000.00. The total amount of premiums offered was $86,471.22 of which was paid $45,250.48 or 52.3 per cent of the offering. The same county fairs offered $55,400.40 for speed, and paid out for same $41,658.11 or 75 per cent.

            <seg id="p036">34 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE suit will follow. The United States Government has passed several bills favoring experimentation in these channels. The activities along mar - keting lines by the farmers of Nebraska so far has been limited to the purchasing of commodities in car load lots, and the handling of live stock and grain at a limited number of points within the state. The success or failure of these experiments depend largely upon the ability of the manager. If the manager is a wide awake, level headed business man the organization will be successful but many wrecks will strew the wayside when incompetent or untrained business men are in charge. Co-operation in fruit growing has ben practiced in eastern Nebraska during the past two or three years win the result that on the Chicago and Minneapolis markets the commercial Nebraska winter apple com - mands the top price owing to its excellent flavor and superior keeping qualities. At the request of the United States Department of Agriculture the Nebraska Department of Agriculture has inaugurated a department of farm markets with a professor in charge who will make an extensive survey of the work accomplished throughout the state and be ready to assist in a compilation of data for public information. FARM LOAN BANK The law establishing twelve farm loan banks in the United States each with a nucleus of $750,000.00 subscribed by the people and at the end of 30 days the balance taken by the U. S. Government, has resulted in placing one of the banks on Nebraska soil, in Omaha. This district — Number 8 — is comprised of the states of Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming. The U. S. Census of 1910 gives this district a total valua - tion of all farm property of $7,158,965,252 which is in excess of more than 800 million dollars greater valuation than our nearest competitor, and a per capita valuation for our rural population, numbering for the district 3,036,038, of $2,358.00 which is $916.00 greater than any other district in the United States and more than the combined figures for the first five districts. These facts indicate that the Omaha bank will be the more easily financed and a great section of its territory will require but little service. However, the territory covered embraces much land in the early stages of development from which the demand for loans will be quite active. </seg>

            <seg id="p047">PKOIKEDINUS NkltKAKKA STATE BOAB1) OK AOKll I I.Tl KK 45 Smith: About the superintendent of speed, I will state no provision was made for the salaries of these two, this matter was left to the Board. In class J quite a number of changes were made but in the opinion of the committee, the classes were much better than they had been and we adopted it in its entirety. Smith: Mr. Chairman, as a member of your committee, I move its adoption as read. Seconded. Ollis: You have heard the report; it is moved and seconded that it be adopted as read. Any remarks? Leonard: In class A, I believe that is horses, in the pony display 1 do not know whether I made any recommendations or not in regard to the four-in-hand teams. I do not know for sure that I made a re - port; Mr. Mellor said once I did not make any report but I wrote him I did and have never heard from him since about it. In the four-in-hand pony teams last year we had a good deal of dispute among the ex - hibitors. One party claimed that each four-in-hand should have their own driver, that one driver should only drive one four-in-hand team and each team should have its own driver. In the exhibit last year there uas one man had one four-in-hand team and a man to drive it. An - other exhibitor had three four-in-hand teams and one driver only. To show each team he got out of one buggy and into another and it caused a little trouble. My opinion is one man should handle a team from start to finish. I make that as a suggestion. Ollis: You mean each rig should have a different driver? Leonard: I mean each four-in-hand should have its own driver. Smith: I rise to a question of information. The objection made there last year, as the committee saw it, was the fact that one exhibitor had an expert driver and the others objected. In all fairness I believe the same money as expended for one could be expended on another, if he wanted to compete against the experts with what ability he has, he could drive his own team, I think we should be careful about making any changes or we will get to where a man, in showing his live stock, would be prohibited from securing help, we might call it expert help, I think we should allow that, if a man wanted to make a better showing. If a man wants to expend a thousand dollars for a rig, he has my permission. Leonard: I think without doubt all the exhibitors in the pony class would work to their own advantage. No doubt the expert driver did not get there any better than the fellow who was not an expert driver but he would handle one team, come back and leave that standing, get out of one buggy and into another and then a second and third. If they wanted a man to drive each team, all right, no one objected to the expert work, I was not trying to infer that expert work should be cut </seg>
            <seg id="p048">46 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE out. I leave it to you whether a man should drive three teams if he chooses, or drive one team. Ollis: Do you wish to make that as a motion? Leonard: Yes, sir; I move each team have its own driver Seconded. Ollis: You have heard the motion, gentlemen, that each team have its own driver. Hoffmeister: I do not believe in that way of doing business. I believe we will go further next year and say a man cannot employ more than one jockey, that he cannot get from one sulky to another in the running races. One jockey would only be permitted to drive one horse, if we adopt this motion. The next thing will be one jockey will only be permitted to drive one horse. We will go further after a while and get into the cattle business where a man must employ one man to show each animal. I think a man has a perfect right to employ whom he pleases. Ollis: I think there is a point Mr. Leonard did not make plain, and I do not believe the members understand why he is making these remarks. Graff: The contention arose over this matter of one driver. I do not think it is understood, as the President has said. Here we have a class of four-in-hands, as they are called; here is your exhibitor with two entries in that class, that is, he has two outfits. He has a professional driver and that professional driver will take one of these outfits and show it while the judge is judging, he will jump out of one rig into another rig and drive that one. Well, the fellow who is not quite so strong in the show ring has only one outfit, which he does not like to drive against a professional driver twice; he would like to get along with one showing anyway. That is the difficulty, your exhibitor using a professional driver and showing two outfits when competing in the same class. The judge may say, "I would like to see those two outfits move at the same time in order to judge between them." I believe, gentlemen, it is largely a matter for the judge to decide and I have not heard any complaint from the judge. If the judge had made a complaint in this matter, I believe we could have taken it up but as a member of your committee I was silent when this was passed on and did not have anything to say, for that reason. Everybody wants to make as good a showing as he can make and I believe we have to give a little leeway to the exhibitors so they can do so. Leonard: The idea was not to cut out any expert work. I admire a man who will hire an expert to come and show his team, I believe he is far ahead of the man who puts an amateur behind his four-in-hand. My friend here called attention to the jockey; no jockey every rode two horses in one race — he can ride two horses in two races but you never saw a jockey ride one horse one mile and then get off and ride another horse the next mile in the same race. So far as I am concerned </seg>
            <seg id="p049">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 47 I do not care how you handle this, I would just as soon you would throw this suggestion out as to take care of it but I promised these men I would bring this up at this time. Ollis: Mr. Leonard, the rules say they should be judged sixty per cent on the horses and forty per cent on handling; that is where the idea comes in — whether a horse is handled better by an amateur driver or whether an expert driver shows it off to better advantage, that la the question. Leonard: That is the question exactly. If it is at all necessary to see them move at once it is impossible to do so when one driver handles two teams. I know this, the man this complaint was made against has made our pony show in this state; if it had not been for him it would not be one-third of what it is. The fellows who brought the complaint, one of them came in here and skinned him — I do not know how amateur he was. I thought the young fellow handled the ribbons pretty good. So far as hiring an expert driver or an expert showman is concerned, no one who wants to see a good show would advance anything against this. I know when I handled horses in the show ring I always wanted to hold the whip myself and do not blame any man for showing them to the best advantage but the idea of one man showing two rigs is the con - tention. I do not care what you do with this. Smith: I think, gentlemen, the only question is whether you want all these rigs shown at one time, but they cannot do so when one man drives more than one rig — that is the contention. I have no objection to your compelling these horses to be shown at one time, each with its own driver. It might compel a man to hire three experts if he had three entries, but if it makes a better showing to have them all move at once let us do so. I will take Colonel Leonard's judgment about that, if it makes a better showing to compel them to move at once and get drivers for each one. Leonard: Do you think five rigs would make as good a showing with four standing still as with all moving, to entertain an audience? Smith: No, it might be better to have them all move at once and if a man owns all four, let him furnish four drivers. Jackson: I move, to get this before the house, that no driver be allowed to drive more than one rig in the same class. Seconded and carried. Ollis: The matter comes up on the adoption of the report as read by Mr. Smih and amended by Mr. Jackson. All in favor of the motion to adopt the report of the committee say aye; contrary minded, no.

My understanding is that the fourth dis - trict is the only one where there is any contest and it would save a lot of time, in counting ballots, if we just voted for those in that district Ollis: I think that can be done if there is no objection. There is a blank line and any one can write in the name of another candidate, if they so desire. The men elected will be the ones nominated in these five district*.

The four receiving the highest number of votes, if a majority, will be elected. The one receiving the lowest vote of the four highest will have the short term, one year.

The time, of course, must come in aii organizations for a change of management It cannot be, that one per - son can always hold on, a change must come some time whether it is this year or some other. I am going to place in nomination the name of another candidate this morning and in doing so I would not take from Mr. Mellor one iota of the greatness he has attained and justly merited as a good secretary in years past. I am going to place before you this morning the name of a man with whom you are all well ac - quainted, a man who has worked on the Board, the State Board of Agriculture, for a good many years. He needs no Introduction to the members of the State Board of Agriculture, he probably needs no intro - duction to four-fifths or perhaps a greater per cent of the delegates here — E. R. Danielson. I want to say for Mr. Danielson, in presenting his name, that he has been very active in the State Fair, the State Board of Agriculture work. He la a fanner, and a good one. He is a stock- </seg>
            <seg id="p053">PROCEEDINGS NEBBABKA STATE BOABD OF AGBICULTTJBE 51 man, and a good one. He is a business man, and a good one. Mr. Danielson has been identified with the stock interests of the State Board, of the State Fair, is acquainted with most of the stockmen of any prominence in the state and I think has done as much for the stock interests of the state as any man we have ever had on the Board. If I did not believe that E. R. Danielson was qualified for the place I want to assure you, gentlemen, I would not be on my feet at this time pre - senting his name to you. I want to present the name, Mr. Chairman, of E. R. Danielson at this time for Secretary. Graff: (I believe I will have to get out of this hole for a little room). Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the convention: I have reached a stage as a member in connection with the State Board of Agriculture where I want to second the nomination that has been made and I want to tell you, to begin with, that I do not want to preface it by saying I take pleasure because I don't. It is for what. I believe the good of the State Board of Agriculture and the success of the Fair and the harmony that can be brought about by those men who have to conduct this State Fair, that I want to second that nomination. For the years I have been connected with this Board, to a man I have been able to work with them to my satisfaction and, I hope, to the satisfaction of those that I worked with. You know, gentlemen, that for several years there has been a storm brewing and you know I have done my part to keep it down. I have been scratched on the back and I have had men use the press to natter me here and there to get me to turn against the men that were at the head of the State Board of Agriculture but I could not see it that way and cannot now, but gentlemen, in order for our Board to accomplish the best that can be accomplished, we must have some unity — we must be able to give in to one another; the minority at least must be such that they can give in to the majority in order to be able to go along with the work. I cannot go into detail and tell you of the little things and the big ones that have sprung up during the past num - ber of years but will cite you one case. The Horticultural Society of the state has been making part of the exhibit at the State Fair; we have nothing to say in any way. We pay them $1,200.00 a year and they take the thing and run it. I have been told by members of this Board that they have been asked to make a report of the premiums awarded to the State Board of Agriculture and they have strongly intimated that it was none of our business. Now that won't work, gentlemen. The live stock interests of this state and the agricultural interests of the state can come to us and say: "We have consolidated our business, we now feel that we want to take over a section of our Fair grounds and run it to suit ourselves." Gentlemen, I asked Mr. Mellor last night if, for the sake of harmony, for the future good of the State Board of Agri - culture, if he could not at this time see his way clear to step down at least for a short period of time in order to have that harmony that we should have. Mr. Mellor frankly told me that he was going to fight. </seg>

I do not want to be a pussy footer or a gum shoer, 1 cannot do it, men,' it is not in me. It is not because Secretary' Mellor and 1 have in the past ever had any trouble, gentlemen, he is one of the greatest secretaries for this kinu of work that I know of and I believe men of other states know of. He has been honored by the Association of Fairs of the United States as their president, he is a man known all over the country, but Mr. Mellor claims he does not need this office — it is not for the salary — and I asked him would he not step down at this time because there is friction enough that he is aware of that could be removed and if it does not work out, gentlemen, Mr. Mellor will not be to blame, we all know that. This morning when 1 came up here a prominent man of this state told me that if such a thing was done, if W. R. Mellor was put out as secretary, iliey with their publication and newspaper men would get into this fight for keeps and there would be some fur flying. He said "if there is going to be a political machine, we will let you know we are in it." I said "all right, turn loose, go uhead. it cannot be helped." Men, we are either right or we are wrong and for the good of the State Board of Agriculture and the State Fair in the future is why I this morning second the nomination of Ed. Danielson. Roberts: If I were to take up your time for one hour I could not get you better acquainted with Mr. Mellor than you are now. He is recognized as a man of great capability not only in this state but all over the United States. 1 have watched this State Fair grow from a sapling to a great, bearing fruit tree and it seems to me now you are about to prune it, or attempt it, and I would say, gentlemen, be very careful you do not take off limbs that will cripple the State Fair for some time to come and maybe kill it entirely. I hope you will think this matter over seriously before the vote is cast. Ollis: Any other nominations? If not we will proceed to ballot for the election of secretary. Mellor: Mr. Graff used the words "there was a lack of unity." I did not know it before, I have worked to the best of my ability this year for this Board. I have done everything I could to further Mr. Ollis' campaign and his direction of this Board. I do not think Ollis can put his finger on a thing I have not done for the best interests of the State Board of Agriculture. If he can, I am perfectly willing to have him do so and I will answer any questions he may ask. As for the unity part, I do not think there is anything in it. There are one or two per - sons on the Board who would like to have the office, that is the fact of the case, and if this manner of going after it will get it, let them. He spoke of "pussy footing" and "gum shoeing," I was at the county fair meeting last night doing my best to entertain and instruct your county fair men all within my power while this pussy footing and gum shoeing was going on last night.

If I am going to work against them I will work against them openly and let the people know the actual conditions, not take snap judgment in any way. I have nothing but the utmost regard for these men in fair work and have done, without a murmur, without con - tention, just what this Board has asked to be done. I think these men would justify me in that statement, and I thought our Hoard was getting along splendidly, absolutely 1 did. I was under the impression we had gotten rid of all the old trouble and were getting along; that is the position I want to take and have taken, gentlemen, and assure you. you have all known that what W. R. Mellor has done he has done in the open and he has tried to do the best he could for the State Board of Agriculture to make it a grand success. Mitchell: I just want to say a word or two from the outside. I aiu not a member of the Board but a delegate here and have been interested in the fair work of the state for the past four or five years. We have built up a fair in Thayer County and have come to the secretary and treasurer and the Board to get information and so far as 1 could learn from the outside, everything seemed to be working in peace and harmony and it &lt;ame like a stroke of lightning from a clear sky, the information that seemed to go around this morning. Everything seemed to be all right, I for one do not pretend to explain it but feel Mr. Mellor is an invaluable man; 1 do not believe he is the one essential man, I believe the State Fair would go on without Mr. Mellor, but from my viewpoint I believe it to be an ill advised time to dispense with his services. We have a secretary known wherever fairs are known in the United States, a man in his prime who has done something and without a word against the other man or against anyone and from one on the outside, from one who is not on the inside and does not know anything of the workings of the inner circle it seems we would be making a serious mistake if we make a change at the present time. I am for Honorable W. R. Mellor for Secretary. Craig: I am like Mitchell here, am an outsider and knew nothing of this friction until this morning. I have been on our county board in Boone County some years and have "been here as a delegate and want to ask, if I might at this time, if there was friction why we were not informed of the fact before we nominated men yesterday. I do not know the man who is nominated, I do know Mr. Mellor and know it will be a great disappointment to the boys of Boone County if I return home and say to them "we have dropped Mr. Mellor." I know that I would not be received very friendly by the Boone county board If I re - turned home and told them this and want to say to you that the Boone county board, I was secretary for some time, never asked a favor or Information or anything from Mr. Mellor that we did not get and I </seg>
            <seg id="p056">54 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE think, from our experience in county fairs, that it takes more than a day to develop a good secretary.

Later they were done differently but I do not know if they were improved and 1 think it is a poor time to swap horses in the middle of the stream. We have been growing, as the report shows, we were told yesterday how we were growing, no man will deny the fact that we are growing and I believe in the State Fair as in the county fair, a great deal depends on the secretary. I do not know the other gentleman and am saying nothing against him, I am just expressing my views of Mr. Mellor as I have done business with him in years past and telling you what I would expect to receive from my home friends if I returned and told them I had cast a vote against Mr. Mellor.

The secretary will call the roll and as your name is called the teller will come and get your ballot, the same as before. Mr. Mellor called the roll. McArdle: While we are counting the ballots I think we can take action on the Treasurer. I will state Mr. Sass is a sick man, he came out here but could not stay and has gone down town to his room and I believe you can take action very quickly while they are counting the votes, if you wish, and then adjourn to the next room where a repre - sentative of Mr. Sass will pay the delegates their per diem and ex - penses.

I think that would be the biggest mistake you could make for If the secretary is not conversant with the needs and requirements of this Board he is not fit to be secretary, that is the way I take it. I think the secretary has the welfare of this Board at heart, he is on the job all the time and I think his judgment would be just as good as that of any other one man and I hope this motion will not prevail. Smith: I have no motive to injure any person' or Impair the efficiency of our great State Fair but I believe I know the workings, I know something about, I presume, the work of the secretary of the State Fair and I know he has always been a busy man and if you burden him us one of the members of the Board of Managers you are adding to his work.

            <seg id="p058">56 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE as the proposition that has come up, of taking the secretary off the Board of Managers, I want to be frank and say I have advocated this change for several years and conscientiously think it is the thing to do. I may be wrong, time only will tell, but personally I am going to ask you to do so that we may try it and see how it will work. All I ask is the confidence of the men who will be connected with me the coming year and, as I have said before, I will endeavor to do everything within my power to make the State Board of Agriculture a success and along with that goes the Nebraska State Fair. I thank you. Question. Ollis: The motion is that the secretary be changed from a member of the Board of Managers to an ex-officio member of the Board of Managers. Leftwich: I do not believe — is he not at present an ex-officio member? Mellor: No, he is a member. Leftwich: That is the idea, that he be eliminated from the Board of Managers, that is my idea of this motion. Perhaps I have it wrong but it seems to me that is the thing to do if we are going to get into this business at all, let us eliminate him from the Board of Managers, and make him secretary to the Board of Managers. Mellor: It might be well, if you are going to eliminate him, to eliminate another. This way it makes six on the Board and there could be a tie-up on all questions so if you are going to eliminate one member you had better eliminate two. Agee: They can elect a man to take his place. Mellor: You have to change the rules; you had better do these things now while you are working on it. Ollis: 1 think we can get at this, on page 19, rule 11 "Board of Managers" it says the President, Vice-Presidents, Secretary and the mem - bers selected by the President shall be the Board of Managers. S trader: How many on the Board? Mellor: There are seven on the Board of Managers, the President, Vice-Presidents, Secretary and the members selected by the President shall be the Board. Smith: As mover of the motion, if I can get the consent of my second, I want to renew that motion and say that the Secretary of the Board of Agriculture be eliminated from the Board of Managers and the President be empowered to appoint an extra man in place of the Sec - retary. Seconded. Ollis: The motion is that rule No. 11 be changed to read as follows: By cutting out the word "secretary" and adding to the paragraph that the President be authorized to add another member to the Board of Managers. Any remarks? </seg>

We are very anxious that we have at least 160 boys at the camp this coming year. We need four shifts of forty boys each to take care of the grandstand and that will give an opportunity to better take care of the boys, attending lectures, and for the men who take care of them and it is quite an expense for some of the boyg and also the State Fair Board. I therefore would like to make this motion, that we ask our representatives in the Legislature to present a bill making it possible for the County Commissioners to pay the expenses of two boys from each county to the State Fair Boys' Camp. Seconded and carried. Strader: I would like to ask Mr. Ollis to take charge of this, if he will. Agee: I move a committee of three be appointed with Mr. Strader, chairman; to take this up with the legislature. Ollis: Moved and seconded that a committee of three be appointed, of which Mr. Strader is chairman, to take the matter up with the legis - lature. All in favor will signify by saying aye, contrary minded, no. Carried. Is there anything else you want to bring before the meeting? Member: I am not a member of the Board but I was at the banquet of the fair managers association last night and Mr. Mellor read a paper and I would like to move that this be published — (Several interrupted him with the statement that this had been taken care of.)

The constitution and by-laws may be amended or altered at the annual meeting by a vote of two-thirds of the members present. Unless you do this you cannot legally appoint this member on the Board of Managers. You cannot appoint a man to take the place of the sec - retary or the one man eliminated, is that not right? Ollis: I think you are mistaken; the motion was made to amend the rules and it carried unanimously. That makes at least a two-thirds vote. S trader: Does that allow you to appoint the other man? Do t&amp;e minutes show it? Ollis: Tes. I think the committee Mr. Strader is to have appointed I will appoint later on — somebody who is going to try and interest the legislature. I would like to find someone who will take an interest in it and will notify them later, when I appoint them. If there is nothing else you want to bring up I will announce the members of the Board of Managers I wish to place before you for your consideration: Mr. Graff, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Caley and Mr. Purcell. These four names I place before you and recommend. Mellor: I move you the names mentioned be approved by this Board Seconded. Ollis: All in favor of this motion will signify the same by saying aye, contrary minded, no. It is carried. Now gentlemen, if there is any other business that should be brought before this meeting now is the time to make it known. If not, a motion to adjourn would be in order.

            <seg id="p065">PROCEEDINGS NEBKASKA STATE BOABD OF AGBICX'LTUKE 63 ADDRESS BY HON. CARL S. VROOMAN Assistant Secretary, U. S. Department of Agriculture "Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: England had a great navy. She thought if she could raise an army equal to her navy she would win the war. So she called the great war statesman, Lord Kitchener, and told him to raise an army. England raised a great army. They trained for months in the camps. Then after a time, which France thought was cruelly long, England sent the flower of her young man - hood to France and put them in the trenches against the Germans. England thought the pathway to victory was open. But suddenly she discovered that her great army had only ounces of powder when they should have had pounds, and only pounds of shells when they should have had tons. Her men were shot down by German gunners whom they could not see. So England called another great statesman, Lloyd George, and said, 'Create for us munitions. Dot the hillsides with munition factories.' Lloyd George created the munitions and England thought the pathway to victory was open, when suddenly her workmen struck. They said our masters are piling up millions of war profits and the price of food is rising. The workmen said 'We will work for no wages at all if the capitalists will put their factories at the disposal of the government without remuneration.' (Applause). A common coun - cil was called. An understanding was made between the laborer, the capitalist and the farmer. Labor was given a living wage and no more; farmers were given a reasonable remuneration for their products and no more; manufacturers were given a reasonable profit on their products, and no more. Then England went ahead like a high-power automobile suddenly thrown into high. No nation is really prepared until she has taken justice out of the clouds and madt it a part of the laws and institutions of man. "And when England had done these things, she came face to face with the great world-old primeval problem, the problem of mankind to feed itself. Thus this becomes a food war with famine fighting on both sides of every battle front. For two and a half years America stayed out of the contest as long as we could keep the decent respect of mankind. To have remained at peace would have meant silent acquiescence in the murder of our own citizens, when we said nothing. A cause has now come that is worth fighting for, worthy of dying for. (Applause). At this juncture the Congress of the Great United States threw 100,000,000 people into the struggle. Our government is engaged not in a war of conquest, we are not striving to wreak vengeance, we have no hatred against the masses of any race. Our hands are as clean as those of any Knight of old who went out to fight for the Holy Grail. This is a crusade not only of the little people but of every people in Europe and also the German people. (Applause). I bear the honored name of Carl Schurz and I speak the sentiments of 99 out of </seg>
            <seg id="p066">64 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF AGRICULTURE every 100 Germans who have come here, to avoid the pressure of the military heel of the Imperial Government. "Three years ago we thought that the time of an international peace and democracy had come, with the modernization of the governments of Turkey and China. But this war had to come before the war lust was entirely extinguished from the face of the earth. "The declaration of war by President Wilson was the greatest pronunciamento that ever fell from the lips of man. (Applause). The American people feel a close friendship for the German people. Our war is against the Imperial Government. (Applause). "This fury is going on increasing. None of us can feel the horror of the European battlefields but they can realize it perhaps when our boys begin to come back in pine boxes. Then this giant of the western world will awake to its responsibilities. I am no prophet. This awaken - ing may come when one of our allies receives a mortal wound and we would have to put 5,000,000 men in the trenches. That is what will happen should Russia go to pieces. We cannot send many soldiers to the trenches in nine months. We are to send one division to raise Old Glory (Applause) alongside the flags of our allies to show the world we are there in the flesh as well as in spirit, and to show France that we have not forgotten the aid of Lafayette and Rochambeau in the time of our distress. It is the moral effect of our United States troops holding one or two miles of trenches. The material result will not affect the outcome to any appreciable degree. ' And then Congress voted a loan of $7,000,000,000. The average man cannot comprehend the vastness of this sum but when we decided to make the loan we served notice on mankind that we had underwritten victory. (Applause). We cannot all go to the trenches but we can get into the game by buying a $50.00 bond. (Applause.) Any man who has enjoyed the peace and prosperity under this flag and who expects to have his children here and who does not buy one of these bonds is not worthy of being defended by the brave boys who go into the trenches and face the hell of gun fire. (Applause). This loan should be over-subscribed 500% in the next fortnight. "You are seeing in your eyes a light that has not been there before, a light of patriotic resolve, unselfish purpose, only called to flame by some great crisis. Besides floating this loan we must meet the arch enemy hovering over every European nation — allied, central powers and neutrals. Europe cannot feed herself. If we do not rise to this emergency and ship vast quantities of food to European nations more people will die of starvation in a year than have been killed in battle in three years. We must feed the civilian population of the allied nations and after the war is over feed the starving millions of the central powers. This is a task high enough to appeal to the deepest imagination. </seg>

            <seg id="p069">65 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "Every man, woman and child can participate in this great fight against world famine. Farmers can farm as intelligently and effi - ciently as possible. The farmers can farm a little more scientifically and intensively and reduce waste. I have seen it done. Waste is our national vice. It is almost an institution from the farmer through the entire population of this country. Until the women of our nation, as well as the man, come to feel in their emotional natures as proud of thrift, this trait will continue. "The women in the kitchens of America waste $700,000,000 worth of food products in a year. The average man in America wants food not only to relieve hunger, but he likes to look at it. The French housewife prides herself on having everybody satisfied. Our method of loading the table is vulgar. ' In time of peace it is bad enough to waste our food. In time of war it is despicable and disloyal. In America we mill only 72% of the wheat into flour. In Europe they mill 80 to 85 per cent into wheat flour and mix it with oat, corn, barley and potato flour. I believe that before the end of the present year every country In the world, ourselves included, will be doing the same thing. There is not enough wheat flour to feed the world. There are other things just as good. Nothing is better than corn bread. When we market rice we polish it so that it looks white. When people live on rice alone they develop that dread disease beri beri. When they eat the brown rice they thrive. "For thirty years legislation for farmers has been neglected. There has been more of such in the past four years than in twenty years before. (Applause). Next year more will be accomplished in the interest of the farmer than in the last generation. Here is a chance for con - structive work. We are asking Congress to guarantee a minimum price. (Applause). No responsible person connected with the Department of Agriculture has suggested a maximum price to beat down the price the farmers will receive for their products. Germany showed us the folly of that. Farmers fed valuable products to hogs, turned their farms into pastures and greatly decreased production in all lines when the German government tried to establish a maximum price for products of the farm. What we have asked for is power to fix a maximum price in order that production will be stimulated and in order that food gamblers cannot rob the farmers. The farmers are not receiving exorbitant prices for their grain. The average price the farmers were paid for wheat during the past year was $1.35% bushel. We are asking Congress for power to fix a maximum price to stop food speculating. These food gamblers are the worst enemies of this country, and are Allies of the Kaiser, and are disloyal Americans and traitors to every American prin - ciple. (Applause). The men who corner food to gather in dirty money when our country is engaged in a life and death struggle are human vultures. The federal government is counting on everyone to do their </seg>

We are now engaged in a democratic crusade to put a stop to war and the lust for conquest which has made a charnel house of the world for years. We are asking you to help this great nation to make the world safe for democracy. (Applause). This cause is worth contributing to, worth fighting for, and taking some trouble for. Following the cam - paign we made in the south I saw planters go out and order fields that had been planted to cotton plowed up and corn put in so that the food supply might be increased. (Applause). Never before have the rich been so patriotic. Business men are not 100% good. I have no use for traitorous food gamblers. But business men, like workingmen -and farmers are getting behind the president in the war. They are willing to make the same sacrifices and are constantly making these sacrifices to assist their country and help the establishment of liberty and Ameri - can principles around the world. "L,et me relate you the experience of the United States in securing copper. The National Council of Defense selected Barney Baruch, a Wall Street operator, to buy the metals needed for the struggle. Baruch called the copper operators of the nation, representing 90% of the pro - duction, to meet and fix a price for copper. He left them in a room for half an hour with the instructions to fix their price with an eye on the flag. As a result they cut the price of copper in half. That is the American spirit in the war. (Applause.) "Have you done anything? Have you planted a garden? Have you Dough t a Liberty Bond? Have you begun to practice conservation in the home? If not, ask Almighty God to forgive you. Be an American to help push this the holiest war that humanity ever engaged in, a war of democracy against despotism, law against piracy, and for the establishment of American principles around the world. (Applause). Into such a war as this you can safely go with one eye on the flag and the other on the Cross. God help him who in this hour neglects his opportunity to make good." (Applause and cheers.) ADDRESS BY HON. WM. G. McADOO, SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY MR. McADOO said: "Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Permit me to thank you for this very generous and cordial reception, which I do not take in any sense personal to me, but merely as an indication of that splendid spirit of true Americanism which I have found manifesting itself throughout the length and breadth of the land where I have had the privilege of going within the past week. "I know, my friends, that there have been honest differences of opinion in this country about this war. I have no fault to find with the men who believe that this country should not bs engaged in war. I </seg>
            <seg id="p071">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF AGRICULTURE 67 am not intolerant in my views but I want to say that your Repre - sentatives in Congress of the United States have settled that issue. Now that the die has been cast and we find ourselves in this most colossal war, there isn't anything for the true patriot in America to do but to support your great leader, the President of the United States (applause), and in supporting him that you organize quickly the might of America in order that we may at the earliest possible moment bring this colossal slaughter in Europe to a prompt conclusion. "We are most interested in stopping the European war because we stand for liberty and humanity. We are just as much interested in stopping this slaughter because we want to save American lives as we are interested in stopping it because we want to save German lives, and Serbian lives, and French lives, and Belgian lives, and Eng - lish lives, and Hungarian lives and Russian lives, because civilization itself has been kept in a state of horror for the past two and one - half years by this brutal slaughter upon the battlefields of Europe, and we in free America not alone want to vindicate the rights of liberty throughout the world but we want to slop, as quickly as possible, this crime against civilization. This is the thing that we are striving for, while we are at the same time trying to reassert the supremacy of democratic institutions throughout the earth. "Now, I know, that your great President, because I have had the privilege of serving at his side for the past four years, has striven with all of his might and main, with all the energy that only true love of peace and humanity could have, to keep this nation at peace. I know that he has prayed to God that we might not be drawn into this horrible war, but there are times, my friends, in the history of nations when we seem to be beyond the control of fallible human hands, when some unseen hand seems to take and drive nations into situations from which they can't escape, and this is one of those situations. 'We have been brought into this conflict because we could not avoid being brought into it; we have been brought into this conflict because God has willwl it and God has willed it for a purpose. My friends, He has willed it because we are at that time in the history of the world when we are confronted with a supreme struggle between a military autocracy on the one hand and self-government and the principle of democracy and liberty on the other. "In 1776 we fought Great Britain in order that we might become independent and that we might establish an institution on the prin - ciples of liberty in this great Western Continent. "In 1812 we fought Great Britain again. What for? We fought for the principle of the freedom of the seas, a principle we vindicated by our blood, a principle which this military autocrat has challenged and repeatedly challenged, a principle, my friends, which we couldn't concede or afford to surrender, a principle which for our own liberty, safety and security we must reassert. We must take up the challenge, </seg>
            <seg id="p072">68 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATL BOARD OF AGRICULTURE no matter who lays it down, as far as the principles of the seas are concerned, and vindicate anew the rights of our great people upon these highways of commerce. "In 1861 we fought again — we fought each other. For what? Not states' rights after all, although that was a part of the controversy but we fought for human freedom, we fought to liberate an enslaved race in America and because freedom is the paramount thing in the hearts of free men we succeeded in establishing that principle. We haven't had anything but free men in America since 1865 and we aren't going to permit any alien autocrat to reestablish that principle of slavery in the world, and especially to enslave the free people of America (Applause). "In 1898 we found ourselves again at war. For what? For con - quest, for advantage to ourselves, for any selfish end? No; we fought for the only thing that could inspire a nation of free men to fight for, and that was to liberate another enslaved people, the people of Cuba. We succeeded and they are today a republic. They are learning rapidly the value of democracy, and self-government and when this nation found herself at war, one of the most inspiring things that has happened in all history, I think, was when that splendid little nation immediately cast her lot with America and showed that she stood shoulder to shoulder with us in the principles of independence and free government. "We find ourselves again, in 1917, fighting. For what? Freedom again, freedom and security for self-government not alone in America but throughout the world and the extraordinary thing about this war is, my friends, that we aren't fighting because we have any hate or hostility, or enmity toward the German people. Throughout the whole of our history we have had nothing but sentiments of friendship for the German people. We are fighting not the German people but we are fighting a German autocracy. That autocracy in itself, in my judg - ment, has enslaved the people of Germany and I believe that when the time has come for America to sit at the council table of the nations, and thank God she is going to sit there as the most majestic power on the face of the earth, representing the principles of free men and dedicating her whole soul and being to the reestablishment of justice in the world, seeking no advantage, coveting the possession of no one else, asking no contributions, enforcing no retribution, but demand - ing that justice should be restored in the world that big nations shall respect the rights of little nations in the world and that the value of treaties shall hereafter be scrupulously observed. Above all, my friends, we are going to stand for justice, even to our enemies (Applause) and I hope as a result of settlement that we are going to reestablish the basis of staple peace in the world again because unless that settle - ment is so based, if any festering soree are left to eat at the body politic of any of these nations, then the peace of the world will again become imperiled and our whole object to give to peoples throughout </seg>
            <seg id="p073">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF AGRICULTURE 69 the world, who are capable or responsible, or intelligent enough to know how to enjoy liberty, the opportunities and advantages of self - government and I hope that is what we are going to be able to do for the German people. "I don't know that the German people know what the real issue of this war is. I don't believe that autocracy has allowed the German people to know. I believe if the German people knew what had been done by their own military autocrats that they wouldn't stand one minute for this war with America (Applause). "Now, we know what we are fighting for. Do the German people know what they are fighting for? We have not been able, in spite of every effort made by our President when in that noble attempt he made in December last to find out what Germany is fighting for. Last De - cember the President said to them all: 'Won't you tell us what it is you hope to get as the result of victory, what it is you want as the result of this war, because if you will all say what you want and we compare points of difference perhaps this great liberal, generous republic might be able to act the part of the mediator.' Every other power told us what they wanted except Germany, and today we are facing a war with a nation whose purposes in this war we don't know. We can't tell what they are fighting for, and we don't know what they are going to do if they happen to be victorious. We only know that liberty is not compatible with autocratic government and we know that either autocratic government or liberty has got to disappear from the world, and, therefore, my friends, every American man and woman must wake up to the fact that a really grave crisis involving your very safety for the future, your lives and your property for the future and your liberties for the futurei We don't intend, my friends, to allow splendid and noble America that we have loved, that we have treasured, that we have reared through the centuries, to be drawn at the chariot wheel of any autocratic government as Belgium has been. Tet let me say to you in all sincerity that you are facing those possi - bilities because if England and France should be overcome in this struggle and this military autocrat should be able to get possession of the French and English fleets and then bring into the oceans his own great fleet which has been bottled up for the past two and one - half years and supplement that with the fleet of murderous submarines do you not think he could make it uncomfortable for America, if such a situation should ever arise, and the situation has its possibilities of just that thing unless America awakes herself and gets earnestly to work in this great cause. If such a vision should ever arise the in - demnities we will have to pay will be ten times as much, yes twenty times, fifty times as great as it will be if we go at it vigorously and earnestly in organizing the might of America to win a victory. Our security for the future and the vindication of the principle of liberty and self-government are at stake in this war. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">70 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OK AGBICUI.TUBE "Now, how can we win this war? We can win this war only if we provide your Government with the necessary means of war and the first is always money. You must provide the moneys promptly, both by buying bonds of your Government and submitting to the neces - sary measures of taxation to raise the money to carry on the war. "Now, the Congress of the United States has authorized an issue of $5,000,000,000.00 of Government bonds. $3,000,000,000.00 of those bonds are to be loaned to the allied governments making common cause with us against Germany and $2,000,000,000.00 are to be sold for the purpose of providing in part the expenditures of our own government in carrying on the war now. "These bonds are called The Liberty Bonds because every dollar of their proceeds .is to be dedicated to the cause of liberty. These bonds are secured by the honor of American people, which alone is sufficient, and then they are secured in addition by $250,000,000,000.00 of wealth of the American people. Your Government offers you 3V4% interest for that money. It offers in addition to that to give you or to convert these into new bonds bearing a higher rate of interest if during the progress of this war we should issue bonds at a higher rate of interest. In addition to that, we exempt these bonds from all taxation, state, national and local and anybody who has a United States Bond in his pocket not only has a bag of patriotism in hts pocket but in addition to that he has the most liquid security on earth; you have a security which you can go out and sell at any time, or if yon want to borrow money you can go to any bank and borrow money on your bonds. So in subscribing to these bonds you not only render a patriotic service to your Government in helping to carry on this war but in addition to that you provide yourself with the safest and securest investment on the face of the earth. "Now, these bonds aren't going to be sold unless every man and woman in America is willing to buy a mortgage upon the American people. Your Government isn't asking you to give anything, it is ask - ing you merely to buy the best security on earth. The banks alone can't do this piece of work. They are doing their part splendidly. They haven't got the means to finance the Government all by them - selves during the next year, and, therefore, it is that every man and woman who has the means to do so must buy some of these Govern - ment bonds. Buy, if you can't buy more than one of these $50 bonds or $100 bonds, or whatever amount is within your means. I want to impress upon you the fact that both the business situation and the security of your own Government Bonds upon the market depends upon the response of the people of America to these demands for the neces - sary finances to carry on the war. "Along with the bond issues comes this question of taxation. I know that nobody likes to pay taxes. I know that that is human nature. I have no fault with that. The man who doesn't reckon with human </seg>
            <seg id="p075">71 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE nature won't get along. Nobody likes to pay taxes, but I haven't found anyone who wasn't willing to make any promise, once they understood this proposition. It is necessary to protect the lives of our soldiers in the field and make them more effective fighting units upon the front. We are asking to raise only $1,800,000,000.00 of taxes in the first year. "The amount we may have to finance tor the allied governments and ourselves will probably be $10,000,000,000.00. We are asking tha. $1,800,000,000.00 of that amount be provided by taxation and we are proposing to raise the rest by bond issues. "Now, that is the least possible sum that we can afford to raise, my friends, by taxation. It is the least possible amount that we can afford to raise by taxes if we are going to conserve the soundness of the business situation in America. You are all just as much interested; you are more interested in that than anybody else in your country be - cause you are producers here. Unless you can find the ready market for your products you are going to suffer. And, therefore, it is neces - sary that your Government be supplied at all times with the means to pay you for the products that you have got to sell to the Govern - ment to carry on this war. "Do you realize what it means to "nave $10,000,000,000.00 spent for products in America in the next year? It means that there is going to be a greater demand for the products of the farms, mines and factories than ever before in the history of our country. Prosperity is going to be greater than ever before and it means furthermore that the chief customer of the farmers of this country, the manufacturers, the business men, is to be your own Government and the governments of Europe, who are going to buy their supplies here in conjunction with your own Government. If you don't provide the means by which your Government and these governments may buy your products at profitable prices don't you see that business prosperity in the country would have to stop? Of course, there isn't any danger of any such thing because everywhere that I have been I have seen the determina - tion and I have been given the assurance- by the people that they will supply their Government with everything that is necessary to enable it to carry on this war and that they are willing to submit to the essential taxation for that purpose. "Do you realize, my friends, that only a short time ago the Con - gress passed the selective draft bill? That that has had the approval of the President and that on the 5th day of June next there has got to be an outpouring of the youth of America — the splendid patriotism of America responding to that call of registration, a time when prob - ably 10,000,000 young American free men will come up and register themselves in the cause of liberty. That will be an inspiring and splendid and noble spectacle, one befitting of free people who are dedi - cating themselves to a cause so noble. "What do we offer those young men when they go into the b»ttle- </seg>
            <seg id="p076">72 PROCEEDINGS .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE fields? Do wo offer them any security (or their lives? They go tor the purpose of sacrificing their lives not only to vindicate freedom but to protect your property and your lives and your rights, you people who stay at home and who can't go into the battle line. These boys are shedding their blood for you, sacrificing their lives for you and their country. What compensation do we offer them? We offer them $30 a month; a less compensation than most of them undoubtedly are getting in the fields of private life. Now, I want to draw this contrast for you: "We can't give protection to the soldiers who go into the field of battle, we can only compensate them inadequately. They are fighting for you and your property and your liberty and we are offering to you people who stay at home here, for the property that you lend to the Government the security of the principle of your property, im - pregnable security, by giving you a mortgage upon the American people, all that we are or hope to be in this world. As I said before, we can't give security to the lives of the men who ara fighting in the field and we are offering to compensate you 3%%, a compensation ten thousand times greater for the use of property than that we are giving for the impairment of our men's lives, your and my sons, on the field of battle. "Now, I ask if we are going to be more tender with the lives of our sons than we are with the property of our citizens? "Are you willing to make these sacrifices of property to pro - tect those young men on the front that are absolutely necessary to be made in order that the only protection that those men can possibly get may be provided them, and that is the best fighting implement that we can put into the field. Not only the guns but the ammunition and the artillery that we put back of them and all the other equipment of war. That is the only protection that we can give to them. Are we going to hesitate to make the sacrifices of property or to lend money to our Government on absolute security to equip those young men in the field and enable them to sell their lives as dearly as possible for you? "You men and women make the public opinion of this country, and it rests upon you to say whether or not your representatives in Congress are going to respond to this manifest duty of the hour. "I must say I think it is tragic, I think it is a reflection upon the American people that within the last week or two there have been going down to Washington committees protesting against the necessary taxation, while we are reaching out and taking the lives of our sons and putting them into the field of battle to protect this property. "You have sot to form the public opinion that is necessary to support your Government in this situation because I tell you, my friends, democratic government cannot become effective unless supported by public opinion of the country. The Government can do things for you, </seg>
            <seg id="p077">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 73 but very few in comparison with what you can do for the Government, because it is your Government; you direct it and you run it and I hope that you will send word to your representatives and tell them that you want no quibbling, no hesitation about the taking of every measure on the face of the earth that can be taken to equip our young men who are going to the front and to enable them to give a good account of themselves upon the field of battle and to enable them to win. (Applause.) "We are fighting to win this war quickly to save further expendi - ture of men and property. We are fighting this war for peace and we are going to get peace because I tell you democracy is arousing itself in America. (Applause.) "I have three sons, thank God, who have volunteered for the Navy. (Applause). I wouldn't confess that I had them unless they were im - bued with the spirit of America. They aren't unlike the sons of every other true American in this country because, I tell you, while there may be some factions, cliques or groups somewhere who aren't answer - ing to the call of their country in this crisis, it doesn't apply to the young of America; it doesn't apply, thank God, to nine hundred and ninety-nine one thousandths of the people of America. "I want to refer to another thing. If we undertook to do a less taxation than mentioned we would have to issue more bonds. Now, there is not an unlimited market in this country for bonds and even if there were the most hurtful thing that could possibly happen to America would be to finance this war wholly with bond issues because bond issues mean inflation, bringing within itself a train of evils. A certain amount of wholesome inflation is necessary. In this situation we must have a wholesome expansion of credit. We must keep the Inter - est rates down. We have fortunately the most splendid financial system in the world. We have here the greatest financial resources in the world and we are able to finance this war and to keep business going and there isn't going to be any hesitation to that score. The inflationary tendency that would come from unlimited bond issues must be corrected by wholesome, essential measures of taxes and the amount of taxation established is the least possible amount that we should have for the purpose of correcting any such tendency to inflation — to keep the whole situation steady throughout the land. "It is important for another reason: It is important in order that we shall encourage economy necessary during the period of this war. Encourage economy, ladies and gentlemen, because it is absolutely es - sential that you shall not make any demands upon the general store of the country which are not essential to your support and to your needs. "When I say economy I don't mean that hysterical, self-denial whicn I have heard in some quarters; I don't believe that there is any reason why we shouldn't supply our normal needs. "I mean by economy the prevention of waste, the stopping of extrava- </seg>
            <seg id="p078">74 PROCEEDINGS NEBBASKA STATE BOAJtO OF AGBICULTUBE gant living, the cessation of the purchasing of luxuries during the time of this war. "I should like to have you, ladies and gentlemen, to think for a moment of the United States of America as one great common store, one general store of credit and supplies. It is the only remaining great storehouse in the world for supplies of all kinds. The demands that are going to be made upon that general store by our own people, even if we remained at peace, and by the armies of Europe are going to be much in excess of the supply, but in addition to that we are putting into the field a million or million and a half men for training and those men are bound to be withdrawn from productive interests and while they are producing nothing they are consuming much. "Now, if every man, woman and child in America eats no more food than they require and wastes no food at all and wastes nothing else that is necessary to their support, but saves and conserves as much as possible don't you see that would relieve the general store of an immense demand? "Uncle Sam isn't going to hand out a lot of stuff to be wasted and thrown away and rendered valueless. "Don't you see that the amount you may save might support these armies in the field? Don't you see that the less demand you make upon that general store the less the law of levels is going to make prices? Don't you see that the extent to which you sava is going to enable you to do still another thing for your Government, it is going to enable you to invest your savings in this matchless security; these mortgages upon the American people and by buying those bonds you ara putting your Government in a position to purchase the materials it needs for its armies in the field, and, furthermore, and last but not least, in saving money in that fashion you are building up something for your - selves, you are saving something that wou'.d otherwise be wasted, you are investing it in the bonds of your Government, which is the best investment on earth. The prevention of waste and starvation during the next year is a fundamental patriotic duty; it is a primary necessity, and I hope every one of you will bear in mind what I said to you on th;s subject and lend your aid in that direction. "Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion I should like to say to you that there isn't any question whatever about the gravity of the issues that now confront you. I repeat — I do not want to exaggerate these things. It would be impossible to exaggerate the gravity of the situation now confronting America. We have got to organize our resources. As I said before, we have got to go into this war and end it as quickly as possible. We can't win this war by any absent treatment. We can only win it and gave the destruction of lives and property by going into this fight with all our hearts, souls, energies and patriotism, and with the most effective organization that can be brought about. We are organizing the country in that fashion and you must give your support </seg>

We are in a time — I re - peat — when the principles of self-government and the liberties of the people of the world are at stake and it rests upon free America, upon this great democracy, the greatest republic of all time, to keep the torch of liberty aflame and if I do not mistake the temper of the American people they intend that for every people it shall continue to shine and flame, for the benefit of humanity, if it takes every drop of blood of every Ameri - can free man to bring about that result." (Applause.) REPORT OF POLICY COMMITTEE— NEBRASKA CONSERVATION CONGRESS MR. E. R. PURCELL, Chairman, Presiding Presented by FRANK G. ODELL, Secretary The Nebraska Conservation Congress, representing every interest of the State, and recognizing our responsibility in the present crisis, enunciates the following declaration of principles and policies, confident that every citizen will perform his or her part for the preservation of the National Welfare. We are engaged in a great war for the preservation of liberty throughout the world. This war is not of our seeking. The innate right of humanity to self government is at stake. To the President of our Nation, we renew our pledge of unselfish devotion to these principles. THE FARMER'S RESPONSIBILITY We recognize that the problem of food production and conservation is all important and, in, the solution of this problem the farmer is the most important factor. Farmers recognize this and are responding loyally. CROPS A survey of seed requirements and seed supply should be made, to the end that local requirements may be met by local supply. The critical time for farm labor will come during cultivation and harvest of crops. Statements of when this is needed should be made to the central labor organizations and arrangements should be made to fur - nish such labor. We believe the conscription for war of men engaged in the produc - tion, or engaged in any industry assisting in the production of food supplies, would be deferred until there is greater need for men in the trenches than there is on the farm. </seg>
            <seg id="p080">76 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Injury to alfalfa and clover has been severe. Preparations should be made to meet this and not depend upon buying hay on the market. There is still time to seed sorghums, millet, sudan grass and such crops. We urge that special efforts be made to save extra amounts of corn fodder which is a valuable feed. In eastern Nebraska, or on irrigated or sub-irrigated land where there is abundance of water, root crops such as rutabagas or turnips should be sowed up to July 10th. Rape can be sowed in the corn at its last cultivation, or can be sowed alone or with small grain fo# hog pasture. It can be seeded any time up to the first of August. FARM MACHINERY. In order to supply the farmers of Nebraska with their actual re - quirements in agricultural implements during the continuance of the war, it will be necessary for manufacturers to build each year, at least as many tools for distribution in this state as they have built for the previous twelve months, as any curtailment of the supply of farm machinery will seriously effect the production of food in the state. We urge farmers to look carefully to the repair of machinery on hand. We urge also that machinery dealers and manufacturers keep constantly on hand an ample supply of parts. POTATOES The potato acreage of Nebraska for this year will be double that of 1916 with a probable corresponding increase in yield. We recom - mend that the consumer not demand new potatoes. We find that there is probability of a labor shortage in harvesting the potato crop, and we recommend that steps be taken to provide the grower with the necessary labor in order to save the crop before the freezing period, this labor being necessary in the potato belt between September 25th and October 15th. In the eastern part of Nebraska where potatoes are not a major crop we recommend to farmers and gardeners the state and national publications with special emphasis upon a study of the insect enemies of potatoes and methods of destroying them. We recommend that the producer of western Nebraska study and adopt remedies for the preven - tion of dry rot and other diseases of this nature which attack the potato in storage. Experience has shown that intensive cultivation will double the yield of potatoes. We recommend that special attention be given to intensive farming of potatoes by the grower. The loss of potatoes, due to improper transportation facilities at the time the crop must be moved, has been very heavy. We urge that the railroads co-operate by furnishing cars at the proper time and </seg>
            <seg id="p081">PROCEEDINGS .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 77 moving them (aster to the points of destination. We urge shippers to load cars with the utmost dispatch and receivers to unload them with equal dispatch. Proper grading of potatoes means economy and fair prices to the Nebraska producers. When properly graded, Nebraska potatoes are of as high a grade as any produced. We recommend that potato growers form associations and adopt rules for the strict grading of potatoes. We find that there is a marked increase in acreage of potatoes in eastern Wyoming, near the Nebraska line and recommend that all the advantages and facilities given to Nebraska growers be tendered to these growers. In our opinion there is no danger of over-production in potatoes. Experiments now being carried on assure a bright future for the potato industry in the use of the culls and lower grades in the making of alcohol for use in power machinery. BEAN8 We advise the planting of beans in larger quantities than hereto - fore, and recommend that steps be taken at once to secure additional seed for the present season. We urge that cultivation of beans be confined to the heat of the day when the plants are dry and that special care should be taken to ;.void breaking the plants as it is through such wounds that disease enters and destroys the plant. We recommend that the University extension bulletin on beans be obtained by all raisers. Beans are especially adapted to a semi-sandy soil and do exceptionally well upon virgin land. Inexpensive special machinery for harvesting crops is recommended to all who grow beans. GARDENS Every city and town should adequately organize for the purpose of producing the largest possible food supply on vacant lands and for its preservation and conservation. The state and federal authorities are urged to furnish all possible information and assistance. Since under present conditions it will be impossible to procure cans in sufficient quantities for all purposes, we recommend that all communities be furnished information concerning especially simple meth - ods of preserving fruits and vegetables. Each locality is urged to make a survey of all vacant lands suitable for garden purposes and report to proper local and state organizations. We suggest that all land available for next year's garden be manured and plowed this summer or fall. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">78 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Of AGRICULTURE FRUITS Owners of orchards should make an earnest effort to control insects and disease pests. Perishable fruits should be preserved, canned or dried. Less perishable varieties of apples, particular^, should be properly handled and stored lor winter use. As an act of patriotism, any surplus fruit should be placed in the hands of needy families. Accurate information should be distributed pertaining to pruning, spraying, preserving or storing fruits. WASTE OF FOOD STUFF IN LIQUOR MANUFACTURE We urge the president to immediately exercise such power as is now vested in him to commandeer all grain now Meld by distilleries and breweries and prohibit its use in the manufacture of alcohol. *: LIVE STOCK We advise the conservation of breeding herds by retaining the best animals and marketing all animals not desirable for breeding purposes. We urge the raising of two litters of pigs per year, while the present demand for meat continues. The state live stock sanitary board should adopt active measures to control such live stock diseases as tuberculosis, hog cholera, anthrax and others of like nature. The constantly increasing price of corn and other grains, makes it necessary to utilize rough feeds formerly wasted. The finished meat product should be made upon a minimum of corn and high priced grains. The silo is an effective means of utilizing rough feeds and helps to increase the number of cattle which can be maintained on a given acreage. Its use should be encouraged. We advise the grinding of alfalfa hay and other feeds and the chopping or shredding of cane and fodder as methods of decreasing the feeding cost. We recommend the utilization of the grasses upon the range to the fullest extent. Stock growers should sow liberal quantities of dwarf Essex rape and rye for fall pasture. We recommend that land lords and tenants more generally adopt the plan of co-operation, using the crops raised on the farms in live stock production as largely as possible, with long term leases. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 79 WOOL SUPPLY The wool supply of the country should be increased by endeavoring to interest our agricultural population in the keeping of a few sheep on each farm and by making an effort to secure, for a time at least, protection against the slaughter of lambs and breeding ewes. WA8TE IN FEEDING ANIMALS AT MARKET CENTERS The heavy feeding of corn for filling purposes at market centers en - tails unnecessary waste. This corn is undigested by animals immedi - ately slaughtered. The regulations of the government are such that this grain is thrown into the sewer. A concerted action at all market centers is necessary. This should be remedied by Immediate federal supervision. DAIRYING Increase the meat supply— stop slaughtering calves! ! ! Weed out unprofitable cows — keep more cows — give the cow a square deal by feeding her better. Use skim milk products for human food — they are muscle and tissue builders and are palatable. Feed surplus skim milk to young stock. Watch the pasture — supplement shortage with soiling crops and sum - mer silage — save the corn fodder— utilize fodder from sweet corn grown for canneries. Home grown feeds are cheapest. Provide alfalfa and corn silage — stop wasting corn stalks. Pepare now for winter dairying. Don't let children suffer for milk. POULTRY All raisers of poultry should maintain for production purposes all pullets of laying age and all suitable hens of at least one year of age. All birds intended for meat purposes should be maintained until matured, in-so-far as possible, in order that waste products, such as wasted grains, bugs, worms, etc., may be profitably utilized in producing meat. In view of the present food emergency the quick returns from poultry warrant the production of young stock throughout the entire growing season. Poultry raising in Nebraska should be encouraged and extended. The rat is a destroyer of poultry and a carrier of disease. It costs 15.00 per year to feed a rat. EXTERMINATE THE RAT.

Dealers in poultry should be encouraged in the distribution of pure blood by the exchange, weight for weight, or at market price, of such pure bred males as may be received by them. We urge the co-operation of all dealers in poultry and eggs in promoting the production of infertile eggs by encouraging the removal of all males from the flocks when eggs are no longer desired for hatch - ing purposes. TOWN AND CITY LABOR ON THE FARM We recommend the plans outlined by the federal and state govern - ment for the retention of farmer boys on the farm to work crops. Experi - enced laborers in transportation, manufacturing and other lines requiring expert and efficient labor should, if possible, be retained in such service. Capital, Labor and Lands should work in harmony and be so utilized as to secure best results. Employers and employees should act in absolute harmony regardless of all personal differences which might arise during this crisis. WASTE IN DISTRIBUTION Waste in distribution is apparent. Every unnecessary agency in the handling of food products should be eliminated. We urge that steps be taken to establish a less expensive and more expeditious method of exchanging the products of labor. MARKETING AND PREVENTION OF SPECULATION. We believe that in the marketing of Food products the producer is entitled to access to the market In as free and direct a manner as is possible. We believe it is the province and should be the purpose of our Government, not only to secure such markets but to take all necessary steps to guarantee them free from manipulation and monopo - listic speculation, to the end that the full price, less only necessary hand - ling expense, reach the producer. We believe in the retention so far as practicable, of existing markets, methods and machinery, to the end that experienced service may be exerted in the problems of prompt and efficient handling, and that delay and confusion which might result in the disorganization of existing ma - chinery be avoided. Complete surveys of every phase of the food question should be constantly maintained. Wide publicity of all facts and statistics that they may be available to all the people. The taking over of control by the Government of all Storage Ware- </seg>
            <seg id="p085">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICCLTfRE 81 bouses and elevators, and the issuance of warehouse receipts to every depositor. The power in the Government to conscript food at a" fair price whenever necessary to break monopoly, prevent hoarding and se - cure proper distribution. FIXING PRICES We believe that satisfactory results can be obtained without the drastic method of arbitrary fixing prices. Price fixing power might be lodged by Congress in the hands of the President to be used in his discretion if regulative measures fail. Should the Government find it necessary to fix prices of farm products, it should also fix the prices of the products of mines, forests and factories. WAR TAXATION War taxation should be adjusted so as to work a minimum inter - ference with production and distribution of necessary articles. A super - tax should be laid upon excess profits and income. THE LIBERTY BONDS We urge every citizen of Nebraska to purchase Liberty Bonds to the extent of his or her ability. TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE REPORT The emergencies of. war require that the people of the state of Nebraska take steps to conserve the transportation facilities of the state; eliminate unnecessary expenditure incident to cross shipments of products into and out of the state; liberate freight equipment for the most pressing uses by determining upon a plan of, wherever possible, purchasing home grown and home manufactured products; establishing increased storage facilities for the purpose of making possible the greater storage of fuel, and by co-operating with the directing forces of the transportation companies so that the fullest possible efficiency may be secured through maximum loading of freight equipment; the prompt loading and unloading of freight cars, and the providing of ad - vance information, wherever possible, by consignees which will enable (he transportation companies to more quickly handle the work of switching. It is estimated by the American Railway Association, that if a program of co-operation of this character is inaugurated which will include the best efforts of both the shippers and the transportation com - panies, it will be equivalent to adding to the present freight equipment of the country additional cars to the amount of almost 30 per cent, br of a total of 779,000 freight can. </seg>
            <seg id="p086">82 PBOCEEDIN'QS NEBRASKA STATE BO ABC OF AOEICULTCBE To the end that our Government may have all of the assistance possible from the transportation lines of this country, the Committee on Transportation and Distribution of the Conservation Congress makes the following recommendations: 1. CO-OPERATION IN THE HANDLING OF FREIGHT EQUIPMENT (A) That the delay of cars at terminals awaiting order from con - signees designating tracks and industries for unloading, and in waiting orders of reconsignment, especially of those cars laden with coal, grain, sand and stone, be eliminated by the consignees giving notice to the carriers of disposition in advance of the arrival of cars at destination. (B) That it is the duty of shippers to load the cars to their maximum capacity, where possible putting two or more consignments in the same car. (C) That freight equipment be promptly loaded and unloaded in order that it be released for other uses, and the practice of using freight equipment for storage purposes be discontinued. 2. ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TRANSPORTATION (A) That the various Community Clubs, Farmers Unions and kin - dred organizations inaugurate a campaign of buying home raised and home manufactured products. (B) That the various cities, towns and communities commonly known as marketing points establish and maintain municipal or com - munity markets for the disposition of surplus products. (C) That in each town of one thousand population, or over, the citizens be urged to establish adequate cold storage plants, either co - operative or owned by the city or community, where perishable vege - tables and fruits can be stored at the actual cost of maintenance, and that in the larger cities, where large privately owned storage plants already exist, they be requested to set aside storage room for similar purposes. (D) That the transportation of seed winter wheat from any com - munity needing it which will necessitate the later transportation of seed back to that community be prevented. 3. STORAGE OF FUEL, (A) That local coal dealers, dealers in other fuels and consumers both large and small, supply themselves with all the fuel which they can in reason do, during the summer months. (B) That consumers of steam coal provide themselves with storage facilities (C) We recommend the storage facilities already established in this state. </seg>

A3t (A) That the County Officials in charge of the public highways of our counties take advantage of the new road laws passed by the last legislature and inaugurate a systematic and economical method of improving and maintaining the highways leading to the marketing points so as to enable the agricultural districts to transport the products of the farm at the lowest possible cost. 5. LABOR (A) That the State Council of Defense take steps to secure a complete survey of the labor situation in the state, so that it will be possible for the agricultural interests, manufacturing, shippers, and transportation interests to secure labor when needed, and at the points where needed. (B) That special attention be paid to labor requirements, during the heavy shipping season, so that there may be no delay in the loading and unloading and otherwise prompt handling of freight equipment. J 6. MULLING IN TRANSIT In view of Nebraska's short wheat crop prospect, we favor an effort to obtain an adequate milling in transit arrangement on grain at regular milling stations — sufficient to relieve the coming handicap which a goodly number of plants will have placed upon them by reason of little or no local wheat supplies. BANKING It is the sense of this Congress that every facility should be given to finance the production of farmers and ranchers of this state, con - sistent with sound banking. We urge the bankers of Nebraska to organize in the various counties of the state for the purpose of assisting in financing production, the intent and purpose being to do everything within the power of the banks of Nebraska to aid in the present national crisis. HOME ECONOMICS We believe conservation in the home to be our patriotic duty. We recommend the continuation of all essential lines of work in which women are engaged in various organizations, and that specializa - tion of conservation in the home is an added duty. We recommend the preservation of foods by canning, drying, and other methods. The purchaser of food supplies for the home should figure the units of cost, and every family should be urged to raise their own vegetables, or procure them in season, of some who have a surplus for home consumption, that each home may come as near as </seg>

We should re-adjust our buying so as to receive greater returns in order that canned goods may be conserved for the use of the army and in other places where needed. Nebraska housewives should conserve the use of meat, using in - stead palatable substitutes; we recommend corn products and whole wheat flour and more of such dry vegetables as beans and peas, instead of canned goods. The women's division goes on record as against the use of any food material for the manufacture of intoxicating liquors. We recommend that the women of Nebraska adopt conservative styles and materials in matters of dress and that greater simplicity be observed. In view of the increasing severity of the clothing prob - lem, we urge that Nebraska women take the responsibility of seeing that partly worn clothing be used to the greatest extent possible. We urge that each housekeeper reduce the waste of food in her own home. We recommend the curtailment of refreshments at entertain - ments. We endorse the Liberty Bonds as presented by Secretary McAdoo, and recommend that Nebraska women purchase these bonds as liberally as circumstances will permit. We go on record as opposing any interference with the child labor and compulsory education laws until the services of every able bodied man and woman has been exhausted. This body heartily supports the special department of the Women's Committee of Council of Defense, whose duty it will be to protect the labor, wages and hours of women called to fill positions of men who are called to military service and to demand equal pay for equal service. FARM LAND CONSERVATION AS APPLIED TO MILITARY USE For the purpose of conserving all of our farm lands for the pro - duction of foodstuffs, we urge the federal government and the war de - partment in the selection of lands for the mobilization and training of troops to select only those lands which cannot be adapted for the produc - tion of food crops. POTASH FOR FERTILIZER We recognize the fact that Nebraska is today producing the major part of the potash used by this country in the preparation of fertilizer for the purpose of increasing the production of crops, and we recom - mend that encouragement be given to the development of the potash industry of this state, and that the potash producing plants of western </seg>

PERMANENT ORGANIZATION In pursuance to a request from ths Chairman of the Nebraska Con - servation and Welfare Commission for the development of a plan tor the continuation of the work of this Conference, we, the Policy Committee of said Conference, beg to submit the following for your consideration. The situation appears as follows: The National Defense Council has appealed to our state. In response, the Governor has completed the organization of the Nebraska Defense Council and is now working on the organization of County Defense Councils throughout our state. It is the patriotic duty of the people of this state to assist these defense councils to the utmost, to assist as individuals, and furthermore to place at their disposal the facilities and the equipment of the many organizations and associations of our state, to the end that the data re - quired, the facts and figures in such urgent demand will be available with the least possible delay. We feel that a wonderful work has been started as the result of this Conference and that it should be continued as an aid and to make easier the task assigned to our various defense councils. With this feeling strong within us — the feeling that a service can be rendered — we recommend and urge that the Nebraska Conservation and Welfare Commission continue the work so ably inaugurated. We count this Commission the State's legal organization to gather, com - pile and correlate the information, the facts and figures desired. We further recommend the appointment of auxiliary committees from the various lines of endeavor in our state, to the end that this Commis - sion can secure the service to which they are entitled from the people in carrying forward this conservation work.

WAR ACTIVITIES OF THE EXTEN8ION SERVICE OF THE NEBRASKA COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE By C. W. Pugsley, Director As soon as it bacame evident that the United States was to take part in the world's war for democracy, the Nebraska Extension Service made the aid of the government its first concern. Wherever suggestions on food production or conservation could be obtained from the adminis - tration steps were taken to put these suggestions into operation. In accordance with instructions from the government immediate steps were taken to greatly increase the number of county agricultural agents, home demonstration agents, and junior extension workers. Since August 1st a number of counties have had the agent work explained and have taken the necessary steps to establish agents on a permanent basis by January 1st. On September 1 emergency district agents were placed in charge of all territory not having county agents to look after the work and to assist in organizations. </seg>
            <seg id="p091">PROCEEDINGS XEBBASKA STATE BOABU OF AGRICULTURE 87 At the beginning of the war an information service was established known as "War Emergency Bulletins." Up to date there have been twenty-three bulletins issued. They deal largely with the production and conservation of foods and food crops. 1. A World Food Shortage. 2. St. Louis Conference on the Agricultural Situation 3. Nebraska Towns and the World Food Shortage. 4. Bean Culture. 5. Potato Culture. 6. Prevention of Food Waste. 7. Food Production and Conservation. 8. Farm Machinery. 9. Planning an Economical Wardrobe. 10. Spraying Potatoes for Insects and Diseases. 11. Economy in Buying. 12. Economy in Shoes. 13. Drying Fruits and Vegetables. 14. Restrictive and Coercive Food Measures. 15. Controlling Insect Pests of the Garden. 16. Home Storage of Vegetables. 17. Grasshopper Control. 18. Whole Wheat Breads. 19. Substitutes for White Flour in Bread Making. 20. How to Substitute Other Foods for Meat. 21. Economy in the Use of Fats. 22. How can I Make My Clothes Last Longer? 23. Saving Beans for Food and Seeding Purposes. An increased number of regular extension bulletins also relates largely to war activities. All of these bulletins are sent to any citizen of the state upon request. The five main lines of activity in the Extension Service are as follows: Special meetings. County agent work. Home demonstration work. Junior extension work. Publicity. The Special Meeting group Includes all farmers' institutes, short courses, and special meetings of whatever nature. Approximately 3,000 sessions will have been held at these meetings by the end of the first year of the war. The attendance will doubtless be over 300,000. The pro - grams have nearly all related to the emergency confronting us. Great emphasis has been placed on food production and conservation. At practically all of the farmers' institutes demonstrations will be held in the women's section relating to the use of substitutes for wheat, meat and sugar. In the men's section great stress will be placed on the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p092">88 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE duction of foods which are needed in the war. A larger number of meet - ings will be held during the coming winter than ever before. COUNTY AGENT WORK By direct order from the government, the state Extension Service and the farm bureaus directing county agent work, the county agents im - mediately prepared their programs to help in every possible way in the production and conservation of the foods for our nation. Owing to the winter killing of a large part of the wheat the agents encouraged the seeding of spring wheat, and flour for many loaves of bread was made possible because the seed was located by the agents and distributed to farmers who needed it. Seed wheat surveys for this fall's sowing have been made by each agent and encouragement given toward increasing the acreage. Demon - strations were held in the proper method of seeding in corn fields with small drills. Many wheat smut eradication meetings were held so that our next year's crop of wheat may be as free as possible from this disease and that the quality of the grain for bread purposes may be increased as well as the yield. Because of the killing of the winter wheat a large acreage was thrown upon the farmer's hands to be either planted to corn, spring wheat, oats, or some other crop. The county agent, together with workers from the Extension Service, located great quantities of seed of all kinds, including corn, spring wheat, sorghums of various kinds, oats and beans. So far as possible the farmer was put in direct touch with the producer of these seeds. BEAN SEED Beans of the Pinto and Navy varieties have not been generally grown In the state of Nebraska. Because of the war conditions these were high in price, and the opportunity of trying out this crop in the state was exceptional. Many farmers were induced to try a small bean acreage, but could not find the sead. The Extension Service, therefore, located two carloads of seed costing about $12,000. This was distributed to 568 farmers at cost. A special bulletin on Bean Culture and another one on Harvesting and Storing Beans were prepared and distributed to bean growers. Re - ports are now coming in concerning the success of the crop. Western Nebraska is especially adapted to the growing of Pinto beans, and this crop will be of great importance in the near future. POTATOES Because of the high price asked for potatoes, a special effort was made to increase the potato acreage. Sound and disease free seed pota- </seg>
            <seg id="p093">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 89 toes were located and brought to the counties by the county agents. The acreage of potatoes in Nebraska was tremendously increased because of extension activities. Aid was given during the entire summer in fight - ing insects and diseases and a number of men are engaged this fall In helping in the marketing and storing ot the potato crop. Some special bulletins on planting, growing, harvesting and storing potatoes were pre - pared and given wide distribution. LIVE STOCK DISEASE CONTROL In the emergency work special emphasis was given to the elimi - nation, in so far as possible, of liva stock diseases. This is especially true with hog cholera and diseases of similar nature. Hog cholera vacci - nation demonstrations were given by the county agents, and resulted di - rectly in the vaccination of over 10,000 head of hogs. Many farmers who watched the vaccination and saw the results of the demonstrations fol - lowed the example set by their neighbors. By co-operative work which was carried on with the Bureau of Animal Industry veterinary inspectors have answered calls for the investigation of sickness among hogs of over 1,500 farms, and have visited about 1,200 other farms, making a total of 2,700. Gneral supervision has been given in the treatment of 16,000 hogs in 375 inspected herds, and in tha treatment of 45,000 hogs near cholera outbreaks. Hog cholera warning letters have been sent to over 10,500 farmers notifying them of outbreaks in their vicinity. In addition to this hun - dreds of inquiries have bean answered personally and by mail, and numerous articles dealing with hog cholera control work disseminated. Blackleg control has been urged by all agents and the three or four western agents have brought about the vaccination of over 8,000 animals against this disease. The need of eliminating the destruction of crops by pocket gophers, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and other pests, has been emphasized. The agents in Gage, Seward, Madison and Dakota counties have organ - ized gopher clubs covering a total of 2,000 farms. The work has been exceedingly successful in eliminating gophers from these areas. LABOR BUREAUS The Extension Service realized that a shortage of labor was sure to come and in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture placed a man in charge of the labor work early in the war. Later this man's office was moved to the State House to co-operate with the State Labor Commission and with a man from the United States Department of Labor. The plan is to have a labor representative in each locality, to have a County Labor Bureau in charge of the county agent, and to have a State Labor Bureau to keep in touch with the government, which receives re - ports from all states. It was thought that there would be a considerable amount of labor in each locality if it could be properly distributed, so </seg>
            <seg id="p094">90 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE this was the first effort of the labor specialist's work. His next effort was to redistribute surplus of labor from various sections. A number of people from the College of Agriculture donated their services in ths organization of Local Labor Bureaus. Eleven student agents of the Burlington Railroad Company located about 125 such bu - reaus in the Burlington territory. Five members of the Extension Serv - ice spent one week and organized practically 40 local bureaus. Nine county agents organized about 50 such bureaus. Activity of the bureaus has been determined by local labor shortage more than by any other factor. Probably 99 per cent of the bureaus are active when there is need for their work. Wherever there is a county agent there is a county bureau, and no county bureau is located in the state outside of the coun - ties having agents, except in two instances. Wages finally settled at about $2.50 per day and board, and from $40 to $50 per month and board. More women and children than usual worked in the field. There were few instances of crops being lost because of tha shortage of labor. The county agents alone have placed 312 farm laborers, and the labor bu - reaus have placed many more. MARKETING Exchange bureaus are conducted by all county agents, the object of these being to find a market for all grain and live stock not normally taken care of. Also to eliminate in so far as possible all unnecessary fric - tion and waste. Thess exchanges have also given special emphasis to the redistribution of second-hand machinery. This was brought about because of the shortage of farm machinery and the great increase in prices incident to the war. The Potato Market Naws Service was established in the Office of the County Agent in Alliance, Box Butte county, by the Office of Markets of the U. S. D. A. Daily reports of potato markets are sent to 2,000 growers. This has resulted in increasing the price paid to producars and lessens the price to consumers by helping eliminate the uneconomic speculator. HOME ECONOMICS Because of the nature of home economics work much emphasis has been placed upon that line of work on account of the world's food shortage. CANNING The number of trained workers was so small that if we were to reach at once all of the people in the state with canning instructions, we saw that it was necessary to hold special training schools. The latter part of May and the first of June forty-five such training schools were held at thirty-three different points in the state. Each school lasted for two days, and was in charge of a member of the home economics faculty </seg>
            <seg id="p095">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 91 from some one of the state schools. The Normal schools co-operate*. in this work. The total attendance at these schools was 2,150. Th;» includes only the women who came to all of the meetings, who re - ceived instruction and made a pledge to teach the cold-pack method of canning to other people. Previous to the opening of these schools a series of conferences ana schools were held with all of the home economics teachsrs, to teach them the method in all of its details. Several of these wers held in Lincoln and others at the state normal schools and the Curtis School of Agriculture. The mornings were devoted to laboratory work in which the women actually canned vegetables under direction of instructors. The after - noons were given over to discussions and demonstrations. Literature was distributed, and charts to be used were explained. After the schools wera held, those receiving instruction gave demon - strations and individual instructions in their own communities. Proper literature was compiled and sent to them and a question and answer circular was made out from the inquiries regarding the cold-pack method of canning, so that the instructors would have practically every question that might be asked with its proper answer. The detailed summary of the results of this work is not in at this time, but thousands of people received their first instruction in the method of cold-pack canning and the result was ths saving of great quantities of wood which would otht. wise have gone to waste. DRYING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES When it became apparent in the early part of the season that there was likely to be a shortage of cans the Extension Service gave special attention to methods of drying fruits and vegetables. The new method of drying was tried and found to be entirely successful. By this method sliced fruits and vegetables were placed upon wire screen trays in front of an electric fan, and air blown over them from twelve to forty - eight hours. This took out a sufficient amcunt of moisture from most products so that they could be safely stored for winter use. It was felt that this method, while valuable to those who had electric fans and who were able to purchase them, did not permit the poorer people of the towns and cities or the farmers of the country who did not have electricity available, to dry their products. They must necessarily resort to the oven method, or to the sun method, both of which had disadvantages. The Extension Service, therefore, de - veloped a community drying plant, and established the first one in Lincoln with funds which were contributed by the Lincoln Rotary Club and by interested citizens. The drying plant was operated by a com - munity club organized for the purpose. The plant was wonderfully successful, and while it had a capacity of 144 trays each eighteen inches by thirty-six inches, it was not sufficiently large to take care of all of </seg>
            <seg id="p096">92 PROCEEDINGS NEBKABKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the products brought for drying. As a result of this community drying plant, — the first one established in the United States, four other Ne - braska communities established like plants as follows: University Place, Fremont, Omaha, South Omaha. In addition to this a number of towns in Iowa, Colorado and other places put in plants made from the blue prints developed at the Extension Service. The reports of these plants are not all in, but they indicate that no plant was sufficiently large to care for all the vegetables brought as soon as it was found what could be done by them. The indications are that more than 300 bushels of material were dried In each plant during the season. This is an enomous quantity of food and had there been more plants at these places the dried products would have been greatly increased. STATE FAIR DRYING PLANT Secretary Danielson of the State Board of Agriculture conceived the idea of making one of these drying plants out of glass and placing it on exhibition at the State Fair. This was erected at the Food Training Camp, and attracted a great deal of attention. Two people were kept in charge during the entire week and there was no place on the ground where a crowd could be found oftener than around this community dry - ing plant. Quantities of circulars were distributed, and from the in - quiries which have come in since the State Fair, many plants will be established in Nebraska towns. The community drying work in Nebraska has attracted nation-wide attention. Letters have been received asking for information from all over the United States. Pra"tically every periodical has carried some mention of the work. The United States Department of Agriculture has asked the Extension Service to write a Farmers' Bulletin on Community Driers for distribution throughout the country. This bulletin is now in press and will be ready for distribution about the first of January. DEMONSTRATION AND EXHIBITS At the Omaha Food Congress representatives of the Extension Ser - vice had charge of the Home Economics exhibits. Meetings were held every day and demonstrations were in progress at all times. Booths giving graphic illustrations of methods of saving food and methods of its proper preparation were attended by home economics workers. At the Epworth Assembly the first part of August the Extension Service tent was erected and daily demonstrations were given in canning and drying. Workers were in charge of the exhibit every day from 8:30 in the morning until 7:30 at night. Great quantities of literature on food conservation were distributed and the names of women taken who wished special help along various lines. At the' State Fair the food conservation booths of the food training </seg>
            <seg id="p097">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 93 camp were in charge of the Extension Service. These booths presented the following conservation ideas: Child Welfare Conservation of Strength and Time in Housekeeping Wheat and sugar conservation Meat and fat conservation Home methods of preserving food This took the time of twelve workers for one week. Careful estimate of the number of people visiting the booths showed that 17,000 people were reached. A home economics extension worker was sent to each of fifteen county fairs and demonstrations in food conservation were given. At seven of these fairs the University exhibit tents were used. The number of women reached through these county fairs was 7,000. TEACHERS' INSTITUTES Work was given at ten county teachers' institutes. In two cases a whole week's work was given. In seven cases two days only were given to food conservation, while in one case the representative remained only one day. At each one of these institutes the people were given a chance to obtain copies of the food emergency bulletins and were given talks on the importance of the conservation of food. One of the most valuable features was the holding of individual conferences with rural teachers who were anxious to start the serving of hot lunches. WOMEN'S SHORT COURSES The program for the women's work at short courses has been entirely changed in response to the suggestions given for food conservation. In many cases the old recipe sheets have been entirely discarded and new ones substituted advocating the use of substitute materials for wheat and sugar. A prominent place will be given at the short courses to war activities of women such as Red Cross work, campaigns for liberty bonds, food purchase, and other lines of work in which the government is especially interested. The women's sessions at farmers' institutes this year are all conservation programs. PLEDGE CARD CAMPAIGN In the first pledge card campaign the Extension Service sent out all of the pledge cards and two or three of our workers devoted several weeks to organizing the state for the work. It was necessary for the University to pay for having the cards printed, as no funds were avail - able either from the federal or the state government for this work. The time given for organizing the machinery was limited, and the workers were few, but in spite of that fact between 50,000 and 60,000 women signed the cards during the first campaign. </seg>
            <seg id="p098">94 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOME DEMONSTRATION AGENTS Since the passage of the ememrgeney food production law giving to the state of Nebraska some money for home demonstration agents, special effort has been made to organize various localities for county and urban agents. There are now three of these asents at work, together with ten district agents. There will doubtless be from 10 to 25 counties organized by the first of January and the district agents will be trans - ferred to the counties with other agents appointed to take charge of the smaller districts. JUNIOR EXTENSION WORK The junior division of the Extension Service has kept in mind during this year the stimulation of food production and the preservation of surplus products. This special effort has resulted in a membership in the corn growing and potato growing projects of 295 boys who agreed to raise three acres of corn, and 153 boys one-eighth acre of potatoes. Many boys planted and kept records on whole fields of corn of from 10 to 20 acres. It is a conservative estimate that 150 of the members grew an average of 10 acres more per boy than the 3 acres required, making a total of about 2,400 acres Four hundred and forty-seven boys became members of the Pig-Raising Project, agreeing to raise at least one pig to maturity. A number of the boys raised a full litter from 4 to 6 pigs. The reports are not yet in but it is certain that each boy raised an average of at least two pigs, and that these will average 200 pounds each, making 178.800 pounds of pork. At the prevailing price for the last month this would amount to over $30,000.00 Two thousand one hundred and twenty boys and girls registered in the Chicken-Raising Project, and agreed to set one or more hens and raise at least 15 chickens. A great many of these boys and girls would not have been interested in the ra'sing of chickens if it had not been for the junior work. Our reports are not yet in, but it is safe to say that over 20,000 chickens were raised by these boys and girls and that they will be worth at maturity $20,000.00. Seven hundred and fifty girls joined the Sewing Club Project and agreed to give special emphasis on the remodeling of old garments. Two thousand six hundred girls joined the Cooking Club Project. In this club this year special emphasis have been placed on all things necessary to the winning of the war. GARDENING One of the special campaigns of the entire Extension Service as well as the Junior Division was the raisins of war gardens. A great many talks and much literature was spread broadcast over the state urging everybody to allow not a foot of ground to go waste in their backyards or on the vacant lots of the towns and cities. The high </seg>
            <seg id="p099">fBOCEEDINOS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICtTLTUEE 95 prices of food together with this campaign resulted in a very large in - crease in the amount of food grown in these places. In the junior work forty-six towns were induced to hire a paid supervisor to look after this garden work. In these centers alone there was an enrollment of 6,000 boy and girl members, and 3,000 children who were under ten years of age, who were growing gardens but required to keep no record. In addition to this a number of centers organized clubs without a paid super - visor, but used the special literature sent out by the Extension Service. According to reports received so far from fifteen of the supervisors the average production per child's garden is about $8.00. This means that in the junior work alone more than $50,000.00 of garden material was raised. Add to this the tremendous amount raised on the vacant lots and backyards by the older people, and we have an enormous quantity of food. Special emphasis was given at these garden centers, to the matter of canning and drying the surplus products. A great many demonstra - tions were given to the children and at the State Fair canning teams from different parts of the state competed for the honors, the prize going to Kearney. The State Board of Agriculture furnished a free trip and a banner to the winning canning team. This feature is to be put on next year with added emphasis. PUBLICITY The Extension Service was asked by the government to give special emphasis to the publicity of all matters pertaining to the production and conservation of food. Since war was declared six months ago upwards of 75,000 pages of publicity matter alone have been sent out by the department. In addition to this emergency bulletins and exten - sion bulletins, together with Experiment Station, and research bulletins aggregating 225,000 copies have been published. Several distinct branches of the service have been maintained. One service reached all of the daily papers of the state, and those in cities adjacent to the state line. An Extension News Service with an edition of approximately 2,000 copies a week reached every country paper in the state. A special home economics service was sent to various publi - cations, and a farm news service went to the agricultural papers of the middle west. In addition special articles were supplied to local news - papers as occasion demanded. The system of news distribution in the editor's office was placed at the disposal of the State Council of Defense, the State Labor Bureau, and special communications coming from these bodies were attached tc the regular sheet. GENERAL ACTIVITIES Space forbids a detailed statement of the tremendous amount of work carried on by the regular and special extension workers. Each one </seg>
            <seg id="p100">96 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of these has made special effort to increase the work in his or her de - partment, and so much work has been done in every one ot the depart - ments of the college that a special report could well be written concern - ing each line. The increased number of district and county agents both in the men's and women's work makes an extra demand for specialists from the various subject matter departments, and these people have been swamped with requests for help. More specialists are greatly needed and must be supplied if the work of the county and district agents is to be of the greatest value. Among the activities of the specialists might be mentioned the work done in connection with the reclamation of wet land by the engineering department. Drainage projects for demonstration purposes were placed on eighteen different farms totalling 1,183 acres. These resulted In the draining of a large amount of land in their respective neighborhood. Silos were emphasized and large numbers put in to help care for the big corn crop, and thus provide for winter food. Specialists in the dairy work emphasized the use of skim milk U the making of soft cheese and induced a number of creameries to make proper use of buttermilk which was formerly going to waste. Live stock specialists have made every effort to increase pork and beef pro - duction, two commodities which are greatly needed during the war, and which are being produced in smaller quantities than ever before. The plant and animal disease specialists have made every effort to save all of the crops possible and the agronomy specialists have not been able to answer one-half the calls concerning substitute crops and the proper management of Nebraska soils and field crops. DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE ON THE PLAIN8 OF NEBRASKA IMPORTANCE OF CORN PLANT. By S. C. Bassett. In writing of history relating to the development of agriculture on "The Plains of Nebraska," two features only will be considered, viz. — First, precipitation: Second, the importance of the corn plant. Something more than a century ago our government came into pos - session of the land later known as "The Plains of Nebraska," and his - tory relates that the early travelers and explorers all agreed in describ - ing these plains as an arid region, a desert, meaning thereby that agri - culture could not be made to flourish, nor comfortable homes established according to ideals contemplated by American civilization.

The title to the greater portion of the lands south of the Platte river in the territory of Nebraska was ceded by Indian tribes to the federal government in the year 1833 and north of the Platte in the year 1857 still, history discloses, that while thousands of families in search of homes were traveling the trails across the plains of Nebraka for almost half a century there was no demand on the part of the public or of individuals for opening these lands to settlement, and the lands in central and western Nebraska were not surveyed until 1868, and there were, practically speaking, no settlers, home-makers, on these lands at an earlier date than the year 1870. The total population of the territory in 1860 was 28,841, confined al - most entirely to Misouri river counties. The sixth principal meridian, extending across the state from north to south, passes through the city of Columbus in Platte county, and is approximately seventy-three miles from the Missouri river at Omaha. The 1870 U. S. census returns disclose that of the total population (122,993) of the state at that date only five (5) per cent were living in the territory west of the sixth principal meridian and that less than one-half of one per cent (587) were living in the territory west of the boundary line between Hall and Buffalo counties. Establishment of Ft. Kearney, In the year 1848 the general government established a fort (Ft. Kearney) at a point about one hundred sixty (160) miles west from the Missouri river. It was located on the south bank of the Platte river in what is now Kearney county. This fort was not established primarily to afford protection to settlers — home builders — on the plains of Ne - braska for, practically speaking there were none, but was established to afford protection to homeseekers traveling the trails across the terri - tory of Nebraska and seeking homes in an almost unknown, unexplored region far distant towards the setting sun. The Beginning in the Development of Our Agriculture Ft. Kearney was established in the year 1848 and in the year 1849 the War Department of our general government issued an order in sub - stance, that "daily precipitation or rainfall records should be kept at all forts west of the Missouri river." It is understood that this was the beginning in the keeping of a daily record of precipitation in the United States. It was also the beginning in the development of agriculture on the plains of Nebraska. The beginning in the development of scientific agri - culture, of more certain and definite information in regard to agricultural and climatic conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">98 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGB1CUI.TVKK It would be of great historic interest to know the name of the official who first conceived the idea and issued the order providing tor the keep - ing of an official daily rainfall record in this trans-Missouri region, for it has been of far-reaching importance, immeasureable value, in the development of the agriculture of the great plain's region. This order was issued by the war department fourteen years previ - ous to the establishment of a U. S. Department of Agriculture (1862) with a commissioner in charge, and forty-one years before there was established a U. S. Department of Agriculture (1889), the first secretary of which (Hon. J. M. Rusk, of Wisconsin), became a member of the cabinet of President Benjamin Harrison (1889 year book U. S. Department of Agriculture, page 7.) The keeping of a daily precipitation record in 1849, on the plains of Nebraska has, practically speaking, been continued to the present time and in the year 1915 there were 207 towns in the state where such records were being kept. When precipitation records had been kept on the plains of Ne - braska for a considerable number of years (twenty or more) it became apparent that annual precipitation was reasonably certain and constant in amount (taking a term of years together) and that the greater por - tion came in the spring and summer months when most necessary and profitable in the production of certain food crops, and with such valuable infomation available in official form, came the settlement of the state, the plains of Nebraska, by home-builders, and a beginning in the de - velopment of our agriculture along profitable lines. Conditions Affecting Our Agriculture. The history of the development of our agriculture teaches the im - portance of an intelligent understanding of certain fixed conditions af - fecting its development: conditions which have prevailed in the past, which prevail at the present and which will prevail for all time to come. The first of these conditions is that of elevation above sea level The elevation at the Missouri river is, practically speaking, one thous - and feet, and if we travel westward, along the same parallel of latitude, about two hundred fifty (250) miles to the vicinity of North Platte, near the center of the state from east, to west, we find the elevation to be ap - proximately 2,800 feet and if we go to the western border the elevation is approximately 4,704 feet. This condition will always exist. The second condition is, that annual precipitation in the state is affected by — dependent upon— elevation : That is, as elevation increases annual precipitation decreases. The third condition is, that increases in elevation causes a decrease — a shortening — of the length of the growing season for cultivated plants, more especially that of the corn plant which can make good use of a long growing season. </seg>
            <seg id="p105">PROCEEDINGS .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICt'LTrBE 99 To illustrate these conditions let us first take the history of precipi - tation records continuously kept in the state and along the same parallel of latitude. At Omaha has been kept daily precipitation records for forty-five years (1870-1915) the longest continuous period in the history of the state. These records seem to disclose that whether we take periods of ten years each, of twenty-six years, of thirty-five years or of forty-five years, the average annual precipitation is, for all practical purposes, the same (30.06 inches), and that, taking a term of years together, there has been no marked increase or decrease, at this point, of precipitation in these various periods. At North Platte precipitation records have been continuously kept for forty-one years (1875-1915) and these seem to disclose that whether we take periods of ten years each, of twenty-one years, of thirty-one years or of forty-one years, the average annual precipitation is approxi - mately the same — 18.86 inches — and that, taking a term of years to - gether, there has been no marked increase or decrease of average an - nual precipitation in these periods, and a like condition seems to pre - vail at the western border of the state wheree at Kimball precipitation records have been kept continuously for twenty-six years (1890-1915), the average for four years, for ten years, for seventeen years and for twenty-six years, being practically the same, 15.63 inches average annual precipitation. Daily precipitation records kept on the plains of Nebraska beginning in the year 1849, as revealed in the light of history, warrant the state - ment and the belief that such precipitation is not due to, nor affected by. local causes incident to the settlement of the country: That tilling of the soil does not tend to increase or decrease the average annual pre - cipitation. On lands, other than those irrigated, precipitation is a necessity in the growing of cultivated crops, and history has demonstrated that on the plains of Nebraska timely rains from the heavens necessary to nour - ish cultivated plants, while possibly less generous in amount than in more favored regions, are as certain as in other sections of our country.

At North Platte, near the central portion of the state from east to west, the elevation is approximataely 2,800 feet. History discloses that in this locality the average annual precipita - tion, covering a long period of years, is 18.86 inches and that the grow - ing season for corn is approximately 115 days. Under conditions thus prevailing there was produced a specimen ear of corn, fully matured, 8 inches in length and weighing 9 ounces, requiring 124 ears to make a bushel by weight. In the extreme western portion of the state the elevation is approxi - mately 4,700 feet. History discloses that at Kimball the average annual precipitation covering a period of 26 years has been 15.63 inches and the average growing season for corn approximately one hundred days. Under such conditions there was produced, without irrigation, in that locality a specimen ear of fully matured corn i inches in length and weighing seven (7) ounces, requiring 160 ears to make a bushel by weight. On the Platte river bottoms in Scotts Bluff county, where the ele - vation, average annual precipitation and growing season for corn are practically the same as in Kimball county, a specimen ear of fully ma - tured corn, reported to be grown without irrigation, measured 7% inches in length and weighed eight (8) ounces, requiring 140 ears to make a bushel by weight. Speaking in a general way, not to be understood as exact and defi - nite, elevation increases from east to west across the state at an approxi - mate rate of seven and one-half (7%) feet per mile. Also history seems to disclose that crossing the state from east to west, average annual pre - cipitation decreases at an approximate rate of one inch annually for each twenty-seven (27) miles of distance and that the growing season for corn decreases — is shortened — at a rate of approximately one day for each ten (10) miles of distance. Importance of the Corn Plant History and tradition seem to disclose that tribes of Indians in - habited these plains some three centuries before the advent of tthe white men: that these tribes had a civilization adapted to their mode of living: that they engaged in the pursuit of agriculture to a limited extent, culti - vating certain plants for food purposes and also, for like purpose, mak - ing use of plants and fruits gowing in a wild or uncultivated state. History and tradition seem to disclose that of the plants cultivated by Indian tribes for food purposes, the principal one was corn and his - tory discloses that when white men came to possess these plains, corn was the first food crop grown and the principal food crop grown and has so continued to be to the present time. </seg>
            <seg id="p108">102 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE While there has been a rapid and marvelous development in agri - culture on the plains of Nebraska (as well as elsewhere), and many other plants useful and profitable for food purposes have been grown in steadily increasing amounts, yet ever and always the corn produced has been of greatest importance, both as a food product and a producer of agricultural wealth, and history discloses that whether comparisons be made year by year, decade by decade, or using the longest periods in which official statistics of crop production have been kept — are available — the result is invariably the same, that the farm value of com produced in Nebraska not only has exceeded that of any other food plant grown, but has exceeded in farm value the total of all our principal food prod - ucts viz. — wheat, oats, barley, rye and potatoes. (Note — See tables of crop production and farm values of crops grown in Nebraska, compiled and made a part, for reference purpose, of this article). A1J will agree that primitive conditions prevailed in the territory of Nebraska in the year 1859 and especially was this true In our agriculture. History (U. S. census returns), discloses that in the year 1859 there was produced in Nebraska territory 1,482,000 bushels of corn, being an ap - proximate average of 87 bushels per capita of estimated rural popula - tion (17,016). Ten years later (1869) history also discloses that there was produced in the state of Nebraska (then but two years of age) 4,736,000 bushels of corn, being an approximate average of 65 bushels per capita of rural population (72,56u), and of the corn thus produced not to exceed five (5) per cent was grown on the plains west of the sixth principal meridian. Ten years later (1879) history discloses there was produced in the state 65, 450,000 bushels of corn, being an average of 257 bushels per capita of rural population (53,915). History seems to disclose there has been produced in Nebraska in the period, 1880-1915 36 years), food products, viz. — corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye and potatoes of a total approximate farm value as follows: Corn, farm value $1,861,142,000 Wheat, oats, barley, rye, potatoes, farm value 1,346,912,000 Total farm value 3,208,054,000 Corn, per cent of total 58 Corn, average Dec. 1st, farm value, 36 years, cents 33 The importance of the corn plant in comparison with any and all other food producing plants grown in Nebraska in a period of thirty-six years (1880-1915), stated in simplest terms is this — that for every one hundred dollars ($100) worth of wheat, oats, barley, rye and potatoes produced in the period named, there was also produced in the same period one hundred thirty-seven dollars ($137) worth of corn.

            <seg id="p112">106 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the compilation of the agricultural statistics of Nebraska some unusual problems have presented themselves, the solution of which should be explained — by no means in, the light of an apology, but rather in justice to the people who have collected the information upon which these statistics are based. The year 1917 has no duplicate in the history of the state. Specifically, we refer to the extensive winter killing of whea: and certain other crops. About 20 per cent of the winter wheat, as the statistics show, survived, leaving roughly 250,000 acres which were subsequently planted to other crops — chiefly corn and oats. The data upon which is based the agricultural statistics of the state is collected by the assessors early in the spring. At the time this information was taken little could be told about the winter wheat, and it was not for some time later that the ground originally planted to winter wheat was replanted to other crops. As a result the returns made by the assessors were manifestly at variance with the actual conditions, winter wheat having but a fraction of the acreage reported and corn and oats, which later proved to be the crops which largely replaced the winter-killed wheat, having greatly increased acreage. To have given out the reported acreages as accurate would have been ridiculous. Only one thing could be done under the circumstances. The approxi - mate amount of winter-killed wheat must be determined for each county in the state and a determination made of the percentage of that acreage planted to other crops. By reports, collaboration with authorities, and with the aid of government officials these determinations were made which served as the basis of the fig - ures here presented. While approximated in part, these figures are presented with the belief that for all practical purposes they are accurate and reliable. Certain it is that they are the most accurate figures available to any one and that agricultural Nebraska may have in them just as reliable information as is held by the speculator and which until comparatively recently was ofl» of the tools by mean* of which ha wploited the farmer. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE 107 It should also be mentioned that six counties — Arthur, Clus - ter, Frontier, Nance, Otoe and Wheeler — failed to submit their data in time or in the manner asked for, and they are as a result represented by figures taken from their reports of the previous year. It is to be lamented that assessors or clerks in these counties are handicapping their county, and, of even greater concern, their government, by such remissions. The State Board of Agriculture is making every effort, as a result of the requests of the government, to get this information that steps may be taken in caring for the food situation throughout the country. It is of governmental concern that officials do their duty in col - lecting this data, as stipulated by law. and it is just as much of governmental concern that individuals throughout the counties render the information desired as well as estimates of production when asked for. By reason of county clerks being members of local exemption boards a large number of reports were delayed. For this no blame is attached, but such is not the case where counties failed to submit any report at all. </seg>

            <seg id="p241">227 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOAJtD OF AGHICULTUBE THE NEBRASKA STATE FAIR OF 1917. A Survey of Nebraska's Biggest Fair It is most significant that in a year of national stress, with war clouds hovering about, that the Nebraska State Fair should break all attendance records. More than anything else, it shows the solidarity of one of Ne - braska's greatest institutions. To prove such a success in the face of disturbed economic conditions resulting from our entry in the war an institution must be built upon something worth while. And such is the case. If our educational system is worth while the Nebraska State Fair is worth while— for it is essentially a school and one of the state's biggest. If it were not so — if it were not its function to educate, better and ad - vance the various industrial interests throughout the state this year's attendance would have represented merely that part of the people who come for amusement alone — a very small fraction of the people who each year attend. The Nebraska State Fair is essentially a farmer's fair. Its patronage is chiefly made up of farmers; its exhibits are predominantly agricultural. This does not mean, however, that other industries are not represented in the attendance nor that other industries are not represented by won - derful exhibits. One must needs but go through the machinery grounds at ths State Fair grounds to marvel at the immensity and quality of that exhibit. On the other hand, one must marvel as much or more when he views the exhibits of live stock, dairy and agricultural products. Noth - ing finer are to be seen anywhere. No greater object lessons are to be taught than those forced upon the observer of these great exhibits. But wonderful exhibits do not end with machinery, live stock and agricultural products. Every field in which human beings are interested has its show - ing. Whether the attendant is a fancier of poultry, devoted to fancy work, fine arts or, as all of us are, interested in the "Better Babies" fie or she may find the best in their particular line of interests that the state affords. The Nebraska State Fcir stands for higher standards of living. It is the mission of the Fair to teach better living, — not "higher" living but better living. For the housewives of Nebraska, the week of the Fair may be a week of concentrated schooling. Better cookery, more economical management of homes, substituting machinery for drudgery, better care of the children — these are some of the most valuable lessons of all time that the State Fair presents in the most effective manner possible. What such schooling can mean to the people of the state is beyond estimating. If one home were made the better for the time, money and effort expended upon these exhibits the investm e nt would have been worth while. There is every reason to believe that mor e and more people are returning to their homes after a week's study of th e State Fair object lessons with new ideas as to home management and a willingness to spend their money for labor saving mac'hin e ry that may remove drudgery and give more time for things more worth while. Higher standards of living is the sermon being preached year after year </seg>
            <seg id="p242">228 PROCEEDINGS NKBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBK'ULTUBE — a sermon the worth of which is deep seated in the fundamental prin - ciples of economics. That Nebraska has a great future is not to be questioned by one who attended this greatest fair in Nebraska's history. One is likely to grow unappreciative of his state. The hum-drum affairs of life press in more strongly than the larger, though less immediate, things. It is not until one views the assembled evidences of Nebraska's greatness that he fully appreciates what a magnificent state he lives in. Thus it was that the wonderful arrays of Nebraska products brought one to a new realization of the immensity, the productivity and the possibilities of the cornhusker state. Truly, Coronado's vision which brought him to the plains of Nebraska in quest of treasure was more true than ever he had dreamed. The fabulous wealth was here — only in unrecognizable form, — wealth far greater than the riches he sought, — wealth that today pales into insignificance the vision that brought him here. Riches, re - sources and possibiltiies without limit confront every far-seeing man who is in intimate touch with Nebraska. That these things may be appreciated by all, the Nebraska State Fair presents a representative collection of exhibits that tell the story of Nebraska as a wealth pro - ducing state. To see it is to believe; to miss it is to fail to understand. It has been the aim of the Board of Managers of the Nebraska State Fair to make that institution one of service to the government. Govern - ment interests first, then state interests has been the order of the past. And so it was that with the declaration of war the Board of Managers began inquiring among themselves as to how they could make the Ne - braska State Fair be of service to the government. Should a fair be held was one of the much mooted questions. There was some argument in behalf of throwing up the Fair for the period of the war that interests and energies might be centered in war preparations and war pursuits. Much consideration and thought finally elicited a decision to go ahead with the Fair but to place it upon a new footing, whereby by govern - ment interests should stand foremost and the cause of Uncle Sam should be farthered in every possible manner. Accordingly, representatives of the Board of Managers went to Wash - ington, D. C, and there, in company with representatives from most of the larger fairs of the country, the services of the fairs throughout the country were placed at the disposal of the government to be used in any way the government saw fit. This tender of services was accepted by President Wilson and Food Administrator Hoover, and immediately plans were begun for a big program in the interest of increased food production and conservation of resources — particularly food. Suggestions of the Food Administrator were carried out and further plans made locally. As a result the Fair opened dedicated to a program of increased pro - duction and conservation and there is no longer any doubt but what these purposes were fulfilled and the effort successful. The efforts of the Nebraska State Fair in behalf of the government took form in what was termed a Food Training Camp. The work was carried on largely by people connected with the University State Farm — </seg>
            <seg id="p243">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 229 people who bad made the various phases of this work their business and life work. The "Camp" was located in the north balcony of Agricul - tural Hall, occupying some half dozen booths which were marked by large placards bearing the name of the phase of the work treated In each case. Here was taught a new and sounder domestic economy: the substitution of plentiful foods for scarce foods, the securing of greater nutritive value and increased palatability and the hygiene of cooking. In addition were exhibits of allied interest such as conservation of clothes, child conservation and conservation of strength. Thousands of people visited and studied these exhibits each day of the Fair and there is every reason to believe that this pioneer effort of the State Fair in food efficiency has been one of the really effective stimuli in the interest of domestic economy now sweeping the country. It is significant that the Nebraska State Fair fired the first shot within this state in the battle against waste of food resources. To fail to mention the Community Food Drier in connection with the Food Training Camp would be to omit one of the largest features of this great exhibit. Early in the summer a Community Food Drier had been established by the Lincoln Rotary Club in a north Lincoln settlement. The idea was also taken to X T niversity Place, where a large drier was established in the high school building. These two experiments proved beyond question that the move was a success. By means of the drier perishable foods were preserved at a cost hardly worth considering and with a flavoring and quality never before known in dried foods. For the purpose of exhibition at the State Fair a drier was constructed out of glass so that one could see the entire mechanism — if such it could be said to have. All during the Fair the drier was kept in operation drying fruits and vegetables but more essentially, bringing to the people of Nebraska a new idea in food preservation. Coming late in the season, it is not likely that the community drier was of any great value in pre - serving perishable foods this last fall but it is practically a certainty that the summer and fall of 1918 will see the community drier savine tons of perishable fruits and vegetables that have hitherto rotted in the orchards and fle'ds. As such, the community drier will become a very valuable ally of Uncle Sam. Closely related to the work of the Community Food Drier was the canning demonstrations conducted by teams from various high schools throughout the state. The work here conducted is constructive and of value in many respects. It is of value that the younger generation be taught the preservation of food resources, that they be imbued with the thought of saving and that they be schooled in the efficient handling of garden and orchard crops which are on an enormous increase in Ne - braska. Tbe families of tomorrow must be better equipped, in such matters, than the families of today. Not only is this true of work as demonstrated in the canning exhibit. The textiles department also holds forth a similar need. Textiles, to many, are an incident to the home rather than a thing of importance. As a matter of fact, it will be, indeed, many years — perhaps, many generations — before textile work In homes </seg>
            <seg id="p244">230 PBOC EEDING8 NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE will have ceased. It is conceivable that some future date will see such perfection in the manufacture of textiles that it will be a great loss to any one to attempt to do such work in the home. Until that time, how - ever, many and considerable economies are to be enjoyed and the State Fair's stimulus to this work has been in the interest of a worthy work. No parent could enter Agricultural Hall without becoming interested in the Educational Exhibit which extended the length of the south balcony. It is astounding what the little ones are being taught to do and the quality of the work they put out. Booth after booth was filled with exhibits from various counties in the state and were, without exception, of high quality. Also educational in a large sense was the Fine Arts Exhibit in the west balcony of Agricultural Hall. Showing for the first time in these new and more spacious quarters, this exhibit was of interest to every lover of art and culture. To have seen this exhibit was to disabuse one's mind of the idea that Nebraska is an agricultural state and nothing more. True are was typified in this beautiful exhibit and it should be a matter of pride to Nebraskans that the finer side of life finds so worthy an expression in this exhibit representative of the fine arts interests in Nebraska. On the machinery grounds in the eastern part of the Fair grounds was preached and taught the lesson of increased production as strongly as in any other deparament. The machinery exhibited is largely agri - cultural. In this year of 1917 it is of greater importance than ever before that this be true. The farming industry is, and has been for some time, short of labor. In the face of this shortage of labor came the first draft of young men for the army and with it went a fair share of the farm labor of the state. With other drafts yet to come the labor ques - tion among farmers is growing increasingly acute. Moreover, with our allies growing more and more dependent upon us for food and with increased demands at home by reason of supporting an army in the field, there is a far greater demand for the products of the farm than ever before. The one solution of the problem is machinery. Machinery it is that must replace the shortened labor supply on the farms and make larger production possible. Prodded by necessity the war has already made invention serve it until the whole nature of warfare has been changed. Invention has already stepped into the realm of peaceful pursuits and offering possibilities that are scarcely known to the indus - try. Farmers have, as yet, scarcely begun to make use of machinery in their work. The State Fair is performing an invaluable service to the agricultural industry in Nebra s ka in presenting exhibits of ma - chinery as were shown in 1917. Wonderful is the least that can be saia of them. In at least one department — Farm Products — no fair in the country can compete with Nebraska. Scarcely a criticism could be offered any exhibit in this class. A great variety of products were on exhibit — more than the average person imagines can be raised in Nebraska. The work entailed in preparing these exhibits is startling but perhaps no less so </seg>
            <seg id="p245">PBOCEED1NGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD (H AURICULTUBE 231 than the knowledge of the business required in raising and assembling the products. In the same building and adjoining the agricultural displays was shown the horticultural exhibit, the odor of which scented the entire building. This was, perhaps, the best horticultural exhibit ever pre - sented notwithstanding the damage done in some sections by extensive winter killing. The live stock was the best in point of quality ever shown at the State Fair. Quality and uniformity — these were the distinguishing fea - tures and it is safe to say that the work of the judges was made harder this year than ever before. The distinguishing character and type of the various breeds is becoming well fixed in Nebraska and a greater uniformity is showed each succeeding year. This speaks for improve - ment. It is also evident that stock is being finished better year by year. Old exhibitors profit by experience and the proof is not lacking that these exhibits are educating stock men as nothing else does. The swine exhibit was the largest in history, all available space being taken. The sheep, never a large exhibit, had more entries than usual. In the case of the horses, however, there was a substantial tailing off in number of entries due to the curtailment of importations and the demands of the war for horses. The exhibit was of fine quality, however, the ponies, in particular, having had no equal in the past. To give a survey of the State Fair without mentioning the amuse - ments would be to overlook no small part of the Fair. Primarily, the State Fair is an institution for serious minded people. Its function is educative and up-lifting. But it is not that alone. It goes one step farther. It provides lor a good time as well; it offers one a week not only of profit but of pleasure; it mixes profit and pleasure into a most effective "sugar coated" dose. This year the biggest attraction ever presented at the State Fair was offered the patrons — the Hagenbeck-Wallace Trained Animal Circus. At a cost never before put in amusements this great circus was secured and the effort stands as the firEt time that a state or other fair has pre - sented a circus as its main attraction. The seal of popular approval was given the first day by public and press alike. Never before had such a spectacle been seen on the Fair grounds as the big open air appear - ance of one of America's biggest circuses before the grandstand. In addition were the horse races which were sandwiched in between acts of the circus the whole presenting a series of varied thrills that kept one in utter oblivion to time for almost four hours. The mid-way with its collection of shows held the attention of thousands each day. All told, no better nor cleaner amusements have been seen in Nebraska than those of the 1917 State Fair and the person would be hard to find that could not find in them something that would hold his attention and interest.

The 1917 State Fair stands as the pinnacle of fair building in Nebraska. There is, however, every reason for believing that tbe 1918 State Fair will surpass it in quality and in size. As the war progresses a greater unity is becoming manifest among the people of the state — a certain solidarity and seriousness of purpose. A larger number of such people will attend the 1918 State Fair than ever before drawn by the constructive purposes upon which the Fair is builded. By September, 1918, an even higher type of citizenry will eagerly respond to this institution which is striving for progress — not only industrial progress but civic and social progress as well. Further than that, the 1918 State Fair will preach the doctrine of true Americanism more strongly than ever before and do its part in making of Nebraskans better citizens with larger war responsibilities. Such is the purpose and scope of one of Nebraska's greatest institutions — the State Fair. CANNING DEMONSTRATION Nebraska State Fair, September, 1917 As a phase of the food conservation program, Secretary Danielson of the State Board of Agriculturue invited the Junior Section of the Agri - cultural Extension Service to increase their efforts of previous years, and use the various canning clubs of the state to demonstrate the Cold- Pack Method of canning fruits and vegetables to the State Fair visitors. The teams from the garden clubs of Kearney, Fairfield, Holdrege, Ash - land, Grand Island and University Place accepted the invitation, and contested for the honor of representing Nebraska Boys and Girls Clubs at the Interstate Fair at Sioux City, Iowa, in a similar contest with teams from Minnesota, South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska. Beans, plums, corn, peaches, beets and tomatoes were demonstrated to an unusually large number of people, who showed their keen interest by their apt attention and the number of questions, which they put to the young canners. Eight double (two teams) demonstrations were put on daily beginning Tuesday morning. After a very exciting ' heat" on Friday to decide a tie between Kearney and University Place, in which the Kearney team demonstrated that they could can in thirteen minutes, four pints each of beets and plums and "clean up the kitchen, " against fourteen minutes for University Place, the judges by vote of three to two awarded the honor to Kearney. A team consisted of two boys and two girls and each member was costumed in the national boys and girls club cap and apron. Tbe cap and apron were decorate with a four-leafed clover, on each leaf of which was inscribed the letter "H."

            <seg id="p247">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 233 A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE POTASH INDUSTRY OF NEBRASKA By G. E. Condra, Director, the Nebraska Conservation and Soil Survey The potash industry of Nebraska has developed within a short time. Starting with Bmall shipments of alkali crusts collected from the shores of McCarthy Lake and shipped to Omaha, the industry has grown to a value of several million dollars. The processes involved in the reduction and refining of the potash have not been perfected to a high degree of efficiency. Four large reduction plants are operating, the fifth plant is build - ing and three more are to start within a few weeks. One refining plant is operating at Omaha, and a reduction plant building at Antioch will do refining also. Nebraska produces about two-fifths of the potash output of the United States, leading in the amount coming from lakes and lake beds. The Potash Region of Nebraska The production Is now confined to Sheridan, Qarden and Morrill counties. The lakes being worked lie north and south of the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad, beginning a few miles east of Alliance. The area with producing lakes, extends about thirty miles north and south and between twenty and thirty miles east and west. (Fig. 1). It occupies nearly equal areas on each side of the railroad. Small inter - mittent lakes occur on the table lands of Box Butte county and some of them might be worked. Among these are Bonness, Putman and Morrison. At first it was thought that only two or three of the lakes would become of importance as sources of potash. Now about seventy-five of them are known to contain potash in paying quantities. Though it is thought that the potash region of Nebraska has been fairly well determined, and that few strong lakes remain untested and unleased, we are convinced that the exploratory work should be con - tinued. Lakes with some potash occur in the Pawlet district of Garden County, in part of Grant County, in widely scattered areas of Cherry County, in McPherson County, in the southern part of Brown County, and in southwestern Holt County. Such tests as have been made of these lakes seem to show more magnesium and sodfiim than potash. All these lakes should be tested, however, and by wells. A considerable amount of potash is known to occur near Ellsworth. There are many lakes in Cherry County, as near Cody, near Merri - man, in the southwestern corner of the county and between Simion, Brownlee and Wood Lake. Among the best known of these are Big Alkali. Red Deer. Clear, Dad's. Pelican, Willow, Dewey, Marsh and Cody. Among the Brown County lakes are Enders, Moon. Rat, Long, Marsh, Willow and Chain Lakes. Topography. The lakes occur in two physiographic regions, namely, the table lands and the sand hills, but mostly in the latter. </seg>

The largest belt of such hills is in the north-central part of the state, extend - ing from Holt County southwestward. and occupying much of the area between the Platte and the Niobrara. Box Butte table is west of this. The surface of the sand hill country is comparatively rough (Fig. 2). It is modified by many hills, basins, valleys and lakes. The valleys are one-quarter to one mile or more wide. Their courses are very irregular.

B. &amp; Q. Railroad, the direction of small valleys Is east and west (Fig. 4). Most of the large valleys south of the railroad extend southeastward and southward. Those on the north, range eastward and northeastward, and in some parts nearly due north and s&lt; uth. The hills were produced largely by wind action. The more or less mobile subsoil was eroded from a table-land formerly connected with Box Butte Table. Nearly all of the original surface drainage pattern has been effaced. The hill form is not changing much at this time because of the holding power of the vegetation. </seg>

The table-land has surface drainage, and on the part where potash occurs, the streams flow into small intermittent lakes. These lakes lie above the water table. The sand hill drainage is largely underground. The ground water is shallow in the valleys and exposed at places as lakes. The under - flow is eastward, veering a little to the southeast in much of the potash region. On the north the underflow moves to the tributaries of the Niobrara and here some of the valleys carry small streams. On the south the underflow is towards the Blue Water and other small branches of the North Platte. The area where the best lakes occur is one of slow underflow and of little loss by outward drainage. This condition has been an impor - tant factor in the development of alkali lakes. Structure. The sand hill belt is covered with dune sand in the hills, and by sandy loams on the valleys and basins.

The bedrock immediately below the dune sand, and the surface of Box Butte Table is of Tertiary age. It is formed by what is known as the Arikaree Formation. This formation is separable into fairly distinct divisions which need not be considered in this connection. In general it is composed of rather poorly defined layers of sand, gravel, silty clay and light colored, friable calcareous sandrock. Below the Arikaree is the well known Brule clay, which outcrops prominently at the foot of Pine Ridge and at a number of places in the North Platte Valley. The total thickness of the Brule, the Arikaree and other Tertiary formations in this part of the state is 1,000 feet or more. The Tertiary deposits rest unconformably on the Pierre shale of Cretaceous age. Generally speaking, the mantle rock of the potash region is under - lain by sedimentary Tertiary formations and definitely cut off from the older formations which outcrop in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The structure of the bedrock near the surface is of the kind that would prevent leakage or seepage from the deeper formations of Cretaceous and older age. Transportation Facilities. The potash region is served by the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad (Fig. 4). The presence of a railroad near the lakes has been of great importance in many ways, as in moving freight and labor. Most passenger trains stop at the towns having potash plants. </seg>
            <seg id="p254">240 PBOCEEDING8 NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AGRICULTURE The public roads are not good as a rule. Those in valleys are fair. The stretches on hills are poor to very bad. They have been a hindrance in the potash development. The potash companies, assisted by the Alliance Commercial Club and County Commissioners, have improved a road from Alliance to Hoffland, Antioch and Lakeside. This road is south of the railroad. It is used principally by autos and auto trucks. Description of Lakes. There are many lakes in the sand hills. Some are small, being mere ponds (Fig. 5), and a few lakes have areas of 600 acres or more. The depth varies from a few inches to several feet. The usual depth of the larger lakes is from 1 to 3 feet. The lakes are constantly changing in form, depth and size in sympathy with the rainfall, underflow and evaporation. Most ponds and some lakes dry up during late summer (Fig. 6). There are all stages between fresh and alkali lakes. As a rule, the fresh ones are deep and with outward drainage. The alkali lakes are at dead ends of drainage. Many of the fresh lakes contain rushes, cattails, and other plants of similar habitat (Fig. 7). Those having salt grasses along their shore lines, and about which occur myriads of alkali flies in the summer time, are apt to be alkaline. The alkali lakes usually appear yellowish in color, yet this is not a sure sign of alkalinity. Their beds are covered with muck underlain with hardpan, called mag - nesia. Tb« water has a characteristic odor and a bitter taste. Birds and live stock avoid strong alkali water. Alkali and fresh lakes may occur practically side by side, bat as a rule, those on a given valley or hay flat show similar characteristics, if they have about the same drainage conditions. The alkali lakes contain more plant and animal life than is gen - erally supposed. There are several species of low plants and a few species of animals, represented by many individuals. Among the plants are diatoms, desmids and chara. The plants first named are very simple and usually called the single celled microscopic organisms. The charas are known as stoneworts. They are small branching plants, rising from the lake beds. It :'s thought that the lower species of plants occur in all the alkali lakes. The animals usual'y f-und in the alkali waters are bugs, small crustaceans and salamanders. Flies show up in the summer in great swarms which cover the vegetation along the lake shores. The sala - manders do not pass through their normal development, but remain in the axolotl stage. This animal is wrongly thought by ranchmen to be half fish and half lizard. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF LAKE BRINES The strong water 1b called brine. Two things stand out promi - nently in determining value of brines, viz. — the percentage of soluble salts and the percentage of K,0 in the salts. The brines contain com- </seg>

            <seg id="p256">242 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pounds principally of potassium and sodium, and traces of magnesium, calcium, iron, etc. The compounds are principally sulphates, carbon - ates and chlorides. The relative amounts of sodium and potash vary considerably in the potash region, and there is a yet wider range if th? lakes of the whole sand hill country are considered. By the percentage of potash is meant the percent in the water rr in the solids of the water. For example, a brine iur.ning 16 per ce:it solids and 28 per cent of that as potash (K..O) would be reported: potash. 28 or as potash, 4.44. Both these are correct, but they refer ir. the one case to the solids and in the other to the water and salt:: combined. The word "potash" has at least three meanings. In chenrstry it is an element. Industrially it is K.O, or some compound of potash or one or more compounds of potash together wtih salts of soda, maTn^slu-n. etc. Potash salts are widely distributed in nature. This is shown by the following, compiled from Mr. H. S. Gale"s report on Potash in 1916.* "Sea water contains 3% per cent of dissolved salts and .04 per cent K.O. Great Salt Lake brine contains 20 per cent dissolved salts and .41 per cent K.O. Searls Lake, California has in a saturated solution, 2.48 per cent K 2 O. Jesse Lake, Nebraska, has shown as much as 19 per cent dissolved salt and 5.96 per cent K L O in the water. The following compounds occur in the alkali lakes of Nebraska, but in varying proportions: Potassium carbonate, K.CO, — called pearl ash Potassium bi-carbonate, KHCO,. Sodium carbonate, Na.CO. — called soda ash Sodium bi-carbonite, NaHCO,— Called cooking soda. Calcium carbonate, CaCO, — called lime. Potassium sulphate, K.SCv Sodium sulphate, Na,SO, — called Glauber salts. Magnesium sulphate MgSO, — called Epsom salts. Calcium sulphate CaSO, — called gypsum. Potassium chloride, KC1 — called sylvite. Sodium chloride, NaCl — called halite or common salt Usually the brines of producing lakes contain about equal percent - ages of potash and soda salts. The amount of dissolved matter, the "solids," run from about 2 per cent to 12 per cent or more. Nearly fresh lakes have only a fraction of 1 per cent solids.

Various theories have been proposed, and persons actively engaged in the potash industry have shown an interest in this subject. As we now see it, the origin of alkali lakes is best explained by physiography and chemistry. Hence the following discussion: Development of Alkali Lakes. There are marked differences be - tween table-land and sand hill lakes. The alkali of the former is easily explained, but the latter is more difficult. The steps in the development of alkali in the small lakes on Box Butte table are about as follows: The wind erodes a small basin, or a drainage course is modified by drifting sand produced by erosion. In either case a basin or reservoir is formed which receives surface drain - age when there is enough rainfall. Water entering this gathers more or less alkali from the soil and subsoil. The solutions are weak. Inwash brings fine sediment which silts the depression and checks the percom tion. Water thus collected is lost by solar evaporation and the salts are concentrated and finally deposited on the lake bed. (Figure 8). This group of processes when continued long enough produces alkali such as occurs in Bonness and Putman lakes. These lakes do not have much </seg>
            <seg id="p259">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF AGRICULTURE 245 potash in sands below the lake bed. Furthermore, much of the alkali and soda in the incrustations is blown away when the lake beds be - come dry. Sand hill lakes are fed principally by underflow. The ground watei percolates through the soil and subsoil and moves for considerable dis - tances after reaching the water table. Many of the lakes are ground water exposed in depressions or low places in valleys. The depressions retain their positions with considerable permanence, yet the lake sur - faces rise and fall with changes in the contour of the water table, due in part to the rainfalls, but caused principally by seasons or periods dif - fering in the amount of evaporation. The conditions which determine the accumulation of potash in sand hill lakes are about as follows: Comparatively fresh water enters the lakes from the highest point on the surrounding ground water, which FIGURE 9— A SECTION SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION OF MAGNESIA LAYERS AND POSITION OF SANDS.

This seepage supply, though constant or nearly so, is most in evidence as a rule, in fall and spring. The water enter - ing some lakes, passes out at once. In others it is held back by a sand dam, or by the natural form of the basin. In case the water is re - tained, the principal loss is through solar evaporation which becomes very heavy in the summer time. It is safe to state that about five feet of water would evaporate from one of these lake surfaces in a year. The alkali soiuticns are concentrated by evaporation. The density attained varies with changes in the volume of water in ths lakes and is affected by freezing. Lakes supplied by considerable water, and sub - ject to evaporation for a long period become heavily mineralized. Another feature of alkali lakes is hard to explain. It is the muck and the hardpan or magnesia layer on the lake beds (Figure 9). These impervious materials have importance in trapping the brines. Formerly it was supposed that the impervious layers on lake bads were formed wholly by the inwash of very fine sediment from the hill sides. This view is now thought to be partly in error. An examination of the materials on the beds of several alkali lakes shows them to be principally fine sand, indurated or cemented by magnesia and alkali compounds. There are present also, compounds of iron, alumnia and organic material, most of which seem to have been formed in the lake itself and deposited on the lake floor. The conclusion is that the lakes, alter becoming somewhat mineralized, began to precipitate certain com - pounds. Some of the materials were thrown down before the brine be - came very strong. Salts of magnesium, calcium and alumnia were dropped in a flocculent, colloidal form, making the muck and magnesia layers. Evidently the inwashed silt and sand had secondary importance in the development of the impervious beds. The magnesia layer is best developed, as a rule, in the east and southeast parts of a lake. It may e* tend beyond the border of a lake. Referring again to the potash, it should be noted that the brine usually is most dense at the- lower end of a lake, i. e. opposite the point where seepage water enters. Alkali lakes deposit salts on their beds as the water lowers, especial - ly so in late summer (Figure 5, 6 and 8). This gives a fringe or belt of incrustations. The color of this deposit varies from nearly white to yellowish. Often the deposit makes fantastic forms on the vegetation and lake beach. Development of Lake Bed Potash. This relates to brines in sands below the lakes proper. Some have called these brines the sub-surface potash. Most of the producing lakes show the following section: (1) Muck and magnesia. (2) Sand, 2 to 40 feet. (3) Magnesia or hardpan, six inches or more. A second sand and a third hardpan occur in some lakes. It is not easy to account for these potash bearing sands and the lower impervious layers. Apparently they represent ancient lakes. But, the </seg>
            <seg id="p261">247 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE question arises — how were they formed. No hardpan layers extend gen - erally through the region. The typical hardpans are located mostly be - low the present lakes. This means that the same forces produced the surface lakes and the ancient or buried lakes. If this proves to be true, the land surface and the water table must have lifted during the de-' velopment of the lake beds, and probably by stages or periods. The table-land lakes have little or no sub-surface potash. The sand hill lakes may contain alkali in the lakes and in one or two sands be low, but they are underlain at some depth by fresh water. In fact, good wells of fresh water can be obtained along the shores of these lakes or even under the lakes proper if the surface water is cased out. It seems that the sand hill region, whose surface averages slightly lower than the table-lands has advanced westward. The water table came closer to the surface as the sand hills encroached upon the table - land. The deeper basins filled in to the water line, as the catchment areas of the lakes expanded. This chance appears to have come by two or three stages. At each stand, sands were filled in and a magnesia or im - pervious bed was formed. The sands between the impervious layers are so named because they are the sources of brine. They are colored light green to dark green by iron compounds and are sometimes called green sands. The color of this sand is dus to a film of greenish to dark iron covering the grains. Some of the potash prospectors maintain that the brines in the lake beds have come from deep seated sources, from what ihey call a mother lode. Apparently there is no ground for this claim t'cr the thick layers of Tertiary beds would cut off any connection with the formations of Cretaceous age. Then the Cretaceous deposits being thick and imper - vious, would prevent leakage from the older beds, which might or might not be a source of potash. It is evident that the view that brines come from a mother lode or deep source, is not we'l founded. A few persons think that the brines come from shallow, artesian springs. It is true that practically all the lakes are fed by seepage water and in most cases the intake zone is alons; the west edges of the lakes. In some places, however, it has other points of entry, even from below a lake. A number of cases were found while sinking wells, in which the waters below the muck and magnesia broke through and lifted to and above the surface of the lakes, like artesian springs. The lifting of the sub-surface water seems to be caused by the dense or heavier water in the lake itself acting upon impervious layers which extend to higher ground. This condition of unequal densities develops a head, which really causes the water to lift through an opening, and above the Iak3 surface. It should be noted that much of the water below the magnesia layer is fresh. This means that springs coming from this zone would have little value as a source of brine. The surface seepage does feed the lakes with weak brines. Our conclusion Is that the deeper hardpan layers were developed on the floors or beds of ancient lakea; that the water line has lifted </seg>

Where Strong Lake* Occur. These are found where the basins are most perfect for holding water; where the conditions favor excessive evaporation and where there is a large supply of potash bearing water. The most typical lake of this kind is Jesse lake. Big Sturgeon, Snow, Ashburger and Cook lakes are examples of this type. Ages of Lake*. The newest lake condition occurs on the table-land. Then come those of the sand hills in which muck and magnesia layers are absent or developing. The typical alkali lake with the hardpan bed follows, and the oldest are buried. They are represented by the alkali deposits lying between the impervious beds below the surface lakes. Lakes may be classified according to the alkali compounds they con - tain. These are discussed at another place in this report. The Probable Origin of Potash. The term potash as it is here used means potash salts, such as the sulphate, carbonate, nitrate or chloride or a combination of one or more of these with salts of soda, magnesia, lime, etc. The development of alkali salts beginning with the primary rocks as they occurred in the mountains, is outlined in the following paragraphs : 1. The Feldspathic and other potash bearing rocks of the Rocky Mountain areas were weathered and eroded. This released the materials now occurring in the Tertiary and later formations covering western Nebraska. 2. Debris from the primary potash bearing rocks was carried east - ward by streams and built into the late Tertiary formations. This con - struction left a smooth, high plain or table-land where the potash region is now found. 3. The high plain was eroded by wind and streams. Valleys were carved out of the land and the water table deepened. Then the sand hills were formed as the destruction of the table-land advanced west - ward, and the water line lifted. 4. The rainfall and capillary water were instrumental in weathering and leaching alkali compounds from the mantle rock and bedrock. 5. These alkalies were gathered from large areas in the eroding re - gion and from the table-land on the west and moved by the underflow in the direction of its drainage which for the most part was eastward. 6. Much potash was lost to tributaries of the Platte and Niobrara. 7. That part of the sand hills which intercepted the surface flow and the underflow, and in which the waters could not readily escape except by evaporation, became the potash region. 8. Water moving in from large catchment areas became trapped in basins and its alkali salts were evaporated to brine. The lakes through which the water drained and escaped remained fresh. </seg>
            <seg id="p263">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 249 Discussion. Vegetation aud prairie tires may have had some im - portance in the accumulation of the potash. But, the only work they did was to take compounds from the soil and release them. All the potash, as we see it, has come from the soil and bedrock, which were, in turn, derived from primary rocks. Water was the agency that brought the solutions to the lakes and solar heat caused the evaporation and con - centration. The precise chemical reactions whereby the potash compounds of the bedrock and sub-soil were released and taken up by the percolating waters and the underflow are not fully understood. Neither is it known just how the various potash, soda, magnesium, calcium and iron salts react under the conditions in which they occur in the bed - rock, mantle rock and lake solutions. It is known, however, that mass chemical reactions do take place between these salts, that the reactions are affected to some extent by the organic matter in the lakes, and that the compounds thus produced are not equally soluble. The chemistry involved in the development of potash lakes presents an attractive field for research. Probably the compounds enter the lakes mostly as sulphates. These in the presence of organic matter and iron of the sands are reduced to sulphides and finally changed to carbonates. The first compounds to be thrown out of solutions would be the salts of magnesium and calcium. The iron chang.-s to sulphides and sulphates which cover the sand grains, giving the greenish colors. The organic matter decomposing, unites with the broken up compounds of potassium and sodium forming carbonates and bi-carbonates. This would, with enough vegetation and time, bring about the elimination of all sulphates and leave carbonates as the principal alkali compounds. Viewed in this light the oldest and most mature lakes would be found to contain prin - cipally the carbonates, as they do in some parts of the region. It is possible that the alkali salts do not move through the sand dams and lake beds at the same rate. This, if true, will account in part for the varying kinds of salts occurring in the different lakes. The in - vestigation of this subject belongs to what is called physical chemistry. Broadly speaking, it may be said that the potash was released from the bedrock and its derivatives and concentrated in the lake beds pri - marily through the agencies of ground water and solar evaporation, and that organic matter and iron compounds have been important agencies in determining the nature of the potash compounds of the brines. Life History of Potash Lake*. Our studies show that the potash lakes fall into four stages of development based on their physiographic history. The stages are as follows: 1. Intermittent table-land lakes. 2. Comparatively weak sand hill lakes 3. The richest sand hill lakes 4. Lakes losing strength. Evidently the lakes in division one are destroyed by the advancing sand hills. Their alkali is moved onward to the incipient lakes in the </seg>
            <seg id="p264">250 1'HOCEEUINUS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AOBICULTUBE second group and stage. The water from lakes in the second belt finally reaches the basins where conditions are most favorable for making the liardpan layers and the stronger solutions. This gives heavily mineral - ized lakes which finally, through mass chemical action, show more car - bonates than sulphates. The three stages of lakes just named do not remain fixed. They change to a condition of decadence shown by de - creasing mineralization. This is the fourth stage in which more alkali is lost than is received. The cycle of development herein outlined, requires a long time, prob - ably hundreds and thousands of years. The number of good lakes in - creases or decreases, depending primarily upon the potash supply and the development of outward drainage. LEASING LAKES The methods used in leasing potash lakes and oil lands are similai. The work is dona by private parties, or by the representatives of pro - moters who expect to turn the leases to some company, or by the opera - tors themselves. In either case the person going to the field supplies himself with information concerning the ranch owners, and the names and locations of lakes. H&lt; j visits the owners and urges the desirability of leasing according to his terms.* In the beginning of the potash development practically all of the ranchmen were anxious to lease or sail even at a low price. Later, they were leary and in some cases annoyed by the persistence with which they were worked. The leases bind the lessor and lessee to a number of conditions re - lating to testing, erection of a plant, pumping, etc. Most leases have been just and fair to the lessors, but in a few cases there has been sharp practice. This has tied up lakas without production. The royalties range from 5% gross to 207c gross of the production. Most royalties are 12" L .', gross. The leases continue in effect during the period of profitable produc - tion of potash. As a rule, the potash leases cover the other mineral rights, such as oil and gas. School Land Leasea. The press has run a great deal concerning tne leasing of school land lakes. It reflects both criticism and commendation for the public officials having in charge the state lands on which potash occurs. There are few laws on the statute books touching the state's mineral resources. Such as there are have been used as a basis for action by the Commission of Public Lands and Buildings. A plan for leasing was out - lined and certain restrictions were named. The Question was raised as to whether both agricultural and mineral leases could be made, and thin was decided by the Commission in favor of double leasing. Nearly all of the school land lakes have been leased by persons not </seg>
            <seg id="p265">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 251 in the potash business. The purpose in most cases evidently will be to sell the leases to promotion companies or to the potash plants. A better plan in the management of the school land lakes would have been to determine the potash content of the lakes and the value of the same, and to lease to companies or persons ready and willing to develop the lakes. Probably this could not have been done under the law. Nothing has given more publicity to the alkali resources of Ne - braska than the discussion relating to the leasing of school lands. Evi - dently this has promoted the development of the region. Some of the school lakes have little value and could be leased for a low royalty. Others are of more value and better located and should be leased to better advantage. The flat rate of one-eighth royalty will not cause weak lakes to be developed. The school lakes are scattered in sections 16 and 36, except those on lieu lands, and are therefore not com - pactly located so as to permit their working in a large way by a com - pany operating a single plant. The school land lakes might be pumped by companies having pipe lines near them provided that contracts fair to the state could be secured. SURVEYS AND FIELD INVESTIGATIONS The study of sand hill lakes has been under way for several years. The first work done by the Conservation and Soil Survey was for the pur - pose of detormining what lakes are suited for fish culture. Then, little or nothing was thought of the potash resources. Many samples of water wera collected and analyzed. Another phase of the early field work related to the plant and an 1  - mal life which have importance as a source of fish food. Dr. R. H. Wol - cott and Dr. Elda Walker, of the University of Nebraska, were the leaders in the b'ological studies made of the lakes. Dr. E. H. Barbour, of the State Geological Survey, has studied and described the sand hill lak?s. Mr. Whitford. working under the direction of Dr. Barbour, visited many of the lakes a few years ago. A report wag prepared, published, and distributed by the Geological Survey. This re - port did much to show the value of the state's alkali r?sources. To Messrs. John H. Show and Carl Modesitt belong the credit for the first careful studies made of the alkali lakes. They began the field work about eight years ago and thsir efforts were chiefly instrumental in shaping the potash development. The past year has witnessed a great deal of activity in the way of lake investigations made by persons and companies hoping to secure leases and to stqrt reduction plants. The Conservation and Soil Survey has access to the results of this work. The State Conservation and Soil Survey, in line with its duties defined by the statutes, began a comprehensive survey of the potash lakes last spring. Three men were sent to Sheridan county and two men to MorriH county. One of the Sheridan county men enlisted, another worked until August, and the third, Mr. W. A. Norris, continued until </seg>
            <seg id="p266">252 PKX EEDING8 NEBBA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE November. The results of the survey in Sheridan county were unsatis - factory. Messrs. F. A. Hayes and V. H. Seabury worked northeastern Morrill county. Their mapping was found to be accurate. The writer spent considerable time checking and extending the surveys. Several difficulties were encountered on the survey, i. e., in securing lodging and board and on account of bad roads. Part of the time, roads were fair and some of the time they were too sandy at places for the use of autos. Land Corner*. Our greatest difficulty in parts of the region was due to the lack of agreement held in regard to land corners established by two or three surveys. Discrepancies of one-fourth mile were encountered. There is an overlap of three-fourths mile along the line between Garden and Morrill counties. The map shown by figure one of this report, is only approximately correct. It may be off three-fourths mile on the Mor - rill-Garden county boundary. The northeastern corner of Morrill county was plane tabled by our survey. The lakes there were tied to corners, observed by land owners, yet we do not agree with the original survey. Elsewhere, much of the region was covered with only a fair degree of accuracy. At places, where the corners are in dispute, the lakes were mapped from the locations given by ranchmen. Land line suits are pending in the courts, and until these are decided one should not be too positive regarding the legal numbers of the land on which the lakes occur. For example, the location of the C. B. &amp; Q. between Hoffland and Lakeside is not definitely known. Testing Lakes. Our survey did some of this, but could not undertake to cover the whole field. Preliminary examinations of lakes were made by finding the Baume reading and noting the condition of the vegetation, lake bed and the presence or absence of incrustations. The hydrometric test, if properly made, gives the percentage of solids. The water runs from zero to 5 or 6 Be. or more, depending upon the den - sity. If sediment is in the water, as it may be on windy days, the read - ing is too high. Hydrometric readings of lake waters are deceptive. It should be ob - served whether a lake or pond contains more water than usual or that it is low, probably nearly dry. A record made when a lake is very low shows a high density. Density tests have less value than was formerly supposed. If a good reading is observed, it remains to be determined what salts are in the water. There may be more soda than potash. About all that can be said for this test is that it may show whether further prospecting should be done in the way of laboratory testing of water samples and by putting down wells. Wells. Now that most potash is derived from the beds of lakes, i e., from the sub-surface, it has become the practice to thoroughly test out the waters below the lakes proper. This is done by putting down wells to depths of 15 to 40 feet by drilling with casing and sand bucket. Care </seg>
            <seg id="p267">253 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE should be exercised to prevent the mixing of lake water with that of the sands below. As a rule the casing is allowed to stand for a few minutes after the opening has been made through the hardpan layer In order to let the silt and mud settle around the pipe before water is withdrawn. If brines are t'cund in the first few wells, a number of wells are sun* in the lake bed to determine the producing area. The lake is surveyed into blocks, varying in size with the area of the lake. This gives well locations that serve to test out all the sands. In most cases the walls show only part of a lake bed to contain potash in paying quantities. This is the producing area. Samp'es of water are taken from the well at frequent intervals and placed in jars or jugs labeled to show the Iak3. the well and sample num - ber. An accurate log is kept of each well. This shows the thickness nf beds or layers penetrated. Hydrometric readings are made at regular intervals for information concerning the strengths of solutions encoun - tered. Laboratory Tests. The brine samples secured from lakes and lake beds are usually shipped at once to the laboratory. Some operators do a part of the laboratory testing in the field. They take a certain quan - tity of the water, let it stand for about 24 hours, and then make a hydro - metric test of the clear water. In order to facilitate shipment a given weight or volume of water is boiled down to determine the percentage of solids. A sarrp'e of the solids is sent to the central laboratory for analy - sis. The chemical analysis is made to show the percentage of potash salts or to show a complete analysis of all alkali compounds in the sample. Th9 price paid for such analyses varies with the determinations made, ranging from about $2 to $20 per sample. Evaluation of Lakes. The field examinations and the laboratory tests show the lake density and the potash content. These are used in deter - mining the amount of potash in a lake or lake bed. A report is made on the depth and thickness of sands.' and the area of the lake bed in wh'ch paying quantities of brine occur. Having these data and the chemical data it ia easy to determine and report the num - ber of tons of potash both in the lake and in the lake bed. Such investi - gations and reports have been made on a large number of the lakes in the region. The investigations of a lake should show the area in square feet the average depth, average density, amount of water In tons and the K O content, and for the underground zone, the area, depth or thickness, density, amount of water in tons, and the K = O content. The amount of potash in the lake and underground should be determined and stated. Eventually, it will be possible to make a fairly accurate estimate of all of the potash resources of the state. The value cf a lake is also affectfd by its 'ocation with respect to a pipe line or its nearness to other lakes that may be reached by the same line. A lake several miles from a reduction plant is not Dearly so valuable as one much nearer. </seg>

            <seg id="p269">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 255 BKINE PRODUCTION At first, the production was from lake waters, but now the principal source is the sub-surface sands. Production is by pumping. Brines are delivered to the reduction plants through pipe lines. Pumping. Wells are put down in the lake bads where there are strong brines (I-iguie Hi). Tue depth varies wall the thickness 01 sands. Some wells are driven; others are made by lowering a large casing and then letting the sand point down and filling sand around it. The large casing is then removed. This method gives the stronger wells. The sand points are attached to a gas pipe which is connected to a suction line (Figure 12). Wells are placed close in order to draw froiu ail the sand. This may require about 50 wells for each five acres of lake bed. There are about 1,200 sand points in Jes-se Lake covering a produc - ing area of about 100 acres. It requires high suction pumps to remove the brine. From 100 to 200 wells are connected to each pump. There are five pump stations at Jesst Lake with two pumps at each. Force pumps are used to drive the brine through pipe lines leading to reduction plants. Pumping is done by motor dr.ve or by gas engines. There are two twelve-hour shifts each day. Brines are gauged by meters or by the use of stroke counters. Most of the potash companies have pump stations at lakes anu relay stations along the pipe lines. Pipe Lines. There are several miles of pipe line in the potash re - gion. They lead from the producing lakes to relay stations and finally to the reduction works. Some of these lines are made of iron casing, but most of those now installed are wood, wrapped with heavy wire. The diameters of the casings range from 2% to 6 inches. Ihose made of wood 'are about 6 inches in diameter and are built to stand a head of 150 to 300 pounds. The lines are buried 30 inches below the surface as re - quired by the state law. Some ditching is done by hand, but most of it is by mechanical diggers. A plant operating from a number of lakes and with several pumps will collect water from laterals or branching lines at central points and then pump it to the central plant. Summer Lakes. The brines in some lakes are too weak most of the year for production. They can be pumped to the beds of other lakes when evaporation is greatest and concentrated by solar evaporation. After this is done, other pumps draw the water off and force it to the potash plain. The water of such evaporating basins is allowed to collect in an artificial opening called a "sump" from which it is pumped. The American Potasn company has made extensive use of this plan (Figure 13). Winter Lakes. Ice forming on a lake causes the potash to concen - trate in the water below. The brines are pumped when the density has increased sufficiently. This makes it possible to utilize the lakes which are comparatively weak during other times of the year. </seg>

Three additional companies are either building or preparing to build. The Potash Reduction Company plant is at Hoffland; the Nebraska Potash Works Company and the American Potash Company plants are at Antioch, and the Hord Alkali Products Company plant is at Lakeside. The Alliance Potash Company is completing its works at Antioch. The Western Potash Company and the National Potash Company are starting to erect plants at this place. The Standard Potash Company proposes to build near Lakeside. It appears that Antioch is destined to become the big potash center (Figure 13). This place has sprung up within a year. There are now more than 200 houses in the town. The two or three new plants should cause the growth to continue for some time. Equipment of a Potash Plant. The reduction of potash is brought about by methods similar to those used in reducing juice at a beet sugar factory. Machinery is installed to pump and transport brine, to evaporate or boil down the brines, to dry the concentrated liquors, to crush the dried potash and to sack the same for shipment. The small plants are very simple and easily installed. A large plant costs $100,000 to $400,000. It requires several acres of land for a site and usually includes the follow - ing equipment and buildings. 1. A main building equipped for storing, evaporating, drying, grind ing and sacking. This includes tanks, vacuum pans, furnaces or driers, grinding mills, etc. 2. Boiler and engine houses and equipment. 3. Bins for coal storage and tanks for oil storage. 4. Blacksmith shop, carpenter shop, and supply house. 5. Office buildings. 6. Bunk houses and eating houses. 7. Homes for employes. 8. Railroad siding. 9. Water supply, probably from wells. The companies have had difficulty in securing machinery and build - ing materials. This delayed the completion of plants. Evaporation of Brine. This is the main process in potash produc - tion. It requires extensive equipment and about 75 per cent of the coal consumed in a plant. In its simplest form, evaporation is done in open pans and by the use of direct heat. This method, used by small operators, i» slow and wasteful of fuel. The large plants use multiple evaporators — in double and triple effect. The evaporators are operated part under pressure and part under vacuum. Each evaporator consists of a steam chest, a liquid circulat - ing space and a vapor space. Live steam enters the chest of the first </seg>
            <seg id="p274">258 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE body in the series and causes the brine to boil. The vapor given off in this evaporator is carried to the second body and so on through the series. The boiling point becomes lower in each succeeding evaporator. This is due to vacuum brought about by means of a pump and condenser. "In the operation ol the triple effect, it is the custom to draw the weak liquor into the second body, then through a third and back to the first body, then from the first it is pumped to a finish- ing cooker, the object of all this procedure being that of preventing crystallization as far as possible by doing the concentration at the highest available temperatures."* In most plants the brines are evaporated to some extent by the use of solar towers. The condensation of vapor in the last effect or effects is produced by pumping water through a condenser, from which it goes to the cooling tower or to a spray pond. The tower is essentially one of the effects. The Potash Reduction Company uses two batteries of pans or evapo - rators — one a double effect, using steam two times, and the oiher a triple effect, using steam three times. In the triple effect, brines enter the first pan under 10 pounds or more pressure and at a temperature 01 about 240 degrees F. In the second the temperature is lower and there is a 5-inch vacuum. The third paa has an 18 to 2U-inch vacuum and a temperature of about 160 degrees V. It is planned to unite these bat - teries of pans making a quintuple effect. As has been shown by the foregoing, the brines pass through what might be called evaporators and vacuum pans arranged in a series. The liquor is reduced to 30 Baume or more. If the reduction is carried to the point of saturation the salts drop out as crystals and thug interfere with the operation of the pans. It would seem, however, that advantage might be taken of this crystallization and separation of salts. This could be done by keeping the liquor in motion and by drawing off the massecuite about as they do at sugar factories. The product of the evaporators and vacuum pans goes directly to the driers or it is sent to a series of open tanks provided with steam coils and heated with live steam. A concentration of 40 to 45 Baume may be brought about in these tanks or in otherwise specially devised "cookers" or finishing tanks. Drying the Liquor. The small plants continue the process of evapo - ration in open pans until the water is driven off and a crust is formed. This cannot be done in the vacuum pans of the large plants for evapora - tion must stop at or near the point of saturation. The liquor from the pans or crystallizing vats is dried in rotating fur - naces made of heavy boiler iron. The furnaces are cylindrical, 4 to 5 feet in diameter, 30 to 45 feet or more long, mounted on a low incline and rotated by a cog drive. The feed end is the higher. The inside of • W. C.

The liquor is fed to the driers by hand or from nozzles. The heat is produced by the direct action of oil flame blown into the furnace from the lower end making high temperatures. The clinker-like potash drops from the fire end of the drier. It requires two men to run a furnace. Each large potash plant has four or more driers. Grinding the Potash. The product of the driers is passed through grinding mills, of which there are several types in use. Each plant tinds it an advantage to install two mills. The potash is ground to the size represented by granulated sugar. Sacking and Shipping. The ground potash is sacked in burlap cof - fee bags and sealed. The weight per sack is 200 pounds. New bags cost 20 cents each and second hand ones are cheaper. The sacked potash is stored until shipped in car load lots. Price and Market. The price is set for all producers on a basis of K,O content. The price is now $4.50 or more per unit. This is about $90 per ton for 20-unit potash and about $126 per ton for a 28-unit product. A small sample is taken of every sack of potash. A referee chemist is selected by agreement between the producer and buyer to determine the grade. All sampling is done at the plants. The production finds a market in Baltimore, Atlanta, Richmond, Charleston, Jacksonville and other cities where there are large dealers in fertilizers. Freight on shipments is paid by the reduction companies. THE POTASH REDUCTION COMPANY This company was the first in the field. It built a small plant at Hoffland about eleven miles east of Alliance and has by a number of changes and improvements evohed a reduction works costing many thous - ands of dollars. (Figure 14). The company has pioneered potash pro - duction by experimenting on the methods and equipment used in reduc - tion. It has built and torn down a number of buildings. Recently a large stack 210 feet high and a big boiler house were erected. Also, new equipment for reducing the brines and for grinding the potash were in - stalled. The company owns many small houses which are rented to em - ployes. Attention is given to the welfare of the laborers through public entertainments, public bath houses, etc. The persons financially interested in the Potash Reduction company came mostly from Tekamah, Nebraska. Mr. John H. Show deserves most credit for starting this plant. Trained as an engineer and student of chemistry at the State University, he became interested in alkali salts used In the makings of soaps, and finally went to the sand hill region in search of brines. Associated with him was Mr. Carl Modesitt, a graduate of the State University, who had specialized in geography, geology and chemistry. These men spent a number of months making surface exami- </seg>

Finally Jesse Lake was located and found to be much stronger than any of the large lakes that had been examined. This lake being close to the railroad was selected as the one from which an attempt would be made to produce potash. Messrs. T. E. Stevens, W. H. Austinberg. W. A. Redick and Dr. H. Reinbolt financed the field exami - nation and the erection of the first plant. Messrs. V. I. Jeep and C. C. Denny former university students, were also associated with the or - ganization of the company. At first the output of the Potash Products company, the name then used, was small. By the middle of 1915 operation was undertaken on a large scale. Since that time the plant has operated nearly continuously. The product has been widely advertised and it now supplies a big de - mand in several states. The company either owns or leases a number of lakes both north and south of the railroad. Jesse Lake, (Figure 15) from which much of the output of the Potash Production Company plant has been secured, is 2% miles north of Hoffland. It has an area of about 235 acres. The surface water and the lake bed have been utilized. The percentage of solids runs between 10 and 20 Baume and the K,0 between 28 and 30. The lake has been reduced by heavy pumping. The water is carried through pipe lines to the central plant and reduced by the usual methods to a dried condition, then ground and sacked for market. Recently the Potash Reduction Company built a pipe line southwest - ward to Clough Lake. Extensions will be made from this to McCarthy, Wildhorse, Richardson and to several other lakes in Rice Valley. A pipe line leading to the Nebraska Potash Works Company at Antioch which is to handle brines for the Potash Reduction Company, taps a number of lakes southeast of Antioch. Among these are Lane, McFall and Herman lakes. The Potash Reduction Company is the largest operator in the field The output of the plant has exceeded 100 tons per day. The company recently built a refining plant at Omaha to which a part of the potash from Hoffland will be diverted. Several potash and some soda com - pounds are to be made at Omaha. THE HORD ALKALI PRODUCT8 COMPANY This company built the second plant in the potash region (Figure 16). It operates at Lakeside, just west of town. In fact it should be said that the town built just east of the potash plant. The Hord company has large holdings of ranch land in the vicinity of Lakeside and on which are many ponds and lakes. Most of these show a low density, but several are quite rich in potash. Among the lakes used to date are Cook, Dougherty, Cat, Mulhall and Simindson. A pipe line is being extended to Snow Lake, a small part of which is on a school section. Another pipe line is to be laid southward from the plant to Ash - burger Lake, a distance of about 15 miles. This may tap other lakes along the line. </seg>

LAKESIDE As a rule the brines worked by the Hord company are a little lower in solids than are used by the plants farther west. The potash content compares quite favorably, though not as high as in Jesse Lake. The Hord plant is well built and efficiently managed. It is in charge, of persons who have had considerable experience in the chemical indus - tries. The plant cost more than $200,000 not including a number of build - ings which have been erected for housing and feeding employes. The plant is compactly built and has a capacity of about 80 tons a day. Not until the late summer of 1917 was the full capacity reached. The central offices are at Central City. Heber Hord is president, and W. E. Rich - ardson is manager. This plant has improvements over others in the region in the method used in feeding the liquor or concentrated brine to the driers. The liquor is sprayed in from nozzles. A part of the reduction of the brine is brought about by blowing air through the liquor. The Hord Company ships the output principally to southern states for use in the manufacture of fertilizers. AMERICAN POTASH COMPANY The plant of this company is located north of the track at Antioch (Figure 17). It was built in 1916 and the first part of 1917, being the third in the field. The central office is at Omaha. Mr. Arthur English is president, and A. J. Dunbar is superintendent. The plant is compactly built and favorably located. The processes in reduction are about the same as those employed by other companies. The capacity is about 100 </seg>

The total production for the year ending December 15th was sold to the American Agricultural Chemical Company. The American Potash Company has several good lakes under lease. Most of them were secured from the Krause brothers. These lakes are reached by pipe lines ruunning northward about 15 miles and branching to the sources of brine supplies. A royalty of 20% is paid on these leases. A large lake basin is used for solar evaporation. Waters are supplied to this basin from weak lakes. Brines controlled by the American company are quite high in solids and in potash content. Among the lakes used are Krause Nos. 1, 2, 3, « and 5, the Marks Lakes, Harrion Pond and Turkey Track Lake. Lily and Bower Lakes are used as winter lakes. The original capitalization of the American Potash Company was $150,000. The capitalization was raised to $250,000. The company operates successfully and pays good dividends. THE NEBRASKA POTASH WORKS COMPANY The plant of this company is located north of the railroad at Antioch and immediately west of the American Potash plant (Figure 18). A considerable part of the water used for reduction has come from Ash - burger, Palmer and Wilson lakes. One of the pipe lines extends east - ward along the north side of the railroad and then branches to the Wil - son and Ashburger Lakes. This line is now extending southeastward to Herman Lakes. Another line reaches northwestward from the plant to Palmer lake. The Nebraska plant is quite well built, but it has not had sufficient brine at all times for capacity work. Some water used has run as low as 2% solids and comparatively low in potash content. The company has entered into a contract with the Potash Reduction Company to run some of their higher grade brines. This means that the plant should not be hampered in the future. The Nebraska plant has certain novel features for drying. By this scheme some three or four grades of potash are obtained and comparative - ly little of the potash is lost THE ALLIANCE POTA8H COMPANY This company, recently organized, is constructing a plant at Antioch. The location is immediately east of the American Potash Company plant. The Krause brothers and Alliance people are chiefly interested in the com - pany, though there are a number of other stockholders. It is claimed that this plant will be the most modern in the region It is being constructed with fire proof walls and in units, whereby the works can be extended if the developments warrant such. The Alliance company has a number of good lakes under lease. The first one to be worked is the Big Sturgeon located about 6 miles south- </seg>

The other source of brine supply will be lakes located 1 to 15 miles north of Antioch. These are some of the Wilk - inson lakes and others in that vicinity. Six-inch pipe lines are being laid and efficient pumps are to be used in the production and transportation of brines. The plant is building for a capacity of 100 tons or more per day. The central office will be at Alliance. THE WESTERN POTASH COMPANY During the summer extensive tests were made of lakes located prin - cipally to the north of Antioch and to the south of Hoffland. About thirty lakes, quite rich in potash are said to be under lease, as a result of this field and laboratory work. The leases are being taken over by the West - ern Potash company. The capitalization is to be about $500,000. This company plans to erect a large plant at Antioch to reduce and refine the potash. If the present plans are carried into effect this may become the largest potash plant in the state. Machinery, pumps and pipe line supplies have been purchased and the installation of the plant is to be started at once. Among the lakes under lease to the Western Potash company are the Briggs lakes, of which there are four or more, the Wilkinson lakes, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, Potmeeill Lake, Patmore Lake, East Valley Lake and Clark Lake. Mr. W. E. Sharp is the president of this company and the central offices are at Lincoln. THE NATIONAL POTASH COMPANY Not much data are at hand showing the resources and plans of this company. According to reports received, the plans call for a plant at Antioch to be located just west of the Nebraska works. The capitalization of the company is $500,000. Central offices are at Omaha. The plant will have a capacity of 100 tons a day. The source of brines, at the start, will be the Beck lakes located be - tween 10 and 12 miles southeast of Antioch. A pipe line will connect these and other lakes with the plant. Messrs. O'Brien and Haines of Omaha were the organizers of this company. THE 8TANDARD POTASH COMPANY According to reports, a company with this name has leased the Lunds - ford lakes and will construct a plant at Lakeside, located southeast of town.

Several of the lakes are on school sections and some of them contain very good brines. We do not have a report from this company, showing what plans have been made for building a plant. Mr. W. S. Ridgell is president. SMALL REDUCTION PLANTS. There has been more or less agitation favoring the building of cheap plants to produce potash from small lakes. The Rogers plant south of Antioch worked for a while and apparently successfully until it was shut down by litigation. The right of the operator to remove the brine was Involved in the dispute. The cost of the Rogers plant was a little more than $1,000. The product was hauled to Antioch for shipment. The King-Swenaon Company is planning to erect a small plant, at Birdsell Station, costing about $10,000, and to pipe brines from small lakes located on the tableland. The lakes now under lease are the Bonness and the Putman lakes. More lakes, favorably located, may be leased if the plant is installed and it proves successful. Messrs. Murray and Sarwine are associated in a small plant on Strong Lake southwest of Lakeside. We have no figures showing the cost and the output. The Robbins plant, coating about $1,000, is reported. It is said to be about 10 miles south of Antioch. SOME ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE POTASH INDUSTRY It is now time that this industry should be studied with the purpose of conserving it for the state. The following Is a resume of some of the salient economic factors that may determine the permanence of the potash industry in Nebraska. The Available Supply of Brine. Though a complete inventory of the brines has not been determined we conclude from data at hand that the volume of natural brine is less than some promoters claim. It is thought that if the plants now producing, building and contemplating building come to operation at their full capacity, the stores of high testing brings would be greatly reduced within four years. The brines are subject to depletion and economic exhaustion but not to complete physical exhaus - tion. Weaker brines are available for use after the richer ones are de - pleted. How long these may last cannot be detrmlned at this time. The Fuel Supplies. Two kinds of fuel are used in the plants — name - ly, coal and oil. A large amount of the coal is shipped from Wyoming. The oil is brought from Casper and Greybuil, Wyoming. The coal costs from about $1.00 to more than $4.00 a ton at the mines, depend- </seg>
            <seg id="p283">267 PBOCEEUINUS .NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Ut AGRICULTURE ing on the quality, whether slack, screenings, nut, or mine run. The freight rate is from $2.uo to $2.76 a ton. The government hag given preierence tor the shipment or coal to the potash plants and this has been of importance to the companies. At a lew times, however, the daily production oi the plants has been reduced because of a lack of coal. It is to be hoped that the excessive demands made on the rail - roads because of the war, may not cause the fuel supplies to be cut off in the future. The coal is used for generating heat for evaporating, and power to drive the machinery and generators of electricity used for light and power. Oil is used principally in the rotary driers and to some extent for pumping. The cost of the heavy fuel oil at the plants is now aboui cents a gallon. It requires a large amount of fuel to run a potash plant The Ameri - can Potash Company produced an average of 77 tons of potash per day in August with a consumption of 78 tons per day of coal and an average con - sumption of 46 gallons of oil per ton of potash. This was a tonnage of fuel greater than that of the potash shipped out. Fortunately, the potash plants are near adequate supplies of fuel. The price of fuel, however, is advancing. The heat economy of the plants is quite low. Hot water from the evaporators might be used in the boilers. Greater use could be made of exhaust steam and of the hot vapors from the cookers. Labor Supply. Most of the companies run a standing ad for labor. Bach of the large plants has 125 or more persons on the payroll. These include, pipe line men, pump men, firemen, drier men, engineers, chem - ists, etc. The wage is high, yet the common labor is hard to hold. Laborers are shipped in principally from Omaha. Meals and lodging are furnished at about |1.00 a day to persons not living in homes. The American Potash Company pays a bonus of 1 cent per ton of product per day to each employee. The effect of this has been to stimulate production. The plan may be put into effect at all of the plants. It is more difficult to hire and hold labor in the potash region than it would be near a large city. Some trouble has been experienced witn the I. W. W.'s. The officers of the plants are trying to prevent further disturbances from these floating trouble makers. The war is making the labor problem more difficult. Cost of Production. The cost of production varies In the different plants. It is figured on a tonnage basis. There is a difference between the cost of operation and the cost of production. The first refers to the outlay in carrying on the- processes in operating a plant. The latter must include all depreciation of plant, cost of leases, or price paid for lakes, royalties, expense in the installation of new equipment, etc. Unfortunately, no very reliable data are at hand to serve in deter - mining the cost of production. The cost, if properly figured, would be </seg>
            <seg id="p284">268 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE found to vary greatly in the different plants because of the advantages and disadvantages under which they operate. We refer to such as rich and weak brines, long pipe lines and their cost; low and high potash content; low and high royalties, and to conditions that have come as a re - sult of good and bad management. The cost of the production seems to have run between $20 and $44 per ton. The mean average is said to be $30 or more. The cost of operation has run as low as $10 per ton in some cases. Use of Potash. According to a report recently published by the U. S. Geological Survey potash salts are used in fertilizers, in the manufacture of soap, glass, matches, explosives and for tanning, dyeing, electro plating, photography and in many chemical compounds. Contrary to the general belief, nearly all of Nebraska's output is used in the manufacture of fer - tilisers. Only a small part goes to refineries. The production is shipped to the south and southeast and to such centers as Baltimore, Indianapolis, Richmond, Savannah, Nashville, Jacksonville, New Orleans and Memphis. Amount of Production. According to Mr. Gale, of the U. S. Geologi - cal Survey, the production of this year in the United States will come from the following sources: Natural salts and brines, in which Nebraska leads; alunite and dust from cement mills and blast furnaces; kelp; dis - tillery slops, wood washings and miscellaneous industrial wastes; and wood ash. There probably will be a production in the United States equal to 25,000 tons of K,O. Nebraska will account for about two-fifths of this. The 1918 output should be much larger in Nebraska. Demand for Potash There is a strong demand for the output. It is made so because foreign potash has been cut off. Normally the United States consumes the equivalent of 200,000 tons of K,0 annually. This rep - resents between four and five times this tonnage of crude potash. There still remains a large demand not supplied. This is a favorable condition viewed from the angle of the producer. War Prices. Before the European war much of the fertilizer potash used in the United States was imported from Germany and at a cost farther below the present prices. At one time 16% potash came in at between $7 and $8 per ton, and 20% potash at about $12 per ton. The highest price quoted on the first output in Nebraska was about $20 per ton. As the foreign supply decreased the price of the domestic product advanced. Nebraska potash now sells at $4.50 or more per unit, a unit meaning 1% of potash (K,O) in a ton in the material marketed — that is, a product carrying 28% K..O may be sold at $4.50 a unit, which would be $126 a ton for the material marketed. The reduction companies pay the freight The high price of potash has been a great incentive to the develop - ment of the industry in Nebraska. Without this the industry would not be in its present condition. Most of the producers are deeply concerned re - garding future prices. </seg>
            <seg id="p285">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA ST ATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 269 War Taxes. What is to be done in taxing the potash plants (or war purposes? This matter is uppermost in the mind of everyone who owns potash stock. A special tax may be levied on production and excess profits. It is believed that the officers of the various companies will show the right spirit in this matter. Probably the better plan (or the govern - ment to follow would be to stimulate production by not over-taxing the plants and to place the emphasis on taxing the incomes of the stock - holders. Permanence of the Industry. Is Nebraska to have a permanent pot - ash industry? The answer to this question is in the future. It is to be hoped that the future prospects may prove brighter than some think. In order to get at this matter let us observe the factors that should decide the case. They are prices and the supply of brine. If the first of these declines approaching the cost of production, the industry will be hampered. If the second, i. e. supply of brine, plays out, the in - dustry will stop. The plants are now receiving war prices for the production and there is no competition with foreign potash. Tlje war will end some time and with it may come lower prices. Just how fast the decline should come cannot be determined at this time. Prejudice will keep out German potash for a while. The government may or may not enact a tariff to protect the potash industry. Ordinarily we should expect a decline in prices fol - lowing the war, and probably a small margin will be left between cost of production and the market price. Looking now at the available supply of brine, it should be understood that it is subject to economic exhaustion, that it is not easily replenished, and that unless much more brine is discovered, the heavy pumping will in time deplete the workable supply. The best brines are being pumped. Future production will be from decreasing densities and lower potash con - tent. The effect of this should be apparent. The plants are operating on a plan that calls for the largest produc - tion possible while prices are high. That there is enough brine to sup - port most of the plants and probably all of them for a few years must be admitted. But this is a short period. The lower prices after the war can be met, at least in part, by using the Nebraska product in refineries and turning out high priced chemicals. The recovery of soda along with the potash, if it can be done, will tend to enhance the value of the product of the reduction plants. The depleting supplies of brines can be offset to some extent by the discovery of new supplies, by the natural increment or growth of salts in the lakes, by impovements made in methods of reduction whereby weak solutions can be run, and by a better system of management of the lakes and brines both weak and strong. This system should partake of the nature of farming or husbanding the alkali resources of all lakes. </seg>

            <seg id="p287">271 PB0CEEDIN08 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Or AGRICULTURE tistics are at best rather unreliable. The gathering of statistics, passing as It does from hand to hand in the various years Involves methods not alike and in many cases make a comparison for the different years al - most impossible. The method of gathering statistics has not been re - fined to a point of accuracy. They may, however, be sufficiently reliable to use in making broad analyses. Records are available, both in acreage and yield, for the principal crops — corn, wheat and oats — back as far as 1890. We can therefore show by these statistics the relative acreage of these crops since that time and have prepared a chart (No. 1), to show this graphically. In 1890 there was grown in Nebraska approximately four and one-half million acres of wheat. In 1916, there was six million, seven hundred thousand acres of corn; a little less than two million, two hundred thousand acres of oats; and three million, three hundred thousand acres of wheat. Dui ing this period the acreage of corn in Nebraska increased about one-half, the acreage of oats a little less than one-half, while the acreage of wheat trebled. During the same period there was some increase in the total acreage of available tilled soil, but statistics are not available to deter - mine just how much. This rapid increase in the acreage of wheat was due largely to the introducton of winter wheat, to better farm machinery, and to improved methods of seed-bed preparation. Until some time In the eighties, spring wheat was grown in Nebraska and with varying degrees of success. It was not considered a satisfactory crop. The lateness with which it ma - tured exposed it to unfavorable weather conditions which so frequently reduced the yields that the growth of wheat was practically abandoned in the southeastern counties. Attempts had previously been made to grow winter wheat, but the varieties used were not found to be hardy. Sometime in the eighties Turkey Red winter wheat, a remarkably hardy South-Russian variety, was introduced from Kansas. This variety proved hardy and rapidly spread through the southeastern counties. It proved to be a profitable crop from tha first. It spread north and west in the state until in 1894 it had reached Buffalo county. Prom here it worked west more slowly. For a considerable time it was thought to be less adapted than spring wheat to western Nebraska conditions. With the introduction of the press drill as a better means of seeding and a better understanding of conditions and crop requirements, it has continued to advance until now it is grown to some extent in almost all sections of the state. Winter wheat has several distinct advantages over spring wheat, wherever the former can be successfully grown. It has usually given much larger yields. As it is sown in the fall of the year, it relieves the pressure of work in the early spring when most of the other seeding is being done. It ripens at least ten days earlier than spring wheat and escapes by that much the danger of insect ravages or unfavorable weather conditions There is no evidence that winter wheat is losing its popularity as a </seg>

            <seg id="p289">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE 273 been an actual decrease in the acreage of oats. Wheat, however, shows an increase in acreage of more than one-half million acres. Some of this increase in acreage has been due to the breaking out of new land In the western part of the state and some of it has been due to the winter wheat having become more commonly grown in sections of the western part of the state where formerly only spring wheat was grown. There is no evidence, however, that in any of the counties where winter wheat has been a staple crop there has been a lessening of the acreage. There is always a fluctuation, but the evidence is that it is nothing more than seasonal. In order to determine, if possible, the relative importance of wheat in the state, we must take both the yearly and the average yields. The average yields for the past twenty-seven years, as shown by the statistics compiled by the State Board of Agriculture are 24.9 bushels for corn, 27.0 bushels for oats, and 16.9 bushels for wheat. In these records spring and winter wheat are considered together. Obviously these figures are not based on accurately determined yields, and can only be approximate. Accurate records of yields are available for the past fifteen years from the experiment station. The yields obtained there are higher than those obtained throughout the state, but any effect of better land or better tillage would influence the yield of all crops alike and a comparison of the yields obtained there would show the relative position of the vari - ous crops in regard to yield. We have, therefore charted (Chart II), the yields for the past fifteen years, of oats, corn and winter wheat at the experiment station at Lincoln. During that period the average yield of corn was 58 bushels, oats 53 bushels and winter wheat 36 bushels. Dur - ing the past eight years spring wheat has been compared with the other crops and its average yield has been 19 bushels, just a little more than one-half that of winter wheat during the same period. We will not attempt to determine the profit per acre. It is, however, easy to determine the gross income per acre. During this same interval of time the average price in Nebraska for these crops has been, corn 51 cents, wheat 81 cents, and oats 32 cents per bushel. Based on the average yields obtained at the experiment station, this would give a gross income per acre of $29.58 for corn, $29.16 for winter wheat, $19.16 or oats and $15.39 for spring wheat. Based on the average yield in the state and the same average price, oats have given a gross income of $9.64 per acre, corn $12.70 per acre, and wheat $13.69 per acre — one cent less than one dollar per acre more for wheat than for corn. Judging from the gross income, wheat (winter wheat where it can be grown) and corn are Nebraska's most profitable cash grain crops. The meagre data available indicate that the acre cost of growing corn is a little less than for growing wheat. If such is the case, corn may be a little more profitable than wheat, since there is so little difference in the gross acre income from these two crops. One cannot, however, plant all of bis land to corn, nor would It be advisable under Nebraska's climatic conditions to do so. Experience has shown us that Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p290">274 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sometimes has seasons favorable to the production of wheat and not of corn, or vice versa. This is very clearly shown in the results obtained at the experiment station during the seasons of 1912, 1913 and 1914.

Nineteen hundred and fourteen was favorable to both crops and corn made fifty - three and wheat thirty-four bushels per acre. In IMS, wheat was grown at a loss and corn was profitable. In 1913 wheat was very profitable and corn a loss. In 1914 both were profitable. Such conditions are sure to continue. It is impossible to forecast weather conditions. Sane farm - ing, therefore, dictates the growing of more than one crop wherever the system of farming is grain farming. The results obtained give wheat an important place in Nebraska agriculture. In order to get the best possible returns from the equipment of horse power, machinery, and Hi bor, the work of the farm must be distributed as much aa possible throughout the year. It stands to reason that it would take more equip - ment to tend a certain sized farm in corn alone than it would if a part of the land were planted to wheat. Where winter wheat is grown, the fall seeding greatly relieves the pressure of spring work, and ripening earlier it can be harvested ahead of other small grains, thus relieving the pressure at harvest In methods of tillage for wheat production there is very little to saj. The climatic conditions in Nebraska are not stable enough to allow one to lay down definite systems of tillage. To be successful any system must be elastic enough to meet the erratic conditions that may occur. There are, however, certain rather definite ways of putting in wheat in rather definite areas in the state. These are subject to seasonal varu. tions, but are in the main accepted as good practices. In the eastern part of the state, early plowing for wheat has given best results. Early plowing destroys the weeds, catches the moisture, and allows time for the soil to settle before seeding. This system ncessitates an intermedi - ate crop between corn and winter wheat. In the western part of the state, the chances are about even over a period of years for wheat on early plowing as compared with wheat seeded in the corn stalks. Seed - ing in the corn stalks is naturally cheaper, and, as a consequence, the major portion of the wheat is sown in that manner, thus eliminating the less profitable intermediate crop. In other words, in western Nebraska it can be corn and wheat while in eastern Nebraska there must be a crop of spring grain between corn and wheat. The question of crop rotation is far from definitely settled. The present practice of corn and wheat in the western part of the state does not take into consideration the question of soil fertility There the soil is comparatively new and the problem of fertility is of much less im - portance at this time than the problem of available moisture. In the eastern part of the state the rotation usually advocated is corn one ot two years, followed by oats, and then winter wheat. On lands that have been cropped for considerable time there is every evidence that includ - ing a legume in the rotation is profitable, and this is being more and more practiced. The popular legume is clover and comes between tn» wheat and corn. Where the soils are not showing depletion, however, definite rotations are not popular. Oats, which are the common inter- </seg>

The tendency therefore Ik for the farmers to leave them out. A fanner recently remarked that "The best rotation was to get the moat out of the land," saying that he frequently followed wheat with wheat for two or three years. In </seg>

He would follow corn with corn for the same period and then change the two, using some oats as an intermediate crop and seeding some wheat in the corn stalks. His object was to gei about sixty acres of wheat on his quarter section and about the same amount of corn, growing comparatively small areas of oats and alfalfa with a little pasture on the remainder. Occasionally in the eastern part of the state wheat is sown in the corn, especially on sandy land and an intermediate crop omitted. The practice, however, is limited for two reasons: there is probably more trouble with weeds, and the corn, due to its larger growth, may fall over and make it more difficult to do the seeding in eastern Nebraska than it is in western Nebraska. So far as diseases go, Nebraska is probably fully as well off as any of the wheat growing sections. This is especially true in the case of winter wheat. Winter wheat ripens at such a time that there is usually very little trouble with rust There is some evidence of scab, but so far it has not proven serious. A rapidly increasing damage from smut is being reported. Both the loose and stinking smuts are present. The treatment for the loose smut is not very widely known or practiced in this state, but it can be controlled by what is known as the modified hot water treatment. Stinking smut can be practically eradicated by the formalin treatment. Damage from Hessian fly or from chinch bugs is sel - dom serious, though they do occur in the southeastern part of the state. So far as variety is concerned, we now have varieties of wheat very well adapted to all sections of the state where wheat is grown. In win - ter wheat any of the Crimean wheats, Turkey Red, Kharkov, or Beloglina, are well adapted and hardy. Turkey Red is far more commonly grown than any other winter wheat in the state. In some of the southeastern counties, softer winter wheats are occasionally tried, but they have not proved as satisfactory. Marvelous, a comparatively recent variety, has given good yields, but of inferior quality. Wherever winter wheat can be grown there is little question of Its desirability. It not only allows for the better distribution of the farm labor by fall seeding, but ripens earlier and escapes' to that extent the danger from damage from unfavorable weather conditions, insects, or diseases. In the eastern part of the state, if the weather is hot and dry, spring wheats are usually shriveled. If the weather is moist and warm, which is favorable to the production of rust, this disease will at - tack it and the crop will not properly fill. It has been found in almost all sections of the state that where winter wheat can be grown, it has given higher yields than spring wheat. For this reason, the production of spring wheat has decreased rather than increased within the state. There may be reasons occasionally for the seeding of spring wheat Due to certain well recognized factors, the seeding of fall wheat for the crop of 1918 is considerably below normal. This can doubtless be par- </seg>

There are two distinct types of spring wheat grown in the state. They are known as Common and the Durum or Macaroni. The Durum or Macaroni is not supposed to be adapted to conditions as humid as those obtaining in eastern Nebraska. It is supposed to do best where the rain - fall is under 20 inches. Durum wheat is rather extensively grown in the western and northwestern parts of the state. Of the Common spring wheats, there are several varieties that have given about equally good results at the Lincoln station. These are Swedish, Bearded Fife, Marquis and Early Java. The Swedish and Marquis are both commer - cial varieties and can be obtained on that basis. Spring wheat is mpei extensively grown in the northern and northeastern parts of the state. In Chart No. 3 (prepared by Prof. R. R. Spafford of the Panne Manage - ment Department) is shown the division between the spring and winter wheat areas. The broken line shows where spring and winter wheat met on a fifty-fifty basis in the year of 1910. The solid line shows the same for 1916. These lines represent the place where the acreage of spring wheat was practically equal to the acreage of winter wheat. North of that line spring wheat predominates and, south of the line, winter wheat. It will be noticed that the winter wheat area is quite rapidly encroach - ing upon the spring wheat area. There is a reason to believe that win - ter wheat will largely replace spring wheat in the entire state. Chart 4 (by R. R. Spafford) shows the areas where wheat is most extensively grown in Nebraska. This area lies south of the Platte river and just west of Gage and Lancaster counties. In it the soil and climatic condi - tions are admirably adapted to the growing of wheat and the experience of farmers has been that wheat is the most certain crop that can be grown. This is borne out by the fact that one-third of all the cultivated land, or twenty per cent of the total land in this particular territory, is usually sown to wheat. In summing up all the evidence, there seems to be no indication in the past records or in the present conditions that wheat will become a less important crop in Nebraska agriculture. Its place seems firmly fixed by a number of very important factors. It is one of the two most profitable cash grain crops. Including wheat in the farming system where wheat is adapted rather than narrowing down to corn as a main crop reduces the danger of loss through adverse climatic conditions. It also allows for the better distribution of labor. Wheat farming lends itself to the use of big machinery. At this time, with the scarcity of labor and the high prices .this is an important factor Under the past conditions of land and labor values and prices obtained, wheat growing has been profitable for Nebraska farmers, and, unless those conditions change radically, there is no reason to believe that wheat growing will become less important </seg>

Frandsen, Professor of Dairy Husbandry, University of Nebraska Since the beginning of the world war in August, 1914, many a pre - diction has been made as to the duration of the war and its effect on the industrial and agricultural situation in America. Possibly because they were based on imagination, hut largely because accurate informa - tion was not obtainable, these predictions are in need of more or less modification However, statistics are now available indicating that over 60,000,000 men have been withdrawn from productive fields to take up actively some phase of war work. These men are not only not producing, but are entirely dependent on the efforts of others for their food supply. This situation will aid us in understanding the food shortage exist - ing at the present time. As a nation we had formerly been concerned only with feeding our own population and, with seemingly a good balance for export, we had not considered it as a problem. Statistics show, however, that even In normal times the rate of food production in America had not kept pace with the increase in population so that, though we prided ourselves on being a land of plenty — and rightly so — we seemed to have been ap - proaching the time when we, like the peoples of older nations, would have to meet the question of food production squarely, and work out our own salvation as older nations have been forced to do. This problem has been rushed upon us by our entry into the war. Not only has our producing population bean reduced by the number of our soldiers in the field and in training camps, but our consuming popu - atlion has been greatly increased, for not only have we to feed our sol - diers and ourselves, but we must help more than ever before to meet the distress of our allies. We must send them immense quantities of wheat and meat, fat and sugar and dairy products. It has suddenly been discovered that our immense surplus has dis - appeared and that now our efforts must be bent toward a much greater production as well as toward conserving the limited supply now on hann. According to statistics compiled by the United States Food Adminis - tration, the production of dairy products in the United States did not in the years just preceding the war keep pace with the increase in popula - tion, to say nothing of the enormous additional demands on account of the war. The further fact that, according to Hoover, the cattle of Europe have been reduced some 28,000,000 since the war began, indicates an alarming decrease in dairy products abroad. This decrease is further emphasized by the enormous increase in dairy exports of the United States. Increase in Dairy Exports Government statistics recently compiled show that the exports of butter increased from 3,693,597 in 1914 to 26,835,092 pounds in 1917. For the same period the cheese exports increased from 2,027,577 pounds to </seg>
            <seg id="p296">280 PBH KKIilNdS NKRBASKA STATE UOABD OF AOBICULTURE 66,087,213 pounds. The increase in the export of condensed milk is even more striking, the exports in 1914 being 16,209,082 pounds and in 1917, 259,102,213 pounds. Demand for Dairy Product* On account of the depletion of European food resources and of the constantly increasing number of American soldiers in Europe, it is abso - lutely certain that, at least, until the end of the war we may expect a constantly increasing demand for dairy products abroad. In addition, tt Is safe to assume that this marked demand will continue for at least a period after the war, for naturally the first action of the peoples of devastated Europe toward reconstruction will be directed toward the growing of such crops as will bring at least partial relief -to the shortage of bread. It Is reasonable to suppose that it will take them years to bring up their depleted dairy herds to the place they held before the war. In the meantime the people must have milk and butter and cheese, and it will fall to America to supply a large part of these, at least, for yean to come. Then, too, Europe will look to us for breeding stock to replenish her impoverished herds which it will take time to develop Cows can not reach maximum production in less than four or five years: therefore. It seems fairly safe to assume that there will be an unusual demand for dairy products and breeding stock for export for years to come. Home Consumption Increased. It is reasonable to assume also that the home consumption of dairy products will show a marked increase, especially in the form of milk and soft cheeses, since, under general conditions, these are not capable of export, but can be used at home and thus release for export meat and fat which are of more concentrated form and of better keeping qqualit?. Add to this the further fact that we are Just in the beginning of a nation - wide campaign to educate the consumer to the real merit of dalrj products — that milk is not only food for infants, but that it contains nutrients whicb should form a part of the diet of everyone; that butter is not a luxurj simply to make bread taste better, but is one of the cheapest and most desirable sources of energy; that cheese is a valuable muscle builder and one of the best substitutes for meat. Those behind the food conservation movement and those who have made a real study of the food situation do not advise the limiting of the consumption of dairy products. They rather urge a liberal though not wasteful use of milk and soft cheese, especially, in order that less bulky and better keeping foods may go in increased quantity to our allies. The warring countries of Europe are in dire straits for fat (energy foods). Through the press we note the constant appeal of the German leaders for fat, fat and more fat, for the soldiers and civilians alike. The same is true of our own allies .and we must not let them suffer for want of fat so long as we hare abundant supply of coarse, balky feeds that </seg>

Food Values of Dairy Products We are getting away from the idea which formerly was prevalent among dietitians and chemists as well as among people in general, that all fats regardless of their source, yield only heat and energy when con - sumed by the animal or human body Just recently investigators like Dr. Mendel of Yale and Dr. McCollum of John Hopkins have made dis - coveries of vital importance in regard to the value of milk fats. They have found that unlike other fats, butterfat has the ability or power to produce growth after growth had ceased in young animals used in their experiments. In other words milk fat has been found to contain a vital principle necessary for growth and life itself. In the light of their experiments and observations made upon young animals it is reasonable to suppose that as great or greater discrepancies would be found in the growth and general health of young children. Just how much or how little butterfat can be used and still maintain growth has not yet been determined, but enough has been proved to give the dairyman sure footing to his claim that butterfat is a better food than butter substitutes composed of vegetable oils and fats. And the dairy - man's duty becomes the more imperative when he realizes that by in - creasing his herds, he will be able to supply economically the .finest of all fats — the one without which normal growth in children does not take place, and the one which should be available to the weakened soldier and hard working civilian. Milk In this connection it will be of especial interest to compare the food values of dairy products with other well known food products. </seg>

Too many hesitate to buy butter when prices go up thinking of it largely as a luxury instead of a necessary article of food. For instance, but few know that a pound of butter yields almost as much energy as 4 pounds of sirloin steak. Figure 3 shows some, interesting facts in regard to food values of cheese. How many realize that a pound of cheese contains as much muscle building material as 2% pounds of steak, and at a much smaller cost? Ice Cream Figure 4 shows a comparison of ice cream with some food articles found in the dessert class. Most people think of ice cream as a dessert, to be eaten when one has had a full meal of meat and vegetables. As a matter of fact, it has high food value and should be used as a part of a balanced meal instead of being needlessly consumed after a full meal as is so often the case. </seg>

Further - more, cottage cheese may be made into a number of savory dishes in combination with vegetables to make it more agreeable to those who do not like it plain as ordinarily served. Skim Milk Skim milk which is often wasted or used solely as animal feed has a food value of great importance and one to be taken into account when it is necessary to conserve carefully all food supplies. Among Euro - pean peoples skim milk is used as one of the chief sources of muscle building material. Why Increase Production? After having pointed out the food values of dairy products and their relative cheapness when compared with other food articles, which they can in large measure replace and release for export, let us see what musi be done to keep up an ever-increasing supply of these products, in the face of the constantly mounting production costs. Enough data on milk production has been gathered to prove con - clusively that the dairy cow produces human food cheaper than any other animal on the farm; that no other animal can take the roughagu, hay, grasses, corn fodder and corn silage and the by-products from our food factories and mills and in return give so much nourishing human food stuff. For example, it has been shown that one cow, if slaughtered, will provide sufficient meat for two soldiers for one year, while the milk from the same cow will yield equivalent food material for twenty sol - diers for one year. To show further the economy of the dairy cow, it is of interest to know that Katy Gerben, University of Nebraska dairy cow, has in seven consecutive milking periods produced as much digestible, food material as is contained in the carcasses of 47 steers. To this might be added the fact that she has raised seven calves whose value has not been computed. Also the fact should not be overlooked that dairying contributes in large measure to the direct beef output of the nation by the slaughter of superannuated dairy animals and the baby beef not needed for breeding purposes. Statistics tell us that practically all of Denmark's beef supply comes from this source. How large a per cent of our meat supply is furnished in this way, we have no figures to prove, but it is safe to say that it is large enough to count as an im portant factor at the present time. </seg>
            <seg id="p301">285 1'Ktn KKIHMiS NEBRASKA 8TATK BOARD OK AOBK'l'LTl BE "Keep-a-Cow" Movement Food Administrator Hoover is advocating the "keep-a-pig movement" for the suburban population in order to meet the heavy demand for pork. Why not a "keep-a-cow movement" too, for the people of smaller towns and villages and outlying districts where vacant lot space is easily available for growing alfalfa and forage crops which form a large part of a cow's ration. Even the grass and hay going to waste on the road - ways in many places could easily be conserved for feed. Where such waste material can be found, it offers an opportunity for the patriotic citizen to add something to the food supply of the nation. It may help also to teach thrift to boys and girls many of whom are growing up with - out employment or responsibility of any kind. The writer knows of boys who by keeping a few cows have earned the money necessary to put them through high school and college. While milk ordinarily can be produced mora desirably on dairy farms where special attention is given to this as a business, the suggea - tion of keeping a cow wherever feed and labor are available is given as a war measure in the hope of increasing the quantity of food wherever it is possible to do so economically. Hold On to the Good Cowt and Add More. To help supply the demand for dairy products practically every farmer can care for a few more good cows. It has been estimated that at the present time the excess pasture and roughage in Nebraska alone would easily care for 200,000 additional cows. Nebraska with its ordi - narily cheaper forage and grains offers special opportunity for the dairyman engaged in the manufacture of a high priced concentrated ar - ticle, like butter, cheese or condensed milk, which can readily be trans - ported to any part of the world where the best markets prevail, giving him an opportunity to take advantage of the demands and larger profits that are not possible to the man simply engaged in the production of a bulky coarse product, the bulk and freight rates operating to shut off demands of distant markets. Now, more than ever before is the time to weed out the poor dairy cow and replace her with a good cow. Wttn feed high and labor scarce it is very important that evsry cow should be yielding the highest possible returns and that more attention be paid to the selection, feeding and breeding of dairy cattle. For this reason a few fundamental suggestions are given. The most reliable guide in selecting a dairy cow is to determine her actual butter fat record. This can be done by weighing the milk produced by each cow and by determining the per oent of butter fat through frequent tests of the milk by means of the Babcock milk tester. Weigh the Milk. Keep a record of the number of pounds of milk given by each cow. Hang a spring scale in a convenient place where the milk can easily be weighed and mark down the weight of each milking on a chart prepared for the purpose. At the end of each month, </seg>
            <seg id="p302">286 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGHK I'l.TI'KK add up the amount of milk produced to determine the monthly record. The year's record will show the amount of milk produced by each cow. Tett the Milk. Take a sample of each cow's milk about three times each month and test it for butterfat with a Babcock milk tester. A sim - ple and complete outfit can be purchased for $5.00, and is so easily used that a farmer can learn to operate it in a few hours. By carefully testing and weeding out the poor cows, the people of Denmark, in five years, have succeeded in raising the average annual production of each cow more than 40 pounds of butterfat. This has in - creased the profit of each cow over $20 per year. By adopting the same systematic method, Nebraska dairymen can secure as good results. Cow Testing Associations Where a sufficient number of farmers in a community are interested in testing their cows, a cow testing association may be formed and a specially trained man employed to make regular tests of the herd at a small cost per cow. The Dairy Sire In addition to weeding out the poor cows by systematically weigh - ing and testing the milk produced by each cow, an effort should be made to improve the young stock on the farm through pure bred sires, which should be selected from heavy milking cows. Breed up and in - crease the production capacity of your herd. Community Breeding It is highly desirable not only that each dairyman build up a good herd, but that all the dairymen of a community unite on the same breed of cattle. This enables nearby farmers to unite in purchasing high class sires. As soon as a considerable number of farmers have dairy cattle for sale, they can advertise together and secure a much better market than could be done by any single breeder, since they attract more buyers and can furnish cattle in car lots where a buyer so desires. Winter Dairying There are many advantages in having cows freshen in the fall or early winter. In Nebraska, butter is generally one-third higher In win - ter than in summer. Cows which freshen in the early winter and are well cared for during the winter period go on pasture at the time when they would naturally be drying up. and this lengthens the milking period and increases the annual yield of butter. The farmer has more time to milk cows in winter. The climate is more favorable in winter, where good shelter is available. CLASSIFICATION OF DAIRY FEEDS Inasmuch as protein and carbohydrates are the two feed constitu - ents with which the feeder is most concerned, and to aid the dairymen of this state to make proper selection, it may be of value to roughly group some of the most common Nebraska feeds into two classes as follow*: </seg>
            <seg id="p303">287 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE First: Feeds containing a high percentage of protein. Second: Feeds containing a high percentage of carbohydrates. Feeds Rich in Protein Alfalfa hay Clover hay Pea hay Cottonseed meal Oats Gluten meal Soy beans Bran Oil meal Feeds Rich in Carbohydrates Corn Orchard grass Corn silage Barley Oat straw Carrots Oats Sugar beets Timothy hay Mangel wurtzels As the protein feeds are required for the production of muscle, ti» sua and milk, and the carbohydrates for fat and energy, the feeder can easily see that a balanced ration must contain both classes in the right proportion. The feeder should bear in mind that home grown feeds are the cheapest and plans should now be laid to grow as much of it as pos - sible next year. Provide plenty of alfalfa and silage or fodder corn or other forage crops. AMOUNT OF FEED FOR DAIRY COWS The following brief and simple rules will aid in determining the amount of feed required by each cow: First: Feed all the roughage, such as alfalfa, corn silage, etc., the cow will eat up clean. Second: Feed approximately one pound of grain for every three pounds of milk produced per day. Third: Give the cow as much fesd as they will consume without gaining in weight. Fourth: Feed some succulent feed, such as corn silage or roots, to make the ration more palatable. Fifth: Be prepared to supplement the pastures by feeding silage when the dry season sets in. Watch Pastures Watch the pastures closely next year. If they get short, plan to supplement with some Boiling crops or summer silage. For soiling crops plant corn, oats, sorghum, sudan grass or alfalfa. Provide More Silos Silos constitute our best insurance against drouth and also enables mora high priced grain to be released for human food.

Constitution. Well-distended nostrils and good heart girth due to breadth and depth of chest are the beet indications of that quality ol health and vigor commonly referred to as constitution. 2. Food Capacity. Great length from shoulder to hip bones, to - gether with great width and depth of barrel indicates well developed di - gestive organs, which enable the cow to consume and digest large quan - tities of food. 3. Nervous System, or Nervous Temperament. A good dairy cow is active and intelligent. Large, bright eyes, set rather far apart, a broad well dished face, and a spare and angular form are good indications of a nervous temperament. 4. Blood Circulation. A good circulatory system is necessary to carry the digested food from the abdominal region to the udder. The milk veins should be large, tortuous and branching, entering as many large wells as possible. 5. Producing Ability. The digested food is converted into milk only after reaching the udder. A large udder that is soft and pliable, but not flabby when empty and well developed forward and attached rather high behind, and teats of medium size and squarely placed are the best Indi - cations of the cows producing ability. The Department of Dairy Husbandry is always ready to assist far - mers in the selection of good dairy cows. FIVE ESSENTIALS IN DAIRY HERD IMPROVEMENT 1. The sire is more than half the herd. Be sure that the sire head - ing your dairy herd will transmit dairy characteristics. 2. Weed out the unprofitable cows by use of the Babcock test and the scales. 3. Raise and keep all heifer calves from the best cows. 4. Winter dairy as much as possible under your conditions. It given you more milk, better prices and at less cost. 5. Provide comfortable quarters for milch cows. HELP FOR LABOR PROBLEMS There is no denying that the steadily growing list of drafted men is making the labor problem more and more serious. However, the milk machine and other labor saving devices will do much to reduce the amount of man labor required, as well as reduce the drudgery of the work. Men who are now using the milking machine are convinced that it has now been so perfected as to be practicable, when the dairy herd is of such size that time which may be profitably employed otherwise is saved through machine milking and where intelligent care is used in its operation.

Under present emergencies when women and chil - dren may be called upon to do much of man's work, dairying presents a field for service that can hardly be equalled in any other line of agri - culture. It is true that abnormal conditions, the uncertainty of war, the high prices of feeds, the scarcity of good labor, and the fact that many dairy - men are temporarily not getting an adequate price for their product is severely testing their courage as it has not been tested before. Ad - mitting that the present conditions present many problems, the writei, nevertheless, feels that from conferences with food administrators it 1b fairly safe to predict that such price adjustments will soon be made as will give the dairyman more fair returns for his labors.

CONSUMER RESPONSIBLE There should be nothing but contempt for the sensational politician who maliciously or otherwise attempts to misrepresent matters pertain - ing to the milk situation with the hope that he may temporarily curry such favor as may carry him to some much desired public office. Neither can we sympathize too strongly with certain consumers who not having a full knowledge of the food value of milk and milk products, have allowed themselves to become the tool through which housewives have been urged to boycott dairy products. Undoubtedly they do not realize that milk in one form or another is practically a necessity foi the growing child. Without its use he may suffer in a way that can not be overcome in later years. It is also certain that the thoughtful consumer does not sympathize with the boycotting system even though it nvght create a temporary relief, for he realizes by this time that everything that has gone into the production of milk has raised in price in a much more striking way than has been the case with milk itself. The following figures indicate the increase in prices of feed stuffs for the past three and one-half years: Besides these figures, labor in this time has increased at least 30%. Building material has increased approximately 80%. Milk on an aver - age has increased in price for the same period approximately 40%.

Legal prosecution of dairymen or sensational boycotts can ultimate - ly have but one result— that of driving the too frequently overworked dairymen into other fields of agriculture, resulting in a short supply and a still higher price. A full realization of the favorable comparison of dairy products with other food articles together with the definite knowledge of the increased cost of producing dairy products will con - vince the consumer of the justness of the dairyman's demands for such increase in price as will give him reasonable returns for his dairy in - vestment and stimulate him to further production. Looking beyond the economic and financial considerations it must be admitted that no laborer in the field of agriculture is rendering a more patriotic service than the dairyman in adding to the supply of a much needed food product He feels partially repaid for his efforts, I am sure, in the thought that he is doing his share to help win the war and lessen the sufferings of his fellowman. BUTTER MODEL AT THE 1917 8TATE FAIR One of the principal points of interest for the State Pair visitor is the Dairy Building, where each year is exhibited some fine example of the sculptor's art, modeled in Nebraska made butter. This year the butter statuary was a reproduction of the world famous painting, 'THE SPIRIT OF 76," and thousands of visitors greatly admired this splendid work of art. THE DAIRY EXHIBIBT AT THE 1917 STATE FAIR The allied state dairy organizations have been co-operating in secur - ing this exhibit, which again was largely financed by the Nebraska Dairy and Creamery Improvement Association. The University Dairy Department demonstrated the importance of a good dairy sire by exhibiting five heifers that are the progeny of a good sire at the State Farm. This sire has been the cause of these heifers producing eight hundred and forty-three pounds more butter fat than was produced by their dams, and conclusively illustrates the importance of the use of good sires. A bunch of skim milk calves were on exhibition and the necessity of saving and raising all calves from good cows was strongly emphasized. The Babcock Test was demonstrated by well informed men, showini its merits in weeding out the unprofitable cows. Instructions in the can and handling of milk and cream were given In the model farm milk housi which was operated in connection with this exhibit. </seg>
            <seg id="p309">291 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABO Or AGRICULTURE CONSERVATION SURVEY OF NEMAHA COUNTY, NEBRASKA By G. E. Condra. Director of State Conservation and Soil Survey; Introductory. This survey considers the resources of the county and their best development. The soil resources are given major impor - tance. Among the other resources are stone, clay, water, forest, fruit, farm crops and farm animals. Emphasis is placed on geographic influences in the county, that is, on those physical conditions which have affected or shaped the settle - ment and development. The leading environing conditions in this con - nection are topography, drainage, climate and the structure of the land. These conditions and the available resources have largely determined the present industrial progress of the county. They will continue to influence development. The remaining element of importance is the people themselves. Nemaha County is rich in industrial history. Perhaps it is the best in the state to show the close relationship between the physical environ - ment, the natural resources and the people. Position and Area. Nemaha County is in southeastern Nebraska bordered on the east by the Missouri River. The south line is 18 miles from the Kansas line. The bordering counties in Nebraska are Otoe, on the north; Richardson and Pawnee, on the south; and John - son on the west. The eastern boundary is irregular, crossing the Missouri River at places. The county is bordered on the east by Mis- FIGURE 1— MAP SHOWING THE SURFACE FEATURES AND NATURAL DIVISIONS OF NEMAHA COUNTY </seg>

The best known of these is McKissock Island, with an area of about 5&lt;£ square miles, or 3,200 acres. Governor's Island east of Aspinwall is separated from the main land of Nebraska by a strong current of the Missouri. The total area of Nemaha County east of the river and apparently in Mis - souri is about 9.39 square miles or 6,010 acres. The area of Governor's Island is about 1 square mile, making, if included with the others, a total of about 10.39 square miles separated from the main land of the county. The total area of Nemaha County is about 402 square miles, or 257,280 acres. There has been much trouble and litigation in regard to the eastern boundary line of Nemaha County and the ownership of land affected by changes made by the Missouri. These disconnected areas are incon - venient to reach from west of the river. A person at Auburn wanting to travel to McKissock Island would probably go to Nebraska City, across to Iowa, southward to Missouri and then drive westward to the island which is in Nebraska. STRUCTURE Most of Nemaha County is thickly mantled with loess, alluvium and glacial drift. There are relatively few bedrock exposures. The oldest rocks exposed in the area are the Pennsylvanian beds of Carboniferous age. These have been studied and described by this sur - vey and by the State Geological Survey. There are outcrops of the Pennsylvanian beds in the Missouri River bluff land and near Howe, Auburn and Glenrock. The Pennsylvanian beds consist of well denned members of limestone and shale and of poorly defined beds of sandstone and coal. These rocks dip westward in the eastern half of the county, beyond which they rise slowly en the east limb of what is known as the Tablerock anticline. The total thickness of the Pennsylvanian strata exposed in N'emah; County is about 2S0 feet. Named in order irom the oldest up the bed are as follows: 1. McKissock Grove shales, thickness about 100 feet. These shales contain clay, sand, some coal seams, am poorly defined beds and ledges of sandstone and limestone. Outcrops occur in the lower parts of bluffs along the Mis&lt; souri. Much of the shale is dark colored. Other colors an blue, gray and buff. 2. Brownville Limestone, 2 feet or more thick. This member outcrops across the county, but not in cor tinuous ledges. The stone Is quite hard, bluish and massive ii the lower part and slabby to nodular above. 3. Clay shale, with some sand and stone, thickness 18 to 25 feel This is exposed between Honey Creek near Peru, and N&lt; maha. and near Aspinwall and St. Deroin. The basal part </seg>
            <seg id="p311">ruoc KKIIINUS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AOBICULTUKE 293 the shale is dark. The middle zone is calcareous and the upper part bluish. 4. Aspinwall Limestone, thickness 1 to 2 feet This member is exposed at many places along the Missouri between Peru and below St. Deroin. It is massive, light brown mottled, quite soft, and fossiliferous. 5. Shale and thin layers of limestone, 1 to 18 feet. 6. Falls City Limestone, about 4 feet thick and massive It resembles the Aspinwall and has the sound of crockery. The best exposures are at old Aspinwall. 7. Clay shales, 40 to 50 feet. 8. Shales and limestones, 35 feet. These outcrop at Howe and near Auburn. There are three limestones, known as the Elmdale (two divisions) and the Neva. They are each 2 to 3 feet thick and fairly hard. 9. Shale, mostly clay, with thin layers of limestone, 30 to 45 feet. 10. Cottonwood Limestone, 6 feet thick. The bedrock extends under all of the county, but it is generally covered with glacial drift, of which there are two well defined sheets FIGURE 2— VIEW SHOWING LOESS ABOVE AND GLACIAL DRIFT BELOW, THIS REPRESENTS THE DEEP. FERTILE SUB-SOIL </seg>
            <seg id="p312">294 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE or divisions separated by sand and gravel. The drift reaches a thick - ness of 100 feet at places. The lower division, known as the Nebraskan drift sheet, contains much bluish clay and some pebbles and boulders. It is exposed in a few deep ravines and at places in the Missouri River bluffs. Next above the Nebraskan drift is the Aftonian sands which have wide distribution in the uplands of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. They do not outcrop at many places in Nemaha County. The Aftonian supplies some local use sand and part of the well water in the uplands. The topmost division of the drift is the well known Kansan till sheet, which occurs throughout eastern counties of Nebraska and in southwest Iowa, nothwest Missouri and northeastern Kansas. It con - tains clay, (sometimes called hardpan) sand, pebbles and boulders. The color where weathered is yellowish to brownish. This drift sheet ts quite widely exposed in the central and western parts of the county but is covered by the loess near the Missouri River (Figure 2). The well known loess deposit is shown in the bluff and hilly lands along the Missouri where it forms a narrow belt 4 to 8 or more miles wide. The loess is easily distinguished by its buff to yellowish color, very even structure and silty texture. It is composed largely of silt, but contains small quantities of clay and fine sand. Small concretions of lime and sometimes of iron oxide are observed in excavations and exposures of this deposit. Vertical tubes and joints are also features at such places. The loess breaks into vertical columns on the face of bluffs. A loess-like silt deposit caps the terraces or benches in the Little Nemaha Valley. Though this deposit is very similar to the loess along the Missouri, both in structure and texture, it is of later age. The terrace loess lies on alluvial deposits. The valley bottoms of the county are formed of alluvium deposited by streams. The largest areas of alluvial land are along the Little Nemaha, Muddy Creek and the Missouri. Small strips of alluvial land occur in the narrow valleys. The alluvium consists mostly of sand, silt and clay. That of the Little Nemaha and its tributaries usually ranges from clay to fine sand. That along the Missouri averages more sandy, especially in the deeper sections. ALTITUDE AND RELIEF The highest point in the county, about 4 miles southwest of John - son, has an altitude of about 1,320 feet above sea level. The lowest point, along the Missouri in the southeastern corner of the county, is about 880 feet above sea level. Other elevations along the Mis - souri are 908 feet at the north line of the county, and 893 feet at the mouth of the Little Nemaha. Elevations of the towns are as follows: Peru, 902; Drownville, 893; Nemaha, 891; Howe, 987; Bracken, 902; South Auburn, 1,051; Glenrock, 945;; Johnson, 1,220. The general slope of the county is southeastward. The range in elevation In the county is about 440 feet. </seg>
            <seg id="p313">295 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE TOPOGRAPHY The surface features of the county have been formed largely by stream erosion of mantle rock. This story, commonly called physiography, runs about as follows: The strata composing the bedrock were deposited in marine waters from clay, sand, shells and plant re - mains. The sea floor was elevated and eroded, forming a rough land surface. Later this surface was covered with deposits of Cretaceous age. Then erosion removed nearly all of the Cretaceous deposits, of which the Dakota Formation is the best known division. A few remnants of this formation are thought to remain deeply buried in the we«tern part of the area. In comparatively recent times, geologically speaking, the whole of the Nemaha County was glaciated, at least by two well defined advances. This glaciation left a thick veneer of rock debris — the N» - braskan and the Kansan sheets. Subsequent to the glaciation the whole of the county was mantled with loess deposited by sluggish streams. It Is thought that all of southeastern Nebraska was then covered with this loess built up to a nearly smooth plain which sloped southeast - ward, extending beyond the present position of the Missouri. Later this plain was eroded principally by streams. The streams most active in this erosion in Nemaha County were the Missouri and the Little Nemaha and their tributaries. A few remnants of the old loess plain are yet found in the western part of the county. Valleys were eroded entirely through the loess in much of the county and into and through the drift, exposing the bedrock at places. Stream erosion has not continued at the same rate to the present. At one stage, down cutting ceased and the valleys were filled to about sixty feet above the level of the present bottom lands. Remnants of this filling are now shown by the terraces in the Little Nemaha. Com - paratively recent down cutting by streams accompanied by some valley filling has resulted in deepening the valleys and filling their floors to the present levels. The county has the following topographic divisions, namely: Up - lands, terraces and low lands (Figure 1). The uplands are the loess plains, drift hills, loess hills, and the bluff land belt. The terraces are remnants of former high valley floors. The lowlands are the flood plains proper. These land forms are described in the order named. LoeM Plain*. The typical land surface of south-central Nebraska is the loess plain. Several quite large outlying areas of this plain occur in counties farther east, as in Gage, Lancaster and Cass counties. Two small areas occur in the western part of Nemaha County and a third is in the southwestern part in the vicinity of Pleasant View Church (see Figure 1). As has been shown, these outlying plains represent remnants of a former smooth land which occupied much of Nebraska and parts of Iowa, Missouri and Kansas and from which and below which much of the present hilly land was formed. The plains of this county are comparatively smooth, quite high </seg>

They are easily traversed by wagon roads and easily (armed, due to the even topography. Drift Hillt. Erosion has not only removed most of the loess in the west half of the county, but it has formed from the Kansan drift a char - acteristic topography of hills and valleys. The land varies from that which is slightly rolling to that which is quite hilly. Pebbles and boulders show where the land is gullied. The drift hills were so named because of their development on a glacial deposit. In several places, as between Johnson and Glenrock, small areas of rock hills have been formed by erosion through the drift to bed rock. At such places, fairly well defined rock hills are observed. Loess Hillt. The strip of country stretching across much of the east third of the county, except where the bluff land and alluvial land occur, is characterized by a comparatively rough topography with an unusually smooth surface. The belt has been called the loess hills be - cause the loess caps nearly all of the land surface. In places erosion has removed the loess mantle and exposed patches of drift. These patches resemble the hilly land in the west part of the county, but they do not have a very large areal distribution in the loess hill belt. The Bluff Land. The term bluff land, as here used, stands for a belt of country one to three miles wide, facing the Missouri River valley bottom. Typically, the bluffs proper are only the steep faces of the valley side. The belt grades imperceptibly into the hilly land (Fig. 3). The appearance of the bluffs varies greatly at different elevations on the slopes, because of the materials in them and on account of the stage of development observed. The materials in the bluffs, named from above downward, are loess, drift and the shales, sandstones and limestones of the bed rock. The river cutting against the valley side removes much of the talus or slide materials and undermines the slopes. It exposes the structure materials forming the different types of surface. The shales and drift deposits thus exposed form gradual slopes. Rock cliffs (Fig. 4) are developed over limestones and sandstones. Indian Cave near the southeastern part of the county is one of the best examples of rough land dveloped on a sandstone. The slopes are eroded with the steep profiles, first by the removal of talus and later by bank cutting proper. Connected with this process is more or less slipping or sliding especially of the loess and drift. This forms the bare faces or bluffs proper. Points of land or spurs become truncated by river cutting, leaving ridge-like land forms between the ra - vines. As soon as active river erosion and sliding cease at a point, talus and colluvial materials build up more gradual slopes which become covered with vegetation. All stages in the formation and decay of the bluff land forms may be observed along the Missouri in Nemaha County. As has been shown the bluff land belt of the county includes several topographic forms with complicated physiographic history. The forms </seg>

The wind has been a factor in the formation of the bluff belt topog - raphy. Silt blown from the bars of the river find lodgement on the bluff land belt, and some of this material becomes incorporated with the mantle rock. It is evident also that vegetation is a factor in hold- </seg>
            <seg id="p317">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 299 ing this wind-blown material, and the other parts of the subsoil against the destructive work of erosion. It is a question, however, whether the wind blown deposit exceeds what is lost by water erosion. It seems that the amount of loess added to the bluff belt by wind action has been over-estimated. Terrace or Bench Lands. Seven small terrace areas occur in the county. The first is near Brock; the second, on the north side of the valley north of Glenrock; the third, south of the Junction of the Missouri Pacific between Glenrock and Auburn; the fourth, southeast of Auburn; the fifth, at the Prairie View School about five miles east of Auburn; the sixth, two miles northwest of Nemaha, and the seventh at Nemaha. The surfaces of these terraces are smooth to rounded and from 20 to 60 feet above the first bottom of the valley. They afford good road locations and good building places. Flood Plain*. These are the lowest lands in the valleys. They are so named because of their formation by stream overflows and deposition. As a rule the flood plains are comparatively smooth, but modified by cutoffs, alluvial fans and colluvial slopes. The alluvial fans (Fig. 5) though small are noticeable features at the mouths of ravines below the bluff land belt. They simply represent the small stream deposits made on a flood plain, where the velocity Is checked because of the change in grade of the tributaries. Several al - luvial fans united form a colluvial slope. The edges of flood plains built up of wash from slope land is called colluvial land or colluvial slope. Such forms are quite common in Nemaha Comity. DRAINAGE The three principal streams of the county are the Missouri, the Little Nemaha and branches cf the Big Nemaha. The Missouri River flows a little east of south along the eastern border of the county and drains a narrow area of about 70 square miles. The Little Nemaha enters the county in the northwestern part, flows in a southeasterly direction and joins the Missouri River below the town of Nemaha. Numerous tributaries join this river from the uplands. The Little Ne - maha originally had a very crooked course and was subject to frequent floods. It has been straightened by deep ditches throughout its course in the county (Fig. 6). This stream drains about 219 square miles of the county. The branches of the Big Nemaha, Muddy Creek and Long Branch drain about 1230 square miles in the southwestern corner of the county. Though it does not often overflow, the Missouri has a tendency to shift its channel, thus affecting the drainage of the county and interfering with its agricultural practice (Figs. 7 and 8). The most marked changes in the position of this river have been at St. Deroln, Nemaha, ana above Peru. Some of the bottom land along the Missouri is poorly drained. Most of the county is well drained. </seg>

CLIMATE The principal elements of climate are rainfall, humidity, temperature, winds, sunshine and seasons. These are briefly reviewed. Rainfall. The mean annual precipitation, according to records of the U. S. Weather Bureau Station at Auburn and compiled to date is 34.33 inches. The precipitation is heaviest in May, June and July, and lightest during winter months. The rainfall of May and June is well distributed. Drouths are infrequent, yet they may occur in late summer and early fall. As a rule the rainfall is adequate for crop needs. Humidity. The relative humidity is comparatively uniform. The average annual humidity is about 70%. Temperature. The mean annual temperature is about 51.7 degrees P. January and February are the coldest months with a mean temperature of about 25.3 degrees. July is the warmest with a mean temperature of 76.2 degrees. This gives a range in temperature between the means of the warmest and coldest months of about 50 degrees.

The average length of the growing season is 159 days. The normal seasons are long enough to insure the production of such crops as corn, wheat, oats and hay. Wind*. There are no very conclusive records concerning wind velocity. From April 1st to October 1st the prevailing winds are from the south and from October 1st to April 1st from the northwest. Strong winds are common, though tornadoes are rare. Sunshine. The records show an average of about 175 to 185 clear days and 80 to 86 cloudy days during the year. The remaining days of the year are classed as partly cloudy. Seasons. The winter, spring, summer and fall seasons are quite well marked in the county. The winters are cold with only light snow falls; the springs are variable and usually moist; summers are warm to hot, and the falls are regarded by many as the most pleasant part of the year. </seg>

Small deposits of sand are worked for local use. Prospecting for coal and oil has caused more or less excitement. Limestone. There are seven distinct thin limestones in this county. They are known as the Brownville, Aspinwall, Falls City, Elmdale (of which there are two ledges), the Neva and the Cotton wood. The Brown - ville, though it has a fair quality of stone, does not occur favorably for quarrying. The Aspinwall and the Falls City outcrop generally In the vicinity of Aspinwall. These members are similar. They are exposed at many places high on the bluffs between St. Deroin and above Brown - ville. The stone is massive, soft, brownish mottled and easily worked. The Elmdale and Neva limestones occur at Howe, near Bracken Station and in the vicinity of Auburn. They also outcrop in slopes below the Cottonwood in the vicinity of Glenrock. These stones are suitable for use in concrete, but are heavily bedded with shales and usually covered with thick overburden. The Cottonwood is the leading atone in the county (Fig. 9). It occurs high in the uplands near Johnson and Glenrock. This stone la </seg>

Formerly the Cottonwood was quarried for ship - ment as between Johnson and Rohrs and near Glenrock. Most produc - tion at these places has been abandoned. It is evident that the stone resources of the county will not insure working on a large scale in competition with the more available ma - terials that can be secured elsewhere. Clay. This occurs in the shale divisions of the Pennsylvanian beds, and in the drift, loess and the alluvial deposits, Pennsylvanian clay shales outcrop at or near Glenrock, Auburn and Howe, at many places in the Missouri River bluff land. The divisions of this clay and shale have been enumerated in connection with the discussion on structure. Some of the Pennsylvanian clay shales are suitable for use in brick and tile manufacture. They might be mixed with the drift, loess or alluvium, in the manufacture of brick. Such clays are used in large plants of other counties to improve brick made principally of loess or of alluvium. It seems that some of the shale and limestone exposures of the county could be worked by a plan in which both limestone and clay are produced, the first probably for riprap, crushed stone and fertilizer, and the second for brick making. A brick plant is operated at Auburn. If it becomes necessary, the clay resources can be further developed. The absence of fuel and big markets are drawbacks. Coal. The McKissock Grove shales contain several seams of car - bonaceous shale and impure coal. These seams run from a few inches to a foot or more in thickness. A local bed on Honey Creek is thicker. </seg>
            <seg id="p322">304 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Many people have thought that the coal should become thicker and workable back in the upland. They made the attempt to reach work - able beds by drifting or working into slopes as in the vicinity of Brown - ville. Such prospecting has not revealed valuable beds of coal. It is .now fairly well determined that no valuable coal beds occur in the county. None of the bluff land outcrops can be worked profitably and the same adverse report seems to hold in regard to thin beds, which are known to occur below the outcropping formations. The county must continue to ship in its coal supply if this remains the chief fuel and source of power. Oil and Ga*. Do oil and gas occur in Nemaha county? Very little prospecting for these fuels has been done. The shallow wells show no favorable indications. The structure of the county is unfavorable. Much of the area is in a structure basin and not on an anticline, such as would be attractive to oil geologists. The chance for the discovery of oil and gas in Ne - maha county is not promising. WATER RESOURCES The water recource of most value is the ground water. Streams have less importance. Ground Water. This occurs in mantle rock and bed rock and differs much in quality in the various formations from which it is derived. Good water, somewhat hard, occurs in the drift deposits and in some places at the base of the loess. It supplies most of the upland wells. The water secured from Kansan drift is largely in sand pockets or bodies. Wells reaching this supply vary much in depth and strength. The Aftonian sand, lying between the Kansan and Nebraskan drift sheets gives strong wells. Unfortunately, the sand does not occur in all of the upland. In parts of the county where bed rock is exposed and the rock and shale hill conditions maintain, the well water supply is uncertain. In some locations no shallow water can be secured. In other places the supply, usually small, comes from the limestones or from sandy shale. Much of the well water of the county is derived from alluvial ground. On a few farms it is not possible to obtain a water supply from the upland proper. At such places, the wells are located on narrow strips of alluvium in the small valleys. The bottom land water is shallow am of fair quality. It is derived mostly from sand, and in some cases fron gravel. Considerable prospecting has been done to locate wells stronj enough to deliver adequate water supplies at Auburn and Peru. The upland wells of the county range from 35 to 120 feet in deptl They are weak to strong and supply an average good quality of watei The alluvial wells are shallow as a rule, ranging between 10 and 60 fee Some are strong. </seg>
            <seg id="p323">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICULTUmE 305 It is thought that all of the county is underlain with artesian water in the formations of Pennsylvanian and older age. Though this water has pressure in the beds below, the force would not be sufficient to bring it to the surface in all parts of the county. Most of this water contains too much mineral matter for drinking purposes. It contains each compounds as salt, calcium carbonate and magnesium sulphate. Location and Care of Wells. It is evident that too little thought has been given to the location and care of wells in tnts county. As a. rule, the farmers do not realize that surface water, supplied by rainfalls, becomes ground water, and that by moving over and through polluted ground it becomes unfit for use. It is not uncommon to see a shallow well immediately below a farm lot or below a privy vault. In such position a well is a positive danger. If the movement of ground water is from the danger spots to the well, as it may be, the persons using these wells drink more than water. A careful study of all wells in the county for the purpose of guard - ing against unsanitary conditions would have great value in the con - servation of human health. A survey of this kind is very simple. It considers the source of ground water, the direction of underflow and depths. The purpose in well locations should be to get above the sources of pollution. Many wells are dug and cased with wood, brick or stone. Some are bored or driven. Some of the wells are open, receiving blown sediment and the surface wash from surrounding ground. They should be covered and graded up to prevent surface pollution. Springs. The ground water comes to the surface at a number of places, especially in the bluff land belt, as seepage and as springs. Some of this spring water could be further developed by opening up the seepage ground and by guarding against the pollution of the catch - ment areas above the springs. As it is, the springs have relatively little importance compared with the well water supply. A few springs along the Missouri could be piped to farm houses. Stream Water. The streams of this county have some use as a source of stock -water and in some cases for drinking purposes. Formerly the Missouri was used for navigation. The Little Nemaha has been used for power. Water Power. Water powers have been operated in the Little Ne - maha and Muddy Creek. They were hampered by floods and low water. The developments were small. This combination of unfavorable conditions, and competition with comparatively cheap power from steam and gas engines has caused the water power developments to cease in the county. To date no method has been devised whereby powers can be de - veloped economically from the Missouri River as it occurs in Nemaha County. </seg>
            <seg id="p324">306 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF AGBICT7LTTJRE FOREST RESOURCES The explorers, fur traders and early settlers found forests on part of the bottom land and on some of the rough bluff land of Nemaha County. TreeB were in protected places and near water. The forest has expanded since that time. The natural advance of the forest and tree planting prove that forests can now be grown in practically every part ol the county. The trees of the native forest are those which typically belong to a temperate climate. They are such as the oaks, elms, maple, hickory, black walnut, bitter hickory, box elder, ash, linden, willows and cotton - woods. There are many kinds of shrubs. The sycamore is represented by a few trees, though it grows best farther south. The pawpaw on McKissock Island, and at a few places west of the river is only the northern representative of a sub-tropical to tropical plant. The native forest has been used for fuel, posts, poles, bridge timber and lumber. Wild fruits, such as plums, grapes and gooseberries occur in and near the forest areas. Hazel nuts, hickory nuts and black walnuts are found at places. Few patches of hazel brush remain. Though posts have been cut from several species of trees, the burr - oak is most important. Lumber has been sawed principally from cotton - wood and to some extent from black walnut. The walnut timber now standing has considerable value. Though the walnut has a slow growth, it might be profitably cultivated on certain kinds of soil. The forest has yielded considerable fire woog. The chief sources of supply were from the bluff land and from alone the streams. Elm, red oak, linden, box elder, green ash and cottonwood were most used for this purpose. At one time the county could boast of its good axmen, but now few people are skilled in felling trees and in post making, rail splitting and the cutting of fire wood. This condition, the encroachment of agriculture and the shipping in of fuel has greatly re - duced the relative importance of fire wood in the county. Though the forested area of Nemaha County is now as large or larger than formerly, the economic use of the forest has become a problem. Some of the b'.uff land is better suited for tree growing than for any other purpose, yet no definite system has been evolved for forest management. Planted Grove*. Tree planting began with the early settlement of the county. CJroves were started about the farm buildings and trees were set out along land lines. Cottonwoods, box elder, green ash, elms and a few conifers were the main trees planted. Experience has shown that the white elm and the black walnut have done better than had been expected. During the past few years many of the line trees have been cut down, because they sap the moisture of fields. These trees and some of those in the groves have been used for lumber. The groves serve as wind breaks, for shade, and to beautify the farm steads. . Robert W. Furnas and J. Sterling Morton did much to promote tree planting in Nemaha County and in Nebraska generally. </seg>
            <seg id="p325">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 307 SOIL RESOURCES The soils of Nemaha County (Fig. 10) are in three distinct divi - sions — upland soils, derived from glacial and loessial material; terrace soils, derived from fluvial silts; and first-bottom soils, derived from re - cent stream deposits. The upland group embraces the Marshall silt loam, Grundy silt loam, Knox silt loam. Carrington silt loam, and Car - rington loam; the terrace soils are classed as the Waukesha silt loam; and the first bottoms comprise the Wabash and Sarpy series and River - wash. Most soils of the upland and terraces are silty and the same is true of the first-bottom types, except along the Missouri River, where clay and very fine sandy loam are important. With the exception of the Knox and the recently deposited soils along the Missouri River, the soils of the county ara dark in color and rather high in organic matter. The upland was originally covered with a very thick mantle of loess. But through erosion much of this deposit has been worn away and only a few remnants of the original constructional surface remain. The most typical remnants of the loess subsoil are in the western part of the county. The soil here is mapped as the Grundy silt loam. In areas where erosion has removed a large part of the original loess mantle, producing a rolling hilly topography, but retaining a loess cap, the soils weathered from it are classed as the Marshall silt loam. Where the surface soil is more eroded, being thinner and with less humus, it is classed as Knox silt loam. Westward from the bluff land belt the loess generally becomes heavier in texture and more compact. A weathered phase of the Kansan drift, gives rise to the Carrington silt loam. The loess and the weathered phase of the Kansan drift are quite similar in character, but the latter contains more clay and some sand and pebbles, and shows a less pronounced vertical structure. There is no clear cut boundary between the loess and the weathered drift, but they grade imperceptibly into each other. As a result the boundary line between the Carrington and Marshall silt loams is largely arbitrary. Where pebbles are encountered the material is mapped as the Carring - ton silt loam, and where these are absent as the Marshall silt loam. Below the weathered phase of the Kansan drift lies the Kansan drift proper. There is a sharp line of separation in color and texture between the weathered phase of the Kansan drift and the Kansan drift proper. The upper part of the Kansan drift is thoroughly oxidized, showing that it has been subjected to weathering. The weathered phase has been altered so much that it has lost its drift characteristics and assumed the appearance of the loess. The Kansan sheet is till and consists of a heterogeneous mixture of clay, silt, sand, cobblestones, and boulders. The upper oxidized zone varies in color from yellowish brown or brown to reddish brown. Below this the drift sheet has a light gray or pale yellow color, with numerous iron stains, and is highly calcareous. Where the drift sheet has been subjected to excessive erosion it has given rise to the Shelby loam. The Aftonian material* He below the Kansan drift, and consists </seg>

The Aftonian outcrops along the Missouri River, but does not form a continuous bed throughout the county. It does not give rise to a soil type but has contributed some material to areas of a sandy phase of the Shelby loam too small to be shown satisfactorily on the soil map. The lowest drift sheet, the Nebraskan, is not much exposed. Hence, it has no importance in soil formation. The Pennsylvanian beds of Carboniferous age form small areas of rough stony land and shale land. The terraces of Xemaha County are entirely confined to the Little Nemaha Valley and consist of two systems. The second or higher ter - race is about 60 feet above the flood plain. The first, or lower terrace level Is of more recent origin. The terraces or benches are capped by loess-like silts, which give rise to the Waukesha silt loam. The alluvial deposits are rather extensive in Nemaha County. The largest areas occur along the Little Nemaha and Missouri rivers. The Missouri River alluvium consists largely of alternating layers of ver&gt; fine sand, silt and clay. Along the Little Nemaha River and the small streams the alluvium consists principally of silt, with a slight admixture of clay, owing to the prevailingly fine texture of the mantle rock from which the material is washed. The alluvial deposits along the smaller streams are shallow, compared with those of the Missouri River. The light-colored alluvial soils underlain by a lighter texture subsoil are classed with the Sarpy series, and the black-colored soils with a heavy or heavier subsoils with the Wabash series. The recently de - posited material occurring as sand bars is termed Riverwash. </seg>
            <seg id="p327">PROCEEDINGS NEBBASKA STATE BOABO OF AQBICULTC«E 309 The following table gives the names and the actual and relative extent of the various soils mapped in Nemaha County: Marshall Silt Loam. The Marshall silt loam is a prevailingly dark brown silt loam soil, 10 to 18 inches deep, carrying a high percentage of silt. It has a velvety feel and is very friable and high in organic matter. The soil is underlain by a yellowish brown, somewhat heavier, and more compact silt loam, the color becoming lighter with increasing depth. At a depth of 24 to 36 inches light gray mottlings and reddish iron stains are encountered, though not infrequently the solid yellowish brown color extends beyond 3 feet. The transitional layer between the soil and subsoil is usually brown and varies in thickness from 2 to 4 inches. The subsoil is open and friable and has a columnar structure. The lower part of the soil section and the deep subsoil are highly calcareous. The depth of the soil is variable, depending upon its topographic position. In the smoother areas it is usually 15 to 18 inches, while on the sharp divides, steep slopes, shoulders of hills, and along gullies it is only 6 to 8 inches, and the yellowish brown subsoil is frequently exposed. Areas where the subsoil is exposed are classed with the Knox silt loam, whera large enough to indicate on the map. On the lower slopes the soil is deeper and darker in color, and at the foot of the slopes it commonly extends to a depth of 20 to 40 inches. The soil is deeper also in forested areas. The color of the subsoil varies from yellowish brown, yellow, or pale yellow to yellowish gray. The shallow areas of this type are largely developed in the bluff zone of the county. In general the soil is lighter in color and more friable and open along the Missouri bluffs than away * Sop the Soil Survey of NVmalia County. 1918. The field work on this area was done by A. H.

Along intermittent streams this type includes small, narrow strips of colluvial material which are too small to be shown separately on the soil map. Southwest of Howe are a few areas having a gently undulating topography in which the soil is deeper than where typically developed, being 15 to 24 inches deep, while the subsoil is a heavy silt loam to silty clay loam. In some borings a hardpan layer was encountered. In small local areas the soil is a dark brown heavy silt loam to a depth of 15 inches, where a black, tough, moderately crumbly silty clay loam is encountered. At 24 to 36 inches the texture again becomes lighter and the color changes to brown. The Marshall silt loam is the second most extensive upland soil in the county, covering 96.2 square miles. It occupies two large areas in the eastern part of the county, small areas in the bluff zone southwest of Howe, and a small area in section one northwest of Johnson. In the bluff zone the type is associated with the Knox silt loam. It gives way to the Carrlngton silt loam on the west. The topography varies from sli htly undulating to steeply rolling. In the western part of the county it is gently rolling, the steeper slopes being occupied by the Oarrtngton silt loam. The areas southwest of Howe and the area northwest of Johnson occupy slightly sloping and comparatively broad divides. The type is well drained. Erosion, which is a serious factor on the steep slopes, is effectively checked by deep plowing and by keeping the land In cover crops as much as possible. Where the slopes are very steep the type is best utilized for grazing or hay land. The type origi - nally was covered with a thick growth of native grasses, but only a few scattered patches remain. The bluff zone was forested. Practically all the type, except the steep slopes in the eastern part of the upland region, is under cultivation Corn Is the principal crop, and about one-half the improved land is devoted to It, the remainder being largely used for wheat, oats and alfalfa. Corn ordinarily yields from 30 to 45 bushe.s per acre. In some cases yields of 70 bushels per acre are obtained in favorable seasons. Wheat ranks second In acreage and is being more extensively grown each year. In dry years it is pre - ferred to corn, because it matures before the season of dry weather and hot winds. In normal seasons wheat yields from 20 to 30 bushels per acre. The area in oats is almost equal to that in wheat. Oats do well, yielding from 40 to 45 bushels per acre. The acreage of clover and timothy and of alfalfa is small. In favorable years clover yields from 1*4 to 2 tons of hay per acre. Owing to the high lime content and thorough drainage of this soil, alfalfa does very well, yields of 3 to 5 tons per acre being obtained from 3 or 4 cuttings. Some kafir is grown. A number of farmers grow small patches of millet, the yields ranging from 2 to 4 tons per acre. On an average about one-half acre of potatoes la frown on each farm for home use, with yields of 100 to 150 bushels </seg>
            <seg id="p329">311 PROCEEDINGS NEBBASKA STATE BOABD Of AGBKULTUKE per acre. There are a few patches of sorghum on the type. In the bluff zone where the slopes are steep and the type is not well adapted to grain farming commercial orchards and small fruits are receiving increasing attention. All orchard fruits and small fruits do well. Grapes, however, do better on the Knox silt loam than on this type. Owing to its silty, friable and stone-free character, this soil is easy to handle. It does not bake or clod unless worked when very wet. Where properly cultivated it has a high water-holding capacity. The 4-horse hitch is used in practically all farm operations. The value of the Marshall ailt loam ranges from $125.00 to $215.00 an acre, depending on improvements and location. Grundy Silt Loam. The Qrundy silt loam is a dark brown to almost black, moderately heavy silt loam soil, 18 to 24 inches deep, with an average depth of 20 inches. It is high in organic matter and works up into a very mellow condition. The subsoil is a brownish silty clay loam, which passes abruptly into a grayish yellow silty clay loam. At 24 to 30 inches the subsoil color changes to light gray, mottled with reddish iron stains. The subsoil has a decidedly granular structure and is compact, though not noticeably plastic. A lighter textured and better drained variation of this type is de - veloped in the extreme northwestern corner of the county. The soil, to a depth of 12 to 15 inches, is a dark brown smooth silt loam. It is very friable and apparently carries a high percentage of very fine sand. The subsoil is a brownish yellow, heavy silt loam to silty clay loam. The Grundy silt loam covers only 3% square miles in this county. The largest area is about 3 miles southwest of Johnson and another area is in the extreme northwestern part of the county. The type occupies high divides, undoubtedly representing the original construc - tional surface, and is almost fiat to slightly undulating. There are only a few streams, and those which cut back into the type occupy mere sags, although the drainage is adequate. The type supports the same native growth and is used for the same crops as the Marshall silt loam. Corn yields 30 to 50 bushels and alfalfa 3 to 6 tons per acre. Owing to the flat topography, farm operations are more easily performed than on the Marshall silt loam. The value of land of the Grundy silt loam ranges from $125.00 to $200.00 per acre. Knox Silt Loam. The Knox silt loam is an eroded phase of the Marshall silt loam, more broken and dissected than the latter type. It consists of a yellowish brown to light brown silt loam, 4 to 6 inches deep and underlain by a brownish yellow silt loam. Both soil and sub - soil are friable, open, and columnar in structure. There is no apparent change in texture or structure within the 3-foot section. Not infre - quently the subsoil is yellowish gray or yellow mottled with light gray. Reddish iron stains are common, and become more pronounced below the 3-foot section. The soil has less organic matter, and is stickier than the Marshall silt loam.' The subsoil is highly calcareous, the lime </seg>
            <seg id="p330">312 l'KCMEEDl.NGS NEBRASKA STATE UOAK1) OF AtiUlCULTl KK occurring as concretions and to some extent as cementing material. Where erosion has been active the light gray subsoil, with its lime con - cretions, is exposed and ha. given rise to a whitish surface soil. In forested areas leaf mold has imparted a dark color to the immediate surface soil and on many lower slopes dark soil has accumulated to a considerable depth, largely as wash from the original dark soil of the higher slopes. The Knox silt loam has a small total area in this county, and mainly occupies steep to precipitous slopes and sharp divides on the Missouri River bluffs with a few outlying areas in the Marshall silt loam type. The valleys on this soil type are deep and V-shaped, and in many places the slopes have the step-like configuration characteristic of the Missouri River loess. In others the topography is indicative of the soft, massive rock. The roughest areas occur in the southeastern part of the county. In the outlying areas the slopes are less steep. The soil is thoroughly drained and. owing to its low organic matter content, does not retain moisture as well as the Marshall silt loam. The type is subject to erosion and great care is necessary in its cultivation. With the exception of the outlying areas, this type originally was forested. The principal growth on the upper slopes was scrub oak, sumac and hazel brush, and on the lower slopes and draws oak, elm, linden, hackberry, box elder, ash, bitter hickory ironwood, Kentucky coffee tree and black walnut. A large part of the type still supports a forest growth, though such land is slowly being cleared and devoted to fruit production. About 35 per cent of the Knox silt loam is under cultivation, being used mainly for corn, oats, alfalfa and fruits. Where the slopes are not too steep corn, oats and alfalfa, with a small quantity of wheat, are the principal farm crops. Unless the soil is heavily manured, the grain yields are low. Ordinarily corn yields from 15 to 25 bushels an acre, oats 20 bushels, and wheat 15 to 20 bushels. Where alfalfa is started with a liberal application of manure it does well on this type. Three cuttings usually are obtained, with a total production of 3 to 4 tons per acre. In spots where the soil is dark the crop makes a rank growth. The acreage of alfalfa is being rapidly extended on this type, as on the steep slopes of the Marshall silt loam. Many farmers have as much as 100 acres in this crop. A large percentage of the alfalfa is sold. Dairying is better developed on this type than on the other soils of the county. In the vicinity of Peru and Brownville a considerable area is devoted to orcharding and the growing of small fruits. Apples and pears are grown on a commercial scale. Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, gooseberries, and currants are profitable crops. Small vegetables, water - melons, muskmelons, and potatoes do well. On the upper slopes and higher situations grapes do very well, and their acreage is being gradually extended. The general tendency near the towns is to put this type, as well as the steep slopes of the Marshall silt loam, into orchards and small fruits </seg>
            <seg id="p331">313 PRO( KEU1N08 NKHKASKA STATK BI1AR11 OF ACKK rl.TTRE and to use areas farther away for alfalfa. On most farms the lanu is kept in corn 2 years, in oats 1 year, and in alfalfa 5 years or more. The steepest slopes and bluffs are kept in permanent pasture. Owing to its silty texture and open structure, this soil can be culti - vated with ease and under a wide range of moisture conditions. Barn - yard manure is liberally applied, though the practice of turning under green crops is not common. Very little commercial fertilizer is used. Crops respond readily to barnyard manure. General farming land ranges in price from $50.00 to $90.00 an acre, depending on the topography and the distance from markets. Areas in orchards or small fruit are valued at $200.00 or more an acre. Carrington Silt Loam. The Carrington silt loam is a dark brown, heavy silt loam drift soil, 8 to 15 inches deep, with an average dapth of 12 inches It is underlain by a thin transitional layer of brown silty clay loam, which passes into a yellowish brown silty clay loam. With depth the material becomes lighter in color. Below 24 to 30 inches light gray mottlings and rusty brown iron stains frequently are encountered. The soil is friable and, as the color indicates, high in organic matter. The subsoil is granular and compact, and only slightly plastic. There is no abrupt change in color or texture from soil to subsoil. The soil does not stand up in vertical banks like the loess soils. Lime con - cretions occur in the substratum, but rarely in the subsoil. On the smooth divides the soil is deeper and the transitional layer between the soil and subsoil thicker than usual, while on the shoulders of hills and along gullies the soil is a brown, heavy silt loam, 4 to 6 inches deep. At the foot of the slopes where a large quantity of material washed from the higher lying land has been deposited, the soil is a dark brown to black, heavy silt loam varying in depth from 20 to 40 inches. Within areas of the type along intermittent streams are small strips of colluvial material. Where the Kansan drift proper is near the surface a shallow vari - ation of this type is usually developed on the lower slopes. The soil is a dark brown, very heavy silt loam to silty clay loam, 12 to 15 inches deep, underlain by a reddish brown to reddish yellow silty clay loam, which immediately passes into a compact, rather tough silty clay. The subsoil becomes lighter in color, though heavier in texture, and looser with depth. In the lower part gritty material frequently is encountered. At places in the Carrington silt loam area, as near Auburn, the bedrock outcrops and produces another variation of the type. Such areas are very rough and stony and would be mapped as rough stony land if of sufficient size to warrant their separation. Owing to the similarity of the soil profile of the Carrington Bllt loam to that of the Marshall silt loam, the boundary line between these types is necessarily largely arbitrary. They are Identical in color and depth of the soil and in the color of the subsoil. They differ in that the soil and subsoil of the Carrington silt loam are slightly heavier In texture and do not stand up so well in vertical banks. Typically the </seg>
            <seg id="p332">314 rKOCKEDINOS NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AOBIC'L'LTUBE Marshall silt loam breaks down to a fine powder, while the Carrington silt loam has a granular structure. Another difference is that the Car - rington silt loam has a small content of sand and pebbles and occa - sionally boulders. Where these types merge the soil boundary is based on the stone content. The Carrington silt loam is the most extensive soil in Nemaha coun - ty, covering 42.3 per cent of the total area. It occurs almost entirely as a single large area in the western part of the county. Small areas occur east and southeast of Howe and in the northeastern part of the county. Along the major drainage ways this soil is associated with the Carrington loam. It has a rolling to steeply rolling topography. In the vicinity of Auburn and in the northern and northeastern part of the county the slopes are steepest. In section 1 and extending into section 2, T. 6 N., R. 12 E., and in sections 16 and 17, extending a short distance into section 8, T. 5 N .. R. 14 E., the topography is undulating to gently undulating and undoubtedly represents a slightly eroded high terrace. On the main di - vides the surface is rather gently sloping, but along the major stream courses the slopes are steep. This type is well drained. On the steeper slopes erosion is active and numerous gullies are formed. Owing to its high clay content and itb high percentage of organic matter, the soil is very retentive of moisture. Originally the upland was covered with a thick growth of prairie grasses, and the lower slopes along the large drainage ways were forested. Approximately 90 per cent of the Carrington silt loam is under cul - tivation, most of the remainder being in permanent pasture. Corn, the principal crop grown, yields from 30 to 40 bushels and in favorable sea - sons as much as 60 bushels per acre. Wheat ranks second in acreage. It does well, and in dry years is the most certain crop. In normal seasons it yields about 25 bushels per acre. Oats do well, but are not nearly b^ profitable as wheat. The ordinary yields range from 30 to 40 bushels per acre. Alfalfa is receiving increasing attention and promises to be - come the leading hay crop on this type. Ordinarily three cuttings a season are obtained, with a total yield of 4 to 5 tons per acre. In favoi - able seasons clover and timothy do well yielding from 1% to 2 tons of hay per acre. A small area is in wild grasses, which prodnce from one - half to one ton of hay per acre. Some kafir and millet are grown for forage. Kafir yields from 4 to 6 tons of fodder per acre and millet 2 to 3 tons of hay. Potatoes do well, but are grown only for home use. Owing to its high clay content, the Carrington silt loam is more difficult to handle than the Marshall silt loam and cannot be cultivated under as wide range of moisture conditions. When plowed too wet it bakes and forms clods, which are rather difficult to reduce, although the soil never becomes very lumpy. Small checks and cracks form in this type, but these are not of sufficient extent to cause any serious loss of moisture by evaporation. Small quantities of manure are applied every eight or ten years, generally on the poorer spots. Where barn yard m* </seg>

The value of farm land cf the Carrington silt loam ranges from $125 to $200 an acre, depending on improvements, topography and location. Carrington Loam. The Carrington loam also called Shelby, is a dark-brown to brown loam to silty loam drift soil, 6 to 15 inches deep, carrying a rather high percentage of silt. It is underlain by a brownisb, tenacious gritty clay loam to clay, the color changing at 20 to 24 inches into yellow, mottled with light gray. Reddish iron stains and streaks of limy material are common in the lower subsoil. As a rule the sub - soil becomes heavier and more compact and plastic with depth and gravel is encountered in increasing quantities, being sufficiently abundant In places to interfere with boring in soil testing. Gravel and some boulders are encountered in the surface soil though generally not in quantities sufficient to prevent cultivation. In the marginal areas adjoining the Carrington silt loam and in areas where considerable silt washed from the higher lying silt loam types has been deposited, the dark-brown silt loam soil is underlain at 8 to 10 inches by a brown heavy loam to clay loam. At 20 to 24 inches a yel - lowish-brown gritty clay loam which becomes more compact and tougher with depth, is encountered. The subsoil of the Carrington loam frequent - ly has a decidedly reddish shade not a color due to oxidation, but one of material. In places areas of sandy soil not large enough to indicate as a sepa - rate phase are developed. The soil of such areas is a brown fine sandy loam, 6 to 10 inches deep, underlain by an orange colored or rusty-brown, friable sandy clay. The large percentage of sand in the soil is undoubted - ly due to exposed Aftonian material. A shallow variation of this type is encountered in section 31, T. 6 N., R. 13 E., sections 23, 24, 25 and 26, T. 5 N., R. 13 E., and sections 10, 11. 14 and 22, T. 5 N., R. 14 E. The bedrock in this variation is very close to the surface. The slopes on which these areas occur are too steep and stony for cultivation, and they are utilized for permanent pasture. The Carrington loam differs from the Carrington silt loam in having a rather high stone content within the 3-foot section, the Carrington silt loam being practically stone free. '1 he type occurs as small areas throughout the Carrington silt loam, chiefly in the southwestern pan of the county. It is usually developed along the steep slopes between the Carrington silt loam on the higher land and the Wabash silt loam on the bottom land. Drainage is thorough, except in places where the type receives considerable seepage water. The type is subject to destructive erosion, gullies 10 to 15 feet deep, with branching laterals, being com - mon. Owing to the large proportion of clay in the subsoil, the type retains moisture well, though it is somewhat less retentive of motstm-e than is the Carrington silt loam. Th native vegetation consists of the prairie grasses common to the region. Along the larger drainage ways the lower slope* originally were </seg>
            <seg id="p334">316 l'KOCKLDINGS NEBBASKA STATE BOABD OF AOIIICULTUBE forested, mainly with scrub oak. Where the forest growth has not been disturbed it has spread. Only a small part of the type, about 20 per cent, Is under cultivation, the remainder being largely in permanent pasture, with a small acreage in hay land. Where the slopes are moderate corn, wheat and oats do well. Corn yields 20 to 30 bushels, oats 25 to 30 bushels and wheat 16 to 20 bushels per acre. Some alfalfa is grown with good results. Owing to its high stone content, this soil is not so easy to handle as the Carrington silt loam. When plowed too wet it bakes and clods con - siderably, except in the sandy areas. In places, locally termed "gumbo" spots, where the subsoil is exposed the type checks and cracks and is very difficult to handle. The value of this land ranges from $50 to $85 an acre, depending on the topography and the content of stony material. Wauketha Silt Loam. The Waukesha silt loam is a dark-brown, smooth silt loam terrace soil underlain, to a depth of 15 to 18 inches, by a yellowish-brown, heavy silt loam of slightly more compact structure. The subsoil becomes lighter in color with depth and occasionally light - gray mottlings and reddish iron stains appear in the lower part. There very little change in texture and structure within the 3-foot section. The subsoil is open and has no apparent concentration of clay. On the marginal areas adjoining the upland the soil is 24 to 30 inches deep, owing to the addition of material washed to it from the higher lying silt loam types. The soil profile of the Waukesha silt loam is similar to that of the Marshall silt loam, but it occupies flat or bench-like terraces, while the latter occupies rolling upland. The Waukesha silt loam is inextensive in this county. It is con - fined to the first and second terraces along the Little Nemaha River. The largest areas occur between Auburn and Nemaha. The topography of the first or lower terrace is flat to gently undu - lating. The transition from the first terrace to the bottom land is marked by a gentle slope, and that between the second terrace and the bottom land by a rather steep slope. The second terrace is largely reduced to slopes, though it is rather flat topped. The low terrace is about 30 feet and the high terrace about 60 feet above the flood plain. In general the Waukasha silt loam is well drained and drouth resistant.

The Wabash silt loam is a dark-brown to al - most black, heavy silt loam bottom land soil, 12 to 18 inches deep, with an average depth of 15 inches. This is underlain by a black silty clay loam which becomes heavier and more compact with depth. Faint brown mottlings occur in the subsoil. Ditches on this type show that between the depths of 4 and 5 feet the substratum passes into a light - gray silt loam, streaked and blotched with reddish iron stains. Lime con - cretions are encountered in the light-gray layer. In poorly drained spots light gray mottlings usually appaar in the lower part of the subsoil. The soil is friable and high in organic matter. The subsoil is compact and moderately plastic, though the plasticity is not a pronounced character - istic. When dry the subsoil breaks up as granules. On the narrow stream bottoms and in places on the wider bottoms a light variation of this typa is developed. It is a smooth, dark-brown si'.t loam, 18 to 24 inches deep, underlain by a dark-brown, more compact silt lcam. There apparently is no change in color and texture within the 3-foot section. In poorly drained spots light-gray mottlings and rusty - brown iron stains appear in the lower part of the subsoil. In texture this variation is lighter in the surface soil and considerably lighter in the subsoil than typical. The area on the Missouri River bottom north of Peru, and closely as - sociated with the Wabash clay, is heavier in texture than the typical soil. It comprises a heavy silt loam, approaching a silty clay loam in texture and is 8 to 12 inches deep, undarlain by a brown, mottled with lighter brown and gray, light-textured silt loam to very fine sandy loam. This stratum in turn passes abruptly into a dark grayish brown, heavy silt loam to silty clay loam. Practically all this heavy soil is under cultiva - tion. In the Little Nemaha bottom are a number of areas of heavy soil locally termed "gumbo."

When dry, both soil and subsoil have a granular structure; when wet they are sticky and the soil is like a clay. This phase is too irregular and patchy in occurrence to be mapped sepa - rately. It is best developed in the southeastern quarter of section 22, ex - tending a short way into section 23; in an area covering the eastern half of the southeastern quarter of section 23 and extending into sec - tion 24, and in the western half of the northwestern quarter of section 25, reaching into section 26. All these sections are in T. 6 N., R. 13 E. A colluvial phase is included with the Wabash silt loam. It con - sists of a dark brown to black, heavy silt loam, extending to a depth of 3 feet without material change iu texture or color. The subsoil is somewhat more compact, though very friable. This phase occurs largely as colluvial fans at the mouths of small streams entering the major first bottoms, and as gentle slopes between the bottom lands proper and the uplands or terraces. It is well drained and not subject to overflow, except by branch streams and for short periods. Corn, oats and wheat do well on this phase and most of it is devoted to corn. The Wabash silt loam is the predominant 'oottom-land soil of the county. The largest area lies along the Little Nemaha River. The surface is flat and only slightly dissected by old channels and cutoffs. The type is subject to overflow. Originally the drainage as a whole was poor, but by straightening and deepening the channels and by clearing the land it has been very much improved. There are still a number of poorly drained spots in the first bottom of the Little Nemaha Valley. Before the maximum production of crops can be reached it will be neces - sary to install a more complete system of drainage, including tiling and in many places the construction of additional ditches. The narrow first bottoms of small valleys and narrow strips along the main streams originally were forested with white elm, oak, black walnut, ash, linden, hackberry, maple and some bitter hickory. Along the streams the growth also included cottonwood and willow. A large proportion of the original forest growth remains. On the wide bottoms the type supported a growth of marsh grasses and water-loving plants. About 80 per cent of the type is under cultibation, being devoted to the production of the staple farm ir.ops. Corn is by far the most im - portant crop, being grown on about two-thirds of the improved farm .land. Where not injured by overflow it yields from 40 to 50 bushels per acre, with maximum yields of 80 to 85 bushels. Where the type has been cultivated to corn for a number of years wheat does we'.l, yielding from 20 to 30 bushels per acre. Oats are not grown extensively, as they lodga. The Kherson, a short, stiff-strawed variety, does best, producing from 30 to 35 bushels per acre. Most of the Wabash silt loam lies too low for the production of alfalfa, though in the better drained areas this crop does well. Usually four cuttings are obtained in a season, with an average total yield of 5 tons per acre. A large part of this soil is in wild hay, producing 1V4 to 2 tone per acre. Timothy </seg>
            <seg id="p337">PROCEEDINGS NEBEASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 319 does very well, yielding about 2 tons of hay per acre. The potatoes grown on this type are usually of Inferior quality. Owing to the fact that this land affords good pasture and produces large yields of hay and corn, the raising of beef cattle is more general than on the upland. The rotation practiced by a few of the best farmers on the Wabash silt loam consists of corn 3 years, oats 1 year, and wheat 1 year, return - ing to corn. On most farms the one-crop system prevails, and only occasionally is the corn rotated with oats and wheat. Some fields have been in corn continuously for 15 years or more. Under proper moisture conditions the soil is rather easy to handle, though not so easy as the upland types. When wet it is rather sticky, and if plowed in this condition bakes and clods. The "gumbo" spots are difficult to till. Owing to the high water table and the friable nature of the soil, crops rarely suffer from lack of moisture. On account of its high organic matter content, the application of barnyard manure is not desirable on this type, except in fields which have been cultivated for a long time, as it causes small grain to lodge. In the cultivated areas the occasional rotation of corn with grain and some leguminous crop seems to be sufficient to maintain the productive - ness of the soil. Where the type has been planted to com continously for an extended period its crop-producing power has been greatly impaired. Farm land of this type ranges in value from $100.00 to $210.00 an acre, depending on drainage conditions and location. Wabash Clay. The Wabash clay is a dark slate colored to almost black, heavy, plastic silty clay to clay bottom land soil, from 12 to 18 inches deep, underlain by a drab, faintlv mottled with brown and rusty brown, plastic silty clay to clay. When dry, both soil and sub - soil have a granular structure. The change in color from the soil to the subsoil is gradual and usually marked by a dark drab transitional layer, varying from 4 to 6 inches in thickness. As a rule the subsoil becomes lighter in color and texture with depth. It is highly calcareous, the lime occurring in the form of concretions and shells. Adjoining the bluff line the soil usually has a veneering of silty material and adjoin - ing the Sarpy very fine sandy loam a veneering of very fine sandy ma - terial. This type is referred to locally as "gumbo." In depressed areas the Wabash clay is subject to some variation, the soil consisting of a black, silty clay to clay, 3 to 5 inches deep, underlain by a bluish gray, mottled with brown and rusty brown, sub - soil of the same texture. This variation is poorly drained and is inundated a large part of the year. The natural growth largely con - sists of water-loving plants, and the type does not afford very good pasturage. The Wabash clay occurs on the first bottom along the Missouri River, usually adjoining the bluff line, and has a small total area. The largest areas occur north and northwest of Peru and east and northeast of Nemaha. </seg>
            <seg id="p338">320 PBOCEEDINO8 NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE The topography is flat to depressed, but on the whole the drainage is fair. The establishment of good drainage is the greatest problem which confronts the farmers on this type. With the installation of a complete drainage system most of the type could be made valuable farm land. About 50 per cent of this type is devoted to the production of staple crops, the remainder being largely in permanent pasture, with a small percentage in hay lots. Most of the fairly well drained areas of the type are in corn, which generally yields about 40 bushels per acre. Wheat yields from 15 to 20 bushels per acre, while in dry seasons yields of 30 to 35 bushels are obtained. Oats are likely to lodge. The yields range from 25 to 40 bushels per acre. Some of this soil is in wild grasses, which give average yields of 1% tons of hay per acre. In well drained areas alfalfa does well, yielding from 3 to 5 tons per acre. The type is the most difficult soil to cultivate in Nemaha County. When cultivated too wet it forms intractable clods, though under favor - able moisture conditions it works up into a rather mellow seed bed. Very little barnyard manure is applied and no commercial fertilizers are used. The one-crop system prevails on the Wabash clay, though occa - sionally corn is rotated with oats and wheat. Some of the corn land is rotated with oats and wheat. Some of the land has been in corn for more than 10 years. Land of this type is valued at $50.00 to $125.00 an acre, depending on drainage conditions and location. Sa.py Silt Lcam. The Sarpy silt loam is a light brown to brown silt loam alluvial soil, 12 to 15 inches deep, carrying a high percentage of very fine sand. This is underlain by a ve-y fine sandy loam, which has a light gray color, mottled faintly with rusty brown. Frequently the subsoil has a bluish shade. Seams of very fine sand are common in the soil, and seams of silt and heavier material in the subsoil. As the color indicates, the soil is low in organic matter. This type is inextensive and occurs as small arras on the Missouri River bottom lands. It is closely associated with the Sarpy very fine sandy loam, and like that type is elevated about 8 to 15 feet above the normal flow of the stream. In general, the surface is flat, though marked by slight ridges. The type is well drained and is rarely over - flowed, except by branch streairs. In a few places where it borders the Missouri River it is subject to stream erosion. Practically all of this type is under cultivation. Most of it is de - voted to corn, which yields from 50 to 70 bushels per acre when not injured by overflow. Oats and wheat also are grown successfully. Potatoes, watermelons and muskmelons do well. The value of this tvpe ranges from $50.00 to $175.00 an acre, de - pending on the extent to which it is subject to erosion by the Missouri River.

The soil carries a high percentage of silt and is low in organic matter. In many borings there is no apparent change in texture within the 3-foot section. In poorly drained positions the color of the subsoil at 20 to 24 inches changes to light gray mottled with rusty brown or brown, in many instances the subsoil consists of alternate layers of sand, silt and clay, and seams of silt are not uncommon in the surface soil. The Sarpy very fine sandy loam is not extensive in Nemaha County. The largest area is on McKissock Island. Other areas occur as narrow, discontinuous strips along the Missouri River, lying from 8 to 15 feet above the normal flow of the stream. The surface generally is flat, though marked by slight ridges. Between flood stages the drainage is thorough to excessive and during protracted drouths crops suffer from lack of moisture. The type is subject to overflow. Most of this type is under cultivation and devoted to the production of corn, oats and wheat. About 10 per cent of it supports a thick growth of willow and cottonwood. Corn, the principal crop, yields from 30 to 50 bushels per acre. Oats and wheat do fairly well, but are not grown extensively, except on McKissock Island. Potatoes, water - melons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and other truck crops do very well, but are grown mainly for home use. This soil is very easy to handle, and can be worked under a wide range of moisture conditions. It forms small clods when plowed too wet, but these are easily reduced. Very little manure is applied and no commercial fertilizers are used. Crops respond readily to appli - cations of manure, the yields being increased from 25 to 50 per cent. As in the case of the Sarpy silt loam, the value of this land depends on the extent to which it is subject to erosion by the Missouri River. It ranges from $50.00 to $150.00 an acre.

The water table is within 4 feet of the surface. Between high stages of the stream the type is excessively drained. In its natural condition, the Sarpy fine sand grows myriads of cotton - woods and willows. Corn, sorghum and alfalfa do fairly well on this type. As the soil is low in organic matter, crops respond readily to barnyard and green manure. This land is valued at $25.00 to $50.00 per acre. Riverwath. The areas mapped as Riverwash consu' mainly of sand bars and silty flats along the Missouri River. The total area of River - wash is not large. It lies but a few feet above the normal flow of the. river and is iuundated with each slight rise of the stream. It Is changed by every overflow, and even during normal stages of the stream the soil is constantly being washed away in some places and b.uilt up in others. The material is influenced by wind erosion and is practically devoid of vegetation. AGRICULTURE Nemaha County was originally prairie, except the small areas of forest. The sod was turned and a large amount of land came under cultivation in a remarkably short time. At first farming was carried on in a small way for the production of corn, flax, barley and garden products for farm use. Ranching proper never assumed importance. The live stock industries grew up with grain farming and have become </seg>
            <seg id="p342">323 l'ROCEEUINUS NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AQB1CULTUBE stabilized during recent years. Corn has always been the principal money crop of the county. Flax was second until 1870, when it was superseded by spring wheat. The production of spring wheat began to decline in about 1885 because of low yields and insect pests. Its place was taken by winter wheat, yet a small amount of spring wheat is grown at this time. Irish and sweet potatoes, rye, buckwheat and flax have been minor crops. Commercial apple orcharding is now extending. The following table, compiled from the census reports, shows the relative importance of the principal field crops grown in the county prior to 1910: Farm Improvements. Nemaha County is well developed in the country. In few places can one find a better average of improvements. The land is fenced and mostly under cultivation. Adequate provision is made on mose farms for the housing of grain, hay and live stock. Practi - cally every farm has a good set of improvements. These evidence fer - tile soil and prosperity. System of Agriculture. The system of agriculture generally fol - lowed consists mainly of grain production in conjunction with the live stock raising and dairy farming. Corn, wheat, oats and hay and potatoes are the principal crops ranking in the order named. The acreage of corn grown in the county Is about equal that of an other field crops combined. Crop Rotation. There is no definite system of crop rotation in the county. Many farmers have evolved systems which they employ on their farms. The general tendency is to grow corn 2 to 4 years, oats 1 year and wheat 2 years, returning to corn. Frequently corn is grown 10 years and wheat 4 years without a system of rotation. Under such practice the yield of these crops depreciates after the second or third year. Occasionally the wheat land is kept in clover and timothy for 2 or 3 years, or in alfalfa for 4 to 7, and then returned to corn. Clover and timothy fit well into a short rotation, but alfalfa is a more certain crop. Some of the best farmers use a system of rotation, including 2 Relative Importance of the Principal Crops Grown in Nemaha County in 1879, 1889, 1899, and 1909 1879 | 18881 1809 | 1900 Crop Produc- Produc- Prodnc- Produc- tion tion linn tion Acre* Buahels Acres Bushels Acres Bushels Acres Bushels Corn 86.982! 2.942,770 85.575 4.084.020 107 049 4.23RO00 82,680 2.117.421 Wheat 'iS.nM 273.7OS 10.R33 161.528 21.248 315.500 2S.B26 567.066 Ost» J 4.259 118.60ft 15,278 H39.483 23.716 7«0,270 20,677 564.072 Barley &gt;,530 35,412 1,024 25,420 93 1.930 27 i 308 Tons Tons Tons Tons Hsy ; 8,807 U.6T0 20,280 32,654 13,020 25,802 24.194 39.538 </seg>

Two principal things must be kept in view in crop rotation, namely, the maintenance of soil fertility and profitable agriculture. Too many farmers think only of the latter and in the light of immediate returns. This when practiced does not conserve the State and the Nation. Adaptation of Crop* to Soils. Attention is being given to the adap - tation of crops to the soils. It is recognized that the undulating up - land areas are best adapted to corn .wheat, oats and alfalfa; that the steep hilly areas are admirably adapted to alfalfa, small fruits, and com - mercial orcharding; that the eroded drift soils should be used for graz - ing; that the Wabash silt loam or heavy bottom land, is best adapted to corn, and not so well suited to small grains; and that the sandy types of good bottom land soil are well suited for potatoes and other truck crops. U»e of Fertilizer*. Not much attention is given to the use of artificial fertilizers. Some of the drift hill land could be improved by adding ground limestone, such as could be made from local stone. Green crops are seldom turned under and barnyard manure is used most on the least productive spots of the farms. Farm Labor. Efficient farm labor is becoming scarce. Most of the work is done by the farmers and their families. Laborers receive $30.00 to $40.00 a month and keep when hired by the year. The daily wage during harvest time runs from $1.50 to $3.00 or more with board. Farm labor has become a problem in the county. Retired farmers could do a patriotic service by returning to the farm during war times. Ownerchip and Tenant*. The farms are worked by owners and by tenants. The tendency is for owners to move to the towns and leave their places to the management of renters. The cash and share systems and a combination of the two are used in the rental of farms. The share system is common. Cash rent ranges from about $3.00 to $8.00 and $10.00 an acre, depending on the nature of the soil and its location. Under the share system the owner of the land receives two-fifths, and in a few cases one-third of the crops grown, all stock and farm Imple - ments being furnished by the tenant. In some cases the owner receives two-flfths of the small grain -and one-half of the corn. Where the land is rented on a basis of equal division of crops the owner furnishes the farm implements and the work stock. In a combination system of cash and share renting the land not used for crops, including permanent pasture, is rented for cash and the grain and wheat yields on shares. In some cases cash rent is paid for the hay land. Corn This crop is grown on all important soil types in the county, but it does best on the silt loams. Reids Yellow Dent, Iowa Silver Mine, Learning, and the Nemaha Va'ley White are the most popular varieties. More attention than in the past is given to the selection and care of seed. Much of the corn is listed and a small part of it is checkrowed. The cultivation is done with modern machinery and with some regard </seg>

Some corn is shocked, but most of it is husked in the field and stored in cribs. Stock fields are pastured. Much of the corn crop is fed on farms. Only a relatively small percentage of the corn is shipped out. The acreage, production and value of the corn crop of late years are as follows: Wheat. This is second in acreage occupying a little more than 9% of the improved land in normal times. At present the Turkey Red winter wheat is grown almost exclusively. This variety produces better yields than the spring wheat and can be seeded in the fall, when it does not interfere with the work of caring for other crops. It matures before the dry weather and hot winds occur. The crop is grown chiefly on the rolling to hilly uplands on which are the Marshall and Carrington silt loam soils. The crop is produced to some extent on the silt loams of the bottom lands. It does best on the Marshall silt loam of the upland. An increased acreage of spring wheat will be sown this year if good seed can be secured. With the present high prices, the wheat crop is profitable, and it should continue to lead the other small grain crops in acreage and pro - duction. The crop is harvested and threshed with modern machinery. It is stored on farms or taken at once to grain elevators for shipment. It is strictly a cash crop.

            <seg id="p345">326 I'BOCEEOI.NOS NEBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AQBICULTUKE The decrease of winter wheat in 1917 was due to winter killing. Oats. The acreage in oats is nearly as large as that in wheat, the 1910 census reporting a total of 20,677 acres, with a production of 564,072 bushels. Like wheat, this crop does best on the Marshall and Carrington silt loams. It is likely to lodge on the bottom-land soils. The Kherson, a short, stiff-strawed variety, has given the best results on the bottom lands. Other varieties grown in the county are the Swedish Select and Green Russian. As it is impracticable to follow corn with wheat, oats take this place in the rotation, regardless of the fact that the crop is less profitable than either corn or wheat. It is seldom grown on the same land for more than one year. The greater part of the crop is fed to horses, mules, and other live stock and only a small quantity is sold. The records since 1910 are as follows Production Value Hay. This includes wild hay, timothy, clover, timothy and clover, alfalfa, millet, Hungarian, etc. The acreage of wild grasses, from which hay is cut, is comparatively small. In 1909 about 9,487 tons were cut from 5,806 acres. Most wild hay is grown on the first bottom of the Little Xemaha Valley, on com - paratively wet ground. Of the hay crops, timothy and clover mixed occupy the largest acreage, 9,879 tons of such hay being cut from 7,968 acres in 1909. Timothy and clover are seeded with wheat as a nurse crop and the stand is usually maintained for 2 to 3 years. Timothy is usually seeded in the fall with the wheat, and the clover broadcasted in the spring on the young wheat. Considerable clover is seeded alone, but the better practice is to add timothy in order to avoid an entire crop failure in case the clover fails. It has been difficult to maintain a stand of clover in late years, probably because of the low rainfall between the middle of July and September. Timothy alone is grown mainly for hay and to a small extent for feed. It yields 1 to 14 tons of hay, or from 4 to 6 bushels of seed per acre. According to the Thirteenth Census, there were 2,212 acres in clover alone in 1909. producing 2,670 tons of hay. There were 2,449 acres of timothy alone, producing 3,200 tons. Though introduced only about twenty years ago, alfalfa was grown on 4,189 acres in 1909 with a production of 12,170 tons. The crop is admirably well adapted to the Waukesha silt loam, Marshall silt loam and the Knox silt loam soils. It does well on the Carrington silt loam 911 ... 912 913 914 ... .915 916 .917 ...

Usually 3 and sometimes 4 cuttings are obtained during a season with total yields of from 2 to 6 tons per acre. Good stands are maintained from 5 to 7 years or longer. Alfalfa usually follows wheat in the crop rotation, taking the place of clover. Most of the crop is- fed on' the farm, though a large part of it is sold, and shipped to St. Joseph and Kansas City. The nor - mal price is $10.00 to $12.00 a ton in the stack. This year the price is $20.00 or more. Some alfalfa fields were winter killed last year. Miscellaneous Crops. Barley, rye, kafir and sorghum are unimpor - tant crops. Sorghum is grown both for fodder and syrup. Kafir usually is fed without threshing. It is used as feed for horses and other live stock and the seed is used principally for chicken feed. Vegetable*. Nearly every farmer grows some vegetables for home use. Truck gardening is carried on in a limited way around the various towns. This supplies the local demands. In some places tomatoes and other vegetables are grown for canning factories, one of these factories being at Brownville. Watermelons are grown on a number of farms and principally in the vicinity of Brownville. They do well here and the gross return per acre has been as much as $320.00. Most of the melons are marketed in the neighboring towns at 15 to 25 cents apiece. Musk - melons, though adapted to some of the soils, are not generally grown in the county. Piactically every farmer produces potatoes for home use. In some seasons there is a small surplus. It is sold in towns, while in dry sea - sons farmers buy potatoes shipped to the towns. The figures on potato production are as follows: Production Value Acres (Bushels) (Dollars) Fruits. Nemaha County produces several fruits such aa strawberries, gooseberries, raspberries, blackberries, grapes, cherries, peaches, pears and apples. The production of these fruits has not been highly special - ized, probably because the farmers are more accustomed to the growing of the ordinary farm crops, such as corn, wheat and alfalfa. Small Fruit. Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, gooseberries and currants are raised on a great many farms and grown commercially in small patches near Brownville and Peru. They are produced prin - cipally on the Knox silt loam and the Marshall silt loam. Strawberries do especially well; and in one case a gross return of $2,000.00 from 3 acres is reported. Grape*. The production of grapes is most successful on the Knox silt loam, which occurs in the bluff land belt.

There are about 50 acres of grapes in the vicinity of Peru and 100 acres at Brownvllle. The grapes are marketed at Lincoln and neighboring towns. Apple Orcharding. This includes the home orchard and the com - mercial orchard. Nearly every farmer has a small orchard in which are grown cherries, plums, apples, pears and other fruits. Many of these home orchards do not receive the necessary attention in pruning, culti - vation and spraying. The fruit is as a rule of an inferior quality. The commercial orchards are located mostly in the bluff land belt, or on the loess capped hills. The largest orchards are in the immediate vicinity of Brownville and Peru. Mr. Christie and others have succeeded in orcharding in the vicinity of Johnson. There is a large strip of loess land along the Missouri which should have greater value in apple production. This belt is attracting the attention of commercial orchardists. In many places railroad facilities for shipping are at hand. In some parts, however, it would not be feasible to start orchards because the fruit land is too distant from the shipping points. The north slopes of the bluffs and the hills seem to have the preference as locations for orchards. Some growers, however, prefer the highest uplands. The apples show remarkable keeping and storage qualities and can be held later than the apples from most districts in other states fax shipped to the big markets like Minneapolis. In recent years attention has been given to the selection of trees to be planted, to cultivation and pruning, and to such ncessary processes as spraying, careful picking, sort - ing and packing. The windfalls and culls are used largely in the manu - facture of cider and vinegar as in Brownville. Most of the apples are marketed at different places in Nebraska where they are in strong demand, and some are shipped to big markets in other states. The sale of apples is through an association of growers. Live Stock. The principal branches of the lire stock Industry relate to hogs, beef cattle, dairy cattle, horses and mules, sheep and poultry. Growing and breeding of these have importance in the county. The value of the live stock industry for 1910 has been reported to be $1,025,130.00. Not including poultry and eggs it was about $2,105,813.00 in 1915, and $2,906,200.00 in 1917. Hog*. Hog raising is one of the most Important branches of the b&gt;e stock industry. The chief breeds are the Duroc Jersey, Poland China and Hampshire. A cross between the Poland China and the Duroc Jersey is becoming popular. Very few herds are pure bred. There are about 20,000 hogs in the county. On most farms 30 to 50 hogs are finished each year for market in addition to those slaughtered for home use. The hogs are raised on a variety of feeds. Formerly they were given principally corn, but now they are grazed on alfalfa and finished on grain. The tendency is to retain the animals on the farm until they </seg>
            <seg id="p348">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE UOAKD OF AGKiC ULTUHE 329 reached a weight of approximately 300 pounds. A considerable pumber of hogs and cattle are fed together. Hog raising in this county relates back to the large crops of corn and alfalfa and to the soils that grow them. These are big advantages. There are good markets at Omaha, Nebraska City, St. Joseph and Kan - sas City and the price of hogs is high. Beef Cattle. Practically every farmer raises a few head of beef cattle for sale each year. On some of the larger farms cattle are brought in from the stockyards and fed for market. This practice is followed most along the bottom lands of the Little Nemaha, where some of the feeders handle several car loads each. The beef cattle are mainly Shorthorns and the Hereford. The number of beef cattle in the county is increasing. There were 9,503 in 1915, valued at $380,120.00, and 14,754 in 1917, valued at $885,240.00. Dairy Cattle. Dairying has become an important industry. There are a few pure bred dairy animals in the county. Most of the cowa are of Shorthorn breed, and there are a few of Holstein and Jersey blood. In late years many pure blood bulls have been introduced. The number of cows per farm ranges from 2 to 15 with an average of about 6. Some farmers keep merely enough to supply the family with dairy products while others sell some cream. Most of the milk Is separated on the farm and some of the surplus cream is shipped direct to the big creameries at St. Joseph and Omaha. A considerable amount of butter is made for use on the farm and some is supplied to the local town market. As a rule the commercial butter of the county is shipped in from the big creameries. In fact a considerable number of farmers buy their butter from local dealers in creamery butter. Most of the cream is shipped during summer. Too little attention has been given to the breeding, housing and proper feeding of dairy herds. One drawback in the dairy industry is found in the labor situation. The farmers are busy with their crops during the summer time and are not anxious to do the extra work of milking. This condition might be changed by a system of breeding in which the cows would become fresh in the fall time and there would be a larger production of milk in the winter when more labor would be available for milk and cream pro - duction. The number of dairy cattle has not changed much during the past 10 years. The present high pric &gt; of feeds may tend to decrease the number. There were 5,349 head in 1915, valued at $320,940.00, and 5,204 in 1917, valued at $390,300.00. Horses and Mule*. Horse raising did not receive much attention in the county until recent years. The annual horse show at Auburn (Figure 11) has done much to stimulate the raising of better horses. Most farms now raise one or two colts a year and some of them as many as six. The sires mostly used are Percheron, Shire and the Bel - gian, and the quality of the work stock is being gradually improved. A comparatively large number of mules are raised. These find a ready market. </seg>

The value ia between $800,000.00 and $900,000.00. Poultry. Chickens, geese, thicks, turkeys and guineas are kept on many farms. There are several breeds of chickens such at Barred Rocks, Reds, Buff Orpingtons and Wyandottes. The chickens produce a large number of eggs for home use and a considerable number for shipment to the big market. Poultry Is used as meat on the farm and In the towns and many of the animals are shipped to the big poultry houses for fattening. The poultry Industry of the county seems to be on the upgrade. There are a number of admirable conditions which promote this advance - ment, ftheep. Sheep raising was neglected until the last few years.

            <seg id="p350">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOABO OF AGRICULTURE 331 SETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT This story reaches back through several stages of progress to the simple natural life of the Indians who occupied the area for an unknown time before the coming of white people. The Indians were closely related for their sustenance to the streams, forest, prairie and wild life. The whites for a while followed along similar lines, but later changed many things that had been near and dear to the Indians. This caused the destruction of certain resources, but it supplanted them with those of greater importance. It was a change from prairie to modern agricultural communities. Some of the factors and phases of this progress are herein outlined. A trading post was established at St. Deroin as early as 1853. Brownville was the main landing and trade center of the county during the period of navigation on the Missouri. The first permanent settle - ment was made at Brownville in 1854. The county was organized In 1865. Brownville was the first county seat. Auburn became the county seat in 1885. The first settlements were made near the Missouri, close to trans - portation. Gradually the people spread across the county following the streams where occurred timber, water supplies and the tall Brasses. The early settlers came principally from Missouri. Indiana and Illinois. There was some amalgamation of the French and Indians. The present population is largely of American, German and Welsh extraction, with some Swedes, Bohemians, Irish and others. According to the census rpports the population of the county was 10,461 In 1880; 12,930 In 1890; 14,962 in 1900, and 13,096 in 1910. The report* for these yean are not entirely reliable. The county is now well developed In country and town. Farmers, by the use of Improved machinery and power, are doing more work per man than formerly. Unless there conies a greater demand for diversified and specialised agriculture, we should not expect the population of the county to increase. Tht Missouri River. This was the great highway In the days of explorers, reconnotssance survey and fur trading.

This animal, the deer and the elk were hunted by early settlers. Turkeys, ducks, geese, quails, prairie chickens, squirrels and rabbits were important sources of meat. Trapping and hunting continued of importance In the county until overshadowed by agricultural and commerce. The Beginning! of Agriculture.

The Unlveralty of Nebraeka recently marketed the experimental lamba which bad been on feed during the period of 96 days atartlng No - vember 23, 1916 and continuing to February 26, 1917. Theae lamba were of Wyoming origin purchaaed on the Omaha market at $9.80 per 1M pounds. They were dipped at the Stock Yarda and all charges prior to the opening of the experiment charged againat the lamba. The feed prices quoted are taken aa reasonably fair for the perloa In which the experiment waa In progreaa. In the caae of corn at 84c a price Is used which would be representative In most regions of the state during the winter months juat closed. As regards the prices on the pur - chased protein supplement products, oil meal, cottonaeed meal and cold preaaed cake, prices were used tbat were prevalent at the time the expert ment waa opened as this would -nave been the time the feed would have been purchaaed. All of these feeds at the time the experiment closed were aomewhat higher than the prices uaed, but on the other band many feeders purchase these by contract during the aummer months and had thia method been followed the feeds could have been figured in the experi - ment at considerably leaa valuea than we uaed. Silage la valued at $6.00 per ton. Thla ia the highest valuation we have ever placed on silage, however, it seems justifiable when we take Into consideration prevailing prices of corn.

            <seg id="p375">354 PROCEEDINGS N EBB ASK A STATE BOABD Or AQBICULTOBE Alfalfa hay is computed on a basis of $10.00 per ton. This is actually higher than the prevailing price has been in most communities, especially In eastern Nebraska, this year. The first eight lots in this experiment were fed identical rations to the eight lots fed during the winter of 1915-16, the object being to check results and endeavor to give averages over a series of years, thereby of - fering much more stable results. Lot 9 in this experiment was fed alfalfa hay, together with corn and oil meal in self-feeder in order to check with Lot 8, which received prairie hay, and the grain in the self-feeder. As the corn fed during this winter was of much better quality than that fed last year we would naturally expect somewhat different resuiu. from the use of the protein supplements added to a corn and alfalfa ra - tion than were secured then. The lambs were run In one group for a short time previous to tnu experiment and received alfalfa hay as their ration. At the time they were divided they were placed In their respective pens in the experimental shed and alfalfa hay continued as their ration up until the time the experi - ment opened. At this time the various feeds which were to be added to the alfalfa were given to the lambs in limited quantities and they were worked onto their feed gradually with the exception of the self feeder lots. The primary objects of this experiment were as follows: 1. To ascer - tain the amount of corn when fed in conjunction with alt&amp;lfa at will which would produce the most economical gains. 2. To ascertain the advisa - bility of adding silage to a corn and alfalfa ration. 3. To secure data on the advisability of adding oil meal, cottonseed meal or cold pressed cake to a corn and alfalfa ration. 4. To ascertain the practicability of feeding lambs on the self-feeder containing corn and oil meal, in one case the hay being prairie hay and in the other alfalfa. By comparing Lots 1, 2 and 3, it will be noted that the gains which the lambs made were directly in proportion to the amount of corn which they received in their daily ration. An Interesting thing will be noted also as regards the amount of alfalfa hay consumed by each of these three lots. As the corn ration decreased the amount of alfalfa consumed did not increase. This is a rather strange coincidence although this has hap - pened in each of the previous experiments in which this has been checked. It will be noted that the cost of 100 pounds gain was practi - cally the same in each of the three lots and upon noting the cost of feed given the lambs during the experiment we find the amount likewise de - creased with the amount of corn. However, on profit per lamb the fig - ures indicate that owing to the full fed lambs selling to better advantage and having made a larger gain they returned $3.55 per head profit as com - pared with $3.18 in Lot 2 and $2.82 in Lot 3. This would seem to show that even with corn at the price of 84c per bushel and alfalfa at $10 per ton, it does not pay to curtail the corn fed to lambs in finishing them for market Lot 4 fed corn and alfalfa plus silage showed somewhat less gain than Lot 1 fed on corn and alfalfa. However, the corn consumed In this </seg>
            <seg id="p376">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 355 lot was not quite as much as that in Lot 1 and owing to the superior finish which these lambs carried, thus permitting them to sell at $14.10 per 100 pounds or 20c to 100 pounds more than Lot 1, we find the profit increased to $3.70 or 15c per head greater than the lambs in Lot 1. The silage was fed to these lambs in decreasing amounts. At the opening of the experiment the hay was cut back from them and they were induced to eat 2 pounds per day of the silage. This was continued in gradually de - creased amount until at the close of the experiment they were receiving Vt pound per day. As regards the addition of a protein supplement to a corn and alfalfa ration it will be noted that the lambs this year did not show up as well proportionately as a year ago. Somewhat less corn was fed this year in proportion to the amount of protein supplement and this factor may have influenced the results, although undoubtedly with the superior quality of corn, the results would be expected to show up well for a straight corn and alfalfa ration. Lot 5, fed corn, alfalfa and oil meal made very consistent sains throughout the experiment and aside from the self feeder lambs were thu heaviest gainers, their daily gain being .42 pound. Owing to the addition of the oil meal which is valued at $45.00 per ton the cost of their gain came to $7.30 per 100 pounds as compared with $6.64 In the case of Lot 1 fed corn and alfalfa alone. However, the oil meal lambs made a greater gain and sold for a somewhat higher price per 100 pounds and as a result the net profit per head lacked but 2c of being equal to that received from the corn and alfalfa lambs. This profit would naturally vary with the price of feed used. For instance, had the oil meal been charged at $42.00 per ton the profit on this lot would have been $3.68 or 13c greater than in Lot 1. Some feeders who purchased oil meal very early in the season were able to secure it at prices approximately $40.00 and undoubtedly at such a figure the profit on their lambs would show materially greater from the use of the oil meal. In Lot 6 which was fed cottonseed nut cake in addition to corn and alfalfa we find a daily gain of practically the same as that made by tin. lambs in Lot 1. A year ago lambs on this ration made the largest gain and the largest net profit per head of any lot in the experiment, the net profit being practically 50c greater than in the lot fed corn and alfalfa whereas this year the net profit figuring the cotton seed meal at $43.00 is 16c less than the corn and alfalfa lambs show. In Lot 7 wherein cold pressed cake was fed we find results not quite so favorable. For some reason the lambs failed to appreciate the cold pressed cake which was fed, possibly due to poor quality of the same. At any rate the gain is somewhat less and the net profit shows to be only $8.11. The cake which was used was of the extremely thin, flaked type and may have been of inferior quality. The two lots of lambs fed on self-feeders, namely, Lots 8 and 9, were only on experiment 64 days. At the close of this time they were fat and were sent to market. As will be noted they made a very satisfactory </seg>
            <seg id="p377">356 PBOCEEDINOS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE gain especially the lambs In Lot 9, which received alfalfa hay in con - junction with the grain. However, owing to the excessive amount of oil meal consumed by these lambs the cost of gain is extremely high being in the case of Lot 8, $10.66 as compared with $6.64 in Lot 1 fed corn and alfalfa hay and $9.43 in Lot 9, the self-feeder bunch receiving corn, oil meal and alfalfa hay. As a result of this high cost of gain in Lot 8, we find the net profit $1.04 and the profit in Lot 9, fed corn, oil meal and alfalfa, a profit of $2.45. Considering the length of time Lot 9 was on the feed the profit per head shows up very favorably compared with the other lots held 95 days. As has been mentioned before the self feeder method of fattening lambs offers a quick way of getting them ready for market. However, in all tests made at the Experiment Station the cost of gains on self feeders have run considerably higher than gains on any other lots in the same experiment. In conclusion it would be well to emphasize again the fact that from the standpoint of permanent value the figures under the feed per 100 pounds gain should be carefully studied. Granting that feeds are of the same quality there should be but very little variation from year to year in the amount of feed per 100 pounds gain where the feeds used in this experiment are used. Consequently, where prices may vary a great deal, one can quickly figure the approximate cost of putting on gains where rations are used approximately in the proportions indicated above. An - other year corn might be relatively cheap and roughness high. However, by referring to the figures mentioned under cost of 100 pounds gain, one could easily ascertain the data necessary to compute probable results from a Iamb feeding venture. lay .am P ee&gt; ing xperime n lov.

            <seg id="p379">358 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE ECONOMICAL WINTER FEEDING OF BEEF COW8 IN THE CORN BELT. By J. 8. COTTON, Office of Farm Management and EDMUND H. THOMP8ON, Scientific Assistant, Bureau of Animal Industry. The Need For More Economical Feeding of Breeding Cow*. A great many farmers in the corn-belt states keep cows of the beef or the dual purpose type for the production of feeder calves. On the smaller farms, having twenty cows or less, the custom is to milk the cows and to sell milk products, usually cream. The calves from some of these farms are sold to other farmers, who make a practice of purchasing such animals and of feeding them out in carload lots. Some farmers, however, make a practice of finishing their own calves and enough more calves bought from their neighbors to enable them to fill out a carload. On the larger farms, twenty cows or more usually are kept only for the production of feeder calves, which usually are fed out on the same farm as baby beef, or as two-year-olds, or three-year-olds. On some of the farms of the above-described types calves are produced at a substantial profit, and on others, calves are produced at a hsavy loss. Although there are a number of factors that govern the profitableness of the calf-growing enterprise, an investigation carried on by the United States Department of Agriculture in the corn-belt states during the last three years show that losses on calves usually are due to excessive maintenance costs of the breeding cows. Much study has been devoted to selecting for dairy cows, and also for fattening cattle, rations that will give the best and most economical results. There seems, however, to be but little information on the best rations for beef-breeding cows, although the data at hand clearly indicate that these animals must be wintered at as low a cost as is consistent with their welfare. When a cow is kept only for the production of calves, she should be fed a ration that will enable her to produce and raise a good, strong calf and still keep in good bodily condition. To feed in excess of this amount merely for the sake of having a fine appearing cow, as is frequently done, is a waste of feed. This waste Increases the maintenance cost, often to the point of wiping out profits, for when the business is conducted on as close a margin as at present it is impossible to raise calves at a profit unless the strictest economy is practiced in feeding the cows. Breeding Herds Mutt Get Most of Their Living From Farm By-Products The information at hand shows that where cows are kept exclusive - ly for the production of feeder animals there must be a sufficient area of pasture, most economically utilized, to support the animals for at least six months of the year. Not only must they get fully one-half of their living; from cheap grazing, but they must be so handled during the remainder of the year that the greater portion of their winter feed is made up of those unsalable rough feeds, such as stalks, stover, and </seg>
            <seg id="p380">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BO ABO OF AGRICULTURE 359 straw, which are abundant on corn-belt farms. The data obtained also show that on corn-belt farms the size of the herds usually should be limited to the number that can be supported on such cheap feeds. In other words, with the prices prevailing during recent years, the breed - ing herds must be made to utilize the farm by-products and convert them into beef and manure, while the more valuable products are sold or are fed to fattening animals. Every year there are large quantities of corn stover which are not utilized to their fullest extent. Every year also a vast quantity of straw is wasted by letting cattle run to the stack and trample under foot more straw than they eat. Most of the straw on this farm is allowed to ro v in piles and is not even hauled out as manure. In some parts of the country large quantities of straw are destroyed by burning. Much of the straw so wasted might be used to replace some of the more valuable feeds that beef cows receive. It is true that in many parts of the country in times past it has been better farm economy to allow these products to be destroyed rather than to try to use them. However, under present conditions, not only is it necessary that cattle should be handled in such a manner as to use as much of these by-products a* possible, but also, if possible, the farm business should be arranged so that enough stock is kept to consume fully these cheap roughages. These cheaper rough feeds can be utilized more fully than Is custo - mary and much less grain and hay need be fed to breeding herds. This is demonstrated by the results of the investigation upon which this bulle - tin is based. In this investigation approximately 1,000 farms were visited, and detailed information was obtained on the cost of maintaining the breeding herds on these farms as well as on the cost of producing the feeder cattle. In addition to the cost accounting figures, a study also waa made of the methods used in caring for the cattle. This study is based on records from 478 of these farms, upon which the breading herds were kept solely for the production of calves to be fed out as baby beef, two - year-olds, or three-year-olds. On these farms the average cost of a calf at weaning time, figuring all expenses and deducting all credits, was $37. There was, however, a very wide range in the cost of these calves, de - pending somewhat on the locality in which the calves were raised and very largely on the methods followed in producing them. On some farms this cost was as low as $25 per calf, while on others it exceeded $50. On the farms visited there was a very wide range both in the quan - tity and the kind of rations fed. Some farmers were feeding a ration that was hardly adequate, while others were giving their cows more feed than they could possibly eat. Some were carrying their cows through the winter in fairly good condition at a very low cost, while others were using large quantities of expensive hay and grain, with a resultant heavy winter feed bill. Many of the latter could have greatly reduced the cost of their rations by a judicious substitution of cheaper feeds for some of • he more expensive ones. </seg>

That ths various rations, which differed widely In kinds of feeds used as well as in quantity given, might be made comparable, all the feeds for these 478 farms were reduced to the "feed unit" basis, in which 1 pound of corn is equivalent to one feed unit., In this system 1 pound of alfalfa equals one-half feed unit, and 1 pound of cottonseed meal makes one and one-quarter feed units.

Kffi'tlB of varying iimiutltlei of winter feed on tbc economic produc IVcil unit) for animal (KB darn) On the bails of the average quantity of feed given to a cow, the records from these 478 farms were divided into four groups. That they might be comparable they also were standardized to a winter feeding period of 165 days, this being the average for all the farms. In the first group, 131 farms (See Table I), the cows were given an average of 1,550 feed units per head during the winter feeding period. The cows in the ..'■Kiml group, 112 farms, received an average of 2,000 leed units, while those in the third group were fed an average of 2,350 feed units. In the fourth group, 122 farms, an average of 3,200 feed units per head was fed during the winter, this being double the amount fed to the cows In the first group. On 30 of the farms in the last group the cows were Fed more than 4,300 feed units per head, or nearly three times as much as those in the first group. This great variation in ths quantity of feed given In the different groups was not due to any especial difference in the kinds of feeds, as the average ration in the four groups contained the same proportion each of cheap roughages, hay, fodder, silage and grain. This being the case it Is evident that if the farms in the first two groups, which comprise ap - proximately two-thirds of all the farms, were feeding their cows enough the rest were feeding their cows a great deal more than they needed. Much of this excess feed undoubtedly was trampled under foot and wasted. The records In the first two groups were analyzed to determine whether the cows in these groups were receiving a ration that was ade - quate for the maintenance of a cow In calf. The analyses showed that although the rations on a few of the farms in the first group were hardly adequate, nevertheless the majority of the cows were getting enough 1 8c* "Feeds and reeding," 16th edition, Henry and MorrUon, pp. 126ia&gt;. tlon of calves, I! a!

It also showed that the cows in the second group were receiving ample feed; in some cases even more than was absolutely necessary. The cows in the first group wera wintered at an average cost for feed of 110.70 and those in the second at $13.50 per head., The winter feed bill for the cows in the third and fourth groups was $18.50 and $21, respectively. Thus on nearly one-half of these farms the cost of winter - ing the cows could have been reduced materially, and many of the calves that were produced at a loss could have been grown at a profit. In fact, 800 of the calves produced on the farms in the first group were sold at weaning time for an average profit of $4.60 per head, while 700 from farms of the last group sold at the same Urns showed a loss of $8.90 per head. As the number of calves sold at weaning time is hardly large enough to constitute a fair index, the average value of the remaining calves, inventoried when turned on pasture at an average of 13 months, may be cited. The inventoried value of the calves in all four groups was approximately $38 per head. The 2,200 calves inventoried in the first group showed a loss of but $5 at that time, while the 1,600 Inventoried in the last group showed an average loss of nearly $20 a head.. An effort was made to determine whether the varying rations had any effect on the number of calves produced and on their quality. This study showed that the percentage of calves was approximately the same in each of the four groups. Avoid Costly Ration*. Not only were some of the farmers giving their cows too much feed, but many of the feeds used were altogether too high priced. The farms wore again divided into four groups, the grouping based on the average daily feed cost per cow. The average daily feed cost per cow in each of these groups was as follows: 5.8 cents on 98 farms, 8.4 cents on 162 farms, 10.3 cents on 131 farms and 13.7 cents on 87 farms. The average wlntar feed cost for the cows in the first group was $10. In spite of the fact that the cows in the fourth group were carried for a 10-day shorter winter feeding period, and were given nearly one-fifth less feed than those of the first group, they cost $12 a head more to winter, or $22. This great difference in the cost of wintering the cows in these two groups was due largely to the kinds of feed used. The farmers in the first group were carrying their cows through the winter on a ration 62 per cent of which was made up of cheap roughages, such as stalks, stover (cut corn 1 In determining tbe coat of the winter feed for the cow, the varloim feeda were, no far «» poMltilp, priced at their Hale value on thp farm— that U, the market rnlue 1ph» rout of hauling.

There were 14 farms (See Table II) on which no cheap roughages were fed. The average ration on these farms was com - posed of 54 per cent hay, 26 per cent fodder, 10 per cent silage and 11 per cent grain. The dally cost of this ration was 11 cents. In the second group, 229 farms, the average quantity of chrap rouvhagas fed was 24 per cent, these feeds replacing fodder and silage to a limited extent. Al - though the figures show a smaller percentage of hay and grain, as a mut - ter of fact the farms In this group fed on the average one-tenth of a ton more hay and a little more grain than those of the first group, feeding altogethsr 2,250 feed units as against 1,950 for those In the first group. Because of the larger amount of feed given, this ration rout approxi - mately the same as that for the first group, or 10.7 cents dally. On the 207 farms of the third group the cheap roughages replaced to a great ex - tent the more expensive feed*. Although these farmers were the heaviest feeders, this ration cost per cow 2.6 cents a day less than for the first group. This means a saving of $4 or more In the winter feed bill for each cow.

Of tbe calves sold at this time, 1,160 In the third group show a profit of about 76 cent* each; while 1,060 In the two other groups show a loss of approximately $4 per bead. The calves In the first two groups were produced at a loss largely because their damn were not fed as economically as were those of the third group. In the fourth group— 28 farms— over HO per cent of the ration was made up of cheap roughage. The cows In this group were carried through the winter at an average cost of $9 per bead, or for 6.6 cents a day. This Is only one-half the cost of wintering the cows in the first two groups, and nearly IB less than the cost for the third group. The calf crop In this group averaged only 78.3 per cent. However, a study of tbe records Indi - cates that this poor calf crop was not due necessarily to tbe ration. Fif - teen of the farms were In Iowa and Missouri, and on these tbe average calf crop was 01.7 per cent. The remaining 13 farm* were In Kansas and Nebraska, where the percentage of calves produced Is normally much lower, partly because the cows are not as well cared for and partly bacause there Is more trouble with contagious abortion. The average calf crop for these 13 farms was only 67 per cent, which accounts for the low percentage for tbe group as a whole. In spite of this low percentage, the calves in this group were produced at an average cost of only $30 par head. Of these calves sold at weaning time there were only 109, which Is hardly enough to be an accurate measure. They, however, made an average profit above all expenses of 12.26 a head. Approximately two-thirds of the calves In each group were carried through the winter and were inventoried when turned on pasture during tbe following May. All snowed a loss at this time, but tbe loss was much less for the calves whose dams received the ration of more than 80 per cent roughage. The calves In the third group, in which the cows re - ceived 40 to 80 per cent roughage, showed a loss approximately of $11.26. Um Available Feeds Meet Economically. Beyond tbe fact that ordinarily the major portion of the ration for these cows should be made up of the cheap roughages or farm by - products, such as cornstalks or straw, there is no fixed rule that should govern the quantity or the kind of feeds used except that tbe ration should be composed mostly of hay, fodder, silage, or grain will depend ordinarily on local and seasonal conditions. In years when there is a serious shortage of corn, farmers will find It necessary greatly to reduce tbe quantity of tbe corn that ordinarily is fed as grain or In fodder or silage. That this can be done under many circumstances Is evident from a further study of the records. They show that a ration which does not contain corn either as grain or in fodder or silage can be fed without any detriment whatever to the cows or their offspring. There were 149 farms feeding such rations, the majority of them in Kansas and Nebraska, and they produced as good calves as tbe farms feeding corn. The winter feed bill on these farms was $11.10 per </seg>

In the next group, 21 farms, silage constituted one-hair of the ration, the cows receiving an average of 2.76 tons each. As only one-fourth of this ration was composed of the cheaper roughage, the average feed bill for these cows was $17 although they received 400 feed units less than did the cows in the first group. It is evident that on the farms In this third group silage was replacing too largely the cheaper farm by-products. Study of Rations on Selected Farms. It Is evident from the foregoing that in the corn-belt states many of the farmers who are producing their own feeder cattle need to give more consideration to the rations that are being fed. If farmers will take more pains to find out the nutritive requirements of their stock and will then plan rations that shall be as economical as possible and at the same time adequate, many of them can lower greatly the cost of their winter feed bills. To show the possibilities of cheapening some of these rations, five farms have been selected, that their winter feeding system may be studied in detail. The farms chosen are representative of feeding practices found la vogue in different places throughout the region covered by the surrey On four of these farms the cows were receiving more food than they needed and doubtless on at least three of them the feed was not utilised fully. However, care has been taken not to se'lect any farms of the ex - treme type. There is only one that was feeding in excess of 3,000 feed units per head during the winter season. In the discussion of the rations used on these farms, no attempt is made to indicate a ration that shall be fully balanced or that shall be even the most economical. Nor has any study been made to determine whether the rations contain enough minerals for the animals, though generally in the rations outlined there will be a sufficient quantity of these. The suggested changes have been confined to showing that many farm rations can be modified easily in such a manner as to save expense. FARM NO. 1 The first of these five farms is In east-central Iowa. It contains 240 acres, of which, for the year studied, 80 acres were In corn, 86 in oats, 60 In clover and 60 In pasture. The breeding herd consisted of a grade bull and 22 grade cows from which 20 calves were obtained. The cows were given excessive amounts of high-priced feed for both of the years during which records were procured. They were turned on stalks on November 16. Winter feeding began a few days later and lasted until May 1, when the cows were again turned on pasture. During the 166-day Interval each cow received the following: Stalks 1 1-6 acre*, at $1 an acre. Fodder _ .- 2-6 acre, at $35 an acre. Mixed bar ■••••• •- •• 8-4 ton, at $10 a ton.

This is almost a fattening ration. If the corn had been husked from the "odder and only the stover fed, there would have been sufficient roughage for the cows. Estimating that three-fourths of a ton of stover were eaten per acre of stalks and that the stover from the fod - der fed would go 2 tons to the acre, and allowing the cows 3 bushels of corn each during the winter instead of 22, they would raceire the fol - lowing dally ration: Stover 20.6 pounds 9.0 pounds 1.0 pound Mixed hay Corn This ration would be sufficient for their needs. Dy merely eliminating the excessive amount of corn (II bushels) from the ration a Raving of $11.40 could have been made and the feed bill reduced very nearly one-half, or from $24 to $12.60 per cow. The calves, which actually cost $43 at weaning time, would then have cost only $30. FARM NO. 2 The second farm is in the west-central part of Iowa. It contains 226 acres, valued at $175 an acre. There were 80 acres in pasture, 65 In corn (10 of which were for silage), 80 in oats and 80 In timothy hay. The breeding herd consisted of a good bull and 20 high-grade cows, from which 20 calves were raised. The cows were turned on stalk fields on November 15 and allowed the run of the fields during the winter. Be - ginning December 1 they were fed silage, timothy hay, and oat straw, The ration per cow as reported was as follows: Stalks _«.. . 1.8 acres, at $0.75 an acre Silage 3.6 tons, at $4 a ton. 1 ton, at $12 a ton. Timothy hay ..0.75 ton, at $2 a ton. Oat straw This ration contained much more feed than the cows could utilise and probably most of the straw was wasted. It could have been cheapened greatly by leaving out the timothy hay, which, because of a scarcity of hay In that particular year, was valued at $12 a ton. In addition, 1 ton of silage could have besn saved by properly feeding the oat straw Instead of allowing the cattle to trample the greater part under foot.

Because of the very poor calf crop, each calf on this farm had to be charged with the expense of maintaining \% cowi, besides their proportionate (hare of the In. 'I chaw, and thus their coat at weaning time wan $62.80 per head. This cost would have been reduced to 142.26 If the tavlng suggested had been effected. FARM NO. 4 In eastern Kansas them li a region, covering several counties, that is very much broken and where a limestone formation crops out in many places. These hills, because of the numerous limestone outcrops, are de - voted to pasture. Interspersed between the hills are valleys of rich bot - tom Intnl. where much alfalfa Is grown. A large part of this alfalfa is i' "I to the cattle that run on these pastures during the summer months. The cows In this region are wlntpred largely on alfalfa, and as this hay unually Is very cheap, extravagant quantities sometimes art fed, To contrast Hi • practice* followed In this region with those just described for Iowa, a 336-acre farm may be cited. This farm had 1 30 acres In alfalfa, 20 mtm In cum, 120 acres In hill pasture, and 60 acres In waste land and timber. The breeding herd cimnlsted of a pure-bred bull and 30 high-grade cows, which dropped 27 calves, The cows were taken off pasture November 1 and fed until Mny 1, receiving a ration of one-half acre of stover and 3 tons of alfalfa per head. The stover wu valued at |1 per acre and the alfalfa at $A a ton, the totnl winter feed bill be - ing 111, More hay was fed than the cows really needed. Indeed, If the hay hud b»en decreased 1 ton, the ration Mill would have been adequate, pro - viding sufficient iiiM&lt;'*ilhle nutrients and more than double the amount of protein needed A* protein feeds are usually expensive, II It MttMMb?* to devise rations wmlalnlng Just the necessary amount of this nutrient However, alfalfa Is tha cheapest feed available In this case Reducing the feed by 1 fan of alfalfK would have cut the wlntw fe»rt Mil M per row.

Most generally mass meetings were called as a consequence and at least tbe nucleus of the organization established. In all but three counties the organizations are working. In many counties they are exceedingly enthusiastic and doing valuable service for the state and nation. The local organizations usually comprise a chair - man, vice chairman, secretary, treasurer and a representative for each precinct. </seg>

The offices which lha Council has occupied uiid the funniur&gt; , have been donated by the patriotic citizen* of Lincoln. Financial aid has some - times been given for the prosecution of certain linen of work wblcb the Council felt It could not otherwise have undertaken. The Camp Klre Olrls and individuals have given thu Council efficient clerical help. At the suggestion of the Council of National Defense a HclentlQc and Research Committee was appointed from the faculty of the tftate University. The purpose of the Committee Is to supply the Btate Coun - cil of Defense with scientific and technical information, particularly In those subjjects requiring laboratory treatment. This committee rfias tested fuels for their heating value, has experimented with food products and the cost of production and has invest Igated all articles suspected of having been poisoned or made otherwise Injurious. In early July the Council appointed a Committee of thirty members to investigate and advise concerning the winter wheat situation. In the forepart of December it created a Sheep, Wool and Beef Calf Committee looking toward the Increased production and conservation of the same. The State Council has taken the initiative in promoting the organi - zation of Home Guards. Although in the last analysis under tha direction of the Governor, the Council has given out a great deal of information and assisted in many ways to organize the Home Guard units over the state. Although more than 150 organizations have been formed it is believed this work Is only fairly started. The growing demands for patriotic speakers in all sections of the state made it necessary to enlist the services of an expert In that line and the Council was exceedingly fortunate in securing Professor M. M. Fogg to take charge of the Speakers' Bureau of the State Council. The work of supplying speakers for patriotic meetings throughout Nebraska is being diligently attended to by Professor Fogg.

            <seg id="p399">378 rUOCEEDIN'GS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE department to organize throughout the state and conduct public meet - ings in many places where few have been held. One of the very important activities of the Council has been the en - deavor to bring people to a proper realization of the duties of citizenship, especially those of foreign birth and lineage who by reason of racial sym - pathies have been led astray and have failed to remember the promise that they made when they were admitted into the nation's family as citizens. The investigations that the Council has made reveal the fact that the German language press and the parochial schools where the German lan - guage is mostly used has had a very detrimental effect upon the attitude of those who have read these papers and attended these schools in re - gard to a proper appreciation of American citizenship. In fact, these agencies have retarded in a very large measure the absorption of those of foreign birth into the American life. The fostering of a racial section - alism in community life in many localities in our state has been resultant of a very serious condition of affairs. The endeavors of the Council have been earnestly used to arouse the proper responses from those who have lived many years in the state and whose children and grand-children have also baen influenced in a very detrimental manner by the continu - ance of languages other than American and ideals which are in conflict with those of our own country. </seg>
