         <seg id="p007">f Director's Introduction The following are some of the more important activities of this Department which have claimed special attention during the past year. . 1. Establishment and development of the three-agency merit sys - tem. This is a new program in the state and while basically it is rec - ognized as sound, it has some inherent weaknesses which will require special attention. Among the special weaknesses found to date are the following: ¦¦; . ; a. Accumulation of persons at top of register who may not be adaptable for employment in specific positions. b. Impracticability of selecting clerical and stenographic help from State Registers.' c. Delays in securing names from registers of persons who are actually available for appointment. d. Some positions seem to be unattainable to persons filling next lower positions on account of not having adequate technical training and no substitutions'permitted for what might be con - sidered qualifying experience. ¦ • . ; . ; . c. An examination designed to determine whether an incumbent is qualified to hold a position is not necessarily the type of an examination to be used in recruiting new material for same positions. . '. •,."'._. f. dumber of persons submitted to an agency from a register (i.e. three) to fill a vacancy maybe inadequate. It appears to the agency that a review of the Merit System opera - tion to date and the experience gained therefrom may furnish the solu - tion to some of these problems. ¦'¦ i ; 2. Funds to meet payments to recipients of Assistance grants are allocated oh a "needs" basis as set up by State Statutes. Grants have been paid during the past year on a basis of 87% of the Budgetary de - ficiencies in Old Age and Aid to Dependent Children, within the legal grant limits, during the six summer months and 100% during the winter months. . . : Owing to the increased cost of living during the past year it seems imperative that the basis of need budgets be reviewed in order to take the increased cost of living into account in the determination of "need." 3. The integrated field staff handling the supervision of the State Assistance and the Child Welfare and Crippled Children's activities is working out satisfactorily. 4. In order to make the services of newly employed persons on county staffs more efficient, what has been termed an "orientation center" was set up in Gage County, the county cooperating with the State Office in its administration. Persons from the top of county or state registers are selected by a State Office selecting committee, (preference being 1 </seg>
         <seg id="p008">given to persons who arc to be employed on county assistance staffs,) and iu«' jriven 4 weeks' intensive training and practical experience with a monthly stipend of $40.00 to cover actual expenses of such persons as are not employed at the time of attendance at the Orientation Center. Persons who are employed by counties at the time of attendance at Orientation Center receive their salaries from the counties in which they are employed. The Orientation Center is filling a real need and has been well received by counties. 5. The statutes covering .Old Age and Blind Liens have been re- M-inded. Records are being kept by the department in order to ascer - tain what the effects of the removal of these statutes may have on the piogram. I). Out-state clinics for crippled children are being held in various tenters over the state in cooperation with the 8.P.0.E. and makes avail - able many services to crippled children who would otherwise he denied the opportunities available to them through these services. 7. The State Assistance Department, through its accounting di - vision, is handling the mail-order Food Stamp Purchase Plan in fifty - two counties in the state at this time. It is anticipated that many more counties will request participation on the state basis rather than remain on the local county basis. 8. 1.8.M. equipment is used in the Accounting and Statistical Di - visions. !). Bulk distribution of Surplus Commodities is now limited to certain State Institutions and School Lunch Programs, some 30,000 children participating in these lunches. The State Commodity Division ulso distributes surplus commodity clothing to various counties. Bulk distribution of Surplus Commodities is discontinued to individuals in counties when the Stamp Purchase Plan goes into effect in the county. The placing of the administration of the state-wide Food Stamp Purchase Plan under the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare greatly increased the responsibilities of this department as it is esti - mated that when this plan becomes state-wide, it will involve the hand - ling by the state of some $10,000 per day of orange colored food order stamps. The rendering of adequate medical services to persons receiving as - sistance grants is a problem which is receiving considerable thought and which it is felt requires a great deal of cooperation by all persons in - volved. The number of persons receiving assistance grants is a matter of concern to all persons as the greater the number on these rolls the less the individual grants will be as there has never been sufficient funds in the State Assistance Fund to pay all grants on a 100% basis, there - fore it has been necessary to make reductions in the per cent of the grants paid on Old Age and Aid to Dependent Children during certain months in the year in order to be able to more nearly meet the needs of these persons during other months when the needs were greater. The Aid to Dependent Children grants based upon the maximum legal limita- 2 </seg>
         <seg id="p009">tions of $18.00 for the first child and $12.00 for each additional child has resulted in approximately 85% of the grants made to those entitled to A.D.C. when grants are paid on 100% basis receiving less than their budgetary needs whereas Old Age Assistance grants when paid on the 100% basis meet the budgetary needs of practically 85% of the Old Age recipients, thus whenever there is a per cent reduction in the amount of the assistance grants paid, the A.D.C.-recipients receive proportion - ally a greater reduction than do the Old Age Assistance recipients. The appropriation of funds to the State Assistance Fund was based upon all funds available through the sources of revenue which had inured to this fund in the past, i.e. estate, head tax, liquor tax, one-cent gaso - line tax and all unexpended funds in the State Assistance Fund.' In making an estimate of what the available sources of revenue might produce, on the basis of what they had produced in the past bien - nium, and what the needs were anticipated based, upon the experience of the past, it was found that in order to pay the same average amounts per person during the biennium 1941-43 as were paid during the pre - vious .biennium, that it would be necessary to carry over into the 1941 - -43 biennium an additional $500,000.00 which meant paying 87% of Old Age and A.D.C. grants during the summer months of 1941. This was done, and a balance of $587,718.60 was carried over as of June 30, 1941 to July Ist, 1941 in the State Assistance Fund. ¦ Following is a resume of legislation passed by the 55th Session, of the Nebraska State Legislature, pertaining to the State Assistance Pro - gram. Resume of 1941 legislation relating to the State Assistance Program; .'-.-.. Recovery ; • v ¦¦;'. .'. , ' L. B. No. 89. The old age assistance lien and the blind assistance lien and claim.against the estates of recipients of assistance are abolished. The liens on file are to be promptly released and satisfied of record by the registers of deeds or county clerks, as the case may be. There is a provision for a claim to be filed against the estates of deceased recipients for old age assistance payments made and the county board has been authorized to release such claims under certain circumstances. Effective May .-¦ /-¦ : 12,1941. •: - ;¦:"/:;..;;¦.;.:': .¦; .. ;;;;¦¦;:;.;.¦¦ .-¦¦. ; State Assistance Fund : .. L. B. No. 399. The "state assistance fund" is to be continued and there is specifically and absolutely appropriated for said fund and the purpose of the assistance act all moneys, available therefrom from motor fuel taxes, alcoholic liquor, head taxes ".•••¦. and such other taxes as may be provided by law. The division of the fund shall remain on the same basis as during the past biennium with the exception of a $15,000.00 increase in the amount designated for child welfare services, boarding home care and crippled children services. Section 3 deals with the safeguarding of records. Effective May 23, 1941. 3 </seg>
         <seg id="p010">Safeguarding Records L. B. No. 309. The Board of Control is given the power to estab - lish and enforce reasonable rules and regulations governing the the custody, use and preservation of records, papers, files and communications of the state and county departments. The use of such information by any other agency, or department of gov - ernment to which they may be furnished, shall be limited to the purposes for which they are furnished. The violation of the provisions of this law shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or imprisonment. Effective May 23, 1941. Appropriation L. B. No. 222. Section 48. The appropriation for the state govern - ment of Nebraska for the biennium beginning July 1, 1941 and ending June 30, 1043 provides for the State Assistance Funds an estimated $10,106,000.00 from state funds, an estimated $9,252,333.20 from Federal funds, Commodity Salvage Fund, estimated $2,500.00, the Bureau of Child Welfare, Maternity Home Fund, an estimated $1,200.00. The assistance fund is made up of the net proceeds of the alcohol liquor tax (L. B. No. 401 effective April 10,1941), twenty per cent of the gasoline tax fund (L. B. 70, effective March 23, 1941), the proceeds of the excise and estate taxes, and the pro - ceeds of all head taxes. Legislative Bill No. 470, effective August 24, 1941, which pro - vides a tax refund on gasoline used solely for agricultural pur - poses, amends Legislative Bill No. 70 in part; however, the refund does not affect the portion of the tax allocated to the state assistance fund except such amount thereof as shall be necessary to provide the identifying chemicals required for gasoline used for agricultural purposes. Food Stamp and Cotton Stamp Plan L. B. No. 234 The Board of Control of state institutions, the county boards of the several counties and the soldiers' relief commission of the several counties of the state of Nebraska are empowered to cooperate with and to enter into contracts with the United States Department of Agriculture. Effective March 28. 1941. L. B. No. 221 A "state surplus agricultural revolving fund" of 9400,000.00 is established to promote the expansion of the sur - plus commodity stamp plan, school lunch program and such other similar purposes for facilitating distribution of surplus commodities. Effective May 5, 1941. L. B. No. 375 The county boards of the state of Nebraska are empowered to establish revolving funds for the purchase of food order stamps and cotton order stamps. Effective May 2, 1941. 4 </seg>
         <seg id="p011">County Relief L. B. No. 131 The amount that may be paid for funeral and burial expenses upon the death of persons receiving old age assistance, blind assistance, or aid to dependent children is made a matter of contract between the county and the person furnishing the funeral and burial in each case. L. B. No. 5 Notwithstanding any more general or special law, the county boards and the governing bodies of municipalities are authorized to levy an annual tax of not to exceed one mill for the relief of unemployed and indigent persons. Effective Feb - ruary 18, 1941. The one mill may be in addition to the statutory limit for tha levy but cannot exceed the constitutional limit. L. B. No. 85 By a resolution of the county board, moneys collected from inheritance tax may be expended for the relief of worthy incapacitated or indigent persons, or for the improvement of the county roads built in the corporate limits of any city or village. Effective March 13, 1941. It will be noted that with the exception of Legislative Bill No. 89, which repealed the lien against real estate owned by recipients of BA and OAA, and Legislative Bill No. 399, which gave the Board of Con - trol power to safeguard records, there was no substantial change made in the laws under which the assistance program operates. In order to secure continued Federal participation in the assistance program, it was necessary that the state plan include safeguards to restrict the use or disclosure of information concerning applicants and recipients to pur - poses directly connected with the administration of assistance. 5 </seg>
         <seg id="p012">PART I DIVISION OF ASSISTANCE The Division of Public Assistance of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare is concerned with the policies and procedures which arc necessary in the administration of an effective assistance program. This program, which includes aid to dejjendent children, old age assist - ance, and aid to the blind, affects approximately 36,000 persons in the State of Nebraska. Since the assistance program is administered by the counties, the State agency acts in the capacity of a supervising and planning agency, working cooperatively with the Federal Social Security Board, as well as the ninety-three county assistance committees and administrators in Nebraska. Before any new procedure or policy is adopted, every effort is made to know how that policy or procedure will fit into the local situation, since it is necessary that the county agency lind these procedures workable. The Division of Public Assistance is keenly aware of its responsibility toward the person who may be apply - ing for or receiving assistance, and his needs and welfare are of primary concern. The Division of Public Assistance continues to work cooperatively with the Work Projects Administration, National Youth Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps in referring applicants to these agencies for employment on the various projects. The certification of persons to receive surplus commodities is also the responsibility of this Division, as well as the approval of applications for school lunches. The Farm Security Administration has, within the past year, assumed the total responsibility for taking applications for subsistence grants and loans, thus relieving the assistance agencies of that duty. A new program for the prevention of blindness and the restoration of sight has been developed in Nebraska within the past year, and it is hoped will become a means of rehabilitation for many persons who would otherwise be unable to receive necessary medical or surgical care. Funds for this purpose are not matched by Federal funds, although the rules of eligibility are governed somewhat by the eligibility require - ments set forth in the State Assistance law. The past year has seen a close working relationship with the Selec - tive Service agency, both on a State and local level. The staff of the Division is composed of the chief of the division, the administrative assistant, and five units which are the certification, field review and correspondence sections, the assistant super/isor of CCC selection and the consultant on collections. Each unit is concerned with a specific portion of the work in the Department, although all of the units are integrated into a smooth-functioning whole. The continuation of this report is concerned with the detailed 6 </seg>
         <seg id="p013">work of these units and will point out the changes which have occurred as well as responsibilities which have been added. RECOVERY From May 22, 1939 until May 12, 1941, the law imposed a lien as well as a claim on the real estate owned by recipients of old age as - sistance and blind assistance. At the fifty-fifth session of the State Legislature, by Legislative Bill No. 89, approved May 12, 1941, which became effective immediately, the provisions for the old age assistance lien and the blind assistance lien and claim were repealed. The registers of deeds or county clerks were directed to release all assistance liens on file. The State Assistance Department cooperated with those offices in an effort to clear the title to all of the real estate so encumbered. Recipients of old age and blind assistance were given notice by the State Department that if the lien recorded against their property had not been removed, a release could be secured upon their request and with - out any expense to the recipient. At the end of this fiscal year, June 30, 1941, the only provision for the recovery of the assistance payments made is the filing of a claim against the estate of a deceased recipient of old age assistance. If it appears that recovery could be made from an estate, the county board has the duty to file the claim and in some instances it is necessary to initiate steps to have the estate administered. The claim which is filed by the county treasurer, when directed to do so by the county board, is a general claim and is allowed by the court only after the preferred claims. The amount recovered is paid into the State Assistance Fund and the State Department is authorized to pay to the United States one-half of any such recovery. The board may release claims when fully paid or when compromised and settled, or when the estate has been probated and the proceeds allowable have been applied on such claims, or when recovery of the claim is not probable. The claim is not enforced against any real estate of a deceased recipient while it is occupied by the recipient's surviving spouse, or by any child of such recipient or any child of such surviving spouse who has been dependent upon the recipient or spouse for more than a year prior, to the death of the recipient. The possibility of making recovery of the assistance payments made has no effect on the eligibility of an applicant. : : ; For eleven and one-half months of this year, recoveries were made under the lien provision which amounted to a secured claim, and by a gen - eral claim filed against the estate of a deceased recipient. A total of $23, - --807.80 (see Statistical Table No. 40) was recovered for the year ending June 30,1941, as compared with $16,261.82 for the previous year... ' SPECIAL BLIND PROGRAM The Nebraska law makes it possible to provide funds for individuals who are in need of medical services'either for restoration of sight or for prevention of blindness, and who are financially unable to provide 7 </seg>
         <seg id="p014">such services for themselves. These individuals must meet the eligibility requirements for blind assistance except for the degree of blindness, and may or may not be receiving aid to cover subsistence needs. No Federal matching is obtainable on funds used in the prevention of blindness or restoration of sight program. Applications are taken in the county office, and examinations to determine the need for this type of service are made by ophthalmologists or physicians. These examina - tions are in turn reviewed by the State Consulting Ophthalmologist, who recommends or rejects the medical plan submitted for the applicant. Of the eighty-seven physicians authorized to make examinations for blind assistance at this time, eighty-five are ophthalmologists, while the remaining two are general practitioners. This program is very new and interpretation of conditions under which funds are available, and possibilities offered, must be made to individuals who are eligible to receive these benfits. To date twenty - four applications for such services have been received, seven of which were rejected as ineligible. Of the remaining seventeen applications, two were withdrawn, two were cared for by increasing the amount of the assistance grant, two were completed and warrants drawn to the claimants for services rendered, and eleven are still under consideration. CERTIFICATION SECTION The year ending June 30, 1941 has seen complete decentralization of reviewing case records in the State office. On June 30, 1940 records from twenty counties were still being reviewed in the- State office, but these counties have now assumed responsibility for this work. The system at the present time is working successfully under the direct supervision of the field supervisors, who review the work in the county in order to assure uniformity of practice and also to see that eligibility requirements are being met The State office continues to issue a month - ly payroll to each county, based upon the county's findings as to the amount of grants. HOME VISITS A State-wide study of home visits was made as of June 30, 1941, in order to determine to what degree we were conforming to legal re - quirements and administrative regulations, A compilation of the data secured follows: Total Caseload 36,010 3 and 6 Months' Period No. Cases Visited 32,393 Percentage of Cases Visited 89.96 One Year Period No. Cases Visited. - -••- 35,614 Percentage of Cases Visited — 98.90 8 </seg>
         <seg id="p015">FIELD REVIEWS Field Teviews are made for the purpose of studying the actual ad - ministration of public assistance program in the counties. The infor - • mation gained from the study provides an objective composite picture of the way in which the agency is functioning/in carrying out the legal requirements of the program, the administrative policies and procedures promulgated by the State agency, and something of the essential office routines and methods which make for more efficient operation of any program. This study is supplementary to field reports submitted by the field supervisors, and makes an attempt to cover all aspects of the assistance program. The field review may be concerned with the study of a particular portion of the assistance program in a given county, such study to be made upon the recommendation of the field supervisor. The sampling method is used in determining the cases to be studied, and the field reviewer works closely with the county assistance administrator in securing the necessary information. A report is compiled setting forth the factual data upon which observations may be made as to the effectiveness of the local program. The field supervisor then uses this report as a basis for working with the counties in promoting a better administered program in the county. The Division of Public Assistance gains from the field review a basis for determining the effectiveness of policies and procedures, and the review aids greatly in pointing out the problems of county administration, which are of help in the determina - tion of future activity. Twenty-nine field reviews have been made dur - ing the year 1940-41. CORRESPONDENCE SECTION Inquiries about the activities of the Department, as well as com - plaint letters, are handled by the case correspondent. The latter are acknowledged and the letters then referred to the county assistance di - rector for consideration. If the content of the letter seems to warrant special notice, it is referred to the Division of Field Services for the attention of the field supervisor. Many of these letters have to do with eligibility, the status of an application, inquiries about residence, and medical problems. A large nroportion are about the amount of assist - ance which has been allowed. A better understanding on the part of the client of the legal limitation of the various types of assistance, and the stabilization of the whole program has reduced the number of letters. In addition to handling correspondence of this type, the case cor - respondent interviews persons interested in securing information about the program and persons who wish to discuss their own grievances. Another function of the correspondence section is to act as a for - warding center for inter-agency inquiries. Letters from other States requesting service arc sent to the proper counties in Nebraska for ap - propriate action. Since April, 1941, the Division of Public Assistance has requested county directors to route requests for regular reviews on out-of-state aid to dependent children cases through the correspondence section. The State in which the recipient is visiting or living is asked 9 </seg>
         <seg id="p016">to secure a report and return it in duplicate. It is believed that this policy serves as a basis for the establishment of reciprocal plans for servicing aid to dependent children cases, and also aids in developing better cooperation between the State Departments. SELECTIVE SERVICE The Selective Service Regulations, Sec. XXII Paragraph 354 (d) Vol. 11l provide that "The local board may avail itself of the assistance of State or local welfare agencies for information on doubtful matters concerning dependency." This legislation has added responsibility to that already carried by the county assistance directors in that provision was made that the local selective service boards might ask the services of the county assistance agencies in clearance for dependency claimed by registrants. In some counties this portion of the work has assumed sizable proportions, while in others the request for service has been occasional. Plans for the working together of the local selective agen - cies and the county assistance agencies were drawn up by the two State agencies involved, and a fine cooperative working relationship seenis to have resulted. FEDERAL AGENCY PROGRAMS Work Projects Administration The relationship between the Work Projects Administration and and the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare remains on a re - ferral basis, with the county agencies reviewing cases once a year rather than every six months, as had heretofore been the plan. The Work Projects Administration works in close cooperation with the county agencies in determining cases to be reviewed each month. Satioital Youth Administration A major change of the National Youth Administration policy was adopted early in the year 1940-41 which provided for certification and/or acceptance of applicants by NYA youth personnel representatives. County assistance offices, however, continued to refer to NYA youth from families receiving any form of public assistance. Civilian Conservation Corps The upward trend in employment, national defense, and selective service has brought about a change in the personnel and functioning of the Civilian Conservation Corps in Nebraska. On July. 1, 1940 there were 1,937 Nebraska juniors enrolled in the 13 Nebraska CCC camps, while on June 30,1941, there were 1,081 juniors enrolled in these camps. Regulations regarding eligiblity were modified in 1940 to permit the enrollment of unemployed applicants who need the special training which the CCC offers, and the arbitrary standard previously fixed by family need was thereby rescinded. The administrative type of discharge was eliminated in October, 1940 in favor of a dismissal certificate which was authorized in aU cases where service was not terminated by honorable discharge. • Dis- 10 </seg>
         <seg id="p017">honorable discharges were awarded only in cases involving: a felony or moral turpitude. A plan for intermediate enrollment following each quarterly en - rollment was put into operation early in 1941, thus permitting greater, flexibility in assigning local requisitions and enabling consideration of seasonal conditions of employment. The services of the Nebraska State Employment Service were utilized, and that agency agreed to refer un - employed youth to the local selecting agent when no opportunity for employment in private industry was available to the youth. Surplus Commodities ' \, .'.;¦'¦ The counties which were not operating under the stamp plan con - tinued to certify persons to receive surplus commodities under the bulk distribution plan. In addition, the promotion of the school lunch program and acceptance of applications for this service became the responsibility of the county assistance agency. 11 </seg>

         <seg id="p029">PART 111 DIVISION OF RESEARCH AND STATISTICS The Division of Research &amp; Statistics is responsible for the tabula - tion and compilation of data for periodical and special reports. Reports are made monthly, semi-annually, and annually to the Social Security Board; and quarterly reports are made to the U. S. Department of Labor, Children's Bureau, on Crippled Children's Services. The monthly pub - lication "Public Welfare in Nebraska" is also a product of this Division. Since 1936 when statistics on caseload numbers in the various Pub - lic Assistance programs hare been readily available, the Social Security programs have shown a consistent upward trend. This is true of all three categorical assistance programs—old-age assistance, aid to the blind, and. even aid to dependent children up to July 1, 1941, the begin - ning of the next fiscal year following this report. The caseload in old-age assistance has been climbing at a steady pace from a caseload in July 1936 of 21,056 to 25,893 in July 1937, to 26,280 in July 1938, 26,950 in July 1939, 27,795 July 1940, and at the end of this reporting year the caseload was 29,007 in June 1941. The upward trend in this program has shown no signs of flattening out; the number of applications pending remains constant around 1,200; the number ot cases acted upon and accepted is nearly the same each month, so that unless radical changes occur, on the basis of the present data, the caseload should be nearing 30,000 by July 1942. ; The aid to the blind program parallels the old-age program and shows the same persistent upward trend. The caseload climbed from 553 in July 1937 to 577 in July 1938, 601 in July 1939, 679 July 1940, and it was 712 in June 1941. On the basis of data presented there would seem to l&gt;e indicated a relatively higher caseload in July 1942 of per - haps 750. v,- ..:' ¦:'¦,' ¦¦¦ '¦'-.:'¦ ' v ¦ '.¦¦ :'¦ ¦ ¦ . ' " The aid to dependent children program over the period from 1936 to the end of the year presented in this annual report does show a steady increase, yet here is a program which is quite susceptible to economic changes. Events transpiring after the end of this reporting year do indicate that 1940-41 may be a peak year and that if present conditions persist, the caseload in this program; will decline. The trend to June 1941, however, is one of constant rise. Taking July 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, and June 1941, the number of children participating was respec - tively 10,003,10,135,11,177, 12,175, and 13,081. Public aid programs to which referrals are made from the Depart - ment of Assistance and Child Welfare show a far more fluctuating case - load trend. This is due to a seasonal pattern that is superimposed upon the longtime or secular trend. The Work Projects Administration has this typical seasonal pattern of higher caseloads in the winter, generally 23 </seg>
         <seg id="p030">reaching a peak in the first quarter of the calendar year. It then grad - ually slides to a low point in mid-summer, to rise rather rapidly in the late fall. With the advent of more defense spending in Nebraska, with prospects of defense jobs, WPA. should reflect this situation since it has always been considered a work program. The recipients of direct grants under the Farm Security Adminis - tration reflect the reaction to economic situations very clearly as agri - culture moves into a favorable price cycle. The ability of these clients to finance their entire living without receiving outright grants is clearly indicated by the decrease in caseload. The fact that Nebraska will harvest crops this year plus the existence of sufficient moisture for a favorable start next year, together with advancing farm prices should reduce the caseload considerably by July of 1942. The July statistics indicating a secular trend are now given: July 1937-5430; July 1938 - -4180; July 1939-2071; July 1940-1239; and June 1941-1453. The Civilian Conservation Corps caseload of selectees shows the same reaction as the two programs above mentioned, plus the fact that these persons are young men eligible for military duty. The decline in the number of enrollees was constant. In July 1937 there were 3894 en - rollees; in July 1938-3162; July 1939-2767; July 1940-2384; and June 1041-1081. With the present situation as it is, the number of enrollees should continue to decline. The National Youth Administration has a caseload which should react more or less along the same lines as CCC in that its members are young persons. In order to try to show trends, both programs under NYA should be shown separately since the school program and the work program are more or less distinct programs. In the school program the month of May is used for obvious reasons. The trend shows May 1937-5715; May 1938-4212; May 1939-4571; May 1940-6263; and May 1941-6541. What forecast can be made for May 1942 is problemat - ical but an increase in caseload in 1942 does not seem imminent. In the work program one may find a different story since this NYA program has been geared to vocational training for defense. The trend from July 1937 with a caseload of 1157 finds July 1938 with 1545 cases, July 1939-1128, July 1940-1113, and June 1941-4105. To try to forecast the position of this caseload next year must include too many rapidly changing factors to be trustworthy. The third class of public welfare programs on which the Division of Research and Statistics reports comprises the county programs. Chief of these is general relief. While the accurate reporting received on State and Federal programs is not found in all county programs, be - cause of lack of any central control, general relief displays a yearly seasonal pattern of higher caseloads in winter with smaller loads dur - ing warm weather. The long-time trend of general relief indicates that the high points may have been reached and if the present favorable economic situations continue, the caseload will diminish steadily. The caseloads* in general relief for July 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, and June 1941 are as follows: 5991, 5904, 7814, 9206, and 6776. 24 </seg>
         <seg id="p031">The remaining county programs—mothers' pension, soldiers' and sailors' relief, and county blind aid are comparatively small. They seem to have sustained little change in caseload from year to year. These programs are fairly stabilized and reflect little change because of outside events. To conclude, it might be said that Federal-State programs seem to be growing steadily with few signs as yet of having reached a peak or of being stabilized at present levels. In the purely Federal programs, the present economic conditions are effectively decreasing caseloads. This same decrease is reflected in the general relief program of the counties while the other county programs are fairly well stabilized about present-day caseload figures. For further information concerning Public Relief in Nebraska, the following statistical tables are presented: 'Excludes hospltalltation, burial and transient aid through June 1940. After June 1910, medical care is also excluded. , 25 </seg>

         <seg id="p095">PART IV DIVISION OF PERSONNEL j To.achieve maximum efficiency, modern public administration re - quires the selection of the best qualified personnel and the retention of such employees with the agency as long as they render satisfactory ¦service..'- ;'.:.. "¦ ; ¦ ' ';'.'¦'¦'' The Federal Social Security Act, as amended, provides for the estab - lishment and maintenance of personnel standards on a merit basis. To conform with the Federal Act, and to be eligible to participate in the Federal Social Security, program, the Nebraska legislature passed an amendment authorizing the Board of Control to establish rules and regulations governing the administration of a personnel plan. This statute also provided that such rules and regulations should be binding upon the counties.* Following the adoption of the Regulations For A Merit System of Personnel Administration by the Department of As - sistance and' Child Welfare and their approval by the Social Security Board, earnest efforts have been made toward the selection of qualified personnel in accordance therewith. ¦¦ I The Classification and Compensation Plan Of The Department Of State Assistance and Child Welfare was formally approved on Novem - ber 1,1940. This plan is the foundation for the comprehensive person - nel program of the Department. It includes forty-one different posi - tions and describes the duties and responsibilities, as well as the minimum qualifications, required for each. Since the establishment!of this plan, the duties and responsibilities of approximately six hundred positions have been analyzed and each employee has been assigned to a specific classification. . : .. - j The first series of examinations given by the Merit System Council for positions in the Department of State Assistance and Child Welfare included examinations for the technical classifications on both the county and State levels, with the exception of three in the Child Welfare Di - vision. The written part of this series was given in. August, 1940. Due to the time required to grade the examinations and hold oral inter - views, the registers for these positions were not set up and officially ap - proved until December, 1940. The second series of examinations, which was given in February, 1941, included clerical and stenographic classifi - cations on both the State and County levels, together with the classifica - tions in the Statistical and Accounting Divisions and three in the Child Welfare Division. Registers for these positions were set up very soon, with the exception of those for the clerical and stenographic positions, which were not established until July 2, 1941. Considerable time was •68-362 Compiled Statutes, Nebraska, Supplement, 1033. ' , .:•;'¦ 89 </seg>
         <seg id="p096">required to establish the registers for the latter positions because of the large number of applications in these classifications. The delay in setting up the registers for the clerical positions caused the Department considerable inconvenience. The regulations pro - vide that no provisional or probationary employee may receive a salary adjustment. Due to the large demand for clerical and stenographic workers, the Department lost several employees who could have been retained with a small increase in compensation. Had the registers been established earlier, this situation might have been avoided. Registers for most classifications have proved reasonably satis - factory. In some of the classifications, however, very few persons made application and several who took the examinations were not available for appointment because of the low entrance salary or for personal reasons. The incumbent personnel was among the group examined, and those who passed the exmainations were placed upon respective registers. After these persons were removed from the registers through formal ap - pointment to their positions, the number then available from which new personnel could be recruited was rather limited. It is to be noted that the original examinations given under any Merit System are, in the main, qualifying examinations for incumbents. All persons in the em - ploy of the Department previous to November 1, 1939, were required sim - ply to make a passing grade in order to be retained. It is significant to note that approximately ninety per cent of this group made passing grades and were retained by the Department Persons entering the employ of the agency following November 1, 1939, were appointed on a provisional basis and, in addition to making a passing grade, it wa3 necessary that they earn a grade high enough to place them in the top three available for certification on the register. Table 1 shows the num - ber of appointments made from registers and reveals that thirty-three of these appointments were to cover personnel employed on a provision - al basis prior to the establishment of the registers. The remain - ing appointments represent new employees entering the program to fill vacancies. The original register for any classification of position includes the names of all persons who passed the examination, arranged in order of their final grades. In accordance with the merit system regulations, the appointing authority has the privilege of selecting an employee from the three highest available persons on the original register. In addition, the county appointing authority (the County Assistance Com - mittee) has the privilege of selecting an employee from the three high - est available persons on either the local or State-wide register. This us - ually permits a selection for each vacancy from six available applicants, except in cases where individuals may be at the top of both State and county registers. The local register originally consists of persons avail - able in a specific county. If less than three persons are available in the county, names of persons on the district register are made avail - able. The State has been divided into five districts (See map on page 96), which makes it possible for counties to select employees from near- 90 </seg>
         <seg id="p097">by counties before going to a State-wide register for selection. Con - siderable objection has been voiced by county appointing authorities when it has been necessary to select clerical or stenographic personnel from outside the county. This problem may be avoided to some extent in the future by interesting more local people in taking the examinations when given again. .:". -&#132;:' Qualified personnel will be attracted to employment in public agen - cies if it is known that a career is open to them by promotion to higher positions. During the past year, thirty positions were filled by promo - ting persons already in the service. The types of these promotions are shown in Table 2. In almost every instance this meant a salary in - crease to the individual. Experience during the past year has indica - ted that, when vacancies occur, county appointing authorities have given preference to applicants who have had experience in the program and are eligible for promotion. . ' ; ' :¦ -. •¦¦•:.¦ Several employees of the agency have found that they are not eli - gible for promotion to higher positions due to their inability to meet minimum qualifications. Efforts to increase promotional opportunities for employees on the county level may include the establishment of a su - pervisory position and also the substitution of satisfactory experience for some of the minimum qualifications in classifications already estab - lished.: -¦ .•¦• .-:¦;;.::.;,,:¦ .;.;-¦- ¦¦:''. ¦ .'¦' ¦ The present defense emergency has increased the turnover in per - sonnel. The seriousness of this situation is revealed to some extent by Table 1, which shows that approximately fifty-nine new appoint - ments have been made during the last six months. Most of these ap - pointments have been made to fill vacancies caused by resignation of persons to accept employment elsewhere at higher salaries. The salary scale for several positions has been revised upward. In some instances this has made it possible to retain employees; but, nevertheless, many persons have gone to defense industries or into Federal service. ¦ A greater appreciation of the service being rendered by qualified personnel is evidenced by the number of salary adjustments made during the past year. . (See Table 3.) In some instances persons were granted salary increases to prevent their resignation to accept better-paying employment. More important is the fact that many increases have been granted in recognition of continued satisfactory service on the job. Excessive turnover of personnel is not an economical use of tax funds. Equal pay for equal service rendered, together with adequate compen - sation for qualified personnel, should be the basic principle governing a compensation plan in public agencies. The,quality and type of service provided by a public agency will depend largely on the caliber" of its personnel. Under the present merit system regulations, each applicant is rated according to his education and experience, and his knowledge of the work to be performed as evidenced by a comprehensive written examination, and an oral or per - formance examination. Applicants for all positions must meet certain' minimum qualifications of education and experience. For the more 91 </seg>
         <seg id="p098">technical positions, higher minimum qualifications of education and experience have been established and a heavier weighting is given. this part of the examination process. Table 4 reveals the educational level of the agency's technical personnel.

         <seg id="p103">PART V DIVISION OF FIELD SERVICES The Division of Field Services of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare consists of the Chief of Staff, 13 District Field Super - visors, Supervisor of Orientation Center, and stenographers. Its function is to promote uniformly high standards of administrative efficiency throughout the State in accordance with policies and procedures estab - lished in the Divisions, as formulated or approved by the Director of Assistance, under the general direction of the Board of Control. It interprets to the county assistance committees and staffs State laws, policies and procedures, and provides direct supervision in all matters (except fiscal) pertaining to the administration of OAA, BA, ADC, Child Welfare, and Crippled Children's Services, and the certification and re - ferral of applications to Federal agencies, including WPA, NYA, CCC, and Surplus Commodities. There has been some change in responsibility for FSA grant referrals and NYA referrals since last year. With the change in emphasis in these two Federal agencies, the local assistance officers are no longer responsible for making the investigations for FSA grant applications, and refer to NYA only the youth of the families un - deivtheir care. .¦: .! ' : To expedite supervision, the State is divided into thirteen districts with a field supervisor responsible for each district, (cf., Division Field Services, map I). The field supervisors make their headquarters in district offices established at Lincoln, Grand Island, Norfolk, North Platte, Scottsbluff, O'Neill, MeCook, and Nebraska City. In each of the first four cities mentioned, two supervisors have their headquarters office together. At the present time the headquarters office for the supervisor of District II is also at Lincoln. The field supervisor makes regular and emergency visits to the county assistance offices in his district In addition to consulting with local directors on cases involving eligibility problems, he offers assis - tance with problems of general administration including personnel selection, and personnel practices. • ¦ During the last year the responsibility of the field supervisor has changed with respect to certification of applications for and cases of OAA, BA, and ADC. Formerly, he read just enough case records to furnish him a basis for supervision. In July; 1040, the State office adop - ted a new policy which added to the responsibilities of the field super - visor that of acting as certifying agent for the Department. The case reviewing which was formerly done in the certification section of the Division of Assistance is now done in the county by the field supervisor. Thus, he reviews and certifies or rejects all new applications, re-applica - tions, reopenings, and closings, and "spot-checks" modifications. In case 97 </seg>
         <seg id="p104">of disagreement with the county office, he refers the case to the State oflice for decision. The present procedures have met with favor in the local offices, since it is usually possible to straighten out most difficulties in the county by conference between the field supervisor and the county director without the necessity of corresponding with the State office. It has improved supervision and has reduced delays. The various divisions of the State office are kept informed regard - ing the problems and progress of the local offices through use of regu - lar and special reports from the field staff. The field supervisor plays an important role in the evaluation of all county programs for which the Department has responsibility. Staff Development. During the last year the Division has attempted to give more emphasis to staff development and in-service training. While there is little in the way of a well-organized formal staff development program, the Department has tried to strengthen its day-by-day super - vision to help develop skill and efficiency in the staff. In addition to the regular day-by-day supervision, the field super - visors conduct informal study groups of local assistance workers. These programs usually consist of book reviews, special readings, discussions, and so forth. Such practical subjects as case recording, interviewing, responsibility of legally liable relatives, budgeting, and inter-agency correspondence have been studied in these groups. Supervisors alsi at - tend and participate in the district meetings of the directors and public welfare workers which are held regularly by six different groups in the State. The Division holds general staff meetings at the State office four to six times per year, as needed. These meetings usually continue for. from four to six days and are attended by all the members of the staffs of the other divisions. In these meetings there is opportunity for dis - cussion of State and local problems, policies, and procedures. The field supervisors have opportunity to report to the various division chiefs the problems encountered in the field and to make recommendations te - garding proposed policies. Likewise, there is opportunity for the State office staff to explain new policies and procedures to insure uniform in - terpretation and performance throughout the State. There is a mutual interchange of ideas between the field and central office staff which makes for a better-coordinated program. Orientation Center: A new feature of the staff development program is the Orientation Center, established by the State Department early in 1941. An arrangement was made with the Gage County Assistance Office whereby new employees may be given a four-weeks period of instruction and actual working experience under the supervision of a qualified person. The State Department employs a Senior Case Work Supervisor, who divides her time between the supervision of the Orienta - tion Center activities and the duties of case work supervisor for the Gage County staff. ;.'. Trainees are selected by an Admissions Committee, composed of the division chiefs of the State office. Selection is made from the top three 98 </seg>
         <seg id="p105">names of those certified on the merit system register, either from the State-wide register or from the county register. Those who have not already been employed are paid a stipend of $40 to meet the costs of maintenance during: the orientation period. Those who have been em - ployed receive their regular salary from the agency employing them. The Orientation Center provides a course of instruction, including selected readings, discussions, study of the State Assistance laws, poli - cies and procedures, and actual experiences in making investigations, writing records, and preparing forms. The Center has been in operation for too short a period of time for a thorough evaluation of its work, but the reports already received from the counties who have employed trainees are most encouraging. As of June 30, 1941, 16 people have participated in this training. A survey was made in counties where Orientation Center trainees were placed. The consensus of opinion among these county directors was that the orientation training proved to be far more beneficial than an equal period spent by a beginner in a local office, since the volume of work carried on in the county office makes it difficult to give adequate time to training the new-worker in the fundamentals and to provide adequate background such as is done in the period of intensive training at the Orientation Center. Appeals. The State and Federal assistance laws relating to OAA, BA, and ADC,provide for the right of a tax payer, applicant, or recipient to appeal from a decision of the local assistance committee to the Board of Control. When an appeal for fair hearing is filed, the field super - visor or a representative of the State office is directed to visit the ap - pellant, make whatever investigation is needed, and if the appellant still desires it, to conduct a formal hearing." In this hearing the appellant has the right to call witnesses and to present any testimony he wishe3. The testimony is taken under oath and a verbatim transcript of the en - tire hearing is transmitted to the State Assistance office where it is reviewed by the Board of Control. The decision of the Board of Con - trol is final and is sent by registered mail to the appellant. During the fiscal year July 1, 1940, through June 30, 1941, 36 ap - peals were filed in connection with the three categorical programs. Of this number, 31 were in connection with OAA, and of this number 13 were withdrawn by the appellants, and in 18 decisions of the local assistance committees were sustained. There were 3 ADC appeals, in which the Board of Control sustained the decision of the local committee and reversed it in 2 cases. Two BA appeals were filed but were,with - drawn before the-date of the hearing. There have not been many re - versals of decisions due to the fact that in many cases the local com - mittees are often willing to change their action after receiving addition - al information or after a conference with the field supervisor.' ; 99 </seg>

         <seg id="p107">PART VI DIVISION OF CHILD WELFARE AND SERVICES FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN "Government—local, state or federal—is only an institution through which citizens act to fulfill their obligations to themselves, their families, and their fellow men."* This quotation from an article by Katharine Lenroot, the Chief of the United States Children's Bureau/expresses a philosophy which has gone into the planning of the work of the Division of Child Welfare and Services for Crippled Children during: the last fiscal year. Cooperation and joint planning among county and state welfare departments have developed to an extent not before reached in Nebraska. The material in the following pages sets forth the basis for this statement. The Di - vision hopes to see the growth of a broader understanding of the needs of children on the part of the people of Nebraska so that better means for meeting those needs can be attained. If more of our citizens come to realize that "the welfare of the child depends not alone on the care provided for him wthin the family, but also upon the safeguards and services provided by community, State, and Nation/'^ real progress will be made in behalf of our children. 1. RESPONSIBILITIES The Division of Child Welfare and Services for Crippled Children : was established by executive order of the Board of Control in May, 1937. The Chief of the Division was made directly responsible to the Director of Assistance and Child Welfare and to the Board of Control for the administration of the child welfare duties as assigned by the 1937 Legislature. As a consequence, the Division is responsible for the ad - ministration, direction, and coordination of all of the Board of Control's child welfare responsibilities, with the exception of the aid to dependent children program, which is administered by the Division of Assistance; for the interpretation of child welfare needs and promotion of the de - velopment of State and local resources for services to children; for presentation of child welfare problems and the collection of factual material relating to the needs of children. The functions of the Division include, specifically: ¦/¦' . a.

ORGANIZATION In order to administer the above outlined responsibilities of the Di - vision, the staff is comprised of professionally trained administrators and supervisors, all of whom have had experience in the field of child welfare. The Chief of the Division, under the administrative direction of the Director of Assistance and Child Welfare and the Board of Con - trol, is responsible for planning, organizing, and administering the state child welfare activities for the care and protection of children. He is responsible for initiating and promoting the enforcement of laws for the protection of children, the establishment of policies and pro - cedures for the administration of such other laws as are delegated to the Division for administration; he acts as state child-placing agent for the Board of Control; he coordinates the work of the Division with that of the other Divisions of the Department of Assistance and Child 102 </seg>
         <seg id="p109">Welfare; and other work related to the planning, organizing and ad - ministering of the Division. The assistant chief is responsible for the administrative direction of the supervisors of the Division, the planning of statistical and re - search activities relating to the child welfare and crippled children's programs, and assisting the chief in the conduct of the program as such activities are assigned. ' The child welfare supervisors, each of whom is responsible for a particular phase of, the state child welfare program, have the following duties and functions: • Supervisor of Foster Home Care The supervisor of foster home care for children is responsible for the supervision : of the foster-home care program and the work of the Division relative to the State Home for Dependent Children; consultation on county child welfare cases requiring foster home care, and selection of demonstration cases for which state boarding home funds may be used. : Supervisor of Juvenile Probation and Parole The supervisor of juvenile probation and parole is responsible for encouraging, standardizing, and coordinating juvenile probation and parole work; providing consultation . services to district and county personnel on problems of juvenile delinquency, including probation and parole, and to the personnel of the state institutions for juvenile delinquents on matters relating to case-work problems and treatment. As the liaison officer between the Division of Child ¦&#132;:- Welfare and Services for Crippled Children and the state training schools (State Industrial School for Boys, and Girls' Training School), he is responsible for the evaluation of all social studies of children committed to these institutions, the parole plans pre - pared, by the county welfare agencies, and the general supervision of the parole program of these training schools. The supervisor acts as secretary to the case committees of these institutions and main - tains, in a large measure, the flow of work between the individual county welfare agencies and the state training schools. A separate function at present performed by the supervisor of juvenile probation and parole is handling applications for children for admission to and placement and discharge from the Institution for the Feeble-Minded. This work is done in cooperation with the Superintendent of the Institution and the State Board of Control. SBperrlsor of County Child Welfare Units The supervisors of county child welfare work have the specific responsibility of developing county child welfare services in the state through joint planning with staff members of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare, the County Child Welfare Boards and their agents, and other county child welfare officials. In addj* 103 </seg>
         <seg id="p110">tion to the initiation of the program, the supervisors are responsible for the supervision of the activities of all county child welfare ser - vice workers, giving general planning and direction to the case - work, community organization, and interpretation activities of these workers. The supervisors consult with county workers, county di - rectors, staff of the State Department, and other persons on com - munity child welfare problems and assist these individuals in activi - ties designed to improve local conditions as they relate to children. Supervisor of Special Services The supervisor of special services is responsible for evaluation of the activities and services of private child-caring and child-plac - ing agencies; assisting the Chief of the Division in the formulation of standards as a basis for licensing such agencies; providing 1 con - sultation services in assisting child-placing and child-caring agen - cies in the improvement of the standards of their programs. In addition to this work the supervisor provides, on selected cases, case-work treatment, consultation, and/or supervision for un - married mothers, planning and arranging for maternity and post - partum care, either in the Nebraska Industrial Home or in private maternity homes or lying-in hospitals. This involves activity in the preparation of social studies, the handling of legal forms in connection with admissions to the state institutions, and the re - linquishment and commitment of children born out of wedlock when requested by the unmarried mother. Supervisor of Medical Care Policy The supervisor of medical care policy (part-time position) serves as the consultant on all medical problems relating to the state child welfare and services to crippled children programs. The supervisor reviews all medical reports relating to maternity homes and child-caring institutions and agencies and supervises the medical program of the state children's institutions.

This work includes re - sponsibility for determination of eligibility of children for medical services; the planning and arranging for extension clinics held for the purpose of case finding, diagnosis, and follow-up care; the giv - ing of consultation on medical-social problems to the state and local Staffs. |.-':. ; In addition to the administrative staff of the Division outlined above, the field supervisors of the Division of Field Services have definite responsibilities for the general supervision of the local administration of the child welfare and services to crippled children programs. The field supervisors give consultation services to the county child -welfare 104 </seg>
         <seg id="p111">boards and their agents, to the juvenile courts, and to other county officials on child welfare activities; supervision of all of the vanW child welfare activities of the county child welfare boards; serving as liaison persons between the State Department and the local administra - tive unit; general interpretation of the rules and regulations of the State Department, as well as responsibilities for interpretation, and participation in local community programs on child welfare. 3. RECENT CHILD WELFARE DEVELOPMENTS IN NEBRASKA In the last annual report an explanatio was given of the reorgan - ization in child welfare activities which had been initiated in November 1939. It is pertinent to repeat a part of that explanation because the de - velopments in child welfare in Nebraska during the pßst fiscal year have been an outgrowth of that reorganization. From March, 1936, to October, 1939, administrative responsibilities ot the state child welfare agency were administered through a field staff which covered the entire state. During the latter part of this period nine district child welfare consultants, with headquarters throughout the state, were providing the case-work services for the state children's institutions, demonstra - ting child welfare case work on a selected number of local children's problems, providing consultation to local officials on child welfare cases and strengthening community services,, and in general representing the Division. The district consultants were providing services to ap - proximately 1,000 dependent, delinquent, and physically or mentally handicapped children each month. ; '; •• ..-.-. In October, 1939, the Board of Control issued an administrative order which outlined briefly a plan for the establishment of a Division of Field Services to supervise the local administration of child welfare, public assistance, and the other related activities of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare. The Board: of Control recognized that child welfare, as well as other public welfare services, could best be admin, istered through a local administrative unit equipped to serve its commun - ity in all phases of public welfare. This action of the Board of Control was consistent with the intent of the Nebraska Assistance Act passed in 1936 and resulted in the elimination of the district child welfare work being performed by the Division's staff. This reorganization of the field services for the Division was com - pleted on November 1, 1939, and the county child welfare boards were asked to cooperate through their agents, the county directors, in the establishment of services to children through their county offices. The 1937 Assistance Act* made it the duty of the county child welfare boards to coordinate and cooperate with the county mothers' pension board, county visiting nurse, local municipal, judicial, public and private institutions, charities, hospitals, and organizations for the care, support, education, health, morals, and general welfare of children in the county in both rural and urban areas.

         <seg id="p112">fines seven classes of children's cases over which the county child wel - fare board has jurisdiction (dependent, destitute, abandoned, neglected, delinquent, physically or mentally handicapped). The law provides that the powers of the county child welfare board shall include the following: a. Investigate the family circumstances of each child reported as in need of service, in order to determine what care, supervision, or treatment if any, such child requires; b. Administer and supervise relief to families with children needing service, when such families are unable to give the necessary care; c. Furnish indigent children with suitable clothing, shoes, books, food, and other necessities to enable them to attend upon instruc - tions as required by law; d. Assume charge of and provide support for any child who cannot be cared for properly in his own home; c. Investigate complaints of neglect and abuse of children; f. Bring cases, when necessary, before the juvenile court for adjudication; j». Institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction against a parent or adult for neglect and/or abuse of a child; h. Provide any necessary medical or hospital care for children; i. Care for any child discharged to its care by a juvenile court or pending action by a court; j. Investigate complaints of alleged delinquency of children; k. Provide for a child born out of wedlock and his mother as for any other person in need of public relief or care; 1. Institute proceedings to establish paternity and secure the support and education of children born out of wedlock, or make a compromise with the father of the child in accordance with the pro - vision of the laws relating to children born out of wedlock; m. Care for children born out of wedlock with their mothers or in a free or boarding home; n. Provide for expert mental and physical examination of any child whom it has reason to suspect of mental and physical defect or disease, and pay for such care from public funds; o. The county child welfare board is responsible for making reports to the Division of Child Welfare on its activities with re - spect to child welfare. : ¦ The integrated county child welfare program made possible under the Nebraska Assistance Act and the administrative decision, of the Board of Control of October 1939, means that in most of the counties the work of the county child welfare board, the juvenile court, the juven - ile probation officer, will be administered by one agency. The county has the following specific duties: a. Making of pre-commitent social studies on all children com - mitted to state institutions; ..-;• b. Planning for children who are to be released from state 106 </seg>
         <seg id="p113">institutions, with particular reference to the boys' and girls' train - in? schools, and the Institution for the Feeble Minded; c. Supervision of children who are on parole from the boys' and girls'training schools; d. Supervision of children who have been placed from the In - stitution for Feeble Minded; c. General supervision for dependent, delinquent, and neglected .children; ¦ ;¦ ¦ f. Case-work services for unmarried mothers who request it; g. Investigation of applications for services for crippled children and after-care services. . After this reorganization each county agency assumed its respon - sibilities in the field of child welfare with an increased interest in, and awareness of, the dependent, neglected, delinquent, and mentally and physically handicapped children in the county.

It is not thought that this increase in cases re - flects an actual increase in the number of children needing child welfare services or that conditions affecting children throughout the state have become worse. Rather there has been a growing recognition of child 'wel - fare problems, and consequently an increasing number of child welfare cases was recorded statistically. Many county staff members have developed measures of skill and self-confidence in dealing with children's problems during the fiscal year, and have begun to report cases to which they believe they are able to give service. Moreover, as county departments have become more adequately staffed, they have had more time to give attention to the recognized child welfare problems. These three factors give evidence that the county departments and county child welfare boards have been willing and anxious to carry out their responsibilities for child welfare. Table I also shows that in 651, or 49.8 percent, of the 1308 child welfare cases accepted by the county departments, the family was receiving no public assistance, showing that these cases were accepted for service only.

The whereabouts of the children included as child welfare cases under care is shown in Table V. .-'¦":.' The State Department has continued its emphasis on the improve - ment and strengthening of county welfare programs. In February, 1941, three institutes on probation and parole were held by the Super - visor of Juvenile Probation and Parole, at outlying points in the state; The field supervisors have continued to give consultation and to help counties secure child welfare service workers where the number of recognized child welfare problems indicated the need for a worker who would devote his entire time to child welfare. A need for more specialized consultation service on child welfare problems has been,, evident throughout the fiscal year. The staff of the. Division has been unable to meet this need for consultation service because of other re - sponsibilities. Difficult and acute situations have been handled on an emergency basis as the limited staff permitted. The limited staff is due in part to shortage of available qualified workers. 4. SERVICES TO CHILDREN '' a. Dependent and Neglected Children : Because family life is the foundation of our society and of democracy and because every child is entitled to the care and security of a home among his own people, the first objective in the care of dependent' and neglected children should be to preserve the child's own home.

         <seg id="p119">Homes are evaluated after careful study by a foster home worker, through group discussion and consideration by the foster home staff, the superintendent and resident case worker at the Home for Dependent Children, and the Chief of the Division of Child Welfare. Placements in different types of foster homes are made in an effort to give children the benefit of family life according to plans that best fit their needs. Adpptive homes lend themselves to the needs of normal children who are able to adjust permanently to a new family group. Free permanent homes have been used to meet the needs of some older children but have become less fre - quently available since the years of depression and drouth. Board - ing homeß lend themselves to many uses, such as a temporary period of observation before permanent plans are made or a period of post-institutional care, and especial care for children who have behavior problems. Wage homes are utilized for state wards who are making a vocational adjustment and will be under supervision until they are 21 years old. In employment-school homes, older children have opportunities to share in family life while they are learning to assume the responsibilities of employment. There has been increasing evidence of the need for boarding home care in Nebraska. Toward the end of the last fiscal year it was observed that a number of children who had been placed in boarding homes would have to be returned to the institution un - less a larger appropriation was made for their care in foster homes. Since the institution was crowded during the entire year and many requests to admit children could not be granted, this would have created a serious situation. Hopeful progress which many of these children had begun to make in family homes would have been jeopardized. The 1941 Legislature recognized the value of caring for children as individuals and made an increased appropria - tion for the 1941-1943 bfennium. Although this increase will sot make it possible to extend the boarding home care program to in - clude all the children in need of such care, it will permit the con - tinuance of the program as it had been developed by June 30, 1941. b. Delinquent Children—Probation and Parole Direct administrative responsibility for planning for place - ment and supervision of boys and girls ion parole from the State Industrial School and the Girls' Training School has been delegated by the Board of Control to the county child welfare boards, to be administered by their agents in cooperation with the: Division, which acts as a liaison agency between the county child welfare boards and the superintendents of the boys' and girls' training schools. The supervisor of juvenile probation and parole evaluates Social studies of children committed to the training schools, •which are prepared by the county welfare offices. Progress reports from the training schools are forwarded to the county offices by the su - pervisor of juvenile probation and parole in order that the county 113 </seg>
         <seg id="p120">and the family of the child may he kept informed as to his adjust - ment at the school and be prepared for the time when the child is to return to the community on parole. Upon referral for parole by the training school, the supervisor of juvenile probation and parole cooperates with the county in preparing suitable plans for release. The supervisor works with out-of-state agencies in plan - ning for tV\e parole of non-resident children committed in Nebraska, and with federal probation officers in the cases of federal charges who are assigned to the state training schools. A case committee, comprised of a member of the Board of Control, the superintendent of the training school, and the chief of the Division, passes upon proposed plans for the parole of children from the training schools and is responsible for decisions relating to the final discharge of the child from parole when a satisfactory adjustment has been made. During the period a child is adjusting on parole, the super - visor offers the services of the Division to the county welfare offices which are supervising the children on parole from the train - ing schools.

Some of the chil - dren returned to the training schools were returned for the pur - pose of making revisions in their parole plans because their place - ments had not proved satisfactory for their adjustments to the community. As soon as more desirable plans for their release were completed, the children were again placed and many of them were later discharged from parole. Other children returned to the train - ing schools were removed from the community because of parole violations. Some of these children, after an additional period in the school, made progress in later placements. The present program relating to the supervision of children released from the training schools on parole can continue to pro - vide increasingly effective service in guidance to parolees through - out the state. The Division has received excellent cooperation from the county directors and staffs and other county officials. The super - intendents of the State Industrial School and the Girls' Training School have worked closely wiith the Division in developing a more 114 </seg>
         <seg id="p121">constructive parole program for the rehabilitation of delinquent children.

Unmarried[Mothers and Children Born Out ot Wedlock The Division is vitally concerned with safeguarding the wel - fare of unmarried mothers and children born out of wedlock. The Nebraska Statutes- (1) delegating responsibility to the county child welfare boards for providing for the child born out of wedlock and for his mother as for any other person in need of financial assist - ance and care, (2) requiring the maternity homes and hospitals in the state to report to the Division every unmarried mother who enters a maternity home, and (3) establishing facilities for care for unmarried mothers through the Nebraska Industrial Home (Mil - ford Maternity Home), provide a setting for the conduct of the present program-of the Division. The supervisor of special services is responsible for coordinat - ing the work of the county offices, the private maternity homes and '. hospitals and the Nebraska Industrial Home in order that the med - ical, social, and financial resources of the counties may be used to further the best interests of the unmarried mother and her child. Activities of the Division which relate to this program may be enumerated as follows: : . , . . (1) Consultation service to county directors and other officials on all matters relating to the care of the unmarried mother and her child; suggestions as to use of resources within the state for the medical care of the mother; (2) Planning with mothers in the Nebraska Industrial Home for the care of their children. If a mother is able to give proper 115 </seg>
         <seg id="p122">care to her child through her own resources or those of rel - atives or with the help of local public or private agencies, she is encouraged to do so. (3) In the event the mother wishes to relinquish her child, the Divi - sion assists in preparing the necessary forms, arranging court commitment of the child to the State Home for Dependent Children, or referring the mother to private child-caring agencies. Table VIII shows the extent of the Division's activities in work with unmarried mothers. There were 317 referrals of unmarried . mothers from private hospitals and maternity homes, 66 from the Nebraska Industrial Home, giving a total of 383 mothers who were in need of medical and social treatment for themselves and for their children born out of wedlock. An average of 32 referrals per month was received by the Division during the past year which was an in - crease of an average of 4 per month over the previous fiscal year. d. Children with Physical Handicaps The Division is concerned with children who are handicapped in their social or vocational adjustments because of a physical dis - ability. The statutes provide that information from school census records regarding blind, deaf, and crippled children be furnished the Division of Child Welfare.3 Inquiry is made of the county de - partments concerning children so reported to learn more about them. Often the county department, in cooperation with the Division, can help define the child's handicaps and potentialities so that a plan may be made for him. Each year a number of physically handi - capped children are referred to the State Department of Vocational Rehabilitation for consideration in planning a training program. c. The Mentally Handicapped Child The Division acts as the liaison agency between the county child ¦welfare boards and their agents and the Institution for Feeble Minded at Beatrice. The case situations of all children who are committed to the Institution for Feeble Minded are reviewed by the Division and admittance of the child to the Institution is subject to approval by a case committee, comprised of a member of the Board of Control, the Institution Superintendent, and the Chief of the Division. This procedure prevents the admission of children whose mental condition has been improperly diagnosed and those whose needs for supervision and care can best be met in their own home or community. The diagnostic and consultation services at the State Orthopedic Hospital and the psychological services of the University of Nebraska are resources which are used by the Divi - sion in the study and planning for treatment of children who are committed to the Institution for Feeble Minded. At the beginning of the fiscal year there was a waiting list of more than one hundred children who had been found eligible for admittance to the institution. Shortly thereafter the opening of a •Compiled Statute* of Nebraska. 1029: 79-1010. 116 </seg>
         <seg id="p123">new building made accommodations available and those on the wait - ing list were admitted. Currently it is possible to plan for the ad - mittance of children committed to the Institution for Feeble Minded without the long delay which was necessary before accommodations were improved. : ': : . . f. County Child Welfare Service Program Under the provision made by. the Social Security Act, Title V, Part 3, federal funds for child welfare services became available to the states in 1936. These funds have enabled the state public welfare agencies to establish, extend, and strengthen—especially in rural areas—child welfare services for the protection and care of homeless, dependent, neglected, delinquent and handicapped children. The Social Security Act specifies two major activities for which al - lotments of federal money may be expended: (1) for paying part of the cost of local services in areas predominantly rural, and (2) for developing state services for the encouragement and assistance of adequate methods of community child welfare organization throughout the state. Nebraska began participating in the program in 1936 and has used the funds within the above areas for stimula - ting and coordinating developments of needed services for children 'within the existing programs of the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare and the county welfare agencies. During the fiscal year 1939-1940 there was an increase in the number of counties requesting that the services, of especially trained child welfare workers be made available for children in their com - munities. The fiscal year 1946-1941 saw a continued increase in this direction. On July 1, 1940, six counties—Gage, Lincoln, Madi - son, Pawnee, Platte, and Seward—were being served by chHd wel - fare workers, and requests for services had been made by four other counties. On June 30, 1941, ten counties—Brown, Cass, Gage, Lin - coln, Madison, Morrill, Otoe, Pawnee, Platte, and Seward—had child welfare workers. Requests for a worker had been made by several other counties. The increasing numbers of requests from counties for child welfare workers, and the increased financial participation on the part of a number of the county child welfare boards are indications of the value and acceptance of the Child Welfare Service program. . : \ Over a period of two and one-half years, two adjoining counties had the services of one worker between them. The number of re - ferrals continued to increase. The worker was not able to accept them all and both counties decided that they wanted a full-time worker. Since early in the fiscal year both of these counties have had full-time workers. Referrals have continued at a rate which has kept both workers hard at work and plans have already been made in the one county to limit the number of referrals accepted by the child welfare worker. A similar limitation oh the number of referrals accepted by the child welfare -worker has been necessary in some of the other county units. ' Such limitation is necessary 117 </seg>
         <seg id="p124">in order that a worker may give sufficient time to the cases he does carry to accomplish the maximum results. A fairly static rate of referrals in other units seems to indicate that unless social or econ - omic conditions change decidedly, one full-time worker can give the needed service to important child welfare problems. In one instance, after a full-time child welfare worker met some of the urgent child welfare problems, there were not enough additional re - quests for service to require the time of a full-time worker so the unit was suspended. TABLE IX—WHEREABOUTS OF CHILDREN UNDER SUPERVISION OF CHILD WELFARE SERVICE WORKERS, JUNE 30, 1941 Number .of Children Total 756 In home of parents 588 In homes of relatives 66 In foster homes 48 Free home 13 Boarding home 16 Work or wage home 20 In Institutions 43 Home for Dependent Children 6 State Industrial School 19 Girls' Training School 14 Nebraska Industrial Home 3 Institution for Feeble Minded 1 CCC 3 Hospitals 2 Other 6 At the close of the fiscal year county child welfare service workers had 756 children in 374 families under their supervision. Table IX shows the location of these children on June 30, 1941. It will be noted that 588 of the 756. children, or 77 per cent were in their own homes, and 66 or 8.7 per cent were in relatives' homes. Only 48 or 6.3 per cent were in foster homes and less than a third of those (fifteen) were in boarding homes. It is fitting that the largest group of children under supervision be in their own homes. However, many instances have arisen in which child welfare service workers have realized that placement in a foster home—where board could be paid—would have given the child a needed chance to grow into a good citizen. Conditions in the child's own home were most unfavorable and no free foster homes or homes where the child could work for his room and board were available or suitable. During the year in county child welfare service units, requests for service were made on behalf of 1,060 children in 576 families. The sources of these requests are shown in Table X. , In addition to using these funds for the development of child welfare programs within the counties, the Division has paid a por - tion of the salary and travel expense of the field supervisors of the 118 </seg>

' . The Division has assisted the two heavily populated counties, Douglas and Lancaster, to meet more adequately services to children within their boundaries. Some of the Division's funds have been budgeted to permit' Douglas and Lancaster counties to have addi - :. "¦ tional child welfare service because the case loads of delinquent boys and girls from the state training schools, unmarried mothers, and other child welfare problems have been too large for the staffs of of the county to handle without assistance. The responsibility of the personnel made available to Douglas and Lancaster counties included, in addition to case work activities, the participation in staff development of the personnel in the county office, the develop - ment ot resources in the community to meet present needs of -the disadvantaged child, and interpretation of the county child wel - fare activities to the citizens of the community. ; . ¦g.

Examinations were given to 475 individuals. i. Training Program With an increasing number of requests coming from counties for trained child welfare workers and an extremely limited number of qualified workers available for employment, the Department of Assistance and Child Welfare recognized that some arrangements were needed to train individuals for this field. A classification plan for child welfare workers-in-training was established under the Nebraska Merit System of Personnel Selection. During the fiscal year five such workers were employed by the Division and paid a nominal salary from federal funds for child welfare services. Each worker enrolled in the Graduate School of Social Work at the University of Nebraska and carried a minimum of ten semes - ter hours' work each semester and six hours' work during the summer school session. This training enabled these individuals to qualify for the position Child Welfare Worker I and equivalent classifications under the Nebraska Merit System. While in atten - dance at the Graduate School, the child welfare workers-in-train - ing worked part time on family and child welfare cases in the Lancaster County Assistance Office. Following completion of the ten months' training period, these individuals were to accept such reasonable opportunities for employment in the state public wel - fare program as might be offered. 122 </seg>

The Index The Nebraska Index grew from the master file in 1936 serving only the Child Welfare Bureau to a state-wide Index in 1939 serv - ingl as a state central exchange on children's cases for all public ' child-caring institutions and all licensed private child-caring in - stitutions and agencies in the state.

The Nebraska In - dex cooperates with the private social service exchanges in Douglas and Lancaster counties to avoid duplication of work. 5. SERVICE TO STATE CHILDREN'S INSTITUTIONS The Division, by administrative direction of the Board of Control, has responsibility for the supervision of the social services for the state children's institutions. This involves joint planning with the superin - tendents of the state children's institutions for all children committed to their care. This action was taken in an effort to carry out the intent cf the legislature when it abolished the former Child Welfare Bureau in. 1937 and assigned its work to the Board of Control to effect a better integration of the state's services for chidren. The children's institutions with which the Division is working are as follows: Correctional: State Industrial School, Kearney Girls' Training School, Geneva Dependent: State Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln. Physically Handicapped: Orthopedic Hospital,4 Lincoln. Educational: School for the Deaf, Omaha. School for the Blind, Nebraska City. Mentally Defective: Institution for Feeble Minded, 5 Beatrice. Maternity Care: Nebraska Industrial Home," Milford. Before a child is admitted to any institution, other than the correc - tional schools, a complete social study is made by the county of the child's residence, and admittance of the child to the institution is granted on the basis of the findings. In this manner the cHildren most in need of the services offered by the particular institution may, on a selective basis, receive these services. As a result of this intake policy other plans are frequently made, in cooperation with county officials, for children who will benefit from care in their own community. For all children admitted to institutions the social study is used as a basis for planning for that child within the institution. The facilities -' '«[¦ 'The program of this institution has been integrated with Services for Crippled Children.

         <seg id="p131">.of the Division are used in planning for the child after he is admitted, and his release from the institution is worked out through joint plan - ning with the superintendent of the institution, the Division, and the local agency in the county to which the child is being returned. The present organization for institutional social services places the major responsibility for child welfare case work within the in - stitution on the personnel of that institution, and outside of the in - stitution on the local welfare agencies. The Division is primarily con - cerned with the development of adequate standards of care, an effective procedure for relating the state and local services toward the rehabilita - tion of children, and the establishment of satisfactory working relation - ships among all persons interested in a child who has need for the edu - cational, vocational, and social training which the state children's in - stitutions provide. 125 </seg>
         <seg id="p132">Services for Crippled Children The program of Services for Crippled Children during the fiscal year 1940-41 has been marked by continued progress in improving the facilities for the care of physically handicapped children in Nebraska. The decrease in the number of children served which has been ex - pected each year since the service was instituted has failed to material - ize. As in any service program, the need which appears seems to be directly proportional to the facilities set up to meet it. Hence the Orthopedic Hospital and the Services for Crippled Children, acting as an integrated program, have operated at full capacity, without any idle facilities. At the same time the waiting list has been held to a minimum and it is felt that most of the need is being met. It is quite possible that an expansion of facilities would reveal an additional need, but from available information it would appear that the future problem will be one of giving more complete service to a group of children which will remain rather constant in number. It should be recognized, of course, that the narrow administrative definition under which the ser - vice is operating includes only a portion of the total number of phys - ically handicapped children in the state. If more funds become avail - able and the administrative policy changes, the expansion of services would then be in the direction of accepting other categories of crippled children which are included in our statutory definition, but which are not now being accepted because of administrative and financial limita - tions. HOSPITAL CARE Since all children except those suffering from hare-lip and cleft palate are hospitalized at the State Orthopedic Hospital, the report of that institution, to be found elsewhere* will contain the data on hos - pitalization. This material will not be repeated here. The total num - ber of children given hospital care (Table I) was 1089, of which 1000 were in the Orthopedic Hospital, the remainder being plastic surgery cases which were in Immanuel Hospital, Omaha. No other hospitals were used during the year, it being the policy of the Board of Control to utilize the facilities of the Orthopedic Hospital to complete capacity before purchasing hospitalization elsewhere. The average hospital stay, not shown in the table, was about thirty days. This may be contrasted with the average period of hospitalization in 1936 of about ninety days. The decreased stay and the corresponding increase in number of chil - dren served has been accomplished without any increase in hospital capacity or facilities and suggests that the time has come to re-adjust these facilities of the hospital to the enormously increased patient load. In addition to the cases treated in the hospital, 3714 visits were made to the hospital out-patient clinics. •Biennial report of Board of Control, 1939 126 </seg>
         <seg id="p133">CONVALESCENT HOMES In the beginning of the program the sudden increase in hospitalized cases was accomplished by the extensive use of convalescent homes, which allowed children to be discharged from the hospital much earlier than before but kept them in the vicinity of the hospital so that their after-care could be carried out. With the development of better after - care services through the extension clinics, the public health nursing consultant, and the more effective use of local facilities, it has been possible to reduce the convalescent home program. During the fiscal year 1940-41 there were 356 children cared for in these homes. (Table I) It is hoped that this number will remain constant or will reduce somewhat. . .. ; EXTENSION CLINICS The extension clinic program was expanded and improved. Twenty clinics were held at eleven different points throughout the state. A total of 1281 children were seen. (Table II) This is in addition to the regu - larly established clinic at the Douglas County Hospital, where 338 were seen. The clinic program has been of material assistance in many way 3. Many crippled children have been discovered, diagnosed and put under treatment who would not otherwise have, been found; the counties have .been saved a large sum.in transportation; local physicians and welfare workers have received invaluable;instruction in the problem of the crippled child. An important result of the climes has been that the entire community has been made more aware of the crippled child and the facilities available for meeting the problem. The service rendered by these clinics has been greatly improved by the addition of pediatric, physiotherapy and social service. It is hoped that this program may by further improved and expanded. CASE FINDING i . . :V;:: ;.." i/.¦¦: .' ~: . -V" &#132; . ¦ Besides the program of extension clinics, all other available means have been used to discover new cases. The school census, reports of school examinations, reports on birth certificates, etc., have been used. The work of cooperating private agencies, such as the Nebraska Elks Association, the Nebraska Crippled Children's Society, and the Folio - myelitis Committees, American Legion and other organizations has add - ed to the efforts of official agencies. The state register, though still not complete, contains the names of 2962 children, (Table III), of whom 1305 were under active care. (Table IV) The remainder were not in need of active treatment or were being cared for privately. 127 </seg>

         <seg id="p137">The Handicapped Child Because of the work done for crippled children in Nebraska by the Nebraska Elks Association, we feel that it is fitting that the part this organization played in the Crippled Children's Program be given rec - ognition in this annual report of the Department of Assistance and Child* Welfare. A request was accordingly made of Mr. August Schnei - der, Chairman of the Benevolence Commission of the Nebraska Elks Association, to give a history of the crippled children's activities in or - der that a permanent record might be available from a source familiar with the work from its inception. The following narrative represents Mr. Schneider's response to this request: Quite some years back, in the month of May, 1912, the various Elks lodges of Nebraska sent delegates to Lincoln who organized the Nebras - ka State Elks Association with C. A. McCloud of York its first President. After this they met in annual convention and in different lodge centers. For some years, conventions of the usual type were held—a getting to - gether, a series of entertainments winding up with.the passing of cer - tain sets of resolutions for the good of the Order. In due time, it became evident to many of the members that more than that was needed to hold the interest of the membership and that some, worthwhile program should be undertaken. In the year 1925, at. annual convention at Fremont, Dan Butler of Omaha, President, stressed the. necessity of this and after'some discussion appointed a committee consisting of C. A. McCloud of York, Frank Real of McCook, and James Keefe of North Platte to consider and recommend some program for consideration'and adoption by the convention. This committee recommended that the incoming administration study and formulate plans during the current year and recommend a specific program for consideration and adoption to the next conven - tion. During the current and following years, the President and Secre - tary of the Association, after communicating with some fifteen state associations in reference to various programs in operation, formulated and proposed a program similar to one now in operation. The conven - tion at Falls City the following year accepted the report and recom - mendations in full and appointed a committee to organize and carry it on. ¦ : ...'• ' ' ¦;¦: ;'" ¦ '. . &#132;,¦&lt;.-' The next convention at Grand Island, in June 1927, found that the committee had not functioned. After some discussion, C. A. McCloud of York presented a motion that the committee appointed the previous year be discharged and a new one be selected. This motion was unani - mously carried and the following committee was appointed: Gould Dietz of Omaha, Harry, Sidles of Lincoln, Dr. C. P. Fall of Beatrice, Frank Real of McCook, G. W. Mathewson of Kearney, Howard Loomis of Fremont, and August. Schneider of York, Chairman. ¦ Of this original committee Gould Dietz of Omaha, Howard Loomis of Fremont, and August Schneider of York have served continuously. Harry Sidles of Lincoln passed on; Dr. Fall of Beatrice and Frank 131 </seg>
         <seg id="p138">Real of McCook, after some years of service, asked to be relieved on account of advanced age, and G. W. Mathewson of Kearney moved to another state. Since its organization, the committee was increased to nine members serving as of June Ist, 1941 with the original three, and George Stevens of Scottsbluff, A. C. Bintz of Lincoln, Ed F. Peter - son of McCook, E. C. Mudge of Beatrice, Walter Hampton of Chadron, and James Moslander of Grand Island. Immediately after these selections, in 1927 another motion was made by C. A. McCloud of York with the statement that any organiza - tion or industry in order to succeed should have a paid up capital stock and as the first step the above-named committee was instructed to raise a foundation fund of $10,000. This motion also prevailed unanimously and it is our belief that this motion and the raising of the fund saved the program at a critical period a few years later, in 1933, the year the de - pression struck with full force. The annual meeting at Columbus in June of that year found our committee in debt in the amount of $3, - -----375.00. Some members of the Convention sincerely believed that the program should be suspended for the time being and until a return to better conditions. Others contended that when once suspended it would never again be taken up, that it was too valuable a program to be sus - pended, and insisted on its continuance. After considerable discussion, it was decided that the program should be continued and a special com - mittee appointed to solicit the membership for funds to carry on dur - ing the current year. As a result, the committee did a splendid job and succeeded in raising enough funds to pay off all indebtedness and also enough to carry on the program for the year. We might state that only a worthy cause could obtain such results at such a time. This committee proceeded to organize and to raise the necessary fund during the next two years and succeeded in raising approximately 89,000. This amount was invested in first-class securities with the provision that the net earnings, and in an emergency the principal, were to be used for the benefit of the crippled children of the State. Up to June 1941, this principal has not been touched and now amounts, in accordance with the Treasurer's statement, to $14,675.18. We also have our working fund and a separate balance to carry on this current year with moneys subscribed during the current year for the next, show - ing quite a healthy condition. During the latter part of 1929, after a meeting at Omaha of our committee attended by Joseph G. Buch of New Jersey, a national leader in crippled children work who explained the New Jersey plan thorough - ly, the plan of helping crippled children to help themselves, on Sunday, September 22nd, the 1929 committee, trustees and officers, met in Lin - coln, Nebraska to formulate and adopt a constructive and workable program. After a general and wide discussion, a representative of the State Department Rehabilitation and Vocational Division being present offered their services and cooperation, which were accepted by the committee in behalf of the State Elks Association. This cooperative arrangement lasted for a period of five and a half years until the pass- 132 </seg>
         <seg id="p139">age of the Federal Social Security Act in June 1935. During this period n most harmonious relation continued resulting in material benefit to the program and those needing it, the handicapped children of our State. After further discussion and consideration, it was decided to adopt a plan similar to New Jersey's and the committee was instructed to pro - ceed. First, the committee secured office space in the State House granted by Governor Weaver. Then they employed the services of a competent secretary to take a survey of the State to ascertain as far as possible the number and types of crippling conditions of the handicapped children, their ages, etc. A four months period survey showed a list of approximately 1,250 such cases and the committee estimated from this that there were about 3,000 cases in the State of various crippl - ing conditions, , At this time, the committee decided to make a detailed survey of one lodge jurisdiction and selected Beatrice, Nebraska. This was fol - lowed by a diagnostic clinic on June 5, 1930 under the direction of Dr. C. P. Fall and the Gage County Medical Society sponsored jointly by the State Rehabilitation Department and'the Elks State Association com - mittee. It was attended by 33 patients and was the first of a series of clinics to be held. It was pronounced a complete success from, every angle by all those attending and taking part, and the general results were most gratifying to our committee as well as the State Rehabilita - tion Department. .; This clinic was followed by 16 others in 11 different lodge centers during the five and a half year period ending June 1935. All the clinics were under the direction of district medical societies and were attend - ed by orthopedic and neurological specialists assisted by local' doctors, dentists, and nurses, Elks as well as members of other organizations. All services were donated. . . ;'..'¦ At these 17 clinics, 1,376 patients were examined and given specific recommendations for follow-up treatment. Out of the 1,376 cases ex - amined we have a record as of June 1935 of over 800 letters received from parents and guardians showing over 600 having followed clinical recommendations in full or in part and showing 92% materially helped, with many complete cures and restorations. . These reports further indicated that while from 38 to 40% would require aid to carry out clinical recommendations, 60 to 62% did not require aid to do so, showing the important fact that many when shown the way by specialists in attendance at these clinics, would follow in - structions and recommendations at their own expense. This -was a very beneficial feature of the program. Since this time, more have been found requiring aid to carry out recommendations. This is caused by continued crop failures and prevailing conditions. After taking a detailed survey of several more lodge centers, it was estimated that there were at least 5,000 handicapped children be - tween birth and 21 years of age. Later this was found to be approx - imately correct. : At all the foregoing clinics, our organization had the help of many 133 </seg>
         <seg id="p140">and without remuneration, only the knowledge of a good deed well done. Nine orthopedic surgeons and neurologists have contributed 38 full days of their time and have traveled an average of 1,342 miles each at their own expense to help make these clinics a success. At one clinic, namely Scotts Bluff, two Omaha specialists, in order to make the appointment at 8 A. M., hired a plane at their own expense and ar - rived at 7:30 A. M. Five hundred ninety-eight physicians, surgeons, and dentists have contributed many hours of their time to this work. Three hundred eighty-four registered and student nurses have as - sisted with a full day of their time. One thousand two hundred ninety-three members of lay committees and women of the Does and other organizations have rendered inval- ¦ uable assistance at the clinics. Three hundred sixty-five newspapers have carried several stories each announcing clinics and describing activities. Patients from 83 counties in the State have attended and received services. As to the value of this free and very generous service, let those that have received the benefit, the crippled children, be the judge. During the summer of 1935 came the enactment of the Federal. Social Security Law, including a program for the benefit of crippled children and creating a State Bureau for Crippled Children, thus ter - minating our working arrangement the State Rehabilitation Depart - ment and the first phase or pioneer period of the Elks program. The Second and Present Phase of the Program As the next step and in preparation for a future program Elks employed a part-time clerical worker in the rehabilitation office to check up all the records of the program from the beginning so as to transfer them from this office to the State Welfare where they are now housed. Following is a letter from the Child Welfare Director at that time, Mrs. Maud Nuquist: "Please convey to your committee and trustees the most profound appreciation of the officials of the Child Welfare Bureau for the six year pioneer program the Elks have conducted in cooperation with the Rehabilitation Division and turning over to the Bureau the fine.set of records and information that were compiled and acquired during that period. "The program has contributed more than will ever be known to the establishment of the present new and permanent program for the ex - pansion of Nebraska's facilities for the caring of her crippled children. The records are now housed in steel filing cabinets and will, of course, be accessible to the officials of the State Elks Association and their crippled children committee at all times. "Since the relationship between the State Elks Association and the County Medical Societies is so firmly established, it is my desire that this phase of the crippled children's activities be continued as in the past. Obviously, the details of the cooperative set-up will not he exact- 134 </seg>
         <seg id="p141">ly the same as they were when the work was directed by the Rehabilita - tion Division, but the sound principles evolved during the previous six year program will be observed. : ' "I also wish to express my appreciation and the appreciation of Governor R. L. Cochran for the Elks' invaluable service in'making clerical assistance available which helped bridge the period between the time that the Rehabilitation Division necessarily discontinued its finan - cial participation and the time when actual funds for cooperation could be made available to the child welfare bureau. This action materially expedited the organization of the new plan and greatly assisted the Child Welfare Bureau in the preparation of its preliminary budget and plan for approval of the Washington administration, so Federal funds might be made available for the crippled children work in our State. I feel that this is the beginning of a cooperative working program that will be perpetual in function and ever making progress toward the goal that no crippled child in Nebraska whose condition in life can be improved will go without necessary care and attention." (Stoned) Maud Nuquist, Director " The sentiment and hope expressed in the last lines of the above paragraph were a vision we believe soon to come true under the fine program as carried on by our State Welfare Division for Crippled Children under its present director, Harry Becker, the Elks carrying out their part of the agreement. . We also quote from a letter of Dr. C. A. Fulmer, Director of the Department of Vocational Education: "Your appreciation of the very cordial cooperation between the Elks and this Department during the years we have jointly carried a crippled children's program is shared by us. Much good has been done and without question Nebraska is several jumps ahead of almost every other state. Will you please express to the members of your committee and other Elks our feeling in the matter." (Signed) C. A. Fulmer, Director Vocational Education In the early part of 1936, the Social Security Act became a law and went into operation, creating a State Advisory Committee appointed by the Governor, one of whom was the Chairman of the ElksJ crippled children's committee and who for the last two years has been Chairman of said Advisory Committee. ' : ' :¦', : I The first meeting, of this committee was held 'early in March at Lincoln, Nebraska with Herbert Cashing, Department of State Superin - tendent as Chairman. . General plans for Nebraska were proposed and discussed. Following is an excerpt from the preliminary statement of the program: . -;&gt; "Program will be built on the foundation that has beer laid by joint participation in a crippled children's program by the St»te Crip - pled Children's Committee of the Elks and the State Vocational Divi - sion, Orthopedic Surgeons, and County Medical Societies." 135 </seg>
         <seg id="p142">At a second meeting in Lincoln, a sub committee of three were ap - pointed to contact other fraternal and lay organizations to ascertain what part their respective organizations wished to undertake in the program, this committee to report at a later meeting. For and in behalf of the Elks part in the program, its Chairman of the Crippled Children's Committee asked for and proposed the fol - lowing: "In view of the fact that for five and a half years the Elks State Association has carried on a cooperative program with our State Re - habilitation Department, and during that period has had fine coopera - tion with the medical fraternity of our State, nurses' organizations, many fraternal and lay organizations and our membership reaching out into all parts of the State, and during this period have conducted success - fully 17 clinics in 11 centers and examined 1,376 handicapped children and up to this time, April 1, 1936, have record of over 900 cases having followed clinical recommendations and over 700 having received material benefits with many completely rehabilitated, and our relationship with the medical fraternity quite firmly established, we therefore would wish and ask for our major part of the program the holding of clinics in cooperation with our State Welfare Bureau Crippled Children's Di - vision, and we propose further to use our committee and organization in follow-up work as far as our funds will permit." At a meeting of the General Committee at Omaha, the first part of May 1936, the Committee recommended that the foregoing part be assigned as asked for by the State Elks Association and ratified by committee of the whole. Other lay and fraternal organizations contacted were assigned to do certain work. Just to what extent this has been done the writer of these notes is unable to tell, but all have cooperated to a certain ex - tent. In fact, all agencies have been cooperative and helpful to the Elks in their part of the work. The State program was organized along the foregoing provisions and arrangements under the direction of the State Welfare Director, Mrs. Maud Nuquist, for about one year when she was 'appointed a member of the State Board of Control and was succeeded by Harry J. Becker as Director of Child WelfaTe under the supervision of the State Assistance Director and Board of Control. The result is a pro - gram to aid the handicapped children which is second to none, and this we believe undisputed. Under the present program eight more Elks Diagnostic Clinics have been held with the cooperation of the State Welfare Bureau, making 25 in all, with 2,045 patients examined. These were followed up by a series of extension and check-up clinics under the direction of the State Welfare Bureau, the Elks cooperating. Up to June 1, 1941, 26 of these have been held in various parts of the State with 1,670 patients at - tending. This type of clinic is for the benefit of patients having had services at the Orthopedic Hospital and are sent to their homes to make room for others. From time to time these need a check-up. It 136 </seg>
         <seg id="p143">was found part of the Hospital staff can go to various centers at stated periods at much less expense than these patients could be brought back to the Hospital, thereby saving time and trouble for the parents of patients, and greatly improving the service. New patients are admitted to clinics on proper referral from their local physician and County As - sistance Director. Nearly all extension clinics are held in the -western and northern part of the State at great distance from the Hospital facilities. Patients living in closer are brought to the Hospital for such check-up services as may be needed. . . . Thus, the second phase of the program has now been in existence approximately five years and we believe the goal and hope expressed by Mrs. Nuquist, first Director of the Child Welfare Bureau, that no child in Nebraska whose condition in life can be improved will be de - nied the opportunity, is near. ¦'.'•'.••.¦¦¦•¦ : The writer of these notes having had close connection and contact with the program since its inception and growth can and does say without fear of contradiction that those responsible for the State end of the program, the Board of Control, State Assistance Director, Di - rector of the State Crippled Children Division and the staff in general, have put forth at all times their conscientious and best efforts to pro - mote and build up the program, and how well they have succeeded it is useless for us to say but we will also leave that to those who have bene - fitted, the crippled children. . ' : Mistakes have been made but they were only errors in judgment and could only be avoided by doing, nothing. Those, in charge welcome constructive criticism and also welcome suggestions for the betterment of the program which we can assure everyone will at all times be appreci - ated and given consideration. . : ; ¦'¦'.' We would like to call attention to another feature of this program, the employment of the handicapped and vocationally trained worker. From time to time persons: having had services through this program who are fully or partly rehabilitated by being vocationally trained for certain types of work and are ready and anxious for. employment, in some cases it has been found do not have an equal chance. Here is where many of us can be of service and help. Many persons can be placed in the type of work they are trained for and one may rest as - sured they will not disappoint for it has been conclusively shown that they give their all to satisfy. Where these persons have been tried, it has been -shown that they have an average from 5 to 7%% higher in service than those physically normal. A certain large industrial plant of our country has practiced the policy of having its employees represent a cross-section of the com - munity where the plant is located. A medical survey two years ago showed that out of approximately 100,000 employees there were about 100 minus a leg or an arm, over 20 totally blind, about 200 blind in one eye, over 100 having epilepsy, 50 infantile paralysis victims, over 60 ; mates, and thousands of -workers having various less obvious physical defects. ¦¦. •" :. y:':: - -;'¦..'¦ : :" ;-..:- \ '¦.¦¦¦-¦' l ¦ 137 </seg>
         <seg id="p144">Statistics show that the handicapped worker is absent by reason of sickness about 1095- less than his physically normal co-worker. In the above plant as well as others it appears that the output of the handi - capped worked properly fitted to his job is somewhat better than that of other workers on the same task. When one stops to consider, thi3 seems logical and natural. The handicapped person does not wander around the office or plant as much as others; likely he has not been out half the night before and makes a greater effort to do his job right, and when given the chance he has almost universally made good, and certainly it is an act of fine citizenship when you are instrumental in aiding one so handicapped and only carrying out the great fundamen - tal and American principle, do unto them what you would have them do unto you. The redemption of and rehabilitating of the handicapped is a great and endless field, an activity giving opportunity for all to help, an op - portunity to assist in transferring helpless cripples from being a bur - den on their parents or the State, into being community assets by mak - ing them self-supporting and independent. What better act of citizen - ship could one perform? This today is needed more than ever in the history of our country. We believe this gives a fair and adequate story of the program thus far. Perhaps much more could be said but the results ¦would be the same. We have refrained from using the names of but a few per - sons and this is necessary at the beginning in order to lay the proper foundation for the story. There are many whom we would like to have mentioned for outstanding services rendered but who would rather that this not be done, wishing to go along in their quiet way doing their part as they see it. On one occasion we offered our thanks to one who had helped often and well, and he said: "Just forget it; this is my religion." What a religion! This is the spirit of voluntary service the State can - not furnish, the personal contact and sympathetic touch so necessary and effective in the care of crippled children. Naturally the Elks are proud of their part in the pioneering of this program in our state and their further part in its continuance. Credit for what has been done is due to the fine support of the membership. At no time has a single request of the Committee been questioned, let alone refused. In other words, the program has its unanimous, support and approval and as has been said, there is little in life except the sat - isfaction that comes from the good deeds one is able to do. It has also been said the State program can be no better than the interested citizens of the State wish it to be. "The watchfullness of the citizens' attitude is considered the salvation of the state." Speaking for our organization it has been a genuine pleasure to have been associated in this humanitarian work with the officials of our State, the first five and a half years with Vocational Rehabilitation De - partment, the last five years with the Department of Child Welfare Crippled Children's Division, not only as members of our organization 138 </seg>
         <seg id="p145">but also as citizens of our beloved State and it is our hope this associa - tion may and will continue indefinitely. .:".••_¦ We believe we would be amiss did we not mention what we believe has been and is today the greatest and strongest force for good in this program, our mothers, -wives, and daughters. At every clinic held they have served here, there and everywhere. Who knows better than they the heartaches of a mother leading a helpless little one or carrying a twisted little body in her arms? And to them the writer wishes to dedicate this story.

Vandemoer, Director \ ¦ State Assistance Director Lincoln, Nebraska . • Dear Mr. Vandemoer: As per your request, herewith please find dates and places of the Elks Diagnostic Clinics. You will note the first two were both held at Beatrice. This first clinic was held on June 5,1930 and because of bad roads due to rains, a good many on side roads were unable to get in. After this first; clinic we decided we woulfi hold the second so as to get those we had listed to come in to the first clinic and finish up as far as possible in the one center. : .

We might state that during the first five and a half year period we had employed a worker on a 50-50 basis with the State Vocational Department who did the field work, organizing clinics and after the clinics the follow-up work, helping to arrange to go to the Hospital for recommended treatment, calling on patients and parents to encourage treatments recommended at the clinics. Believe this will cover matter asked for and trust satisfactory. Sincerely, (signed) Aug. Schneider 140 </seg>
         <seg id="p147">PART VII SURPLUS COMMODITY DISTRIBUTION During the fiscal year of July 1. 1940 to June 30, 1941, fifty-two counties participated in the direct distribution of surplus foods to gen - eral clients during the total twelve month period, and thirty-eight coun - ties participated four months of the year. Ninety counties participated in the distribution of clothing during the twelve month period and eighty - three counties in the school lunch program during the school year. Twenty-nine counties commmeneed operating under the Pood Stamp Plan of surplus removal during the year, and in each instance, this was accomplished the day following the discontinuance of direct dis - tribution to general clients in these same counties. Direct distribution to general clients was to'cease in the remaining counties of the state on July 15 and August 1, 1941, at which time the Food Stamp Plan would be put into operation immediately in those particular counties. Although thirty-eight counties operated under the stamp plan dur - ing all or a part of this fiscal year, the direct distribution statewide total in pounds, items and valuation was the largest since the program commenced in Nebraska. This was due primarily to the increased num - ber of surplus food items made available to the state by the Surplus Marketing Administration for general distribution and the School Lunch Program. • Increased emphasis was placed on the schoollunch programs, dem - onstration projects, recreational camps and training centers, to conform with the national effort toward improvement in health and its relation to National Defense. Information on the school lunch program was made available to an ever increasing number of interested organizations, groups, and indi - viduals throughout the state. Presentations were made in accordance with our plan of having this activity expand by reason of the merits of the program itself rather than through promotional activity. The re - sult is expected to be a firm foundation upon which a larger program may be built and indications are that participation in this activity will double during the coming school year. 141 </seg>

XIV. SUMMARY Plans were made during the fiscal year to place Nebraska on state - wide Food Stamp Plan basis, and this was accomplished in such a way that by July 1, 1941, direct distribution to general clients had ceased in most of the counties. During this fiscal year, the volume of surplus commodities issued in the state was considerably larger than any prior period in the direct distribution program with an estimated valuation of food and clothing of $2,348,158.89. The Surplus Marketing Administration purchased eleven hundred fifty-two carloads of foodstuffs within the state of Nebraska during the fiscal year for use in Nebraska and adjoining states, thereby benefiting both the producer and welfare client alike, an important part of the surplus removal program. Direct Distribution facilities will, until further notice, continue to be maintained in the counties to service the school lunch, clothing, and specialized programs. District food warehouses will be necessary under the new plan and are to be established at various points as needed. 146 </seg>
