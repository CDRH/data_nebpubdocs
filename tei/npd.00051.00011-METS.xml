CASES BEFORE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION In January and February, 1922, representatives of the Commission prepared and presented testimony, and generally assisted in the presenta - tion of the public side of questions presented in I. C. C. Docket No. 13293 — generally known as Reduced Rates, 1922 — as a result of which the In - terstate Commerce Commission ordered a ten per cent reduction in rates, effective July 1, 1922. The reductions resulting from the ten per cent cut amount to approximately $4,639,978.83 per annum on the freight traffic of this stat«.

            <seg id="p011">11 Cement Rates Under I. C. C. Docket No. 8182— Western Cement Rates— the Inter - state Commerce Commission conducted an investigation into rates on cement from all producing points west of Chicago to all stations in this state. . Testimony was presented and briefs were filed by the Commission, which largely influenced the favorable decision rendered last July, which will produce savings in freight charges conservatively estimated at $200, - 000 per annum. It seems unnecessary to enlarge on the importance of this commodity to the people of this state. Live Stock Rates In a proceeding known as I. C. C. Docket No. 13273, the Interstate Commerce Commission is making 1 an exhaustive inquiry as to the lawful - ness of rates on all classes of live stock from every station in Nebraska to Sioux City, Omaha, St. Joseph and Kansas City. In the hearings be - fore the Interstate Commerce Commission, Nebraska railroads contended that these live stock rates should be increased by amounts sufficient to produce $805,681 additional revenues per annum. Our rate department presented, exhaustive exhibits tending to show that the alleged discrim - inations between state and interstate commerce can be eliminated without increasing either state or interstate rates. This case is now pending- before the Interstate Commerce Commission id will be considered in connection with the general livestock case now ider consideration by this Commission, under Resolution No. 74. Colorado Coal Rates A representative of this Commission sat with Chairman Hall and ommissioners Esch and Eastman of the Interstate Commerce Commis- sion and two members of the Colorado Commission at a joint hearing and ugument in I. C. C. Docket No. 13293, held at Denver, July 31, August 1, 1 and 3, 1922. The decision in this case produced reductions in coal rates from mines in Routt County, Colorado, which will amount to approxi - mately $150,000 per annum. Coarse Grain Rates In a case before the Interstate Commerce Commission (I. C. C. Docket 129291 heard at Des Moines, Iowa, November 9, 1922, the rail - roads ask that rates on corn, oats, rye and barley be increased, up to the basis (if rates on wheat — which would cost our farmers nearly a million tlollars a year for additional freight charges. Representatives of the Ne - braska Commission produced testimony, actively participated in the hear - ing and have been largely responsible for a brief recently filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission urging that the differential on coarse arrain be retained. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 Grain Rates I In addition to the coarse grain case, I. C. C. Docket No. 12929, there also pending before the Interstate Commerce Commission a case (I. C. Docket No. 14393) in which we have joined other western states in king for a reduction Of at least ten per cent in all grain rates. By tes - timony and by participation in the conduct of hearings, this Commission has taken a prominent part in this proceeding which involves proposed re - ductions in freight charges amounting to about $1,000,000 a year for Ne - braska farmers.

ORDER OF DISMISSAL TAYLOR, Chairman:— The complaints herein have been pending in the files of the Com - mission for several years. The cases were heard, argued and submitted in 1915, and later an opinion and finding was prepared by the Commission but its issuance was finally withheld because of the injunction issued by the federal court restraining this Commission from interfering with the rates prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the Missouri River-Nebraska Case No. 3800. The rates involved in the in - junction were class rates, as were the oil rates affected by these com - plaints. It was determined, therefore, that this Commission was with - out jurisdiction to issue its order. The rate structure in Nebraska has been materially changed since 1915, due to government operation of the railroads during the war, and to subsequent orders issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission affecting all rates. Therefore, even though this Commission had author - ity to issue its order at this time, it would be necessary for a rehearing to bring the record up to date. The complaints will, therefore, be dis - missed without prejudice. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaints herein be and the same are hereby dismissed, without prejudice to further proceedings.

Bell, district commercial manager. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: tThe original complaint in this case was filed on March 7, 1918, but ; later withdrawn and an amended petition substituted. The com - int is made by Charles H. Feelhaver and eighteen other telephone scribers at Hampton. They complain as to: (2) The obstruction of streets and alleys by unnecessary pole and wires, thus interfering with street improvements and public travel; (31 Present poor and unreliable service due to the ba of repair of the two plants; (4) Absence of zone of service so defined as to be.-t serve the t needs of Hampton patrons (5) Existence of duplicate system kThe complainants pray for better .-ervice, free service to Aurora and adshaw and consolidation of two plants under such rules and regula - ns as the Commission may prescribe. The Hamilton county Farmers Telephone association answers by Tering to make a physical connection between the two exchanges by means of trunk lines, and avers further that it cannot dispose of its ex - mnge at Hampton because to do so would cripple and impair its Hamil - on county service. The Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph company enies that its service is exceedingly poor and unreliable but admits that is not perfect and says steps are being taken to improve its plant; that service would greatly improve if there were but one instead of two ystems in Hampton; that since it serves four times as many patrons t Hampton a? its competitor and since most of the latter's telephones re duplicates it would only be reasonable for the Hamilton county com - &gt;any to retire from the field after being properly compensated for the (1) The necessity cf renting duplicate telepl </seg>

A hearing on the issues as thus presented was had on May 17 and May 27. 1918. The situation as it existed in Hampton at that time was by the various witnesses, it devel oping that there \Y it a division in the community with reference to which pany should serve in that territory. Those west, north - hwest are hugely tributary to Aurora and prefer service county company, those north and east are more di- ectly tributary to Hampton and prefer telephone service from that are also desirous of an interchange with Bradshaw, the While the Hamilton county company has a switchboard Hamptor. it has less than fifty subscribers directly connected thereto, not own a building;. The general manager of the company that it&gt; property in the village of Hampton is not worth to ex - &gt;00. On the other hand the Lincoln company owns a central il the lot upon which it stands and serves approximately one seventy patrons. It is alleged that its property in and about I replacement value on April 30, lyi8, cf $11,530.50. The rgeil the inconvenience and excessive co.-t due to duplicate ulile rates. It was likewise urged by them, and ad- defendants, that the existence of duplicate plants resulted evelopment in Hampton and that so long as the pre_ent ituation exists that community cannot expect to have adequate telephone the hearing, the Lincoln company filed an amended -petition in which it alleged that the Hamilton county y was engaged in a campaign of solicitation of its ■■subscribers the construction of parallel lines on the highways, the final re- which would be to further duplicate the telephone facilities in itory, and that the district court in and for Hamilton county hail lary injunction restraining the said Hamilton county granted a ich interference; that long distance service was being pa furnished to the patrons of Hamilton county company by the said Lin - coln company and that such long distance service constituted one of the ivincipai elements of value of its service and that the said Hamilton ■ounty company was seeking by means of the service thus rendered to it to destroy the value of the property of the Lincoln company. In its prayer it asked that it be permitted to sever the toll connections between its system and the exchanges of the Hamilton county company and be released of the obligation of further furnishing such service; that the Commission prescribe a basis for consolidation of the two plants and require the Hamilton county company to sell to the Lincoln company. Being advised of the situation at Hampton, the Commission there - upon issued an order prohibiting the Hamilton county company from constructing telephone lines for the purpose of serving subscribers of </seg>
            <seg id="p112">112 ti Lincoln company and from furnishing service to such subscribers, (1 the Lincoln company was prohibited from furnishing individual telephone service to any of the existing local subscribers of the Hamil - ton company and the Lincoln company was further prohibited from con - structing telephone lines for the purpose of furnishing service to the subscribers of the Hamilton company. The Commission at that time expressed no opinion as to the severance of long distance connections between the companies, reserving such decision for the final disposition of the case. Later the Hamilton county company answered by alleging that it was not soliciting the subscribers of its competitor but that it was con - structing a line in response to the demand of a number of farmers north of Hampton; that the district court injunction had been dissolved; that the Lincoln company was not complying with the order of the Commis - sion in that it wae proceeding with the reconstruction of its plant at Hampton; that its farm lines north of Hampton were in a deplorable condition and that the Lincolr company would lose nothing if the service were discontinued; that the ostensible complainants in this case s acting in behalf of the Lincoln company; that the whole proceed - ing was a part of a program of the Lincoln company to drive the Ham - ilton county company out of the field and secure a monopoly. It asked that the Lincoln company be perpetually enjoined from severing its toll connections between its system and the exchanges of the Hamilton county company; that the Hamilton county company be permitted to complete its proposed construction and that the Lincoln company be re - quired to comply with the order of the Commission. During the next few months several conferences were held partici - pated in by complainants, representatives of the two companies and the Commission. Every effort was made by the Commission in these conferences to secure an adjustment of the matter that would result m the retirement of one of the companies from the field. At one time it appeared that such a consummation had been accomplished, but the Hamilton county company subsequently withdrew its consent. An ob - stacle in the way of the purchase by the Hamilton county company lay - in the form of its organization which prevented it from financing such purchase. During the pendency of these proceedings a similar issue arose at Red Cloud and complaint was filed from there asking for the consolida - tion of the two competing companies at that point. Lewis H. Blackledse et al. t. Farmers Independent Telephone company and Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company. The Commission held in its order in that case that it could not require consolidation, but it did order a connection of the two exchanges, both for local and long distance service and pre - scribed certain increases in the exchange rates of both companies to cover the added cost of the interchange traffic. The order also con - tained a provision imposing upon both companies the obligation of </seg>
            <seg id="p113">113 maintaining the existing relationship as to number of subscribers, should there be subsequent growth. This case was appealed to the supreme court. Blackledge et al., v. Farmers Independent Telephone Company of Red Cloud et al., 105 Nebr. 713. Whi!e the court did not in terms discuss the power of the Commission to order a consolidation, the effect of the language used is that it has no such power. It held further that we are without power to impose regulations that will result in confiscation of the property of either competitor or to seriously inter - fere with the individual management and control of the same. Two paragraphs of the syllabus cover these points anil we quote as follows: "Though at common law such public utilities cou'd not be required to make physical connections of their telephone systems, the legislature or the Railway Commission may order such connections when public con - venience and necessity require, provided that the company required to render the service will receive proper compensation for the additional service which it renders, and that such conditions are imposed as will protect such company in its individual management and control of its own property, and that the order does not so operate as to create or allow of such discriminatory conditions as will cause injury to the com - pany concerned. "Where the Railway Commission, as a condition of an order re - quiring the physical connection of two companies, directs that the two companies shall divide all new business, in such proportions that the relation in size of the one company to the other shall not change but shall i&gt;e continuously maintained so long as the order of exchange of service shall operate, the right of either company to accept as sub - scriber* all who shall apply in the territory covered by their system is denied, and the effect of such order is to take the company's property without due process of law." The court found that the conditions under which the Commission ordered physical connection of the two companies would result in con - fiscation of the Lincoln company's property and deprive both companies of the use of their property. The order of the Commission was annulled and set aside without prejudice to the rights of any of the parties to further proceedings before the Commission, for the purpose of arriving at some reasonable regulation for the exchange of service, under such conditions, if they could be found, as would be legally justifiable and within constitutional limits, whereupon the Lincoln Company filed an application with the Commission asking that it be permitted to sever all connections with its competitors at Red Cloud. Hearing was had on this application at which all parties were represented. The Commission invited suggestions as to how the connections might be continued with - out damage to either company. No practical plan was forthcoming. An order was, therefore, issued authorizing the Lincoln company to dis - connect its lines from the switchboard of the Farmers company.

Chapman Telephone Association, t't al., Defendant OPINION AND FINDING. Browne, Commissioner: — This complaint was filed by seven citizens of Merriek county against the Chapman Telephone association, the Nebraska Telephone company, and the Archer Independent Telephone association, the two former be - ing common carriers, the latter a mutual organization. Of the com - plainants some are subscribers of the Chapman Telephone association, some are members of the Archer Telephone association, and two or more have no telephone service. hibitive to the patron </seg>
            <seg id="p115">115 Aeainst the Chapman Telephone association it is alleged that the service is unusually poor, particularly when subscribers desire to use toll lines to Central City. This service is declared to be so poor that complainants, who are new subscribers, do not desire to continue as sub- scribers, and those who are not subscribers cannot agree to accept ser- vice of the Chapman company. Against the Archer Independent Telephone association it is declar- ed that under its present methods those in the territory served by that association and not members thereof can only secure telephone service under terms inequitable and at an expense which is unreasonable. Agpinnt the Nebraska Telephone company, now the Northwestern Bell Telephone company, it is alleged that it is discriminating against omplainants by refusing to accept them as subscribers, although they are immediately adjacent to territory now served by defendant; that eaily ami willing to pay regular rates for service; that defend- aml company has undertaken to serve the territory tributary to Central City, whicr: town is the trade territory of complainants, and that dis- t'rom its refusal to extend its lines to complainants sr like terms with others not far removed from the homesteads c :e&lt;l the situation is this: The Chapman Telephone com- es at Chapman and Archer.

Subscribers of the Chapman company can talk zo Central City only over toll lines between Archer and Chap- id Chapman and Central City, these toll lines being metallic iron circuits. A toll charge of ten cents for each call is made. The Chap- as 130 subscribers connected to its Archer exchange, and man com presumably mostly in the trade territory surrounding Archer. The Archer Telephone association has 44 members. It is purely mutual, its members living north and northeast from Archer . They are connected to four circuits which lead into the town of Archer where they are connected to metallic circuits running to Central City. The metallic circuits from Archer to Central City are owned by the Ne- braska Telephone company and are attached to pole lines chiefly devot- ed to toll service, both transcontinental and from Central City to St. Paul. These circuits are rented by the Nebraska Telephone company to the Archer Telephone association on a monthly basis. Subscribers of the association have, therefore, direct connection at Central City where they pay switching charges. There are no subscribers on the trunk lines between Central City and Archer. </seg>
            <seg id="p116">116 (Defendant Nebraska Telephone company, now the Northwestern- Telephone company, has two rural circuits involved in this com - nt. These circuits are attached to toll pole lines for a distance of • miles west of Central City. They then extend in a northerly and ;heasterly direction seven or eight miles, with one or two laterals. Se two rural lines serve respectively twelve and nine subscribers, h the exception of one lateral they are on section lines one » east of the lines of the Chapman Telephone company and the Ar - - association. One lateral of the Archer association reaches over to e proximity of the Bell lines. A Bell lateral extends within one dred rods of the end of the Chapman company's rural line nearest to tral City. Complainants desire that the Bell company extend a pole line from point five miles west of Central City north on the section line for a stance of eight or twelve miles, preferably the latter, and take on and rve as rural subscribers complainants and others who, it is alleged, and willing and anxious to secure Br!! service at Central City. The elay in handling this case has been ehieLly due to the fact that one of he defendants alleged itself to be a mutual company, outside of the urisdiction of the Commission. At the time of the hearing of thi? cause the question of whether the Commission had jurisdiction over or - tanizations similar to the Archer Telephone association had been pre - ented to the supreme court and it was deemed fairly essential that the a\V be clear before the knotty problems presented in this complaint ere solved. That decision has been rendered. Complainants P. N. Gardner and one other, living five miles nrrth - ast of Archer, have no telephone service. They desire the service of le Nebraska Telephone company at Central City, twelve miles distant. F an alternative they have tried to secure service from the Archer ssociation. This association has its four circuits on one pole line lead - ng north from Archer without cross-arms. They are only willing to take on the two complainants on condition that they cross-arm the pole ne for a distance of five miles and buy and place their own wire. The otai cost of such extension is estimated at $500 or more. The Archer ssociation is willing to turn its properties, now in very depreciated ondition, over to the Bell and pay regular rural rates on condition that ie Bell company maintain the property and give them as good service as is given to other rural Bell subscribers. The Archer Telephone association is brought into this complaint because of alleged unreasonable by-laws working seriously to the dis - advantage of late-comers in the territory served by the association who Hesire service over its lines. It must be admitted that the contention of complainants is sound. It ought not to be necessary for prospective subscribers for telephone service to pay such an amount of money to secure that service, under </seg>
            <seg id="p117">117 all the circumstances involved, as is demanded by the Archer associ - ation. On the other hand, the nature of the organization of the Archer association leaves no other recourse in the opinion of its members. It has no cash. It does not collect sufficient funds to maintain its exist - ing properties. It has no means of securing the capital for an exten - sion of its lines except by assessments on members, who do not desire to be assessed in order to accomodate late applicants for service. At the same time it has occupied so large a territory as to discourage common carriers from entering that particular territory, this discour - agement being due to the lack of promise of any reward for the invest - ment in the territory, with strong probability that such extended lines would be a liability only. However, we cannot require the Archer asso - ciation to change its by-laws and to put itself in more of a business at - titude. It is purely mutual and we have no jurisdiction over such a company. It can accept members or reject members according to the will of the majority of existing members. The state haj not undeitak - en to interfere. .Ttate v.

It follows from our lack of jurisdiction over the Archer Telephone association and its operations that we must dismiss the complaint as to that defendant.

More sturdy transmission current am! better insulation, with perhaps some improvement on the Archer switchboard, will bring this to pass. In the hearing the com - pany promised to make needed improvements immediately. If this has not been satisfactorily done any subscriber of the Chapman Telephone company may file informal complaint by letter and the Commission will take the necessary step? to develop the facts and to see that the service which the company presumes to render is properly rendered. The Bell company (by which term we mean defendant Nebraska Telephone company and its successor the Northwestern Bell Telephone company) refuses to construct the line asked for and to take on the proposed subscribers. It says the necessary cost to reach a point twelve miles northwest of Central City and two miles west of any ex - isting lines owned by it would be $2263, and to extend this line to the Nance county boundary would entail an additional expense of approxi - mately $2000. It is alleged that the existing pole line, approximately paralleling the proposed line and to the east of it one and two miles, </seg>
            <seg id="p118">118 COUld not be used, for it would not reach the homes of complainants. This appears correct. The only reasonable solution to meet the de - mands of complainants is the construction of the pole line in approxi - mately the manner suggested by complainants and the extension of circuits from Central City in sufficient number to serve. No details were presented of this alleged cost. It will embody one metallic circuit twelve miles long under one proposition and seventeen miles long under another for each ten additional subscribers and will require the con - struction and crossarming of a pole line seven or twelve miles in length. The figures on cost appear to be high. This whole complaint embodies the well-known difficulties of twilight zone territory, but embodies more than that in that the proposed line will go through territory already occupied by other companies and will take from those other companies a served by such other companies, company with an average number in the territory under dispute. portion of the subscribers now being It would, if constructed, leave no of subscribers per mile of pole line The complainants allege that service offered in the territory one from thirty tc fifty subscribers of were this pole line constructed and mile on either side thereof anywhere other companies and those not now having telephone service would take the Bell service and pay the regular rates. There is no conclusive evidence of this. Testimony does not point out where these proposed subscribers live. No witness testified who had himself canvassed the situation over any considerable part of the proposed line. Concretely it was shown that from seven to ten are ready and anxious for the service within the limits of seven miles of the extended pole line as prayed for. Others are probable. Some pro - posed subscribers live on rented farms and such subscribers can hardly be counted upon as permanent in territory where facilities are duplicate! by other companies. Complainants say they could assure the company two subscribers per mile but they do not offer ta guarantee such ;i number. On part of the distance the proposed pole line would parallel on the same highway the existing service of the Chapman Telephone company and on another part of the line that of the Archer association. The evidence would indicate that not all the residents adjacent to the highway, where it is proposed the extension should run, would take the Bell service. The fundamental difficulty is not difficult to see. It is apparent that the Chapman Telephone company has extended its lines into territory hardly tributary to its exchanges. Trade territory tributary Ra town or city is the proper measure of the limits of lines radiating m an exchange located in such town or city. Whenever trade terri - tory is disregarded in the construction of telephone property unsatis - factory service to some subscribers must certainly result. While we recognize the inconveniences to which complainants are </seg>
            <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 119 put an equitable solution is not easy to apply. The small town of Archer is already blessed with two telephone companies, the subscribers at each of which can communicate with the others only by paying toll in a roundabout manner. It is true even of business houses \ hich do not have telephones both of the Archer association tpman company. Those subscribers of the Chapman com- inge over to the Bell service would remain at the antage in a reverse direction when communicating with ave service on the other exchange. The extension of proposer! would have two chief effects: Prompter and more efficient connection to subscribers on the City exchange. elimination of the ten cent toll charge in messages to ension asked for by complainants would duplicate pole line two companies on five of eight miles of proposed extension. u This Commission has no power to forbid duplication of properties of telephone utilities. It has, however, long recognized that such dupliea- tvagant and an investment which burdens both companies so therefore burdens their subscribers unduly. Only in an ;n situation would the Commission undertake to require licatioi v proper solution of the whole difficult), would be a consolidation e telephone properties in and around Archer into one exchange, with ul regard of the limits of trade territory in determining where sen - ttache.l to Central City should end and that attached to Archer i. The Archer association is unwilling to aid in bringing to pass unless it has free service to Central City. The lpany does not desire to alienate any of its members. i Members of the Archer association and complainants would not be satis - rieil it the Chapman company were willing to finance a consolidation. This Commission cannot compel a consolidation of telephone properties, Biac v. Farmers Independent Telephone Co. et al., N. S. K. C. 13V; * 14 N. S. K. C. Ill, 609; iO5 Neb. 713;) ior can it compel a company to sell its properties to another even for he ultimate advantage of all concerned, including the patrons of both companies To require the Bell company to build the proposed extension would be to require it to bisect the territory occupied by the Archer association and to parallel for a considerable distance on the same highway lines of the Chapman company which now serve most of the people along that highway. At best, a lural line, whose first subscriber is six miles or more distant from the exchange, is not enticing as an investment. It </seg>
            <seg id="p120">120 might, however, be the duty of a company, occupying a territory, to make such an extension regardless of whether the particular investment were remunerative. It may, from its location, have held itself out to so serve a territory as to discourage any other service. In this instance, however, it is proposed that the extension be built through territory al - ready occupied by other telephone companies. At best, only part of available subscribers along: the proposed line would be willing to accept the new-comers' service. The result would be an unusual pole mileage for each added subscriber. This would accentuate the discouraging outlook for making the investment. We cannot see where the duty lies on the Bell company to invade the territory of Other companies to meet the demand of a minority of the citizens in the territory affected. For the most part it Cannot be Said that the territory covered in this complaint is trade territory tri - butary to Central City. It is such trade territory for complainants, and possibly for others. It is likewise not territory for those other citizens who cling- to Archer as their trading point. Two complainants, Rodysill and Held, live almost three miles from Archer and more than seven miles from Central City. They are on a highway close to the end of the Chapman company's iine nearest to Central City. They are also within one-half to three-quarters of a mile from a farm line of the Bell company. Neither have telephone service. Almost their whole business relations are in the direction of or at Central City. They feel no inducement to take the Chapman service. The Bell company has two circuits, with twenty-one sub - scribers on them, a lateral of one of which is close to these complainants. There are always places in the twilight zone where competing com - panies serve. It cannot be said that the territory belongs to One 01' the Other in such circumstances. That is the situation here. It does not appear equitable to say that these two citizens, desiring telephone service, must be compelled to take Chapman service because it is a few rods closer than the service of the company entering the town which IS their market place.. The Bell company can serve these two subscribers at a minimum expense. Its two circuits can be rearranged without Overloading of the line to take on the two. It requires merely an ex - tension of a lateral line not more than three-fourths of a mile to serve the two. We find that defendant Bell Telephone company shall within sixty days extend its lines and proffer service to complainants, J. M. Rodysill and 0. H. Held, provided that if the extension shall cost more than $75 for each of the proposed subscribers the excess cost shall be paid by the two complainants in question. Complainants Rodysill and Held shall give the telephone company adequate guaranty that they or their successors will remain subscribers for a period of five years.

OPINION AND FINDINC By the Commission By the original order in the above entitled proceeding, dated Febru - ary 4, 1921, the defendant was required to maintain a Sunday passenger train service between Aurora and a ierminus at Burwell, for a trial period of six months, commencing not later than April 1, 1921. The order also required the defendant to be prepared, on or before Septem - ber 15, 1921, to make a full showing as to results of the operation of such a train. By our supplemental order in this case tlated March 19, 1921, the complaint of D. A. Beach, et al., against the same defendant — which W&amp;8 originally docketed under our Formal Complaint No. 420. and brought in issue the adequacy of passenger train service on the line from Palmer to Sargent — was consolidated with the complaint in our formal case No. 3!)9, entitled as above. In the &lt;arae supplemental opinion, the Com - mission disposed of the motion filed by the defendant, requesting that the trial period governing the Sunday passenger train which it was re - quired to establish between Aurora and Burwell for a six months' period, be reduced to a three months' period, and offering to establish f&lt; r a similar period, a Sunday passenger train service on the line from Palmer to Sargent, as prayed for in the complaint of D. A. Beach, et al. By our order in the supplemental decision of March 19, 1921, we required the establishment of Sunday passenger train service en the lines from Aurora through Palmer to Sargent and Burwell, with a provision for the submission, by defendant, upon the termination of the test period — of statistics covering the results of operation of such trains, at a hearing set down at Central City on July 8, 1921. The order also required the furnishing of statistical information to the attorneys for complainants and to the Commission, on or before July 6, 1921. The hearing set clown in our supplemental opinion and order of March 19, 1921, was held at Central City on July 8, 1921, and a subse - quent hearing was held at the same point on August 3, 1921, to permit the completion of the statistical showing made in behalf of defendant as </seg>
            <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 123 to the revenues received ami expenses incurred in connection with the Sunday passenger train service here in question. Decision has been withheld partially for the reason that the business depression, with the resultant loss in traffic, made the ordering of additional service less necessary, and the decreased revenues were less likely to justify the added expense. Business has now, however, shown substantial recovery and railroad traffic has returned very nearly to normal. Barring oper - ating difficulties due to the strike, the conditions should be as favorable for a further trial of the new service as they will be at any time in the future, providing we find the service to be reasonably necessary on the record. At these hearings, the defendant in this case presented a large number of .statistical exhibits purporting to show that it did not receive any net income from the operation of passenger trains on the branches from Aurora to Burwell and Sargent, here involved. Such cost-of - service studies are very complicated and in all cases must be subjected to most careful scrutiny before the conclusion to which they point can accepted. In considering these statistical studies, we ir.ust first determine whether the revenues earned and expenses incurred were produced under normal conditions. Th«&gt; accepted measure of passenger service per- formed by a common carrier is the number of passengers carried one mile and the number of miles run by passenger trains. There was a rather marked falling-off of passenger business in 1921 on the Burlington system, as shown by the statement below, but it will be observed that the number of passenger train miles were actually in- eased in the face of this large loss of traffic.

            <seg id="p124">124 The situation as to freight traffic is very different, however, as will be observed by reference to the subjoined table. ANALYSIS OF FREIGHT TRAFFIC C. B. &amp; Q.

Tht facts as to freight and passenger traffic shown above suggest the conclusion that it is very difficult, — if not impossible — to make a fail" allocation of cost-of-service to freight and passenger traffic, when the volume of business is at a low ebb. To illustrate this point, further, it will be observed that, although the C. B. &amp; Q. system used less tons of fuel to produce a larger passenger train mileage in 1921 than 1920, the proportion of expense assigned to passenger on a "fuel basis", would be largely increased, due to reduced fuel consumption for freight service, although the oassenger train mileage was produced at lower fuel costs.

            <seg id="p125">125 Similar factors affect the allocation of expense to freight and pas - senger service? on the branch lines of defendant here under considera - tion. As shown above, the C. B. &amp; Q. system suffered a decrease of 11,117,167 tons of revenue freight or 23.54 per cent in 1921 as compared with 1920. The station reports filed by defendant with this Commission, and which were stipulated into the record of this case, show that the tonnage of received and forwarded freight traffic reported by all station.-;, Central City and beyond (on these branches) was 415,839,399 pounds in 1921 as compared with 600,284,748 pounds in 1920 — a decrease of 30.08 per cent. The decrease in tonnage for the six months, Janu - ary to June, 1921, as compared with a similar period in 1920, was even greater — being 36.56 per cent. When proper allowances are made for the increased passenger fare charged in 1921, a comparison of passenger ticket sales at the stations Central City and north on these branches; shows that the business to state points fell off from $64,121.95 to $46,993.42 for the first six months of 1921 as conpared with 1920, which is a reduction of 36.4 per cent. Similar figures as to interstate ticket sales indicate a falling - off from $5,810.94 to $4,891.63 in 1921, as compared with January to June, 1920 — a decrease of 19 per cent. A consideration of the losses of traffic in 1921 in both branches of the service indicates that the statistics upon which the defendant relies are not normal, insofar as revenues are concerned. We pa^s now to an examination of the allocation of operating ex&gt; penses. TABLE NO. I.

            <seg id="p126">126 At the outset we call attention to the facts shown in Table 1, which is a comparison of freight and passenger revenues and expenses. This table shows that during April, May and June, 1921, the Burlington ex - pended 33.76 per cent of the charges to Maintenance of Way and Struc - tures account for the year ending June 30, 1921. In other words, during 25 per cent of the time, 33.76 per cent of the total expenditures were made and were charged against the revenues accruing during 1 this period, which were but 24.12 per cent of the annual passenger revenue and 24.35 per cent of the freight revenues for the year. This analysis also shows that 24.12 per cent of the passenger revenue accruing during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1921, was charged with 36.5 per cent of the annual maintenance of way expense which was assigned to passenger traffic. During the particular three months that the Sunday train was operating, therefore, there was expended for maintenance considerably more than for any other three n-.onths of the year. This comparison seems to indicate that the test period figures now under consideration were abnormal as to both revenues and expenses. A detailed analysis of maintenance of way expenses shows a varia - tion in cost ranging from 68.11 cents to $1.32 per passenger train mile during the month of May, and a variation of from $23.32 to $75.83 per mile of road assigned to passenger during this month. It seems fail to say that no sound conclusion can be based upon figures which show such large fluctuations in "cost of service", under substantially similar cir - cumstances and conditions. And, while consideration should be given to the expenditures for maintenance of way and structures in ascertain - ing the cost of operation of the Bonds; train, such expenditure&gt; are by no means controlling. Practically all of this expense would be in - curred whether the Sunday train runs or not. Slight additional ex - pense caused by inspection of tracks would be incurred, but an engineer, no matter how expert, would be unable to n:easure the additional wear and tear on track and roadway structures from the running of two extra trains a week. This conclusion applies also, though with somewhat less force, to the expenditures for agency and station service, an'i par - ticularly to superintendence and general expense, which remain constant, irrespective of the number of trains operated. The testimony in this case shows that the defendant has maintained its present daily passenger train service over a long period of years, and it is fair to assume that if the available passenger train business was, under some theoretical accounting tests, a doubtful source of profit, it was presumably continued as a minimum service necessary to dis - charge defendant's common carrier obligations, and to maintain about the same service on these branch lines as that existing on the adjacent lines of the Union Pacific Railroad. In view of all the circumstances, a comparison of the results of daily and Sunday passenger train operation during April, May and June, </seg>
            <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 127 1921, is of interest. Such a comparison is made on Table II, which is attached hereto. In the original order in this case, the Commission stated that if the traffic on the Sunday train was equal, or nearly so, to that of the average for the other six days of the week, it would tend to justify the continuation of the train. The statistics in the table show that the revenue from all sources from the Sunday train is practi - cally the same as for the week days. It was shown in the original record in this case that the Union Pacific anil North Western, operating in this section of the state, and in some instances in direct competition with defendant, have Sunday trains. As we before stated, defendant's obligation as a common carrier is measured to a large extent by what other carriers do 'under similar circumstances and conditions. The results of the test, as shown by the figures in Table II, indicate quite cloarh that this obligation can be discharged without any substantial increase of its burden. In other words, the Sunday train will as nearly pay its way as do the week-day trains. </seg>

            <seg id="p129">129 In passing, it should be noted that the average passenger train serv - ice revenue? for the entire C. B. &amp; Q. system were but $2.26 per train mile, and all Nebraska lines of the C. B. &amp; Q. show similar revenues of $2.30 per train mile during the year ending December 31, 1921, which may be compared with the theoretical expense of passenger train oper - ation on the Palmer-Burwell line, which is stated as $2.36 per train mile for Sunday and $2.37 per train mile for week clay train?. This is but a further demonstration of the fact that the cost of service figures sub - mitted in this proceeding cannot be accepted as either normal or con - vincing. A conclusion in this case ought not be reached without some con - sideration being given to the general financial condition of defendant company. If the road were losing money on its operation as a system or within the state of Nebraska, that fact would constitute a valid de - fense against a further increase in expense from additional service. On the other hand, if its financial statements disclose a substantial profit from its operations, that condition is at least persuasive that it may reasonably be required to furnish a more complete and adequate service to its patrons. In 1921 the company issued a stock dividend of $60,000,000, making the total stock outstanding $170,839,100. On this new capitalization, two dividends cf 5 per cent were declared upon income account and 15 per cent upon surplus. This meant that the total di - vidends for the year were $44,925,917, of which $19,300,382 were paid from the income for the year, and $25,625,535 from accumulated surplus. The road had a surplus from income, in 1921, after paying the $19,300,382, of $6,014,948. Full credit was made to depreciation and other reserves in addition to the surplus thus set aside. These figures are to be found in the annual report filed with this Commission. They speak for themselves and tell a story of splendid prosperity. Reports for other years are equally favorable. Manifestly, therefore, the com - pany is abundantly able to provide the Sunday service, assuming it to be necessary and reasonable for other reasons. Upon consideration of all the facts submitted in connection with the rehearings of these cases, it is our opinion that the operation of Sunday passenger trains on the lines of defendant from Aurora to Sargent and Burwell is justified and should be resumed. An appropriate older will be entered to give effect to our conclusions. The company is now hand - icapped somewhat by a strike of some of its employes. For that reason this order will not be made effective until September 3, 1922. Should the strike continue, it might be necessary to extend the time beyond that date, which can be done upon proper application and showing.

The coal sheds are on the other side of the railroad and located on an industry track so that the oca' can be un - loaded directly from cars to sheds. In his petition complainant asks us to pass on the valuation placed by the Union Pacific on the two plats of ground and t&lt;&gt; sax whether it is correct as a basis for charging the annual rental. He does not object to a rental rate of six per cent, which is the rate used by defendant, and confines his objection to the valuation of approximately 82,500 for the land, which, he contends, supported by affidavits, is worth very much less. Defendant challenges the jurisdiction of the Commission, asserts that the valuation for rental purposes is correct, and asks that the Com - mission either dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction or find that the rental required is a proper amount. Interveners were chiefly interested in the possibilities that the case might broaden to include the whole question of leaseholds on railroad rights-of-way, the rental charges annually imposed, and the terms of the leases which leasees were and are required to sign. The testimony took wide range and included such questions as the value of adjacent lands; whether acreage is more or less valuable than land cut up into lots; whether a lease of a plat of ground containing such conditions as are ordinarily imposed by rai'road companies upon leasees, and which were imposed in the lease under dispute, detracted seriously from the value of such lease; and whether such subtraction of value should be reflected in the rental paid. The Union Pacific, de- fendant, presented its rrethod of arriving at the amount of the rental, which wa- briefly: find the ratio between the assessor's values for taxing purposes ami the sale piice of such plats as had been sold and apply that r«tio p&gt; the assessor's figures for plats immediately adjacent to the plats apply this "pel foot" value to the leased tract and uni multiply by &gt;ix to find the annual rental. The Commission discussed the advisability of going still farther into the case at a subsequent hearing and whether to broaden it to include all leaseholds on all railroads within the state. No conclusion was readied at the time of the hearing and no date set for a subsequent hearing. Ar- guments were had -i few days after the conclusion of the hearing and the case was submitted. There has been considerable delay in handling this case for the reason that the importance of the subject suggested a case more care - fully presented and on a wider basis than that before the Commission in this cause.. Certain carriers in Nebraska, particularly this defendant, have been following the recommendations of the Interstate Commerce Commission to charge a proper rental for leaseholds in place of merely nominal rentals and thereby to add to the annual revenues. The amount charged by the carriers has been the subject of informal discussion be- </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 fore the Commission by very many patrons and leasees of different railroads. It had been the Commission's hope that the dissatisfied leaseholders would cooperate in the presentation of a very careful case. The law in the matter is very uncertain and the Commission felt that its very importance required all consideration which might be given and that it be not asked to pass widely on the subject upon complaint such as this presented by a single industry without counsel and with no other consideration of the law involved than that given in argument by one intervenor and by defendant, save as given by the Commission.- It has beer said the practice of charging nominal rentals without regard to the location of the plat, or its size, works a disadvantage to the less favorably located competitor, as well as to the competitor who must bear added overheads of taxes or rents .on private ground and for construction and maintenance of switchtracks. This might be called discrimination if the renting by the common carrier is linked up with its common carrier activities. On the other hand, it is urged that if the carrier is free to make such lease requirements as it sees fit it may in - flict heavy and unreasonable burdens on any leasee who may fall under its displeasure, or at its wil! upon any leasee who because of the per - manence of his improvements on leased grounds cannot escape from the location and who has no other option than to sign onerou? conditions. If the relation of leasee and carrier is purely private the state, and therefore the public, can have no legal interest in any of the lease conditions or in whether a lease is executed at all.

Co., 90 Iowa, 265 C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., vs. State of Nebraska, 50 Neb., 399 In the argument of this case representatives of grain elevator in - dustries, who appeared as interveners, urged that elevators are a trans - portation necessity and a required station facility; that if these facilities were not furnished by private parties it would be necessary for the carrier to furnish them and to elevate grain for com - pensation; that the rate of compensation would be as much under regu - lation as the rate of transportation and might be included with it; that rates of rental and lease conditions would, if the carrier furnished the facility, be under supervision as to reasonableness and as to discrimina - tion; and that therefore since these duties of the carriers are delegated to private individuals the carrier has not released itself from its obli - gations by merely sub-letting to other parties a part of its duties. This was the view taken by the Board of Railroad Commissioners of Iowa in Staceyville Grain &amp; Coal Co. v. 111. Cen. R. R. Co., P. U. R. 1920-B, 133. and the conclusion of that board was extended to include coal sheds, </seg>
            <seg id="p133">133 although with no particular logic in tying the two into the same trans portation activity. Assuming that there is sound reasoning in the contentions of the elevator owners, summarized above, there is yet nothing that points to the Commission's jurisdiction in the case before us. Here is a lumber yard located on railroad ground not presently needed for railroad pur - poses. It has no trackage advantages and is unable even to unload cars \'ith greater facility than would be the case were the yard located on private ground adjacent to the present location or on private ground on the other side of the right-of-way. Complainant has merely rented a suitable location close to the heart of the business section of the town ami there operates a lumber yard. Nothing in the testimony indicates that the public is in any way interested, either financially or in added convenience by reason of the present location. The lumber yard lease appears to be purely a private relationship between the lessor and the lessee. So far as we are able to see the mere fact that the one party to the transaction is a common carrier does not change its status. This being true it follows that we lack the authority to measure the reason - ableness of the charge for annual rental of the ground. The coal sheds which were put on the same footing in the complaint and in the testimony, may occupy a slightly different position. They aie located on trackage. It was said in the Iowa case, supra, that sheds on trackage induce shipments in dull seasons and thus aid in avoiding transportation congestion in rush movements of fuel, and that were they not on trackage the cost of handling would discourage movement of fuel at other times than when needed by the public. These coal sheds were said in the Iowa case to be a needed station facility and the intimation is carried that the carrier might be required to furnish the sheds for rape of fuel and unload the cars for proper compensation. It may be possible that the carrier, under proper tariffs and for proper compensation, miffht be required to take charge of freight as soon as it comes onto the right-of-way and to keep it in charge and be responsible for it until it leaves the right-of-way, including under its duties loading and unloading. There is involved, of course, the practi - cal consideration of whether such rule coujd be applied covering all carload freight. No such rule now exists. The carriers' transporta - tion act and its liability for the coal ends when the car is spotted at the coal shed and the shipper notified. Thereafter its handling is a private transaction. Without finally passing on the question as it relates to coal sheds, and not at all as it relates to grain elevators, the Commission is enough in to include it in its general determination that it has no jurisdiction to consider the complaint. </seg>

For himself as a citizen and Us a representative cf the trainmen's organization he has complained against the various carriers named herein to the effect that they do not operate switch engines in local service at various points within the state of Nebraska with a sufficient number of men in a crew. He alleges there is no law in the state of Nebraska and no order of the Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 covering the question of crews in switch engine service and asks that the Commission enter a general order requiring (a) that in general within the state switch engines shall be manned by an engineer, a fire - man, a foreman and not less than two helpers; and (b) that where the larger part of an assignment shift is occupied in making switches from the mail: line to switch tracks or in switching over streets or street tracks in metropolitan cities and cities of the first class there t&gt;e, in addition to those named in (a) above, another helper. At me of the hearing the application was amended to read that three should be required "where a considerable part" of the assign- hift mentioned in (b&gt; is occupied as described. It is alleged that the present practices render the service facilities equipment of the railroads, defendants herein, inadequate, in- -u f;icient and unsafe and that this Commission is authorized by law to correct the evils complained of. \nswers were filed by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad any. Union Pacific Railroad company, The St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company, Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Ne - braska, Chicago, &amp; North Western Railway company, Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company and The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Paciiic Railway company. Each of these defendants appeared at the ng in the offices of the Commission on February 7, 1922. The carriers defendant either operate no switch engines within the defaulted in appearance. appears from the record that agreements exist between the various b and the trainmen's brotherhood calling for the operation of c ngines by an engineer, fireman, foreman and two helpers and le there are state laws relative to assignments of crews in train there is none concerning the crews of switch engines. The ve committee of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen sought in correct this situation by the enactment of a general law within tate. The legislative committee referred the representatives of motherhood to the Railway Commission, which body the committee had ample jurisdiction to correct any deficiencies. That such juris- was admitted before *he legislative committee by re t- presentatives of the defendant carriers according to the testimony in this case. At the time of taking testimony the carriers alleged in defense that the extent of the jurisdiction of the Commission went to the cor - rection of specific inefficiencies in the size of train crews and that the Commission did not have jurisdiction to make a general legislative order the kind prayed for. Complainant admitted that so far as was known switch crews are always manned by a foreman and two helpers in addition to the engine crew. It was asked, however, that this be included in the proposed general order by the Commission to head off any possibility that switch </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 crews might be reduced below the number of men now used and that ?n the specific instances heretofore mentioned the carriers be required to furnish an extra man. The testimony was confined to situations existing on the belt line of the Missouri Pacific in Omaha; on what is known as the alley track be - tween Izard and Nicholas streets; on the Eighth street switching dis - trict; on the gas alley switch track of the Union Pacific in Omaha; switching at the summit between Omaha and South Omaha; and situa - tions at Kearney and Grand Island on the Union Pacific. The North Western, Burlington and Rock Island moved to dismiss because no testi - mony was introduced as to any necessity on the part of those carriers for any switch crews with three helpers. Complainant argued that the testimony was merely illustrative of the general necessity and not in the nature of a complaint covering all places where the present crews are insufficient. The Commission refused to dismiss on the ground stated, holding with complainant that the testimony was merely illustrative. One witness testified in detail concerning switching operations at Omaha on the Missouri Pacific and the Omaha road, and practically agreed during the course of his testimony that no occasion existed at present for crews of four men additional to the engine crew on the Omaha road. Two witnesses testified concerning the Union Pacific. Both agreed that the present operation under existing rules is reason - ably .safe. One insisted that if condition* set forth in the petition men - tioned above under (b) were complied with additional safety would be provided both for the public crossing railroad tracks and for the crews operating trains in road service and in switching service. The witness who testified in an illustrative way concerning the situation at other points in the state did not believe that an additional man at Kearney would add to the safety of either public or train crew. All witnesses insisted that higher efficiency in switching service would be secured and the cost would be amply repaid by the addition of another helper where switching is done from the main line or over streets where traffic is heavy. At the time of the hearing the two members of the Commission sitting provisionally held that that provision of the law relating to efficiency of operation had particular reference to the efficiency in which the general public had an interest. Careful subsequent consideration of this point leads the entire Commission to confirm that ruling. It is clear, however, that if the question of efficiency had been raised by the public served by the earlier and supported by evidence that the public was suffering from lack of efficiency, which might be secured by definite additional expense not unwarranted, it would be the duty of the Com - mission to pass on the complaints raised. From all the testimony presented we are convinced that no necessity </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 exists at this time for a general order, either requiring that no switch crew have fewer than two helpers and a foreman, or that under certain jreneral situations the crews must contain not less than one foreman an three helpers. To require additional employes where the necessity i not clear is merely to add to operating expenses where in the long run and frequently almost immediately the shipping public and the consum intf public must pay the bill. To issue an order covering a situation no in controversy is superfluous. On the other hand we are considerably in doubt concerning specific switch engine assignments, particularly in Omaha, and possibly at other places, where the safety of the crews and of the public, which must cross railroad switch tracks, require an additional helper. Defendants protested at the time of the hearing that the nature of the complaint made it impossible for them to adequately prepare the tiers 1 -i&lt;ie of the case, that the complaint was so general in terms as t&lt;&gt; make a general defense only possible, and that before the Commission finally passes on specific necessities opportunity ought to be afforded the iers to present evidence. We felt that this contention was sound nd at the clo.-e of the hearing said that before any orders, other than osaibly an order of dismissal, were entered an opportunity would be fendants to introduce evidence. om the record before us we find it necessary to dismiss the com - so far as it relates to general orders. We do not know whether complainant desires to submit for consideration of the Commission mat- specific instances where three helpers are necessary on ten engines, or whether he prefers to deal with the railroad operat - officials direct on such specific matters. For that reason we will not now .set this matter down for further hearing looking to the neces - sity or advisability of specific orders. We will, however, reopen the case, en motion of complainant, for the consideration of specific situa - tions within the state of Nebraska where switch crews should contain four men besides engine crew, and will, upon the filing of such motion, set the matter down for additional hearing at which time complainant, or any other representative of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, may at his option present additional evidence or rest the case on the evidence already presented. i At that time defendants will be given op - portunity to present any evidence which they may desire to present. For purpose of facilitating the case we will ask complainant, in case motion is filed, to designate the specific situations which he desires con - sidered. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the complaint herein, so far as it asks for the entering of general orders covering the size of crews in switching service within the state of Nebraska, be and it hereby is dismissed. </seg>

            <seg id="p140">140 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT first that the Railway Commission interpret this statute to mean that every light engine shall be equipped with an engineer, fire - man and conductor or pilot, and second, that the Railway Com - mission make a ruling of its own supplementary to the statute covering the subject. On this point I wish to call the attention of the Commission that the language of the statute is somewhat ambiguous but that the language in other states that have legis - lated on the same subject is clear and definite. Oregon, Texas. Indiana, North Dakota and several other state? have similar statutes covering the same condition and the language used in all of those statutes is this, — 'One engineer, one fireman and one pilot outside of yard limits,' and so the complainant is asking that the statute in question in Nebraska be interpreted to mean one engineer, one fireman and one pilot or conductor outside of yard limits.' " I A division is defined by Mr. Drager, a witness called by complainant, follows: "That portion of a railroad under the jurisdiction of a super - intendent as described by your book of rules." The Burlington book of rules, which is the one referred to, define* a division (page 6) thus: "Division. That portion of a railroad assigned to the super vision of a superintendent." There is, therefore, no dispute as to the meaning of the term. §The evidence shows that divisions, as above defined, do not termin - outside of yard limits in Nebraska. Mr. Thiehoff, general manager the Burlington, lines west, testified as follows: "Q (By Mr. Clark) Mr. Thiehoff, state to the Commission where with reference to yard limits the different divisions of Omaha, Lincoln, Wymore, Sterling, Holdrege, meet ? 'A — All within the yard limits. •'Q — That is, the division stake or mark is always inside the yard limits? A— Yes, sir." Mr. Carey, superintendent of the Union Pacific Railroad company, testified as follows: '"Q — Mr. Carey, can you tell the Commission &gt;our division in Nebraska? "A — Yes, sir. "Q— Tell the Commission. 'A — Nebraska division. "Q — Is it all one division? A — Yes, sir, the Nebraska division i The testimony quoted is not disputed. Some confusion was created in the record by reference to accounting divisions which are not identical with the operating divisions. The divisions defined in the book of rules and in the testimony of Mr. Drager are operating divisions. Th e Btatute refers only to operating divisions; </seg>
            <seg id="p141">141 not to accounting divisions. The divisions of the two roads named ap - pear to be the same now as they were when the law was enacted. The law does not mention subdivisions. It is clear that light engines are run over the roads of the two carriers specified each with only an engi - neer and a fireman. A legal question is therefore presented to the Comnission: Is the law violated by moving a light engine over the road, outside of yard limits (but not from one division to another di - vision thereof*, with only an engineer and a fireman? The language appears to mean that to work a violation there must be a movement from one division to another division and such movement must be out - side of yard limits. As a guide to the construction of the statute we may examine its course in the legislature. When it was introduced as House Roll No. 57, section 1 read as follows: "Section 1. That it shall be unlawful for any railroad doing business in the state of Nebraska to operate or run over its road, or any part thereof, or to suffer or permit to be operated or run over its road, or any part thereof, outside of yard limits, any light engine which is not manned with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman and one conductor." It is obvious that under the language quoted all parts of the roads, outside of yard limits, were covered; and had the bill, as introduced, been enacted it would be unlawful to operate a light engine anywhere upon the carriers' lines, outside of yard limits, without a crew of three men. It is evident from the language above quoted and from the title of the act, that it was the intent of the introducer of the bill that it should apply generally outside of yard limits. In committee of the whole the house modified the language by striking out the words "or any part thereof and substituting the words "from one division to another division." The house journal shows the action taken, thus: (House Journal 1913, page 352) "House Roll No. 57. Amended as follows: "Eliminate the words 'or any part thereof in line 2, and substitute the words 'from one division to another division. 'Amend Section 1, line 3, by striking out the words 'or any part thereof and inserting in lieu thereof the words 'from one division to another division' — and report the same back to the House with the recommendation that it be engrossed for third reading as amended." It must be concluded from the fact that the general language of the bill was restricted by the expression "from one division to another di - vision" that the legislature did not intend that it should be unlawful to operate a light engine anywhere upon the road, outside of yard limits, without a crew of three. As all the division terminals were within yard limits and are still within yard limits, the statute really had no appli - cability then; nor has it now. The statute is neither indefinite nor un - certain; it is not ambiguous and the fact that it is not applicable to present conditions does not make it ambiguous. Just why the legisla- </seg>
            <seg id="p142">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 142 ture should have enacted such a statute is not clear. We cannot, how - ever, weigh legislative motives; we can only consider the actual language employed by the legislature. Nor can the fact that the statute has no present applicability be the test of its constitutionality. A Statute is uncoriFtituional Only when it violates the constitution; it is not uncon- Etional simply because its effect is restricted. It is valid legislation is binding upon us. This view of the meaning of the statute is also ained by an opinion of the attorney general. The Statute above referred to, soon after its enactment, was submitted to the attorney general for an opinion and the correspondence containing the question and the answer is as follow "Lincoln, November 5, 1914. Honorable Grant C. Martin, Attorney General. Dear Sir: I am directed by the Commi: ion ir. writing as to the proper sion to request of you an opin - interpretation to De placed on H'.u.-e Roll No. ."&gt;7, passed by the legislature of 1913, being the law relative to 'light engine crews.' Said law provides: •• That it -hall be unlawful for any railroad uoing business in the State of Nebraska to operate or run over its road from one division to another division, or to suffer or permit to be operated or run over its road from one division to another di - vision, outside of yard limits, any light engine which is not manned with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman and One conductor. "The Commission especially desires an interpretation of the phrase 'from one division to another division.' Here is a case in point. On October 30, 1914, light engine No. 143 of the C. Si. P. ML &amp; 0. Ry. Co. left North Yard, Omaha, and made the run over said company's line to Oakland, in charge of an engi - neer and fireman, but with no conductor. Did such light engine run constitute a violation of the statute referred to? "An early reply will be appreciated. Very truly yours, A. B. ALLEN, Secretary." -Lincoln, November 30, 1014. Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: "This office is in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in which you call attention to the provisions of House Roll 57. passed by the legislature of 1913, wherein it is provided: " "That it shall be unlawful for any railroad tloing business in the state of Nebraska to operate or run over its road from one di - vision to another division, or to suffer or permit to oe operated or run over its road from one division to another division, outside of yard limits, any light engine which is not manned with a crew con - sisting- of one engineer, one fireman, and one conductor.' You ask for the opinion of this department as to the meaning of the phrase 'from one division to another division'. '■In my judgment, said phrase means just what it says, that is to say, there must be a full crew where a light engine is run from </seg>
            <seg id="p143">143 one &lt;livi.=ion to another division, outside of the yard limits, but not necessarily a full crew where the run is merely between stations in the same division. "It is to be borne in mind that the statute in question is penal in it&lt; nature, and, hence, its provisions must be strictly construed where one is charged with a violation of the provisions thereof. In other words, the language of the statute cannot be broadened by construction, so as to make one guilty of an offense against the law who would not be guilty if the words n«e&lt;l were given their literal meaning Very respectfully, GRANT C. MARTIN, Attorney General, By Geo. W. Ayres, Deputy Attorney General.' The interpretation of the attorney general was acquiesced in for more than six years, which is additional evidence of its correctness. The statutes of Indiana ,Oregon, North Dakota and TexaS were re ferred to by complainant's counsel as being similar to the Nebraska statute. The Indiana statute relating to full crews (Burns Annotated Indiana Statutes, 11)14, Section 52951 provides that it shall be unlawful for any 'ail road company to operate over its road, or any pait thereof in the slate of na. or suffer or permit to be run over its road outside of nits ain consisting of more than fifty cars, etc., with the fol a l *\ ii i however, that a light engine without cars shall have !' ie following crew, towit: One (1) conductor, or flagman, o;,e 1 i engineer, and one &lt; 1 ) fireman." The North Dakota statute &lt; Laws of North Dakota, 1919, chapter Hi! 1 1 provides that it shall be unlawful for any railroad company oper - ating more than four trains per day operate over any of its lines, or any part thereof outside of yard limits, any freight or mixed trains consisting of more n forty ( 40i freight or other cars, exclusive of caboose and engine with less than a full train crew consisting of six (6) persons" etc. There are also provisions relating to passenger trains and to freight trains of less than forty cars, in each of which it is made un - lawful "to operate over any of its lift the yard limits" or any part thereof outside of without full crews. A proviso is added allowing and permitting that "a light engine may be manned by a crew consisting of not les: than one 1 1 &gt; conductor, one &lt; 1 ) engineer, and one ( 1 ) fireman. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 The statutes of Oregon provide (Oregon Laws, 1920, sections 5944 and 5045 » that it shall be unlawful for any railway "to operate over its road, or any part thereof, in excess Of fifteen continuous miles, or suffer or permit to be run over the same, outside of yard limits, any passenger, mail or express train con - sisting of four or more cars with less than a full passenger crew consisting of five men" etc. There are similar provisions governing freight trains with a proviso that light engines may be operated with a crew of three. The Texas statute (Complete Texas Statutes 1920, article 6574) provides as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad company, 01' receiver of any railroad company, doing business in the state of Texa.-, to run over its road, or part of its road, outside of the yard limits, any light engine without a full train crew consisting of three persons, one engineer, one fireman and one conductor." T.-e Texas statute was declared unconstitutional in M. K. &amp; T. R. R. Co. cf Texas ■»•=. State, 113 S. W. &gt;)16. In none of the statute? quoted is there any language limiting the :Ct to movements of light engine-; "from one division to another di- vision." The statutes of ..ther states have also been examined an tfUCh language has been found. We conclude that counsel for pJainatit o-as i" error in saying that tho states named had acts similar to the Nebraska act. Moreover the statute is penal in its nature and must be strictly con - strue' i. Enforcement of the statute would require prosecution and in such r. prosecution it would be necessary for the state to allege and pi'OVe that the defendant carrier was running over its road, from one division to another division, outside of yard limits, a light engine not manned with a crew consisting of one fireman, one engineer and one conductor. Under the evidence in this case it would be clearly impossible to prove that there was a movement from one division to another division outside of yard limits. There cannot be such a movement as divisions are now constitute-). /' It is contended by complainant that if the law is incomprehensible and its enforcement along the lines urged impossible the Commission has jurisdiction to issue rules, properly supported by the evidence, requiring the use of three men on each engine operated outside of yard limits. On the other hand it is contended by certain of the defendants that the legislature has spoken and that the Commission is excluded from juris - diction over the subject matter. There can be no question that the legislature at its will may occupy the field on any subject thereby excluding the Commission from further consideration within that field. The complainant urges that the legis- </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 145 lature has not occupied the field. The legislature of 1921 considered this section of the statutes upon a bill to amend it. At that time re - presentatives of various carriers urged that the Commission had juris - diction and the legislature was so impressed with that argument as to refuse to consider the bill at length. This conclusion may have some support in the finding of the supreme court in the case of State of Nebraska ex rel. Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Clarks, et al. 96 Neb. 566, wherein it is said: "The preneral power of the State Railway Commission as applied to passenger traffic, is limited to rates below the maximum fixed by the two-cent fare law. The legislature in specifically fixing the maximum passenger rate and in conferring generally upon the State Railway Commission power to regulate or abolish passenger rates, left the State Railway Commission free to change or abolish rates within the bounds thus set by the law-makers." No general rule can be laid down as to whether or not legislative m is sufficiently broad to occupy a given field. The question must always be determined by the language of the particular act, aided by an examination of the legislative history of the law. Without prejudice to other cases that may and probably will arise we are of the opinion that the legislature has in this particular instance occupied the field to the exclusion of the Commission. It follows, therefore, that being without riscliction we cannot pass upon the evidence presented in this case and ach a conclusion on the question as to whether a pilot should be placed on each light engine operated by defendants. The complaint will be dismissed.

OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Chairman Complainants are, or were at the time of the filing of this complaint officers, soldiers and civilians living or employed at Ft. Crook, am citizens of Bellevue, all of whom are served by the Omaha &amp; Southen Interurban Railway company, which operates from a terminus and section with the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railwav compai 24th and N streets in South Omaha to Ft. Crook, a distance of &gt;iji| mately seven and one-half miles. Defendant (Omaha &amp; Souther terurban Raiilway company) constructed and now owns six milt this roadway, the other mile and a halt' belonging to the O Council Bluffs Street Railway company, trackage rights bei it. The service over this line at the piesent time consi every hour from 24th anil N streets, South Omaha, to Ft. Cr ■ix o'clock a. m. and three o'clock p. m. and a cai every th between three o'clock p. m. ami six (.'clock | car every hour from six o'clock p. m. to midnij v fifteen cents is charged between Ft. Crook and 2lth and X twenty tickets are sold for $2.50. Lesser fares, ba charged between intermediate points. Xo transfers are cxcha tween defendant and the system of the Oiv.aha &amp; Council Bluffs Stree Railway company, thus making it nece.-sary to pay the regular fare seven cents, or four tickets for twenty-rive cents, by those passeng desiring to continue up town to the business section of Omaha. The combined cash fare, therefore, from Ft. Crook to any point on the system of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company is twenty-two cents. The combined ticket fare would he 18 3-4 cents. Complainants allege that the present service is inadequate and in - sufficient. The complaint as to inadequacy of service has reference to the frequency of service during the day, and particularly to the service furnished at the congested period at 4:30 in the afternoon, at which time employes at Ft. Crook are dismissed for the day. Complainants also demand that a through service between Ft Crook and the business section </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 147 of Omaha be provided so as to obviate the necessity of transfer in South Omaha. The original complaint asked that this continuous service be rendered for the one fare now applying between Ft. Crook and 24th and N streets. At the hearing, however, this request was waived and com - plainants indicated their willingness to pay the combined fare. Defendant answers by admitting that the car leaving Ft. Crook at 4:30 p. m. each day except Saturday and Sunday is crowded with passengers until it reaches Bellevue; admits that there has been some increase in the num - ber of passengers carried by defendant since the present schedule of feres went into effect; but alleges that said defendant's revenue from all sources is as yet insufficient to defray the costs of operating and maintaining its property and pay the taxes against the same and a fair return upon the value of the property. It files a cross-petition, setting reneral that it has operated the interurban line at a substantial •ouffhout its entire history, notwithstanding a prudent, economical icient management, and asks that the complaint be dismissed and cross-petitioner be authorized to discontinue the sale of tickets substitute therefor the regular cash fares between all points on its &gt;stance the evidence adduced at a two-day hearing at Omaha lie allegation by complainants as to the crowded condition of ng Ft. Crook at 4:30 in the afternoon each day except Sat - anday. Complainants' allegation that the car carried from one hundred to one hundred fifteen passengers is hardly by the record, although the company's own admission shows umber ranged from seventy to one hundred twenty-two. As 1 previously, the large load at 4:30 is occasioned by the fact k for the day at the post ends at that hour. It is shown that t are insufficient quarters at the post to house all of the soldiers vilians and that a number of the latter find it necessary to live Bellevue and Omaha. The majority of these, it was shown, make ir home in Bellevue. It follows, therefore, that the congestion on car is worse between Ft. Crook and Bellevue than between other points. Considerable stress was placed by complainants upon the fact that the Government recently made Ft. Crook the headquarters for the seventh corps area, which has a supervisory control over military affairs in several adjoining states. The establishment of these headquarters brought several officers and about two hundred fifty troops. In addi - tion, from one hundred sixty to two hundred civilians are employed from- time to time at the post. Claims made by complainants that the territory between Omaha and Ft. Crook has been settling rapidly are not borne out by the evidence. While some tracts have been open - ed up and sold and some development has resulted therefrom, the popu - lation is not shown to have materially increased over what it was several years ago. Defendant contends, and it is established by the testimony, that </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 the traffic on this line fluctuates greatly, due to the frequent and un - expected changes at Ft. Crook due to government orders. The de - fendant operates two cars on this line in order to maintain the present schedule of service. These caTs seat forty passengers. It %a ad - mitted that when one hundred or more passengers are loaded onto these cars that it results in much congestion and great inconvenience to the riders. It is shown by the record, however, that from one-third to one - half of these passengers get off at Bellevue, so that the crowded con - dition applies only to that point. The post dismisses its employes at twelve o'clock Saturday, so that a similar condition applies to the 12:30 car on that day. Conditions have changed somewhat since the heaving on this complaint and it is shown by reports submitted by the company, I the request of the Commission, that the traffic is not now as heavy it was. For example, it is shown that for the days from March 14 March 21, inclusive, the loading on the 4:30 car ranged from fourteen on Saturday, March 18, to seventy-nine on March 21. It appears to_ be averaging about sixty-five or seventy. This falling off in number of passengers is borne out also by the income statements submitted by the company for the months of January and February, li)22, which l'Cveal a falling off in passenger revenue of approximately $400 per month. The financial affairs of defendant have been under review by this Commission at previous times and we found it necessary to authorize an increase of rates two or three years ago, which rates are still in effect. ; It is shown in this record, however, that the line continues to operate at a loss, taking into account a return upon the fair value of the property. Consideration should be given, of course, to the fact that all of the property of the company is owned by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company and that it is in effect one of the numerous lines operated by that system, the separate company be - ing made necessary under the state law applying to electric lines oper - ating outside of municipalities. Complainants make much of the inconvenience and discomfort occasioned by the transfer from the interurban to the city cars at 24th and N streets in Omaha. It is not shown, however, that this inconvenience is any greater than attends transfers from one car to another at any time. It is clear that the conditions surrounding the operation of this line would not justify a through car from Ft. Crook to the business section of Omaha. . Aside from the practical operating conditions involved and the disarrangement of other schedules, the added cost would make it prohibitive. Nor does it appear practicable to attempt to substitute for a portion of the journey other cars operat - ing to Albright or to other sections of Omaha. It does appear that if the traffic at 4:30 should continue as large as it was prior to the hearing on this camplaint some added service </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 149 should be provided by defendant. It is not clear that such congestion exists at the present time, however. The company quite vigorously objects to the use of a trailer, urging, first, that it has no car avail - able for such service, and, second, that the operation of such a car would be attended by danger due to the speed which it is necessary to maintain on this line in order to make the schedule. It is also claimed that the voltage of the power line at the outer terminus is too low during the peak hours to handle successfully two loaded cars at the same time. This is disputed by complainants and evidence was submitted to show that two heavily loaded cars were operated from Ft. Crook to 24th and N streets, one following the other, and that both made the regular schedule. As indicated, the Commission is of the opinion that should the traffic continue as heavy as it was for the few months prior to the hearing on this complaint defendants should be required either to operate a trailer between Ft. Crook and Bellevue or to put on a second car over the entire route. At present, however, it would not appear that such added service is necessary. We shall re - tain jurisdiction of the complaint, however, and will require the com - pany to submit every thirty days for the next six months a traffic statement regarding the loading on this 4:30 car. Should this state - ment disclose congestion, further order will be marie. In view of descending costs of operation and of the improved financial showing made by the company in 1921 under the increased - rates authorized by the Commission it does not appear wise at this time to make any further change in the rates, as requested by the company. The application anil cross-petition will, therefore, be dismissed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Omaha &amp; Southern In - terurban Railway company file with this Commission a statement every thirty days, showing the number of passengers carried daily at 4:30 p. m. on its cars between Ft. Crook and 24th and N streets, Omaha, such statement to show the passengers carried between the various stations on the line. Such statement should also show the day and the hour whenever any other car carries to exceed seventy-five passen - gers on any trip. This statement shall be filed for a period of six months commencing April 1, 1922. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the prayer in the cross-petition of defendant with respect to rates be and the same is hereby dis - missed.

For defendant, Jesse L. Root, attorney; F. Montmorency, general freight agent. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: t Complainant in this case is engaged in the disposal of garbage m the city of Omaha under contract with that municipality. Prior 1920 this garbage was fed to hogs in the outskirts of the city of :aha, where it was delivered by wagons. Successful injunction pro - itfngs to abate a nuisance forced complainant to seek other feeding ■unds. These were secured at Sand Spur east of Cedar Creek on Kendant's line of railroad, a distance of approximately nineteen and -half aides from Omaha. The first shipments of garbage were made on April 3, 1920, moved under Class E rates at six cents per hundred weight. Ne iations had been in progress prior to this for a commodity rate am the allocation to this service alone of certain obsolete gondola i These gondola cars were equipped, at the expense of complainant, covers and hatches and with run-boards along the side of the cai E convenience of trainmen. Apparently the cars were not compl&lt; ipped and ready for service until the middle of June, 1920. In intime defendant had allowed the use of regular gondola ears. Class E rates were collected at the rate of 6 cents per hundred weight on all shipments to September 1, lf&gt;20, and between September 1, and September 27 at the rate of 7% cents per hundred weight. On September 27, 1920, the commodity rate of $27 per car was authorized by the Nebraska Commission on application of the carrier. This rate Cmained in effect until March 10, 1921. At that time, because of chnical wording of the superior order of the Interstate Commerce Commission regarding the level of rates within the state of Nebraska, defendant cancelled the commodity rate and restored Class E rates, which, by the same order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, had been raised to eight cents per hundred weight On April 15, 1921, upon representations by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission amended its order of January 27, 1921, and eliminated the unintentional effect of its language and there - by permitted the restoration of various changes in rates between July 29, 1920, and January 27, 1921, which had been made with the consent </seg>
            <seg id="p151">151 of all parties concerned. Under the amended language the defendant, on June 27, 1921, re-issued its tariff supplement providing the com - modity carload rate of $27, which had been in effect from September to March. Since June 27, 1921, shipments have continued to move at the carload commodity rate. Complainant alleges that during the periods April 3, l!&gt;20, to Sep - tember 27, 1920, and between March 10, 1921, and June 27, 1921, he was rhargsd an umeasonable and excessive rate for the movement of garbage between Omaha and Sand Spur, Nebraska; that during the first period the total freight charges were $3,549.83, ami that during the second period tne total freight charges paid were $3,541.43; that these rates were excessive, unreasonable and discriminatory during the first period to the extent of $1,281.83 and interest thereon, and during the second period in amount $1,650.35 and interest thereon; that this Commission has the power, under sections 6107, 6108, 6125, 6126, 6127 and 0128, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, after hearing the evidence, to determine what should have been a reasonable and just rate during the periods in controversy, and to make a finding as to the arge and an order of repaiatien against defendant. plaint submitted evidence to support its contention that da- had admitted verbally, through its officers, in written state - 1 in formal pleading before the Interstate Commerce Commis- t the rate charged was too high and 1 that it had expressed will - to make refund of the excess amounts were it not prevented iej;al authority to n.ake the refund and by its in- j to find any regulating body with the authority to order the re- Other evidence was presented to show in a comparative way that lates charged were excessive and that on this low grade commodity Ttmgs ami the per car mile earnings were consider- pei ably greater than on shipments of higher grade commodities between the identical points. In Exhibit 3 these comparisons were submitted in evi- ich the following tabulation is made: ( 1". C. M. P. T.

Complainant presented also, as comparison, the average earnings Garbage at 8c per ewt. Sand at 2 fee per cwt. _ Corn •Sand at 3% c per cwt.. </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 tl920 of all freight in Nebraska as shown in the annual report of defendant to the Nebraska State Railway Commission. We do not consider this comparison of value because of the much longer average haul as compared with the freight complained of, thereby leaving no comparable relation of terminal cost to average road haul. In his brief complainant states it is not claimed that the Commis - sion has the power to issue an order of reparation binding as such without bringing an action at law, and proceeds to state that it is the duty of the Commission, however, to determine to what extent com - plainant has been overcharged and that this decision will, under Ne - braska statute, be priira facie evidence in an action in court. In other words, complainant's position appears to be that under the Railway Commission Act and the sections heretofore mentioned the powers of Commission to award reparation are equal to those of the Inter- Commerce Commission within the proper sphere. In part of its testimony defendant was not willing to concede that the rate was excessive. It put in testimony to show that the traffic is so repulsive as to warrant the rate charged and that under the peculiar operating conditions existing and an unusual amount of switching at Oreapolis an added cost is made necessary. In Other parts of its testimony defendant appears to have admitted that if it handled the traffic at all the rate charged under Class E was too high. The position of defendant, aside from this, as presented in answer and in supporting brief, may be summarized as follows: That Class E rates were the proper tariff rates to apply prior to the publication of the commodity rate and that the lack of a commodity rate did not establish that the class rate was excessive. That this Commission had no jurisdiction under Nebraska statutes at the time these shipments moved to order reparation and that it is now outside its jurisdiction to find any rates on traffic moving prior to July 29, 1921, unjust and discriminatory, or to make an order against the railroad company for reparation. That as to that part of the first period prior to September 1, 1920, »i Commission was without power to order reparation, even though were admitted that Nebraska law did give that power, because of the provisions of the Transportation Act, section 208a, which reads: "But prior to September 1, 1920, no such rate, fare or charge (in effect February 29, 1920) shall be reduced, anil no such classi - fication, regulation, or practice shall be charged in such manner as to reduce any such rate, fare or charge, unless such reduction or change is approved by the Commission." That as to the second period, assuming the challenged jurisdiction under the provisions of the state law, the Nebraska Commission is without authority either to find that the rate was unreasonable or to </seg>

Consideration of Evidence and Pleadings Three distinct questions are involved in this case. 1. Was the Class E rate excessive and unreasonable for garbage moved between Omaha and Sand Spur, Nebraska, during the dates March 1, 1920, to September 27, 1920, and March 10, 1921, to June 27, 1921? 2. If, from the evidence, it appears clear that the rate was un - reasonable and excessive, has this Commission the power under Ne - braska law, unless otherwise restrained, to award reparation? 3. . Is this Commission estopped by the terms of section 208a of the federal Transportation Act of 1920 and later by the terms of the federal injunction against the Nebraska Commission and the attorney general from either finding that the rates were unreasonable and ex - cessive or from entering: an order on the subject? Was the Rate Unreasonable and Excessive? While there is some contradictory evidence on the part of the defendant, the record is full of admissions by defendant's witnesses that it has always considered *he rate too high, particularly the evidence in the testimony of Mr. Montmorency. He testified (transcript p. 38) that he had discussed with the predecessor of complainant the question of rate on garbage to Sand Spur and that he had told the shipper that he would recom - irend a rate of $20 per car. He did recommend this rate to his superior officers at Chicago, who were reluctant to agree because of the nature of the traffic. The Western Trunk Lane Committee, an inter-railroad organization, with no apparent legal powers, also opposed the rate. Hence, the delay until September 27, 1920, in the publication of the commodity rate. In the meantime the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion had authorized a thirty-five per cent increase in all class and commodity rates except intrastate upon the assumption that state authorities would follow suit. Hence, when the application was made to the Nebraska Commission it was for a rate of $27 per cnr, which included the thirty-five per cent increase. The cancellation of the rate on March 10, 1921, was made under the urge of the wording of the Interstate Commerce Commission's order in Docket No. 11829, relating to Nebraska rates, and not because the carrier desired to pub - lish the higher rate (tr. 39). The language of the order of the Inter - state Commerce Commission was amended on April 15. The delay between that date and June 27, 1921, was due to the fact that the carrier was not sure that the amended language left it free to re - publish this commodity rate, as well as a large number of other rates </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT held in suspense. When finally the reissue \\a&gt; made, effective June 27, 11)21 , it was made without any other authority than that contained in the amendatory language of the Interstate Commerce Commission of April 15. 1921. The defendant made application to the Interstate Commerce Com - mission for authority to make refund down to $27 per car on the ship - ments moving; between March 10 and June 27. 1921, and in that appli - cation (ti\ 45) the carrier voluntarily stated that it wa- making this application because the rates legally applicable during the period were '•under all the circumstances and conditions then existing excessive and unreasonable''. The carrier did not seek authority to make refund en the shipments under class rates in 1920 because of a general policy on the part of defendant not to ask for reparation in connection with lates that have been reduced for such shipments as moved prior to the voluntary reduction (tr. 421, and not because the rate was any the less high relatively in 1920 than in 1921. The carrier doe^ not contend that the action of the Nebraska Com - mi.-Mon, effective August 26. l!»20. increasing the Class E rate twenty - five per cent, was a finding that the resulting rate was reasonable. The action of the Nebraska Commission in authorizing a twenty-five per cent increase was for revenue purposes only and had nothing to do with findings as to reasonableness of an isolated rate as compared with rates on analogous shipmen Additional to the very flank testimony of Mr. MontmOl'l have the comparative rates between the same points on other as has been set forth in the tabulation heretofore, all of wMet to us to bear out the general contention of complainant. Did the Commission Have Power Under the Nebraska La'w i'rior to July 29, 1921, to Award Reparation if Free from Court Restraint V Complainant reads in sections 6107, 6108, 6125, 6126, 6127 and 6128, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1!&gt;13, the power of the Commission to hear complaints relative to rates and upon the testimony render a decision "revising, modifying ami annulling: the rates complained of herein as excessive and unreasonable, and establish in lieu thereof just and reasonable rates" and that they do give it the power to award reparation where the testimony warrants the conclusion that the. rate was unreasonable and excessive, even though duly filed in proper tariffs. We agree with defendant that this is a strained interpretation of the law. The Commission considered this matter very carefully ill Formal Complaints Nos. 41, 42 and 56, Samuel Kattz, et al. vs. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway Co., and found that under the provisions of the Railway Commission Act the Nebraska Commis - sion had no power to award reparation on shipments moving under proper filed tariffs prior to the time of finding that the rate was un - reasonable and excessive and ordering a reduction thereon. This </seg>
            <seg id="p155">155 position of the Commission was reiterated in several annual reports to the governor, in which it was recommended that the legislature so amend the Railway Commission Act as to give the Commission the power to award reparation. Such action was not taken by the legis - lature until the 1921 session, at which time it passed chapter 229, authorizing the Commission to award reparation where any party com - phiinant "has on and after the taking effect of this Act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint paic! unjust or unreasonable rates or charges to any defendant railroad or express company in this state on intrastate traffic" and authorizing the Com - mission to make an order directing defendant carrier to pay the com - plainant the sum to which he is entitled on or before a date named. All the circumstances herein stated warrant the Commission in adher- its previous declaration that the Railway Commission Act, as l passed in 1907, and all subsequent amendments or additional legislation prior to January 29, 1921, failed to give the Commission authoritv to award reparation. I This conclusion disposes of all other points raised with the ex ception of that contention on the part of the defendant that the inter- locutory order of injunction issued February 21, 1921, by the federal court prevents this Commission from even adjudging "the rates as- sailed in this complaint as excessive, illegal or discriminatory or in any manner unlawful". It is quite probable that had the Commission the power to award reparation on intrastate shipments prior to 1920 the provisions of section 208a would have prevented it from acting or the shipments moving between April 8, 1020, and September 1, 1020, under the Class E rates and that reparation on such shipments would have to uttered by the Interstate Commerce Commission. We do not agree with the defendant that the interlocutory in - junction prevents the Commission from saying that the rates charged are shown in evidence presented to this Commission to have been ex - cessive and unreasonable to the extent that they exceeded $27 per carload. By the testimony of defendant, itself, it is clearly shown that the carload rate of $27 included, in its estimation, the full thirty - five per cent advance authorized and ordered by the Interstate Com - merce Commission in Ex Parte 74. The order of the Interstate Com - merce Commission in Docket No. 11829 required the carrier to remove the discrimination existing in Nebraska against interstate comn'erce by advancing the intrastate rates to the full amount of the increases authorized under Ex Parte 74. Such full amount of increase was made in the commodity rate established by tariff of defendant, effective September 27, 1920, and now carried in item 22727 twentieth revised page 449 C. B. &amp; Q. G. F. 0. 5000 B. This fact is further attested by the re-issue by carrier of the commodity carload rate under the provisions of the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket No. 11829. </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 The interlocutory injunction prevents the Commission from at - tempting to apply the penalties of the Railway Commission Act for the publication and collection of other rates than those authorized by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, or from doing any act that would prevent, or tend to prevent, the plaintiff, its agents or servants, from collecting intrastate freight and passenger rates, fares and charges within the state of Nebraska as authorized, ordered and established by the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission on the 27th day of January, 1021, in its Docket No. 11829. In our opinion, even if the Covrmission had had the power to award reparation during this second period between March 10 and June 27, 1921, on the shipments in question and should now do so it would not be in any way a violation of the interlocutory injunction, or of the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket No. 11829. Certainly, under our finding that even if the rates are excessive and unreasonable we have no power to grant relief to this complainant, the rights of defendant are in no wise prejudiced. We therefore find that from .ill the evidence- presented in this case the rates charged by defendant for moving garbage from Omaha to Sand Spur, Nebraska, between April 3, 1920, and September 27, 1920, and between March 10, 1921, and June 27, 1921, were excessive and unreasonable to the extent thai they exceeded $27 per carload; and we find further that this Commission L&lt; without jurisdiction to enter an order in the premises and for that reason the complaint must be dis - missed.

SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: tomes now the respondent, Frank Henry, and asks leave to with - draw from further operation the bus line in question between South Omaha and Ralston for the reason that it is no longer profitable under existing rates. He sets forth that the Commission's required schedules have detracted from his volume of business and that a strike at the South Omaha packing houses has deprived him of much of the remain - der of his business. He does not feel that he can ask for an increase in rates under competitive conditions. This respondent notified the Commission some time ago that an accident had made it impossible for him to operate one of the busses and that he was suspending schedules temporarily. This suspension, we understand, continues. The Commission knows in a general way that the allegations in the petition are correct. It does not, however, know that the respondent is unable to operate profitably. Said re - spondent will be required, on or before January 20, 1922, to file with the Commission a statement as to volume of business, receipts and ex - penses during the period from December 10, 1921, to the time the accident caused suspension of traffic. Pending such information the commission will authorize continued suspension as a temporary exped - ient until it has sufficient data to finally pass on the application.

SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING h Kmu in 1 . Commissioner olved in this complaint are set forth in detail in this case, dated November 25, 11)21. This supple- i n ith an additional prayer of complainant. Omaha i a lilway &amp; Light company, contained in its reply dated aver being as follows plainant further prays the Commission to n-ake and enter order that no person, co-partnership or corporation other icipal corporation shall, after the taking effect of arid in business as a common carrier of passengers be- state of Nebraska and not within the same here is already in operation a public utility igaged in similar service, without first securing from the Nebraska ate Railway Commission a declaration after a , ublic hearing of II parties interested that public convenience and necessity require idi second public utility." At the time of the hearing in this case it was agreed by com - plainant that the additional prayer would have no effect on respondent but that it was intended as a general rule for future common carriers of passengers who might hereafter enter into the business. Hence, respondent was not particularly interested in the matters to be covered in this supplemental opinion and did not file a brief. At the time of the hearing it was directed of record that the matters contained in the additional prayer should be separately briefed and considered by the </seg>
            <seg id="p160">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 160 Commission independently of the contention in the original complaint to the end that the two matters might not become entangled. No objection was offered to this method of handling the matter. Stated briefly, complainant asks the Commission to recognize its jurisdiction over common carriers of persons within the state of Ne - braska as extending far enough to authorize it, in the absence of any other authority than that now vested in it, to require a certificate of convenience and necessity from the Commission by any common carrier not now engaged in that business within the confines of the state before it may undertake such service. Complainant insists lhat such jurisdiction now lie? within the hands of the Commission and relies in support of that conclusion on three Nebraska citations and a considerable number of citations from other states. The three Nebraska citations are: (a) The constitutional provision creating the Commission, which says that the powers and duties of the Commission shall include the regulation of such service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide "but in the absence of specific legislation the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumer - ated in this provision". (b) The decision of the Nebraska supreme court in The Lincoln Traction Co. v. City of Lincoln. 103 Neb. 22!». where the court discusses the jurisdiction of the Commission i language: "Unless there has been specific legislation that might lir affect this power given to the Commission, it would seem th; people have given this Commission all the control over c-o carriers that they themselves could exercise." (c) The above language approved in effect by the court ii Blackledge v. farmers Independent Telephone Co. of Red Cloud, P. U. R. 1921-C, 668; 105 Neb. 718 181 K. W. 70! (14 N. S. R. C. 609 ) ber of decisions by courts and commissions, the effect in the main of which is to show that generally regulating commissions have deemed competition between automobile busses and street railway lines as detrimental to the public interest and that they have generally as commissions refused to allow the operation of the competitor and as courts have sustained the action of regulatory commissions and muni - cipalities in eliminating such competition. No hearing is necessary in this matter. If the Commission has the power to issue such an order as that prayed it does not deprive any person affected hereafter by such order of his opportunity to be heard, which opportunity would be presented in consideration of the ad visa- </seg>
            <seg id="p161">161 bility of issuing a certificate. Each case would, therefore, rest on its own footing. The cases cited by counsel for complainant are inter - esting as showing the trend of "egulation in other states but hardly helpful in the rr.atter now before us for decision. Years ago the Commission .spoke positively to the effect that effective regulation and competition were not compatible and that where they existed it was quite possible that either the public paid a larger amount for a definite quantity of service or the service interfered with by reason of the area. In of rival competitors was seriously restricted field in the competition Peoples Telephone Co., &lt;8&gt; NT 205. Application No. 223(5 S. R. C. Annual Report the Commission said that if it had the power it would prevent the contemplated duplication of telephone service in that case. There are many situations whtre such additional service as a competitor will offer is highly advantageous to the public, but in manv others nothing but harm can result in the long run. • But this case does not rest upon the soundness of the principle of regulating con. petition. It presents for consideration: First, has the Commission the power to require the certificate of convenience and necessity in the absence of specific legislation on the subject and Second, does the situation presented by competition of motor ve - hicle busses with electric and steam transportation companies war- iancc- of the general order prayed for if the authority so rant to is to issue is found to rest within the Commission. If the first question is answered in the negative the second requires no answer. It may be that the court on further consideration of its language in The Lincoln Traction Co. v. City of Lincoln, supra, would not inter - pretate it u going so far as the interpretation presented here by counsel. It may be that the court spoke a little more broadly than it would be willing to sustain on further consideration. It seems per - fectly clear that the legislature has certain potential powers with re - lation to common carriers that the Comn-ission does not have. It may grant the use of the right of eminent domain by public corpora - tions not now having that right, but it could hardly be said that in the absence of negative attitude by the legislature this Commission could delegate any such power. The legislature may apply penalties for violation of commission orders which now carry no specific pen - alties, but it is very doubtful that this Commission would be upheld if attempting to apply penalties for violation of its orders where penal - ties are not by statute set forth. These are merely examples. In considering the power of the legislature as compared with that </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 granted to the Commission it is difficult to get correct parallels. The power of the legislature extends to everything within this state not withheld from it by the federal and state constitutions. The police power of the legislature over common carriers merges gradually with its police power in other regards and it is sometimes a little difficult to find where the one ends and the other begins. The legislature maj control. It may rpnuii in n serve indirectly to bring such elimination to p The conclusion must be that the Commission has no jurisdiction a to do the tiling prayed for in the additional prayer of complainant. It is not, therefore, necessary to consider the further question of whether the competition now existing or threatened in the transportation of gnnt charters to common carriers or may withhold them or impose specific restrictions in Its grants.

In that case, however, it was urged upon the Commission that in carrying out the mandate of the stocks and bonds act, article 18, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, it should construe certain expressions in that act as giving it the power to inquire into the necessity for issuing and selling securities for the purpose of estab - lishing a competing cemmon carrier in a definite territory and to de - cide affirmatively or adversely upon whether there was need for the duplication. The Commission's conclusion was that such an interpre - tation of the statute \iolated its intent and its plain phrasing. In the instant case we have been asked to arrive at the same destination in another vehicle, hut for the reasons stated above we do not do so. ORDEIJ IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the additional prayer of the Omaha &amp; Lincoln Railway &amp; Light company, which prayer reads that "the Commission made and entered a general order that no person - partnership or corporation other than a municipal corporation shall, alter the taking effect of said order, engage in business as a common carrier of passengers between points within the state of Nebraska and not within the same city or village where there is already in operation a public utility engaged in similar service, without first securing from the Nebraska State Railway Commission a declaration after a public hearing of all parties interested that public conven - ience and necessity require such second public utility" t hereby is denied.

The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, Defendant OPINION AND FINDING Cook. Commissioner: tThe complainants, under oath, in this matter state that the public nags of The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company on ier side of mile post 541 in Cass county. Nebraska, are extremely igerous to life and property for the reason that both crossings in tstion are approoche&lt;l hy the trains through deep cuts, making- it icnlt for the users of the highway to see approaching trains. They te that there arc no signals or danger signs maintained at these ssings for the purpose of warning the public. They are asking this nmission to require improvements that will eliminate the danger as The Commissi natle a careful examination of the conditions at these crossings and after repeated requests of defendant company to improve the safety features complained of without result set the matter down for hearing, the investigation and hearing being at Alvo December 16, 1921. before Commissioner Cook. The opening statement by Carl D. Ganz. attorney for coirplainuiu.-, supporting the statement set out in complainants' petition, was followed by the statement of Judge E. P. Holmes, attorney for the defendant company, in which he frankly admitted that the crossings in question should be improved as to Bafety conditions; that the defendant com - pany was willing and ready to do its part ii\ making such improvements without further action by the Commission ; that from their experience and judgment, supported by their engineering department, they re - commended the elimination of the east crossing (said crossing being only about 300 feet separate from the west crossing*, the county to acquire along the right-of-way of defendant company a strip of ground on which they should grade and open for public use a roadway to ac - commodate the traveling public which would be denied the use of the east crossing. The attorney for defendant company further stated that if the county commissioners would make this change the railway com - pany would let a contract for the removal of the high bank on either sid e ,of its roadway for the purpose of making the west crossing safe as far as seeing approaching trains; that they would also make the improvements requested at the two crossings within the village of Alvo. The county commissioners stated that they would be satisfied with an arrangement of this nature, eliminating one crossing, the county to provide a roadwav to connect the crossings, the railway company to </seg>
            <seg id="p165">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 165 remove the high bank along its right-of-way near the west crossing and make the change* asked for by the village of Alvo. It seemed clear to the Commission that with both parties agreeing to do the thing sought by complainants and, with the defendant anxious and willing to cooperate in the improvement to an extent that seemed entirely just, a recess should be granted for action. This was done. In support of this tentative agreement, and in the absence of a mplete reeord, the following copy of a letter written to the Commis - on by complainants' attorney will show that the county started action in the direction of cooperation: "Answering yours of the 7th relative to the ground for the im - provement of dangerous crossing east of Alvo will say that I have taken this matter up with Mr. G. P. Cook and he informs me that he has already sold this necessary land to the county ami that they have already agreed upon the price, so I presume that this phase of the matter is settled." It transpires that after one year the county has not taken any further action to close one crossing or to provide a roadway to connect with the west crossing, nor has it in any way shown a disposition to - wards the fulfillment of the tentative agreement. The Commission has from time to time written the complainants, also the railway com - pany, without success as to action. With these conditions existing it A - ould seem fair to the Commission to enter an order in this matter without further delay. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company be and it is hereby ordered to remove the high bank along its right - of-way near the west crossing in question, near mile post 541, Cass county, Nebraska, the work to extend a sufficient distance so that the users of the crossing may see approaching trains, the improvement to be commenced within sixty days time after the county commissioners have closed the east crossing and provided a roadway to the west cross - ing for the use of the public. The work of the railway company is to be continued without delay until completed. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twentieth day of December, 1922. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, H. G.

The relief prayed for is that the outbound pas - senger train, known as No. 309, be required to leave Fremont not earlier than 3:50 p. m. where such train now leaves at 1:38 p. m. ■Prior to October, 1920, this particular train had for very many years left Omaha in the early evening, arriving at Fremont at 7:30 p. m. and reaching its destination at Oakdale about 1:00 a. m. The inbound morning train, known as No. 310, ran as at present. The schedules gave persons going to Omaha about four hours in that city and a chance to return the same day and if they desired to stop in Fremont eight hours time in which to transact business and return the same day. After an extended hearing on complaint of the town of Newman Grove the Commission was so impressed with the serious inconveniences suffered by the people on the west half of the branch line as to order the North Western to advance the leaving time of No. 309 from Omaha sufficiently that it could make connection with No. 6 eastbound at Scribner and thereby conclude its run in the early hours of the night and make connections with westbound main line trains at Oakdale.

            <seg id="p168">168 ration it served best the territory affected. Defendant refused to ider the business interests of Fremont as of equal importance to interests of patrons residing at towns on the branch. (Testimony in the case again presented the conflicting interests of east and west ends of the branch as it was set forth in our hearing August 1920. It presented also the old story of the interests of bing points in their relation to the interests of out-state railroad rons in passenger train service, and also the time-honored question of relative importance of mail and express service as compared with importance of seasonable service to those who ride the trains. There can be no question, after listening to the evidence, but that Fremont retailers and jobbers find the present operation of the train disadvantageous as compared with the service from their point of view if a longer period existed each day between the arrival of the east - bound passenger and the departure of the westbound passenger. Whether witnesses lingered longer on the disadvantages than their im - portance warranted only they themselves can know. We must take the testimony as it stands on the question of whether very many merchant - on the branch line mail hurry-up orders for goods rather than telephone tthe orders and expect these orders thus made through the mails to filled and delivered on the same day; and whether or not these country ,-n merchants who failed to secure their goods on the day on which y were ordered by mail just went without the goods or ordered them ne other place. No witness was able to testify as to whether the sent train service drove their regular patrons to other jobbing point.-. • did we have any detailed testimony as to the extent of los =iness as a result of the unsatisfactory train service. The service to the towns in the north part of Dodge county having Fremont daily newspapers is particularly irritating. Under the schedules existing prior to the fall of 1920 Fremont evening papers were available at towns on the branch soon after the opening of the postoffice the next morning, several hours earlier than was the case at the time of the hearing. Some time prior to the hearing the railroau company had ceased to operate freight trains Nos. 339 and 340 east of Scribner. Pouch mail had been carried from Fremont on No. 339 and thereby Omaha evening papers and mail likewise for Fremont had been available at the east end of the branch line in time for rural routes that day. We were unable to consider mail interests a sufficient warrant for the operation of these freight trains between Scribner and Fremont. Freight business has, however, improved and the trains are now being operated from Fremont in place of from Scribner, thus restoring what - ever mail advantage existed thereby. It ought approximately to relieve the newspaper disadvantage. The Clarkson situation was purely local, largely created by reason of a banking house having branches on the Hastincrs branch of the "Vorth Western </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 169 In considering the testimony presented by respondents in opposition to another change in train service, and hence in opposition to complain - ants, we have given due consideration to the fact that the interests of merchants in the larger cities and the interests of merchants at country towns often conflict. These are financial interests and in our opinion must be secondary to passenger train service for those who ride the ains. If both interests can be served properly that creates the best iossible service. When there is conflict the convenience of those who iile the trains and pay the fare must take precedence. In our original finding we expressed considerable sympathy for those patrons of defendant who resided at Loretta, Petersburg and Elgin because of the unseasonable hours which for thirty years had been theirs in train service. These towns in testifying in this case xpressed deep concern over the possibility that they might again be equired to suffer their former serious inconveniences. The proposal &gt;f complainants did not make the situation as serious as it had been iiior to 1920 but the witnesses from the three towns were reluctant to surrender any of the advantages claimed by them from present train -ervice. They were fully supported in this position by the towns of Newman Grove and Lindsay, which, however, were more interested in mail and express and less in passenger train service than those towns of Albion Additional to the testimony many petitions were filed in the case. These petitions are subject to whatever criticism applies generally to petitions. For example, the one witness from Leigh desired the train turned to its late night schedule. He was supported by a petition. &lt;e village trustees, through the village clerk, filed a written state- ient urging that the train schedule be not changed. Petitions of ap - roxiroately equal size were presented from Howells, the one support- g- complainant's position and the other opposing it. The genial editor imed then" both. One of the witnesses from Howells, who opposed le contention of the Fremont Commercial club, signed a petition 'avoring it. Citizens of Snyder signed the petition asking that the -chedule go back to the late night service. The one witness from Snyder favored the Fremont contention of a schedule midway between present an&lt;l the old schedule. Much testimony was presented relative to the desire of people to to Fremont and Omaha and return the same day, particularly the desire of stockmen to make such a journey. This same testimony had &gt;.een presented in the previous hearing. In this later hearing nobody testified personally as to his own desire to make round trips in one day. Our own early investigation was that few people made the round trip in one day when opportunity afforded. The petition of complainant asked for a train schedule which would &lt;rive increased opportunity for people to come to Fremont and return </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 the same day and to handle orders from towns on the branch line in one day, but did not extend this advantage to the merchants and jobbers of Omaha. This fact, no doubt, was mere coincidence as complainants were attempting to strike a happy medium of advantage to themselves without disadvantage to the people on the branch. Without question, the ideal train service, both to the people on the nch and to Fremont business interests, would be an early train as present eastbound and a rather late train westbound with another passenger train each way running on approximately opposite schedules. This was the demand of patrons on the branch at the time of the hear- Ein 1920 and it was found at that time the revenues could not sus - the additional service, and such passenger revenues are worse nov. - l they were ihen. It is therefore out of the question to offer that solution. If Fremont business considerations could be taken into accounc without at the same time doing a greater harm to other people it would be pleasant. But it follows from what we have said that we do no*: think this can be ("one.

Lena I.indemann and William Lindemann, her husband, reside on, ah uinl operate the N. W. % of section 25, town 6, range 8 west of the th P. M. in Clay county, Nebraska. Defendant operates a line of ilroail that passes through the quarter section owned and occupied by mplainants. The farmstead buildings and a portion of the lands lie &gt;n the north side of the right-of-way, adjacent to an east and west road. There is a road al.-o on the west side of the quarter section running rth and =outh. A switchtrack extends approximately one-half way h rough the farm, at the present time serving an elevator as a pertra - ent industry. Complainants, to reach the major portion of their farm, rast travel westward from their farm buildings approximately one - uarter of a mile, cross the railroad track on the public highway and tor their farm from some point on its west margin. The complain- uf. allege that no private crossing exists; that such crossing is very lecet&amp;ary for the convenience of the landowners; that it should be icated as nearly as practicable east of the east switching point, prefer - bly at not more than one hundred feet therefrom. Complainants rely exclusively upon the provisions of the statute id after filing the complaint, elected, when the same had been set down r hearing, to offer no evidence, but to rest the case entirely upon the ivisions of that law Defendant, in answer, admitted all essential portions of the physi - il situation, but denied that under the particular circumstances the tw b operative. Defendant admitted that it has been requested to •onstruct a private crossing and that it has refused to do so except ipon the express condition that complainants pay for the cost of estab - ishing the private crossing. No objection is raised by defendant to granting the easement to complainants for use of its right of way as crossing, subject to proper rules and regulations as to safety of peration of its trains. To understand defendant's position it is necessary to keep in mind the history of the land owned by complainants. Section 25, T. 6, R. 8 W. of the 6th P. M. was included in the grant of lands to the state of Kansas for the use and benefit of the St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Rail - road company, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Kansas, the act of congress being dated July 23, 1866. In that land </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 grant it was required that the railroad be entirely constructed within ten years from the date of the grant. All the conditions of the grant were apparently carried out. The particular section of the railroad was built in 1871 and the land was patented to the railroad company by the secretary of the interior upon proof of construction thereof. In 1875 the railroad company deeded the section of which the quarter owned by complainants was a part, together with an additional section, for a price of $10,195.84. The deed reserved to the railroad company a strip erf l«rd |rfce hundred feet (wide on each side of the center of its railroad track together with such addiitonal land as is necessary for the com - pany's embankments and ditches. It was also expressly reserved Stil'i made a condition of the deed that the purchasers, their successors and assigns, should erect and maintain a lawful fence on each side of the railroad through the section. The contention of the carrier is that it sold two parcels of land in section 25. one lying north and the other south of the right-of-way ; that it had absolute title to the land which it sold and that even though the purchaser of each tract was the same he acquired no rights what - soever to u-e of the right-of-way; that .such right-of-way could not be alienated by the railroad company by its own act; and that the adja - cent landowner could acquire no easement, without cost, to a eroBBing over the railroad by reason of this statute. It b also Hived that a statute passed by a state requiring a railroa.l company ti&gt; build an. I maintain private crossings for the use and con - venience of any landowner of land immediately adjacent to the right - •f-w&amp;y on each si&gt;!e thereof is not an exercise of police power of the state inasmuch as it would be the taking of the private property oi' the railroad company for the use and benefit of private persons; that the efeetiveness of the statute must rather be based upon the as - sumption that the legislature has placed a burden upon the carrier and that this burden, which the carrier might not otherwise be required to bear, is by statute made a part of the purchase price of the land which the carrier acquires for right-of-way by condemnation or by purchase: but in the absence of such a statute, when the carrier has condemned o. purchased a right-of-way and made full settlement therefor it cannot later be required by law to pay an additional price equivalent to the cost of a private crossing. LThe position of defendant is perhaps besi summed up by quoting i page 9 of its brief: "Tlio theory of the law is that if a railway company condemn.- n strip of land through a privately owned tract, when there is in effect a statute requiring the construction of private crossings where lanu is separated in that manner, the burden of making a private crossing is merely one method of furnishing compensation to the owner whose property is taken and damaged; if, with such a Statute in effect, the railway company acquires its right-of-way by private </seg>
            <seg id="p173">173 deed fiosr. the land owner, then unless the deed clearly indicates an intention to release or abandon the right to private crossing, the provision* of the statute become implied conditions of the deed, and the making of the crossing: is a part of the compensation paid for the right-of-way. Such is the full purpose of statutes of the kind now under consideration, and that is all that such statutes can ac- complish under the constitutional limitations discussed in the cases heretofore cited." When we .iefine the police power of the state as concerned with [feet the public health and safety, or the convenience, :e als of the community", we find lack of unanimity among re the courts which have before them the question of legislation of this character. In the decisions examined by us a majority of the courts appeal to hold that the power of the legislature to pass acts requiring railroads to construct at their ov.n expense private crossings between '.jacent parts of land under common ownership is not an exercise of The supreme court of Nebraska seems not to have con- C estion in construing the statute. V. Ry. Co. v. Sevens, 30 Neb. 318; 49 N. W. 842. V reive it our duty, in performing the functions especially Iegat by the legislature, to consider legislative acts as valid and constitutional unless there can be no question that such is not the ease. There is no exception in the law to cover circumstances such as have been presented by defendant. Hence, it is our duty to order de - fendant to build the private crossing in question at its own expense un- less it is clear from the law that under the particular circumstances the legislative act is not applicable. It does not appear necessary in passing on this matter to consider hethei the act is good or bad as an exercise of police power of the -tate, or good or bad as a matter of contract directed in part by statu - tory requirement. We think our conclusions can rest upon the con - tention of defendant, set forth above in the quotation from the brief. Until the repeal by chapter 261 of the Session Laws of 1921 and the .-ubstitution therefor of a somewhat broader statute, the law in Nebraska relative t« private crossings was contained in section W42 of the Re - vised Statute.-, 1!&gt;13, reading as follows: "When any person owns land on both sides ot any railroad, the corporation owning such railroad shall, when required so to do, make and keep in good repair one causeway oj. other adequate mean.- of crossing the same." This particular section in the identical language was enacted by the territorial legislature of Nebraska on February 8, 1864, appears in the Compiled Statutes of 1866, was recognized as the law of the state in- the constitution adopted when Nebraska became a state, and has been appropriately recognized in succeeding constitutions. The section was construed by the supreme court of Nebraska to require only a grade crossing. Omaha &amp; R. V. Ry. Co. v. Severin, supra. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">174 Chapter 261 of the Session Laws of 1921 repealed the section but dill not lessen the requirement. It g-ave authority inter alias to the Commission to adjudge what sort of private crossing was adequate and made possible the requirement, upon proper findinar by the Commission, based up.m facts, of more than one such crossing between the portions of land under common ownership separated hy railroad right-of-way. The existing statute still requires all that the original statute did — that the railroad company shall provide and keep in repair one cause - way or other adequate means of crossing. At coirmon law complainants are probably entitled to a way of necessity across this right-of-way. This is apparently recognized by defendant in the offer to permit such encroachment if complainants will pay the expense. The question of expense is chiefly involved. De - fendant urges that if it had purchased or condemned this right-of-way through private property after the passage of the statute herein in - volved it would be required to construct at its own expense a private crossing suitably located because this cost would actually be considered in arriving at the purchase price or in fixing the damages in Condem - nation proceedings. This contention appears to have been recognized by our court in F. E. &amp; M. Ry. Co. v. Lamb, 11 Neb. 592. where the award of the court below for damages, due to construction of a railroad through private farm lands, did not take into consideration that fences and private crossings were required at the expense of the railroad company. In construing the federal grant of this right-of-way, the courts assume "That in the natural order of events, as settlements were made along the line of the railroad crossings of the right-of-way would become necessary, and that other limitations in favor of the general public upon an exclusive right of occupancy by the railroad of its right-of-way might be justly imposed" Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267. It appears that the statute of 1864 is as effective when reversely consid - ered as when considered under the circumstances argued by defendant. The alternate sections granted by congress were owned in absolute fee by the railroad after complying with the conditions. The right-of-way through these sections, as well as the right-of-way granted through other portions of the public domain granted by congress in the act of 1886, has been construed to represent an ownership by the railroad company in limited fee with an implied condition of reverter. (190 U. S. 267). The conclusion appears unescapable that when the adjacent land, owned in absolute fee by the railroad company, is sold to private purchasers the statutory obligation then existing relative to private crossing must be considered as much a part of the sale price as when </seg>
            <seg id="p175">175 the railroad company purchases the right-of-way from preceding private owners. That statute was in existence in 1875 when the railroad com - pany disposed of section 25, of which complainants now own one quarter. No agreements are shown of record and none pleaded which might act toppal to the deivand of the landowner now that the statutory provision he carried out B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. 98 Neb. 1!»2 Our conclusion is, therefore, that the Nebraska statute applies in the instant case and that the obligation rests upon defendant company to construct, at its own expense, an adequate crossing between the parts of complainant's farm, and our conclusion is also upon the evidence that •ade crossing, over which teams, vehicles and livestock may be passed, is an adequate crossing. This conclusion does not involve at: all the question of gates if the right-of-way be fenced as that matter is not raised and appears also to have been covered in the original contract of sale binding upon the successors and assigns ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that The St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company be md it hereby is ordered and directed, within sixty days hereof, to con - ■truct at its own expense one private grade crossing between the portions &lt;&gt;f complainants' farm, described in this finding, with grading and planking in conformity with the standard practices of defendant com - pany in construction of similar crossings.

Hearing: was held at Wausa, Nebraska, on the 28th day of June, 1!»22, the plaintiff, A. E. Holmberg, being represented by P. H. Peterson, attorney, anil the defendant, Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company, by Wymer Dressier, attorney. kThe evidence in this case shows that the plaintiff's farm is devoted usively to agriculture. He has no livestock save such as is in - ntal to an agricultural farm consisting of 160 acres. The railroad ets plaintiff's land. His buildings are located on the westerly side, about opposite the center of the quarter section. A level grade cross - ing, suitably placed and with good gates in the fence is provided and maintained for his use directly east of his buildings, permitting him to cross the tracks with his farm machinery of al! kinds and with his livestock whenever he desired to reach the east portion of his farm. On the east side the land is devoted to the cultivation of corn and small grain., with a narrow strip of meadow about thirty rods east of the tracks. Plaintiff testified that he has never owned more livestock than at the present time and did not expect to own more in the future; that his farm is purely an agricultural farm; that for a grade crossing the private crossing described is in good condition and adequate; and that his farm and his interests are no different than those of other farmers along the side of railroad tracks in that part of the country. Plaintiff does not testify, nor does he claim in his petition, that the grade cross - ing is inadequate. He does not testify, nor does he claim in his petition, i.t an underground crossing is reasonably necessary for his use on his m. His petition charges that it is difficult for him to transfer his ck from one part of his farm to the other part on the opposite side the railroad and that it would be easy to build an underground cross - which would connect the two parts of plaintiff's farm by a runway that stock could cross without danger. The evidence does not show - that the crossing is inadequate. Plaintiff admits in evidence that for at least three-fourths of the year he would have no use whatever for an underground crossing. It appears also for about the same portion of the year plaintiff would have no occasion to drive his stock from the building-side of the railroad to the opposite side. Evidence shows that plaintiff already has watering facilities for stock on both sides of the tracks, the condition as found having existed on plaintiff's land for more than twenty years. If he had an underground way as prayed for in his application he would have no immediate use for the same. There is nothing on the east side of the tracks which could be used for pasture for livestock and there wil! be no such pasture there until the corn is harvested late in the fall. It is* quite apparent that an underground crossing, as asked for </seg>
            <seg id="p177">177 by plaintiff, would be a convenience three or four months during each year late in the fall and winter, at a time when the stock on the farm is at liberty to range at large. This convenience, in the judgment of the Commission, is not sufficient to create a necessity that would come within the requirements of the statutes governing such matters. Chapter 261, Law- of Nebraska, 1921, provides in section four ■•Whenever any person owns land on both sides of the right of way of any railroad, such railroad shall provide and keep in repair at least one adequate means for such landowner to cross the rig-tit of w:iy. Any interested landowner, with land on both skies of the right of way of any railroad, may lile written complaint with the State Railway Comr ission against any such railroad that the cross - ing is not adequate, and the commission thereupon shall make such investigation and hold such hearings as may be necessary, and shall i&gt;.-ue such orders as it shall deem necessary, proper, and adequate. It dreomsUUiCes warrant the commission may require overhead, underground, or grade crossings, and require wing fences at under - ground crossings, but where such special crossings involves an ex - penditure of more than six hundred dollars, the landowner shall bear one-half the expense in excess of six hundred dollars." The first sentence of this section though slightly modified has been the law in this state for a great many years. The balance of the sec - tion was added by the last session of the legislature. Under the old law, as above stated, an attempt was made in the case of Omaha &amp; R. V. Ry. Co. v. Severin, 30 Neb. 318, to compel the railway company to build an overhead crossing or at least to place cattle guards at a private grade crossing. In that case the court says: "Section 106 of Chap. 16, Comp. Stats., construed, and held, that the 'causeway or other adequate means of crossing', which railroad cor - porations are required to make and keep in repair, when any per - son owns land on both sides of any railroad, and when requested to do so, is an adequate means of crossing such railroad track and right of way by such owner on foot or horseback, with wagon or carriage, or with dometic animals under his control, but is not re - quired to be adequate to the free passage of unherded cattle or other domestic animals wandering unrestrained from one side of the rail - road to the other. "Section 1 of chapter 72 construed, and held, that the railroad cor - porations to which the provisions of said section ayply are required, under the penalty of the liabilities therein specified, to erect and maintain fences on both sides of their railroad' suitably and amply sufficient to prevent cattle, horses, sheep, and hogs from getting on the said railroad, except at the crossings of public roads and high - ways, and within the limits of towns, cities, and villages'; that this includes the space on either side opposite to private or farm cross - ings of the railroad, at which points such corporations are required to make or leave openings in such fence with gates or bars to close and secure such openings; but are not required to put in cattle guard at such private or farm crossings." In Postle v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., 98 Neb. 192, it appeared that a </seg>
            <seg id="p178">178 &lt; surface crossing to accommodate a farmer had been constructed for twenty-seven years, but the farmer desired an overhead crossing, ana attempted to compel the railway company by complaint before the Commission to build an overhead crossing. The Commission concluded that an overhead crossing was necessary, and. ordered it constructed, at a cost to the railway company of nearly two thousand dollars. The supreme court reversed the order of the Commission, saying: "Where 27 years have intervened between the date of an agreement made by the owner of land with a railroad conpary concerning the construction of a private farm crossing, and the railroad company, in compliance with the agreement, has constructed and maintained an adequate grade crossing, there is no obligation upon it to build an overhead crossing merely for the convenience of the landowner, un - less changed physical conditions require such overhead crossing. "Where, under such circumstances, it is shown that the railroa.: company is willing to construct the overhead crossing if the com - plainant will pay the co&gt;l of construction and maintenance, there i - no sufficient ground of complaint against the railroad company. "The evidence examined, and held insufficient to sustain the coiv - plaint of thi landowner against the railroad company." It will be obsened that in the Postle case the physical conditions had not changed from the time the road was constructed to the date of the comp!aini, and it appeared that the surface crossing had been use&lt; ! without injury to anyone for 27 years. Upon this evidence the supreme court held that the order of the Commission, was not sustained by tho evidence and that it was unreasonable and oppressive and deprived the railway company of its constitutional rights. t After a careful consideration of all the evidence, it is the judg - lt of the Commission that the real need for an underground way for :k on plaintiff's farm is not sufficiently apparent to require an im - vement of this nature at this time. ORDER til IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway nmission that the petition of plaintiff herein for an underground ssing under the tracks of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Iway Company be and it hereby is dismissed.

Nebraska; that the Union Pacific Railroad company's right-of-way crosses the above described land and divides it so that the land lays on both sides of the railroad, naking it very inconvenient for applicant to transfer machinery and -tock from one side of the farm to the other over the grade crossing now provided. The complainants ask this Commission to investigate md require the defendant railroad company to construct and maintain in underway through its grade and under its rails on said land for the use of the complainants. The Commission set the matter down for hearing at Cortland, Ne - raska, June 6, 1922, at 9:00 o'clock a. m., before Commissioner Cook nd Chief Engineer Forbes. The defendant company was represented y its attorney. T. W. Bockes, and its division engineer. Prior to the hearing the parties above mentioned, together with Mr. Sowers, made a careful examination of the situation at the farm in ■ luestion. The engineers for the Commission and the railroad com - pany agreed that the condition of the grade at the location pointed out would admit of an underway crossing, although the grade was not of ufficient height to give the regulation clearance. The attorney for the railroad company stated that he thought there would be no objection on the part of the company to construct an underway under the pro - visions of the law providing for private crossings. The commissioner and counsel for the railroad company explained to complainant that under the provisions of the statute a portion of the expense for the underway crossing would be assessed to the complainants. Mr. Sowers stated that he could not go further with the matter as the title to the farm was not in his name at the present time and he would not be able to provide for his portion of the expense.

Secretary. (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 4il Edgar Howard. Complainant. v. rn Pacific Railxoad Co. and Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Co., Defendants. OPINION AND FINDING Cook, Commissioner The complainant in this matter asked that the Union Pacific Rail - road company and the Chicago * North Western Railway company buil'l and maintain a tower and employ a watchman at a point near Norfolk, Nebraska, where the said railway lines cross each other, the watchman to be on duty at all times for the purpose of setting the signals t" permit the trains of both railway companies to past over the crossing in safety. The setting of the signals at this time is performed by the train crews of the trains running over the Union Pacific track. The device installed at this crossing by the two carrier companies is a timed inter - locking derailing combination, of standard make, the same as used by many railroad companies in this country at grade crossings. The two interested railroad companies entered into an agreement whereby the North Western Railway company should have the right-of-way over this crossing on account of its numerous through trains and heavy main line traffic. The Union Pacific company, maintaining only a branch over this crossing, with one regular passenger train and one freight train each way a day, voluntarily agrees to protect the crossing in the manner stated above. this matter came on for hearing the complainant stated undei h that he was unable to get witnesses to support his contention as stated in his petition and that he would rely on the statements made in his complaint as his evidence. The petition of complainant sets out. that the Union Pacific trains stop four or five hundred feet from the said crossing. A trainman must proceed to the interlocking switching device, set the signals against the North Western, at which time the Union Pacific train passe - over the crossing, then clear the signals on the North Western tracks </seg>
            <seg id="p181">181 and proceed to his train about the sane distance on the opposite side of the track, which operation, he claims, takes about twelve or fifteen minutes to perform. Also, he states that the operation is very hazard - ous to the train crew and passengers on said train: that the time re - quired to set the signals and get the train over the track and started again oftentimes causes passengers to miss connections with other tramp and otherwise annoys the traveling public. This contention was supported by one witness for the complainant. He testified that he had been over this line a few times and found the conditions about as plarnant's petition. Respondent, Union Pacific Railroad through its "ngineer, testified that to build a tower as asked for and make the changes that would be necessary in the mechanism would cost in the neighborhood of $8,000; that it would require three shifts to keep ;i watchman there during the time required, at a cost o1' .*400 per month. The engineer testified that he was ac - quainted with the operations at this point and knew from personal knowledge that the time occupied in making a safe crossing by the Union Pacific trains was about five to seven minutes except at times when the opposite track was being used when the time might be as much as fifteen minutes. This is very seldom the case. He also testi - fied that the interlocking device used at this point was of modern con - struction and insured safety to the traveling public in handling trains at that point. A few week.- before this hearing, the Commission, in order to ac - quaint itself with the manner in which the railroads were handling their trains at this crossing, sent its engineer, Mr. Forbes, to Norfolk to make a thorough investigation of this working device and the time re - quired to make a safe crossing under existing conditions. His report agreed in most every material fact with the testimony of the engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad company. The questions involved in this formal complaint have been before the Commission previously informally. The matter was quite fully developed upon an informal complaint of Judge William V. Allen, (I. C. No. 5651 ) who complained primarily of the delay at this crossing in that it oftentimes resulted in passengers on Union Pacific train No, 29 missing connections at Norfolk with the Chicago &amp; North Western train No. 3, the connection being a close one. Following the complaint North Western officials agreed to schedule No. 3 five minutes later out of Norfolk providing for a fifteen minute leeway which appears to be ample under normal circumstances. It was further agreed to hold North Western train No. 3 five or ten minutes when necessary upon receipt of advance notice as to passengers desiring to make this con - nection. Union Pacific employes were definitely instructed to supply this advance information where such connection was desired. Such an arrangement seems to amply provide for passengers desiring to make this connection and would appear to make entirely unnecessary the </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 action herein prayed for in SO far as train connections are concerned. No evidence was introduced at the hearing to show that such arrange - ment was not being strictly adhered to by each of the carriers. tit seems clear to the Commission that in order to serve the greatest liber of the traveling public it would be wise to allow the main line this point to have the right-of-way for its trains and in the interest? safety the Union Pacific be required to handle its two trains over this crossing as now maintained; that it would be unwise to create an ex - pense equal to that necessary under the testimony to maintain a watch - man and to provide for a re-arrangement of equipment at a very con - siderable cost, where the traffic is no greater than on this branch line of the Union Pacific.

OPINION AND FINDING rtrowne, Commissioner: This complaint, heard by the Commission on May 9, 1922, was sup - ported in writing by a score or more subscribers of defendant company living in the general territory between Malcolm and Garland. Most or all of the complaining subscribers have business and social activities with subscribers connected to the Garland exchange of defendant com - pany. This creates a demand for not only service now being offered to </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 183 Malcolm subscribers at the Lincoln zone, but a demand for Garland service as well. The cor.ipla.int alleges that it is necessary to pay $2.25 a month for Lincoln zone and the Garland exchange, or to exercise an option fendant company of trading the Lincoln zone for the Garland exchange and paying thereby $2 per month for local service at Malcolm ami Garland. The complainants desire rather that the de- fendant company be required to offer the option of trading the Raymond he Lincoln zone for the Garland exchange in Seward exchan count In our order on Application No. 3701 we authorized a farm zone rate of $2 per month, :ind a local rate at Malcolm alone of $1.75 per month. In order on Application No. 3953 all farm lines connected to exchanges within the Lincoln zone were put on a zone rate with no local service option. In 1915, in order on Application No. 2480 wo authorized this defendant company to publish a rate for the Garland exchange of $1.50 per month for farm line service, with the right to select by lilies either Seward or Malcolm as an extra exchange, a t no additional charge. This rate was never changed during the war period. It is a comparatively low rate, when measured against the farm line rates of defendant company for similar service in other portion* of its territory, Chief objection to the present situation appears to us to be that Under the option offered by the defendant company, and it is exercised by a considerable number, subscribers on the Malcolm exchange pay S'2 for local service at Malcolm and Garland, while Garland subscribers pms $1.50 for the same territory, in the reverse direction. It is pointed out, however, that it is not the same service, because subscribers on the Malcolm exchange who do not take the zone service, after exercising the Option, are entitled to a low toll rate to Lincoln, while the Garland sub - scriber:- pay a considerably higher rate, and that Malcolm subscribers, who have elected to accept Garland service in lieu of the Lincoln zone. are still entitled to all inbound calls free of charge from points within the Lincoln zone. In our opinion, if subscribers on the outer edge of the Lincoln zone exercised an option to remove themselves from the Lincoln zone, there is no reason why they should be entitled to free inbound messages. Sub - scribers within, the Lincoln zone are entitled to the zone as it exists and have no assurance of continued service to any group of subscribers if these subscribers elect to leave. The lower toll rate from Malcolm to Lincoln, when compared with the toll rate from Garland to Lincoln, is a thing of considerable advantage to subscribers connected at Malcolm, who do not buy the zone service. For this reason alone the rate need not necessarily be the same as for service in a reverse direction to subscribers on the Garland exchanjre in order to avoid the charsre of discrimination. </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 From the evidence we believe, and so find, that the present situation constitutes discrimination. The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph com - pany will, therefore, publish for subscribers on the Malcolm exchange the option of buying- service locally on the Malcolm exchange with Gar - land service additional at a rate of $1.75 per month, this option to carry with it complete elimination from the Lincoln zone on both outbound and inbound messages, except at a per message rate. Preferably this (iption should be offered to individuals. We are not, however, . sure that under such an arrangement proper policing- could be had, and de - fendant company will be authorized to &lt; lfei the rate either to individual rural subscribers, or by line-; if it is necessary to proper policing, a majority on any line to govern. We have no Objection to ;i continuation of the option now offered of buying Garland and Malcolm service at $2 per month, together with free inbound service from the Lincoln zone. Defendant company will elect whether to continue this additional option and file its election with the Commission in writing. The present rate of $2 per month foi Li,-. coin zone service at Malcolm, plus twenty-five cent? per month for Garland service additional, will \w continued. ORDER CIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Bailwaj mission that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company be, ami it hereby is, directed, effective August 1, 1922, to publish the following optional rate to subscribers on the Malcolm exchange of the Lincoln zone: $1.75 per month for Malcolm and Garland service, with all out bound and inbound connections between such subscribers and the Lin coin zone to be on a per message basis. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that nothing in this order shall be construed as eliminating the present rate for Lincoln zone service, plus Garland sendee, nor the offering of the present option of $2 per month for Malcolm and Garland service with free inbound connections from the Lincoln zone to those who accept such option.

OPINION AND FINDING Cook, Commissioner The following complaint by the citizens of Imperial, Wauneta ami Palisade, Nebraska, three important stations on the Culbertson branch of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, is before the Commission for investigation and adjustment: "To the Board of State Railway Commissioners, Lincoln, Nebraska. We, the undersigned citizens of Imperial .Wauneta and Palisade, Nebraska, and patrons of the Burlington railroad, do hereby most earn - estly petition your Commission to require the Burlington Railroad Com - pany to install and maintain at its depots in the towns mentioned ade - quate telegraph service instead of the present unsatisfactory telephone service now and for a long time past installed; the present telephone service being unsatisfactory in that it gives publicity to every message sent hy being transmitted in the presence of all who mty be in the depot ;it time of sending." The Commission ordered a hearing on the merits of the prayer of the petitioners, the same being held Monday, April 24, at the offices &gt;&gt;f the Commission at Lincoln, Nebraska. It speir.s fair and advisable to the Commission, after a thorough investigation, that the service in question, given by the railroad com - pany as agent for The Western Union Telegraph company, should be somewhat improved, particularly as to guarding the contents of the messages offered for transmission by the public. The railroad company has for its private use a single wire grounded circuit from Culbertson to Imperial, a distance of about fifty miles, which is used for telephone service in handling the business of the railroad company oxer this branch. In connection therewith, by joint arrangement with The Western Union Telegraph company, the railroad company receives and transmits mes - sages from it? depots at Imperial, Wauneta and PaHsade to McCook, Nebraska, where they are received by the Western Union for transmis - sion to their destinations. The petitioners insist that the depots in question should be equipped with telegraph instruments in order to cor - rect this difficulty. It was shown by the evidence that in order to make it possible to maintain both the telephone and telegraph service over the line it would be necessary to erect and maintain one additional wire and make other improvements, which would create an expense of about $1800. The railroad company contends that it is to its advantage to conduct its business over this branch by telephone rather than by telegraph; that the expense attendant on the installation of telegraph instruments in </seg>
            <seg id="p186">186 the depots named is not justified from an economical standpoint, or from the revenues derived from the telegraph messages offered at these points by the public. It appears fair and equitable to give the element of cost some consideration and we are of the opinion that the service can be improved and made satisfactory by the installation of modern booths for the transmission of messages offered by the public from these stations. It is the belief of the Commission that with the installati of such booths the causes for complaint will be entirely removed.

OKPKR ON MOTION TO MODIFY Browne, Commissioner This matter came on originally upon complaint of the citizens of the three towns named, directed against the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company. The Commission broadened the inquiry by making The Western Union Telegraph company party defendant and served notice on both defendants to appear and answer to the complaint. Hearing was held on April 14, 1922, at the offices of the Commission. On May 5 order was entered, which W8£ directed to the Chicago, Bui - iington &amp; Quincy Railroad company alone. Motion was filed by that defendant for modification of the order and for re-opening of the case sufficiently to allow the introduction into evidence of the contract be - tween the two defendants, which contract had been referred to in testi - mony but not examined in detail. We re-opened the case, received the contract and modified the order to run against The Western Union Tele - graph company as principal and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Rail - road company as agent. Thereupon motion was filed by The Western Union Telegraph company for leave to be heard further regarding the contract and alleging that the order had been based on testimony on which it had not had proper opportunity to cross-examine.

            <seg id="p189">189 case to that extent. At the time of the hearing, upon verbal representa - tion by the Western Union that it had certain proposals to make which it deemed of sufficient strength to warrant our consideration of a re - vision of the order, and upon acquiscence by the other defendant, Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, we re-opened the case and received testimony on the merits. Hearing was held at the offices of the Commission on June 30, 1922. A af the facts there is no dispute. Under present arrange- ments there ia not enough secrecy to the transmission of commercial message? from the three towns involved. There is under certain con - dition* cross-talk where messages from the telegraph line, by reason of tension, flow over on to parallel farm lines and can there be iy those on the farm lines, by the central operators of the tele - ompanies, and by such persons as are temporarily connected with the paralleling farm lines. Neither defendant believes that the booths ordered by the Commission will more than partially correct the difficulty. The Western Union urged the installation of telegraphone equipment, whereby botli telegraph and telephone messages may be transmitted over grounded lines. The Burlington objected to this plan because of alleged unreliability and probable interference with the transmission of iir.portanl railroad business. Neither defendant believed the difficulty •&gt;f sufficien! magnitude to warrant investment in another line from ■eCenk to Imperial, which conformed to our original opinion in the matter. The hearin.tr of June 30 was confined largely to th« dispute between the defendants ;'.s to the meaning of the contract which exists between them, by which the Burlington, as agent, performs in the territory in question all of the work of The Western Union Telegraph company. The WestPin Union urged that it is powerless to go upon the premises of the Huilington and make the changes directed by the Commission; that the Burlington is a ee-partner in the telegraph business with the Western Union and since it is in control of the property the order should be directed to it alone. The position of the Burlington was that it per - forms no common carrier duties in the transmission of intelligence; that it is not such a common carrier; that its relations with the Western Union are those of a purely private contract, outside of the jurisdiction of the Commission; that it is the duty cf the Western Union to efficient - ly transmit messages; that, therefore, the order should be directed to the Western Union alone, whose duty it then would be either to make the proper arrangements with its agent or to install the necessary facilities itself. The Burlington read into the record the offer of its general counsel to permit the Western Union to go upon its premises and install the booths, ordered in our original and first supplemental orders, or to make the installation itself under direction of the Western Union, under stipulation, in either instance, that the act of installing the booths was not to be considered as an interpretation of the contract </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 and that .such contract liability was to be determined either in the manner provided by the contract or in a Competent Court. After careful consideration of all the evidence we conclude that the s of the first supplemental order are reasonable and that the order should stand as issued in the first supplemental order against The Western Union Telegraph company as principal and the Chicago, Bur - ling-ton &amp; Quincy Railroad company as agent. The public served shoulii not be allowed to suffer while these parties continue the dispute as t. the contract relations. The improvement can be made and the liability under the contract can be settled in proper action between the partie - which will not involve the public. The only modification of the first supplemental order necessary by reason of the re-hearing is to extend the effective date ir compliance with the statutory requirement.

In our order of two years ago we found that the company mi^ht pay dividends of eight per cent upon a value of §42,280. This would result in a return of $3,382. On that basis, therefore, the company operated at a deficit in 1921 of $2,918. The owners drew out $2450 as dividend*. They should not have done .-o because such dividends were not earned and it will be necessary for this money to be returned to the treasury the company or dividends in the future deferred. The company earned about IVz per cent in 1920. It is manifest, therefore, that for the past two years it has not had adequate return on the fair value of its pro - party. We found two years ago that the rates at that tirre were not sufficient to provide a return. It follows, therefore, that for a perio.i of several years this company has not had an adequate return upon the fair value of its investment. An analysis and comparison of the expenses indie t gance.

In past- investigations the Commission has found the property of defendant to he well constructed and well maintained. While it is a grounded system, it is built accord - ing to high standards and good service should be possible. The com - plaints as to service put forward in this case do not indicate any wide - spread dissatisfaction The incidents cited are those common in the operation of any telephone system and, aside from a little better supe vision of the operating force at Weston, there would not appear to be any grounds for serious protest over the service at this time. The two complainants who were present stated that they would be willing to pay the present rates if the service were satisfactory. It is ap - parent from the financial condition of this company that it should not be required to reduce its rates at this time.

A brief extension of time was granted in 1917 and OB July 3, 1917, a hearing was held on the application irf the interurbun company for a still further extension of time, it being set forth that while financing was possible it was at that time impossible to purchase materials and secure delivery. The Commission took the matter under advisement, but, inasmuch a&gt; war-time scarcity of materials increased in intensity and later the industrial market became very unfavorable, no order was entered.

There was also considerable doubt as to whether or not a portion of the stockyards facilities were under the control of the federal government during that period. Objections were made by the company to the constitutional power of the Commission to fix charges. For these reasons and because of the pendency of Application No. 3082 the complaint was continued. Application No. 3082 was an application, afterwards amended, by the Stock Yttnis company for lea\e to increase its charges on coin. The application was heard and a temporary order, irade permanent July 6, 1917, was entered providing: "The price &lt;of corn) shall be revised monthly and the price to be charged for the current month shall be determined by the amount paid for corn per bushel by the applicant at its South Omaha yards for the month preceding the current month for which the price is made up. In addition to the price paid for corn at South Omaha, there is an actual out-of-pocket cost to the applicant for the handling ami placing of the corn in the feeding pens, which for the purpose of this temporary ar - rangement the Commission places at ten cents per busrel. The amount just named may be added by the applicant to the prioe of the corn for" the current month." On appeal, the supreme court reversed the decision un the ground that the order of the Commission did not make allowance for the use of the property engaged in thq service, as well as compensation for the corn furnished. The language used by the Commission in its decision does not seen to have expressed its real intention as the ten cents ad - ditional charge was apparently not only intended to cover actual out- of-pocket cost, but also to supply a fair return for the facilities used. The decision of the court was rendered rn March 1, !!)!!&gt;, at which time the price of corn was so high that the Commission did not desm it ad - visable to proceed After the prices had receded and had become more Vli ii order was entered on March 13, 1922, by which the ne federal department of agriculture.

Assuming this conclusion to be correct, and allowing for toll earnings it the rate of earnings in 1921, the company should earn slightly less than seven per cent in 1922. It may, however, as result of the remain - ing- months, better this showing. The highest net rate charged by this company is $2.25 per month for business service at Nelson. The lowest rate is for grounded farm line service at some of the smaller adjoining towns and is $1.25 per month net. Not. only is the net income of the company available for dividends within a reasonable amount, but the rates themselves are comparatively motlest, taking into consideration that free service is proffered by the company over its entire system to all subscriber*. The rate should be continued and we so find. In our previous orders we require the company to set aside at the rate of eleven per cent per annum on the original cost of the properties. Costs of maintenance have somewhat decreased, both as reflected in common labor and in costs of materials. The same is equally true of the costs of replacements. V/e will, therefore, modify previous orders to the extent of requiring the company to set aside for maintenance and reserve at the rate of $600 per month. This is for a minimum require - ment, reflecting our judgment of the constitutional provisions that re - serve for depreciation and full maintenance must be cared for before funds are set aside for dividends. It will not prevent the company, in the discretion of the board of directors, from setting aside a larger amount.

Stockholders have been compelled to forego dividends for the past two years and it is probable that no dividends can be paiii for at least another two years. The payment of the remaining debts and the rehabilitation of the property render it unwise at this time to reduce rates.

It is probable that had the property been operated economically throughout the entire period since the original order was issued a reduction in rates would have been justified at this time.

This would amount to $2,621.60. If the results in the second six months are as favorable as the first six months above shown the company will have at the end • f the year a surplus of approximately $2,750 after paying dividends, there is still a question, however, as to whether or not the allowance &gt;r maintenance and depreciation is sufficient. In previous orders we xed a definite amount of $4,457 per year for this purpose but since at amount was fixed the property investment has been somewhat in- creased. As was anticipated two years ago, the expenditures for main - tenance and for replacements have been heavy due to the consolidation of two plants at Ord. They will continue to be above normal for some time to come. In addition to this added expense the company suffered ihis spring from two or three very serious sleet storms, as a result of which it has been compelled to make substantial repairs and replace - ments. No reserve has been accumulated in the depreciation fund and it appears likely that none can be accumulated for several years. While the company has in its treasury $10,700 of common stock authorized by this Commission its officers are of the opinion that it will be impossible to sell this stock in the near future. Failing in that it will be necessary for the company to utilize ail of the available monies i'rom earnings to maintain and improve the property. It has deferred cash dividends for the past two years and issued in lieu thereof stock authorized by the Commission, and it appears probable that it will again have to defer payment of cash dividends in 1922.

Applicant was originally authorized on April 30, 1920, to increase its rates for all classes of service twenty-five cent."-- per month per station. This increase ranged from ten to twenty-rive per cent over the rates which had been effective theretofore throughout a long period of time.

Tins $2 "• was to be used by the company in any manner it saw fit. Due i lowance for this estimated amount of additional net retun ever ar above the rebates has been taken into account annually by the cor pany. The records show that during the three years there has be* accumulated in the profit and loss account $8,855.44 and that in the ye: 1922, when some economies have been perfected, the surplus account w show earnings of approximately $3,700. This amounts to about s per cent of the gross rates paid. The board of directors represents in supplemental application thut it does not feel warranted at this time in reducing the ratts now bein? charged. It was pointed out that the maintenance requirements mad* by us ag=iin?t the company have not met all the conditions imposed up on the company in giving good service and that possibly it should trans fer to depicciation reserve a portion of the accumulated surplus.

The rates charged, when compared with the rates of other companies furnishing like serv - ice, would not be deemed out of line. The sole question we have here to pass on is whether at this time the company is justified in making some reductions. It might reduce all rates ten cents per month and thereby wipe out the possibility of accumulating surplus next year unless economies are possible. To require this reduction against the best judgment of the uoaril of directors simply because a small surplus is being created would be to frown upon the high economies and encourage the efficiency with which this company has been and is now being operated. We are not disposed to do this.

Our action requires a statement the circumstances and condition.-; leading to such reopening and ■ hi review of the course this proceeding has takeii. Early in l'i20, and prior to the hearing in Ex Pane 74, an applica - tion, afterward amended, was filed by the carriers for increases in pa.&gt; - senger fares and Freight rates. Increases were also asked in excess baggage rates, in sleepim' car and Pullman car fares, and in rates for cream and milk shipments. After the decision of the Interstate Com - merce CownUBsiOil in Ex Paite 74, which granted a horizontal increase of 35 per cent on freight rates and 20 per cent on passenger fares, the application herein was duly heard by tills Commi.-sion. Under the evi dence presented it was apparent that increased revenues for the earners were necessary, due chiefly to largely augmented labor costs and ex - traonii-iurily high price? ol' all materials and supplies. On August 28, 1920, .i decision tras reacted whereby a general increase of 25 per cen: was allowed by this Commission upon intrastate freight rates, both clas.s and commodity, with certain exceptions not necessary to mention at this time. No change was made in passenger fares except as to special Care trains and Pullman charges. We considered that the 2 - cent fare 'aw, enacted by the Nebraska legislature, left us no jurisdiction to increase passenger fare.-. Our findings were based on the statisti cal showings of the carriers in F.x 1'arte 74 before the Interstate Com - merce Commission and upon the reports riled by the carriers with thi.- Commission. Our computations showed that the increases allowed by us were a.r.ple to provide the Carriers with a 6 per cent return on all propertv devoted to intrastate business in Nebraska. It whs also ap - parent from the record that their total earnings in Nebraska were more them sufficient to pay a return of t&gt; per cent upon all of their property used for transportation purposes within this -ante. We considered that under tire law we were not authorized to grant rates and fares that would giv; the carriers more than a fair return upon their transporta tion property and that Congress was without authority to enact legisla tion that would require us to do more than we did in our order. The order of this Commission above referred to became effective on September l, 1920. It was complied with by the carriers of this state, all of which filed tariffs in conformity therewith. Immediately there - after a complaint was filed by the Union l'acitic Raihoad company, and other carriers operating in Nebraska with the Interstate Commerce Com mission alleging that the rates and fares as provided in the order of this Comivission were discriminatory as against interstate Commerce and asking that the discriminations be removed and that the level of rates, fares and charges as provided in the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Ex Parte 74 be applied to the intrastate business.

In its discussion the supreme court point - ed out that the finding of discrimination under the circumstances, and its removal by the Intel state Comiverce Commission, did not divest the .-tates of regulatory powers over the carriers. The court used the fol - lowing language: "It i.s said that our conclusion gives the Commission unified control «f interstate and int restate commerce. It is only unified to the extent of maintaining efficient regulaton of interstate commerce under the paramount power of Congress. It does not involve general regulation of intrastate commerce. Action of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission in this regard should be directed to substantial disparity which operates as a real discrimination against, and obstruction to, interstate commerce, and must leave appropriate discretion to the state authori - ties to deal with intrastate rates as between themselves on the general level which the Interstate Commerce Commission has found to be fair i interstate commerce." "It may well turn out that the effect of a general order in increasing all rates, like the one at bar, will, in particular localities, reduce income instead of increasing it, by discouraging patronage. Such cases would be within the saving clause of the order herein, and make proper, an application to the Interstate Commerce Commission for appropriate ex - ception. So, too, in practice when the state commissions shall recog - nize their obligation to maintain a proportionate and equitable share of the incon-e of the carriers from intrastate rates, conference between the Interstate Commerce Commission and the state commissions may dis - l&gt;ense with the necessity for any rigid federal order as to the intrastate rates, and leave to the state commissions power to deal with them and increase them or reduce them in their discretion." The order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, dated January 11, 1921. was subsequently amended in several particulars not necessary to state in detail. The following paragraph was added November 3. "It is further ordered. That nothing in this order shall be con - strued as prohibiting any carrier, party to this proceeding, from in - creasing any rate, fare, or charge for the transportation of passengers Or property in intrastate commerce prescribed in said order of January 27, 1921, as subsequently amended by orders of March 29. April 15, August 26, September 26, 1021, to the level of its corresponding rate, fare or charge contemporaneously in effect and applicable to ihe transportation of passengers or property in interstate commerce, provided such increase is made pursuant to the laws of the state of Nebraska and with the ap - proval of the authorities of said State."

            <seg id="p213">213 APPLICATION NO. 4406 In the Matter of the Application of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company for Authority to Readjust Ratfcs Schedules for Exchange Service in Nebraska and for Readjustment and Inc/ease of Toll Rates. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: Application under title designation No. 4406 \va&gt; filed in December, 1921, shortly before the terminal date period of one of the temporary rate orders. On preliminary hearing an order was entered permitting the continuation of the then level of rates, including the so-called sur - charge of ten per cent. That order provided that so promptly as pos - sible complete hearing into the affairs of the applicant company would be had, that ample opportunity would be afforded to any and all parties desiring to be heard, and that the company should, pending final ad - judication of the ease, hold in specific account the amount represented by the surcharge in order that if found excessive vefur.d might be made to those making the excessive payment. The company's application filed in December proposed an entirely new readjustment of schedules, not differing particularly in total amount of revenue accruing, except as to the Omaha exchange, but making some rather sharp readjust ments up and down in some localities. The proposed rates are divided by the company into ten gioup. - with exchanges placed in the groups in accordance with the executive judgment of applicant. The Omaha group is sub-uivided into four sub-groups, or zones. By reason of this grouping the range of pro - posed rates for various classes of service may be set forth briefly as The detail of this will be more fully gone into in its appropriate place in this finding. It should be stated that the minimum rate for two-party and four-party residence service, as shown above, is caused by a few isolated situations not representative of actual minimum charges proposed for any considerable number of subscribers. follows: Net Rates per Month Class of service Omaha Other exchanges }ne-party business $ 5.00 to $8.50 $2.50 to $5.00 Pwo-party business 4.00 to $7.00 2.75 to 4.25 )ne-party residence 2.75 to 4.00 1.50 to 2.75 rwo-party residence _Z 2.25 to 3.25 1.25 to 2.25 residence 1.00 to 2.00 llulti-party residence 1.50 to 1.75 iural service 2.50 1.65 to 2.00 Switching service per annum 10.00 5.00 to 6.60 </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 These proposed rates represent an approximate fixation of rural service at the rates now charged. Reductions and increases in resi - dence and business service are proposed in order to standardize all rates within a particular group. The sharpest rate changes proposed are ill private branch exchange service which affect only a relatively few subscribers in the state in general and a very considerable business in the city of Omaha. The net effect of the proposed changes on private branch exchange service is a sharp increase in charges paid. Under the title number at the head of this case there is pendi.ijr one portion of a previous application affecting toll rates. The war - time adjustments of this applicant's rates resulted in a series of orders beginning December 1, 1918, amended again June 1, 1919, and increased a third time December 1, 1920. In each instance these were temporary orders, and with amendments were extended six months at a time. Testimony relative to toll rate changes was submitted in hearing in November, 1920, and again in June, 1921. At this time the company requests that the Commission pass on its application regarding toll rate adjustments. In brief, the proposal is that the differential between per - son to person and station to station service be increased from twenty - five to forty per cent. No increase is proposed in station-to-station service. The effect of this portion of the application, if approved, would be to increase the rates for something more than one-half of the total toll business intrastate by fifteen per cent. Hearings were had on the final disposition of the case in April, May and June at the Commission's offices in Lincoln. Testimony was taken for a total of sixteen days, during which 1,700 pages of evidence and 157 exhibits were offered. These hearings were held at dates most convenient to all parties concerned, due allowance being made for the time necessary to prepare exhibits called for by various communities and by the Commission. Following the preliminary hearing in December, 1921, a committee was organized for the purpose of representing widely the users of telephone service at exchanges owned by applicant. D. J. Traill, secre - tary of the chamber of commerce of Grand Island, was made chairman, and P. W. Deweese, counsel for the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, was made secretary. The purpose of the committee was said to have been to consolidate finances and to secure united effort along some line of defense against the proposals of the application. It was found im - possible to secure the cooperative effort. Towns and cities, so far as they were represented at the hearings, worked rather independently of each other. The Commission appreciates the efforts of these represen - tatives of communities to ascertain all the facts in the case and particu - larly their specific knowledge of local conditions. W. C.

            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 215 corporation counsel of the city of Omaha, W. H. Young, traffic manager of the Fremont chamber of commerce, and D. J. Traill, secretary of the Gran&lt;l Island chamber of commerce, sat consistently throughout the U. G. Powell, long chief statistician of the Commission, and thoroughly familiar with the accounts of applicant. On February 2, l'J22, a conference was held by two members at the Commission, representatives of the con-pany anil repiesentatives of al - most a score of communities for the purpose of outlining the scope ot the inquiry, with particular reference to whether physical valuation of the Nebraska properties should be made as a basis of this rate case. Aft»r much discussion and some disagreement it was finally unanimous - ly agreed in writing by all present that in lieu of such physical valua- tion, with its attendant high expense, the rate base used shculd be the undepreciated book value of the fixed plant as of date November 30, 1921, to which should be added a proper amount for working capital and material and supplies in the storehouse. The book value, as here used, represents the actual cost of construction, with certain exceptions. It wa.«. agreed that the company would furnish to any iown requesting : .t the book cost of the exchange and toll property in that community, in additicn to furnishing similar data to the Commission on all exchanges designated by it and for the state as a whole. Each community was given the riirht to reject those fig-ires as a rate base, provided such re - jection were made known before the actual hearings began. In case of rejection physical valuation of property of the particular objecting community would be maiie. Such rejection was not made by any com - munity. It was further agreed that in separating the toll and exchange property ard stating the value of each the point of division between toll and exchange property should be considered the back of the switch - board in contradistinction to suggestions advanced that the division of property used in common between exchange and toll should be un Ihe basis of use. The book value of the fixed property as of November 30, 1981, was $16,310. 179.76, to which it was agreed should be added a proper amount for working capital, including supplies on hand. These latter items were to be determined by the Commission from evidence to be presented in testimony. This book value was to be "subject to any additions or subtractions resulting from errors found in the book accounts." The net effect of this agreement was to eliminate the necessity on the part of the company of making an inventory and appraisal for sub- lenp-thy and exhausting investigation. On its part, the Commission studied carefully the advance data pre- pared by the compan) anil required from it the filing in advance of replies to an extensive questionnaire. It required mde than 250 pages at data to comply with the provisions of this questionnaire. The Com- mission used it.~ .statistical engineering forces and specially engaged Ml. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 mission as evidence, and on the part of the Commission and communities of making' an exhaustive check of this inventory and appraisal. In the opinion of the Commission it would not have been equitable to the public to have received as evidence the company's testimony on an inventory and appraisal without a most careful check thereof. The Commission's finances did not permit this at the time and so far as could be ascer - tained no other finances were available. By the agreement this rate base figure was to be used in the instant case only and its acceptance to be in nowise binding in future cases. Speaking generally, the use of this figure acted to offset whatever accrued depreciation existed in the property against whatever weight should properly be given to the higher levels of values as they might affect plant built before the realization of such higher levels and whatever effect it would have been necessary, in a valuation case under the decisions of the courts, to give to the intang - ible factor of going concern and of construction overheads. At the time of the consolidation of the Nebraska Telephone company with other companies into the Northwestern Bell Telephone company (December 31, 1920), the setup on the books of the Nebraska Telephone company for depreciation reserve was $2,860,592. This included the property serving some 6,000 subscribers in southwestern South Dakota. After the consolidation the depreciation reserve was not kept separately for the Nebraska division. Its total as of November 30, 1021, ex - cluding the accrual on the South Dakota properties would be less than $3,000,000. The agreement, therefore, in effect foi the particular case allowed a figure not exceeding $3,000,000 for appreciation of values, going concern value, and such overheads as might be figured legitimate but not charged in from day to day at the time the property was con- The Commission accepted the agreement herein discussed because it felt then, and it feels now, that such agreement did not jeopardize the substantial rights either of the rate-paying public or those of the com - pany. The Commission gives weight to the results of an investigation made in Minnesota. The properties of the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone company in Minnesota were not created under substantially dif - ferent circumstances than in Nebraska. They were built at approxi - mately the same time. They occupied large cities, small cities, and towns, and rural territory. They originated in high competition with small independent companies and with one large independent company. In each instance compromise was arrived at whereby the territory was divided for sale and purchase of properties between the two large com - panies, one of whom was applicant. The Minnesota state authorities undertook an exhaustive investigation of the properties of applicant in that state for the purpose of arriving at a rate base and after three years of time and an expenditure on the part of the state and the com - pany of well toward $1,000,000, the final conclusion of the Minnesota commission was that the fair value of the property devoted to intra- </seg>
            <seg id="p217">AhBKAoKA o 1 A 1 L KAlLwAY LOMMlbolUN 217 state use was approximately four per cent in excess of the book cost of the same properties. In arriving at its conclusion the Minnesota commission included only a small portion of increased unit values. The accounts under which the book cost was built up were kept under sub - stantially the same rules in Nebraska as in Minnesota. The book cost figure, as used in this case, represents the direct cost of construction .so far as it could be directly charged and where such direct charge could not be made the indirect cost of construction was allocated. The book cost figure includes an increase of assets of about $1,000,000, arrived at in 1912 following an inventory by the company of certain classes of its properties. It was alleged by the company that in an earlier day much construction was made from operating revenues and no charges made to plant therefor. Such excess property, of which prior to 1912 no record was available, was set upon the books as additional fixed property at average unit costs up to that date. The Commission was aware of this readjustment, repeatedly investigated it, but never condemned it. In the instant case the company did not desire to again go into this question and neither respondents nor the Commis - sion found it advisable. The questionnaire submitted by the Commission to the company and filled by the company from its records included close scrutiny of the proposed grouping of exchanges. To that end the company was required to furnish all detail of property investment, revenues and ex - penses of from one to three exchanges designated by the Commission in each gr;&gt;up. It was considered impracticable to make similar studies of all the exchanges of the company in Nebraska. For the most part the exrhan:*es studied as typical included the exchanges where repre - sentatives of patrons took an active interest in the case. In the. two or three exceptions to this statement special studies were made along the same line for the communities. In every instance rigid examina - tion and cross-examination of the data was made. Along this line the testimony of the company embraced studies of the exchange property of the entire state as a whole ami likewise, but separately, the toll properties of the entire state, ■with commensurate attention to operating revenues ar.d expenses of the two classes of busi - ness. Arlditional thereto the studies presented to represent typical situations within the proposed groups, as records, book cost of plant, annual revenues earned, expenses directly charged cr allocated to ex - change and tiic net ves-ults of operation for the yea-- 1021, were pre - sented for Alliance, Eutte : Fi llerton.

RESULTS OF OPERATION" Up Until this time the several rate advances in both u&gt;ll and ex - change charges granted to the applicant company and its uredecessot. the Nebraska Telephone company, have been more or less temporary in nature and were granted on the showings made by the Operating Com - pany without detailed investigation as to many of the financial tabula tions submitted for the consideration of the Commisson in support of the applications made, and were largely granted by the Commission in order that the financial standing of the company might not be weakened on account of the abnormal operating conditions that have surrounded the telephone industry occasioned by the world war. Now we have come to the time when careful consideration must be given to all phases of toll and exchange rates and charges and a base rate fixed for the two classes of service that, in our opinion, is just am! reasonable to patrons and applicant. In this portion of these findings, the Nebraska Telephone company will be known as the Nebraska company and will be understood to in - clude all of the property owned by that company located in the states of Nebraska and South Dakota. The Northwestern Bell Telephone company will be mentioned as the Bel! company, and when the Nebraska division is mentioned, we will have reference to the property owned by the Northwestern Bell Telephone company located in Nebraska and South Dakota identical in territory with that owned by the Nebraska Telephone company prior to December 31, 1920. $3,310,025 $2,741,711 3.&lt;io 1,054,278 757,278 4.74 3.555 3,£93 3.16 def 17,227 13,722 3 58 109,631 79,001 4.19 29,398 21,708 7.62 6,357 7,585 5.S2 del G9.129 49,611 4 58 43,638 33.C57 6.28 2,193,122 1,781 875 3.69 7,342 6,918 1.07 def licensee payments.

            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 219 The following companies have intervened in these proceedings under Application No. 4406 in that portion of said application which deals with toll rates and mentioned in the record of the hearing held in Lin - coln on November 4, 1920: Kearney Telephone company, Platte Valley Telephone company, Wehn Telephone company and Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company. In the order which will be entered in this case, the consideration that the Comirission gives to these interveners will be set out. The Bell company, as such, did not submit any operating statistics on the toll traffic as handled by it in Nebraska, so that, so far as the state- of this record is at the present time, we have before us for nur consideration only the data presented by the Nebraska company at the heretofore mentioned hearing held at the Commission's offices on No - vember 4, 1920. At the healing held on December 28, 1921, a statement mi sub- mitted by the applicant showing the results of operation of its Nebraska properties for the month of November, 11(21, and for the eleven-month period, January to November, both included, 1921. No attempt was irade to separate the results of operation in the .statements just men- tioned as between toll and exchange services. At the hearing held in June of this year, the applicant submitted for the consideration of the- Commission the results of operation of the Nebraska properties for t ; ie calendar year 1921. separated in all particulars as to property, revenue 5 . and expenses between toll and exchange. The November 30, 1921, book cost — mentioned in thr agreement supra — of the plant in "service was used because in the racnth of December the applicant entered upon its books a very large sum which represents the cost of installing; a portion of the machine switching apparatus put in place in the city of Omaha. The Nebraska December monthly report shows that there was charge.! in that month to central office equipment the sum of 042 .59. Practically all of this sum coir.es from property put in place i.i Omaha. In discussing the financial needs of this applicant as represented by the voluminous record considered by the Commission in these findings and order, we will first give consideration to the showing made by the applicant as to the company as a whole, exchange and toll combined, following with oui liscussien cf the findings as to the results of oper- ation of the toll service, and following that the exchange service. Revenues and Expenses. In considering the results of operation of the applicant as a whole for the state of Nebraska, the company pre - sented to us the revenues and expenses for only one year, segregated in detail between toll and exchange. In the final decision on a case of the magnitude of this one, it is customary to have the results of opera - tion for a period longer than twelve months. The two or three years </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 tnediately preceding the year 1921 were abnormal, both as to toll and hange operation, as to revenues, and more especially as to operating expenses. We are not convinced from our general knowledge of the telephone situation and the records in the cases here considered that the actual figures for the year 1921 should be used without modification as representing a fair period of operation upon which to calculate the amount of revenues which should be collected from the patrons of the company for the services performed. We will attempt to point cut in certain particulars as to where in our judgment the 1921 figures, as shown in applicant's exhibits, aie more or less unreliable for the purpose of determining what the rates should be now and for a reasonable length of time in the future. I Applicant's Combined Financial Showing. Under this sub-division will discuss the showing made by the company, toll and exchange mues and expenses considered together. For easy reference we set out below a tabulation showing the results of operation at different times which have bean introduced in evidence by the applicant.

For the calendar year 1921 and using the cost of the plant in service as tentatively agreed to by the Commission in the stipulation, and including the company's claim for working assets, the amount remaining for an annual return is ufaown to be 3.45 per cent.

            <seg id="p221">221 ation of the company in Nebraska for the year 1921, as calculated by the applicant, are to be taken as the proper basis upon which to base the rates under conditions as they exist at the present time ; the appli - cation of the company to increase its toll and exchange rates should be granted. But after due consideration of all the facts and and figures submitted to the Commission in this er.se, we are not con - vinced that the annual percentage of return as shown in the tabulations above mentioned accurately reflects normal operating: conditions. First, iscu.s.-, more or less briefly the book cost of the plant in service cludinc working capital as a rate base upon which to calculate the jal re Book Cost ol' Plant in Service. In paragraph four of the stipulation te&lt;l by the Bel! company at the Omaha conference, supra, we find ing lan&lt;iua!;e "That for the parpose of this case, the book cost of the entire pro - perty of the Northwestern Bell Telephone company devoted to public use in the state of Nebraska on November 30, 1921, to- wit, the afore - said sum of $16,319,179.76 plus a proper allowance for working capital, supplies and materials, shall be considered by the Commission as the value of the entire property of said company, subject to any additions or subtractions resulting from errors found in the book accounts." By testimony, the applicant .sought to establish as a reasonable amount to be added to the plant in service fox* working capital the sum of $559,824.24. The basis for finding the amount which should be added to the rate base for working capital appears to us to be just and reason - able, and for the purposes of this case we will accept the method of calculating the amount necessary. But as to the book cost of tne plant in service as of November 30, 1921, in the sum of $16,319,179.76 heretofore mentioned, we are not convinced that this should be accepted as a base figure upon which to calculate the annual return for the year 1921 from results of operations for that year. In the first place, we feel that the figure should be corrected so as to represent an average book cost of plant in service for the eleven- or twelve-month period, whichever is adopted, as a basis for calculation. The revenues and ex - penses for the month of January, 1921, were related to the plant in service during that month and the same statement would apply to each month during the year. The matter here discussed, in our judgment, is important for the reason that the company during all of the year 1921 and for a considerable period prior thereto has been busily engaged in installing machine switching in the city of Omaha. In fact, the Nine - teenth and Douglas street general office building, the cost of which was taken into the book account in 1918, was built with the view of installing machine switching for two 10,000-unit installations to serve the patrons of the company living in the Omaha zone. The record does not disclose, and we are unable to say, how much of the $2,000,000 in round figures which was charged to lands and buildings account represented building space and strength necessary to house the new machine switching equip- </seg>
            <seg id="p222">222 ment that is being installed in the Doug-las street building, but inasmuch as the company has recognized it as a principle that the machine switch ing, so far as the property account in Omaha is concerned, should not be considered by the Commission in these proceedings, we feel that in our findings and order entered in this case, the same general principle should follow through as near as may be in the figure that we finally adopt as a base upon which to calculate the annual return, and the same consideration should be given to the statement of operating expense.-. This is especially true when the entire Nebraska exchange property of the company is under consideration, for the reason that the Omaha in - vestment represents 71 per cent of the total exchange plant in service as found for November 30, 1921. The number of subscribers' stations in service is more than fifty per cent of the total in the state. It. therefore, becomes apparent that the property investment and results of operation in Omaha would materially affect the aggregate figure for the State of Nebraska, both as to property and net income There appears to be a discrepancy in the total figures of plant i service and general equipment as stated in the agreement ami tho plant in service including general equipment as shown cm Schedule ' A", sheet 1 of the questionnaire. On said sheet it is shown that th is $J6,22&lt;&gt;,789.53, while the amount shown in the stipulation i $16,319,179.76, a difference of $92,390.23. This difference occurs almost entirely in the office furniture and fixture.-, and from the record understand that in tlie agreement figure? all office furniture and fix owned by the company located in Nebraska are included, while ir questionnaire sheet. Schedule A, the office furniture anil fixtures used i the general offices in Omaha lor the company as a whole have been r rated between states. We understand that there is some compensating revenue included in the November 30 statement. Exhibit 1, t in a measure make up for the inclusion of the office farnitur tures that are used in operating the system property. We will m allowance in revenues for this estimated amount. Ii no actual figures in the record that show how much of the I'urnitur fixture property should have been pro rated to the system for the eleve month period, we will, for the purpose of t hi- easi, deduct $92,000 the average plant in service for the eleven months of 15*21 The average plant in service for the eleven months January to No - vember, inclusive, of 1921, as shown by the testimony of applicant's statistician, Exhibit No. 1, $15,981,579.54 less $92,000, which we have heretofore found should be deducted, leaves $15,889,189.31. From this amount, and for the purpose of this case only, we shall deduct $400,000 as representing that portion of the Omaha general offices which is or will be devoted to machine switching. This gives us the figure of $15,489,189.31 as representing plant in service, including general equil' ment. The $400,000 that we deduct in this paragraph i'rom the stipulat ed amount of the plant in service is in the property and is a part of th </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 223 sum upon which the company should receive a fair return. In these indings, and at the suggestion of the company, the investment in machine switching in the Omaha exchange has been eliminated from the tatement of plant in service, and we think properlj so. If, at some future tiir.fr, the question of the rate level in Omaha is considered sepa- atel 5100,000 that we have here excluded should be included with he machine switching equipment that is used in operating Omaha exchange. To the sum last mentioned we will add the re- &gt;y th( applicant as representing a reasonable sum Iculated in the sair.e manner as contained in Wit ess Buckingham's exhibit J!i, whieh we find to be $534,377.00. This um we will add to the plant in service base figure, giving us a total !,5Gt&gt;.00 which, in our opinion, is just and reasonable to be a base figure for the average combined plant in service used by the applicant in transacting its total Nebraska business for the eleven month- of 1921. Fiura the record we learn that the machine switching installation in the city of Omaha is experimental not only as to the Northwestern Bell Telephone company but as to the subsidiary companies owned by the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company. The Omaha installation is the largest unit ever installed by the Western Electric company, and many of the features used in the construction of the machine switching units are more or less experimental in the actual operation in a city where multiple exchanges are required. Witnesses for the applicant testified that they did not know, and the data was not available by which they could definitely determine whether or not the machine switch - ing as installed in Omaha would prove to be more economical in opera - tion than the manual boards heretofore operated there. We realize that the installation of a large switchboard in an exchange the size of Omaha, in which continuous operation must be maintained on all the subscribers' stations supplied by the company, is a herculean task, and that during the period of installation and for a considerable length of time there - after the exact results of operation of machine switching apparatus cannot be accurately stated. Under the accounting system in use by the applicant company accurate data can be compiled from which it will be possible to tell the exact results of the change from manual to ma - chine switching, and we will require the company to file reports with us ;it stated periods so that we may keep in close touch with the results of operation of the new equipment in Omaha. Combined Revenues. As heretofore mentioned, the revenues of ap - plicant, both from toll and exchange for the calendar year 1921, were abnormally low, due, no doubt, largely to the general business depression which was so pronounced in most all lines of business during the year. The total toll revenue credited to the state of Nebraska by the appli - cant company for the year 1921 was a little more than $100,000 less than 1920, and this — 1021 — was the only year in a period of twenty-two </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 years when the applicant and its predecessor, the Nebraska company showed a loss in toll revenue over the preceding year, with the exception of the year 1912 when a large portion of the Nebraska company'."! toll property was sold to the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company. The average annual increase in toll revenue for the eight year period VJV, to 1920, both included, was eleven plus per cent. These figures con - clusively show that the toll revenue was abnormally low in the year 1921, and it is upon the results of operation for 1921 only that we are fiuired umler the state of the record to determine the reasonableness the application herein considered to increase toll revenues. The number of subscribers' stations in service at the end of the year 1921 was about one per cent greater than at the end of the year 1920. The exchange service revenue for the Nebraska division of the Bell company for the year 1921 as compared with the Fame revenues for the Nebraska company for the year i020 shows an increase in round figures of $330,000. Most of this increase in revenue is on account of an increase in the average annual revenue per company station in service, which, when calculated for the same territory, shows an increase of $2.71 over the year 1920. The increase here mentioned is due almost entirely to the ten per cent surcharge authorized by the Commission in the latter part of 1920. The annual increase in number of subscribers' stations in service for the past seven years was shown to he as follows: The above tabulation shown that the year 1921 had the lowest in - crease in number of subscribers' stations in service for the seven year period, with the exception of the year 1918 when the small increase was caused by the world war. In fact, during 1918, the government directed the telephone companies of the country not to extend their facilities any more than they found absolutely necessary. If the average net gain in subscribers' stations in service for the year 1921 had been six per cent over the year 1920 and this percentage of increase in sub - scribers' stations had resulted in the same average annual revenue per station of $32.87, the revenue from subscribers' stations would have been increased in round figures ?200,000 for the year, or an average in - crease of $17,000 per month. The exchange plant in service as ' of November 30, 1921, shows an increase of approximately $670,000 over the plant in service as of January 1, same year, or an increase in terms of percentage of 5.45. LThe statements contained in the preceding paragraph .seem to justify conclusion, that in order to have a fair figure upon which to base 1915— 9.92 r* 1916— 8.71-a 1917— 5.75&lt;7, 1918— .78 r /f 1919— 11.50 r v 1920— 5.91'; 1921— 1.57% </seg>
            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 225 conclusions a.s to revenue? from exchange services of the applicant com - pany, it is fair to assume under normal conditions the monthly exchange revenues would have been in round figures $17,000 per month ir.ore thaii was received by the applicant, anil further that this adJitional exchar.gr revenue would have been secured without any material increase in ihf exchange plant in service in excess of that added to the property by tin applicant. For the purpose of this case we are convinced that MM amount should be added to the exchange revenues as stated by the ap - plicant end after a careful consideration of all the facts submitted in the record, we find thai the exchange revenue for the eleven-month period oi' 1921 should be increased $187,000 so that in a restatement of the operat - ing results for the eleven-month period, the constructive exchange re - venue would be $3,033,084.59 plus $187,000, oi a total of $3,220,084.5!'. We will refer to these figures later on in the-se findings. The average monthly toll service revenue for the eleven month period is in round figures $94,700. The toll revenue received from the Nebraska toil business excluding Scuth Dakota in 1020 was approxi - mately $103,000 per month. From this statement, it is shown that the 1921 monthly toll revenues were $8,300 le.-&gt; than those of 1920. l.i the year 1019 the Nebraska company had an increase in its toll revenue of approximately 30 per cent over the year 1918. This exceptionally heavy toll business appeared to have continued into the year 1920, but not in such a large ratio as the year 1919 showed over 1918. The toll revenues of the Nebraska company for the year 1920 showed' an increase of 6.39 per cent over the same revenues for the year 1919. The annual increases over the preceding year in toll revenues received by the Ne - braska company for the six year period immediately preceding 1920 are shown by the record to be as follows, Exhibit T.-9, page f&gt;: Some of the increases shown above are caused by increased toll rates. The actual toll revenues earned by the applicant for 1921 were 7.84 per cent less than the amount received from the to'l services in 1920 with the same schedule of rates in effect during both years. There is no doubt in our minds that the toll revenues as stated for the eleven months of 1921 are abnormally low, and in order to determine what the results of operation would be under normal conditions, some sum should be added to the revenues as stated in applicant's Exhibit 1. The monthly reports of the applicant to the Commission for the system as a whole show that the message tolls for the eight months of 1922 are $111,000 in round figures more than were received by the Bell company for the same period in 1921. For the state of Nebraska, however, the reports 1914— 7.06% 1915 — 8.68&lt;7&lt; 1916—15.40% 1917—13.72% 1918—10.83% 1919— 29.85 Vr </seg>

It is claimed by applicant that many of the wage increases made during the war periot will not be materially reduced in </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATK RAILWAY COMMISSION 227 the near future. This i? especially true as to telephone operators' wage?. It appears to he the conclusion of the operating officials of the applicant that the average wage of telephone operators prior to the war was on too low a basis, and that the vat wage, or the major portion of it, will have to be continued for a consumable length 01 time in the future. We are impressed by this argument to a certain extent a.ui recognize that in many lines of employment the general scale of wage- will have to be continued on a higher plane than the wuges paid to tlu- same class of employees prior to 1914. But, at the -ame lirr.e, we recotfiiizt tie tact that during the war period there seemed to be pio valent in the country a general laxness in the efficiency of employees in most all lines of business, and the telephone industry w;is not an ex- ception. In many instances, the employees available were not of a.- high a grade as the applicant hail been using in the operation of it.- property. However, under applicant".- presont plan of operation, tele - phone operators and many other classes of employees are becoming moi&lt; j efficient in their several lines of wrrk, so tnat as a final figure, tbe company is receiving a greater and more valuable seivicc from its em- uloyees than it did during the war period, but this saving is not, in our estimat:on, appreciably represented in the 1921 ,-tatcn.ent of operating expenses. We realize that the estimating of the results of operation by assuming that more revenues might have been recei\ed by applicant undei certain conditions, and that under more ideal circumstances cpe.- atiug expenses would not have been .-&lt;&gt; great, and as a result of bring - ing tin- figures together, a greater net return would 1 ave be3n receive-i than that stato.i hy the i-.pplicaiit in it.-- showings before the Commission is. more or less uncertain. At the «ame time, in BUI legislative capacity we feel that it is our duty under the lav. to give careful weight to all of the conditions surrounding the traffic when the question before tin' Commis.-ion i: What shall the peimanent rate.- f.i ;. particular public utilitx company's services be? In carrying out the constitutional •amend ir.ent and the statutes under which we receive oui authority, it appear.- to us that our actions sh &gt;uld r.o'. be controlled and our con- dusions limited only to the consideration of the results of operation of but rather that we should earefn'ly weigh cur- things that hav rent happenings and consider what may be expected to happen in the reasonably near future. I he ultimate end to bs attained under successful regulation is to provide the public with good service at reasonable rates, and to do thi. - we have in mind and have given careful con.-ideration to the necessity of having a healthy operating company to furnish the services needed by the patrons of this applicant company as well as the patrons of other telephone companies located in this state. The showing made by the applicant in this case docs not represent a petud of operation which. in our judgment, affords a reasonable statement of operating results from which we cun determine that the applicant company should receive increased revenues in the sum of $280,000 or $300,000. It therefore be- </seg>
            <seg id="p228">228 comes necessary for us to readjust the data submitted by the applicant in support of its petition, which, in our estimation, will represent a reasonable consideration of all the facts of record in these proceedings. In considering the operating expenses offered by the applicant in this case, it is our conclusion that the statement of operating expenses for the eleven months of 1921 should be used as a basis of calculation rather than the month of November or the twelve months of the year. Our conclusion here made is largely based on our desire to eliminate from the figures as near as may be the large expenditures of money made necessary on account of the installation of machine switching in Omaha. There is a very considerable amount of operating expenses included in the eleven month period that is caused largely by the machine switching installation. The material increase in the charges to operating ex - penses on accoui.l of machine switching in Omaha is nearly illustrated in answers made by the applicant company to the questionnaire sent out by the Commission and introduced in this record as Exhibit M-8. The direct operating expenses of the Omaha exchange for the account of re - pairs to central office equipment, Account No. 604, for the months of September, October, November and December were as follows, quoting from the exhibit: Repairs to C. O. E September $7,184.76 October 5,230.38 November 6,907.40 December 18,534.78 The above tabulation shows that charges in the month of December fo&gt; - repairs to central office equipment were 300 per cent of the average monthly expenditures for the three-month period September to Novem - ber, inclusive, or in dollars and cents, a monthly increase of $12,000 in Cd figures. This same general increase in central office equipment irs continued in about the same ratio for the first three months of 1922, the latest period for which the figures were secured for this case. The amounts expended by the applicant and charged to repairs to central office equipment for the Omaha exchange for the three months of 1922 are shown to be as follows: Repairs to C. O. E. January February March _ $11,149.14 12,220.45 24,605.14 This would give us an average monthly charge for the four months December, 1921, to March, 1922, inclusive, of $16,600. This heavy in - crease in the charges for repairs to central off ice. equipment is due al - most entirely to the installation of machine switching in the Omaha </seg>
            <seg id="p229">229 charges which are necessary in connection with the installation of rrachine switching Repairs to station equipment for the month of December amount to $10,000 in round figures expended in the Omaha urea as against an average figure of $5,600 per month for the three months September to November, inclusive. The increased cost in charges for current repairs in the Omaha territory are important for the reason that there appears to be no diminution in the cost of operating the Omaha exchange in the way of operators' wages. The amounts charged to operating expenses for operators' wages for the Omaha area for the seven month period September, 1921, to March, 1922, inclusive, are shown to be a^ follows: February being a short month accounts for the reduced amount ex - pended for operators' wages in that month. The above figures show that the installation of machine switching in Omaha has not had the effect of reducing in any degree the operators' wages in that exchange. All of the above statements appear to point to the fact that the operating results for the eleven month period ending November 30, 1921, would more nearly represent normal operating conditions as compared with the twelve months and to a certain extent exclude many of the ab - normal charges to operating expenses on account of the installation of machine switching in Omaha which, as we have heretofore said, are of such magnitude as to materially affect the figures of the state as whole. DEPRECIATION RESERVE CHARGES The first group of accounts under operating expenses that we will consider is the maintenance accounts, and under this group we will dis - cuss the total amount set up by the applicant company for current maintenance ami depreciation reserve, which, for the eleven month period ending November 30, 1921, as shown on Exhibit 1 of the December hearing, is $1,321,434.43. Of this sum, $700,000, in round figures, re - presents the charge against operating revenues and credits to the de - preciation reserve fund. The balance of the sum represents the charges for current maintenance for the neriod. It now becomes necessary for us to discuss at sufficient length the question of "depreciation" heretofore mentioned in numerous orders and supplements thereto entered by the Commission during the past three or four years when advances in toll and exchange rates have been al - lowed as a temporary measure to tide the company over embarrassing situations which, in our opinion, were affecting adversely the financial September $56,561 86 October 56,451.11 November 54,883.05 December 58,545.66 January 56,095.41 February 48,738.75 March 54,246.99 </seg>

In paragraph 2 of our order entered October 28, 1918, in the Nebraska company's original application for increase in exchange and toll rates, we said: "In defraying the cost of maintaining said exchange properties respectively in an efficient operating condition, and of creatirg a reserve for unrealized depreciaton, the combined amount of which shall be nine per cent per annum of the fixed capital invested by applicant in said properties respectively." Further in the same order we said: "It is further ordered that the basis of all charges to applicant's re - serve fund for accrued depreciation shall be the full cost of replacements made in kind, less salvage values of the property replaced. Where re - placements are not made in kind, the basis of charge shall be the repro - duction new value cf the property displaced as of the time of purchase .of the property installed, and the difference between that value and the cost of the property installed shall be debited or credited to plant ac - count according as the cost of the property installed shall be above or below the reproduction new value of the property displaced. No other charges of any nature shall be made to said fund." In supplemental order No. 4 to Application KC96 entered I'ecembe 31, 1919, we authorized a continuance of the temporary toll :.n«J ex change rates then in effect, and arrong other things required the :ipi&gt;li cant to do as fellow*: "It is further ordered that within 90 days from this date the com - pany shall appear at convenient time in defense of its method of handl ing actual earnings on depreciation reserve investment and show cause why the last paragraph of the original order herein dat-d October 28. 1918, regarding the charges to depreciation reserve of the full cost of replacements made in kind, less salvage, has not been observed, ami why the company should not be required in the future carefully to observe that condition." In July and August, l!»2O, pursuant to tr the ( a hearing was held on the question rf depreciation, at which time 0 siderable testimony was presented on behalf of anplicnnt, and of the Commission submitted data b2aring upon the question, "depreciation" as discussed in these finding.- will he understc present the money expended or set aside from revenues by the applicar company for the loss of or change in operating propertie caused by reason of wear and tear, obsolescnrce or public refill In fact, the word is intended to cover the cost of property displaced or abandoned from any cause whatsoever by reason of the ope growing telephone plant.

The charges n the depreciation reserve account ore, geneially speaking, made on a renewals, reconstruction or changes in the ce operated by the applicant company. In this parti- in handles its depredation reserve charges in a nunv.er than many of the other public utility com- o the regulation of this Commission. This ful consideration by the Commission and we time that it is necessary for us to order applicant to ..- method of making charges against the deprecation We recog.iizp that i;i a large organization such as the &amp; Telegraph company at this lime it become: •counting of all companies to bj nr\ a uniform b; experience that where an individual or spec al case l lecessary for us to investigate the charges made by the ap - npany against its depreciation reserve account, sufficient data instruct the figure", on a different basis if neees.-ary. do not wish it to be understood from what we have just are proposing any change in the settled policy of this Commission, i. e., that credits to the depreciation reserve account charged igainst operating revenues are set up on the books of an operating com- pany as a liability for the purpose of maintaining property, and if that reserve or any portion of it is used for the purpose of constructing ad - dition? and betterments to the property, it should be understood that that n-.oney may be expended only with the end in view that when the time does arrive that the property needs depreciation reserve money the amount so invested will be capitalized and the funds returned to the treasury of the company for the purpose of maintaining the property for which the funds have been set up. We will change our order hereto - fore entered to correspond to our findings as stated in this paragraph. From a careful reading of the testimony of witnesses for the appli - cant regarding the question of depreciation, it appears to be a fair state - ment to say as a general summary that the position of the applicant is that the money credited to the depreciation reserve account and charged against operating revenues is accumulated for the purpose of reim - bursing the investois for any diminution in the value of the property due to operations. In the December, 1921, hearing, Mr. livermore, statistician for the applicant, in answer to certain questions propounded by Corporation Counsel Lambert, for the city of Oir.aha, gave the fol - lowing testimony: Q. I inean from the standpoint of actual replacements, 'A. It is not up there for an actual replacement. It is merely to </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 reimburse the investor for the consumption of his capital in the render - ing of service. "Q. When it ceases to be in service ? "A. Yes, sir." (P. 40) Mr. Woodford, valuation engineer for the applicant, in the 1!&gt;2: hearing, gave the following testimony: "Q. Assuming, Mr. Woedford, all the answers to the questions you have made to me heretofore, what would be the occasion of the use of the reserve that you have now accrued in your depreciation reserve? "A. The credit balance in the reserve which we have at the present time is required so that future charges may be made to that account. By the maintenance of that credit account, an attempt is made to maintain the integrity of the investment in the property." (Vol. 14, p. 1072) LAt other hearings, witnesses for the applicant have given sun - tially the same testimony as &lt;et out in this paragraph. To our minds maintaining the integrity of the investment is not directly related to the credit balance in the depreciation reserve fund but rather such integrity is maintained by the rate of return that is actually secured from the results of operation of a given property after a proper allow - ance has been deducted from the operating income for the purpose of fully maintaining the prcpetty in service. If a public utility company fails to earn any return on the money invested, the net worth of the Cnirities drops in value regardless of the fact that the utility may ve an amount in its depreciation reserve account that represents a very material percentage, probably a.- high as twenty -five or thirty pe: cent of the cost of the property at the time of the investigation; but if the rates have not been sufficient to allow a return upon the money invested, the investor cannot realize on his holdings without sacrificing a deduction from the amount originally invested, assuming that the dollar put in by the investor was* actually invested in the property. The problem that confronts the Commission in all rate cases is whether or not the charges to operating expenses set up by the appli - cant company when considered in connection with the revenues received represent a normal experience for that company, and is related directly to the property at that time which produced the revenues and concurrent - ly caused the expenses. By "that time," we mean the period of time covered by the showing made by the petitioning company. Let us illustrate this point by an example: Suppose a given utility applies to the Commission for an increase in its rates. In its record before the Commission as to the results of operation for one year it shows that it has received in operating revenues $10,000 and that its operating ex - penses have been $10,000, taxes and all other actual expenditures in - cluded. From an investigation, it is found that the amount charged to </seg>
            <seg id="p233">233 operating expenses for maintenance of the plant represents the actual expenditures of money. Let us further assume that this individual utility is a telephone company, and an investigation develops the fact that included in the operating expenses is an item of installing a new switchboard which costs $4,000, and that the old switchboard had served the needs of the utility for a period of ten years prior to the installation of the new board. Under these statements of fact, it, is apparent that the Commission should not allow all of the $4,000 charge for the new switchboard to be included in the operating results set up for one year, but that the an-.ount should properly be spread over a period of time during which the new switchboard may be reasonably expected to con - tinue to serve the needs of the utility. This, to our minds, illustrates e purpose for which a depreciation reserve is set up on the books of operating company. The following example is exactly the converse of the one we have just cited: A company has a net income from its operation for one year of, say, $4,000, and on complaint of a patron that the rates should be re.luoed by reason of the fact that the $4,000 net income would yield an annual rate of return of fifteen per cent on the fair value of the property, the Commission finds, upon investigation, that in the operating •■xpenses as stated by the complainants, no allowances were made for the replacement of a switchboard that had to be taken out of the pro - perty within the very near future on account of its inefficiency. Mani - festly, the Commission should not reduce the rates of the utility until it ha.-- been convinced that a proper allowance has been taken into con - sideration in the statement of operating expenses which would take care of the replace ment of the switchboard worn out in the service. Further than this we do not go in order to protect the investment. The question of the amount that should be in the depreciation re- serve account at any given time is, to say the least, more or less com - plex. This is especially true in a growing public utility property, and probably most pronounced in the telephone business. From our inter - pretation of the use* for which depreciation reserve charges are set up, it appears to us that in the history of an operating company there will come a time when the amount of the credit balance in the depreciation reserve fund will not have to be augmented by credits to the account from operating revenues. In discussing the question of depreciation, we much prefer to deal with facts rather than theories. It is a very practical thing we are expected to do in reaching a just conclusion as to how much money shall be deducted from a company's operating re - venues for the purpose of maintaining the property of a public utility company. Telephone equipment does not lose in operating efficiency in like ratio during all the years of the life of a property. This year there may be some open wire leads that must come down to make way tor cable; next year the entire central office equipment may have to be abandoned because the switchboard and delated equipment are not large </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 enough to take care of the needs of the public. One year the needs of the property will require a small expenditure of money; the next year, the amount necessary n.ay be laige, and it is our problem to find the mean figure that will furnish the necessary funds to keep the property in good operating condition as a continuing concern. I In l'.:04 the Nebraska company found it necessary to throw out of r ice all of its magneto station sets and its magneto switchboard in Omaha exchange and install in the place of this equipment common ;ery apparatus. This was an expensive change in the operating litres of that company. In 1922, the Bell compare found it neces - f as an operating proposition to abandon some of the 1904 common :ery equipment in Omaha exchanges and install machine switching aratus instead. In like manner, aerial cable was taken down ami :ed underground. All of the loss in the plant on account of these nges was charged either to current maintenance or depreciation re - /e accounts, and concurrently, the plant in service accounts were nged according to the cost of the facilities at the time the changes •e made. These expenditures are matters of recori so that the actual amounts expended for plant and the maintenance of the same Kill be seated as a fact for any given period in the history of the 'Ne - braska company, and it does appear to us that a study that brings these expenditures of money together comparatively, gives the Commission a statement of facts from which we can draw some definite conclusions of how much money it takes to keep a dollar worth a dollar for the purpose uf earning a reasonable return. There appears to be an agreement running through the testimony witnesses for applicant upon this question of depreciation — that the mount that should be charged againtt operating revenues for depre - ation car. best be determined by taking a long period of time — the nger the batter. The thought that seemed to be uppermo^ in the inds of these witnesses was that if a percentage were arrived at over period of time that represented only the experience of the company actual charges against the depreciation reserve fund for cunent main - nance, renewal;; and replacements, that percentage would not represent le proper amount that should be set up in an operating statement for ny given period, 'specially when it is remembered that the property is rowing continually. The Commission has uniformly taken account of 1 of the varying conditions and has allowed enough in the percentage to take care of the property from all causes that may atfect the oper ;ing efficiency of the plant in service. By this we n ean that our per - centage is intended to include an amount that wi'.l take care of a grow - g plant. An important question which the Commission is required to deter - mine in all permanent rate cases which come before it for final decision is — are the amounts charged against the revenues for the maintenance </seg>
            <seg id="p235">235 of the utility's property during the period for which the results of oper - ation are shown, just and reasonable? Early in the history of the Commission it was found that this question of "maintenance of property" was one of the most vexing problems that had to be decided before it could determine whether or not the schedule of rates under consideration should be changed. The reason why the problem is so confusing is due almost entirely, if not altogether, to the fundamental principle in equity that the patron of today should pay for the ccst of the services rendered, or stated differently, future patrons should not be required to pay for the cost of services rendered by a public service company to a past generation. The confines of these findings do net allow us to further extend a general discussion of the problems surrounding the question of depreciation at this time. We must decide this case. Current Maintenance. As heretofore stated, the total amount charged by the applicant company for current maintenance for the eleven-month period ending November 30, 1921, is $621,983.15, or an average monthly cost per company station of 57.5 cents. The average cost per company station for current maintenance for the month of l&gt;ecember, 1921 is shown to be 78.2 cents, which again illustrates the reason why we have adopted the eleven month period instead of the •Mitire twelve months of 1921 as a basis upon which to figure the re - turn for the company as a whole, toll and exchange combined. When we come to consider the toll and exchange, it will be necessary for us to use the twelve-month period because the figures are not available in the record for the eleven-month period in the same classification of oper - ating revenues and expenses sub-divided between to)l and exchange. The current maintenance charges for the eleven-month period appear to be on a war-time basis. The average monthly charge per company station to current maintenance for the seven-year period 1915-1921, in- hown to be as follows: 1916— 38.7c 1916 — 40.7c 1917 — 41.9c 1918 — 44 3c 1919— 50.4c 1920— 53.7c 1921— 59.2c This comparison uses the Nebraska division of the Bell company for the year 1921. The other years are based upon the Nebraska com - pany's annual reports to the Commission. The above figures show that the current maintenance charges for the eleven- month period are on the highest basis of any year in the seven years shown. We feel that this average cost per company station will be reduced unless it may be that the machine switching installation in Omaha will have the effect of materially increasing the cost of the maintenance of central office equipment for the company as a whole. This is a matter that will have to be given further consideration at some future time if the </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORi conditions require. For the present, we will pass current maintenance and go to the amount estimated by the applicant which should be credited to the depreciation reserve fund arid charged to operating ex - penses for the eleven month period. Depreciation Operating Expense Changes. In the financial state - ment offered by the company at the December 28, 1921, hearing, Exhibit No. 1 shows a charge against current revenues for depreciation of $699,451.28. This figure was arrived at by the applicant by charging monthly to operating expenses under Account No. 608, "Depreciation of Plant and Equipment,' 7 five per cent of the total fixed investment in the Northwestern Bell Telephone company's property and then prorated to the state of Nebraska on the Nebraska company's 1920 annual depre - ciation rate applied to the different classes of depreciable property. The record is not clear as to why five per cent is used in the original charge for depreciation against operating expenses by the entire company. We understand that this is the percentage recommended by the parent company, the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company. There does not appear to be any consistent agreement between the •Ufffci ent engineers for the applicant who have testified before the Com - luission as to the question of depreciation. Mr. Rogers, who gave his testimony :n the depreciation case, Resolution No. 57, offered a set of percentages by classification of property which he found by his exper - ience to be the an^jjnt necessary to credit to the riepreciatior reserve account and charge to operating expenses. Mr. Woodfoi'l, in ois testi - mony, by the application of his average life-in-year basis, secured an - other set of percentages to be appHed to the several classes of property; :mil again, by applying his so-called "reverse accumulation of retire - ments" basis, gets still another set of depreciation rates that he finds should be applied to the different classes of property located in this state. The applicant, through its statistical depaitment, used anothor set of percentages for the apportionment to Nebraska of the total amount as set up on the operating books of the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone company as a system, which, as heretofore stated, was arrived at by applying five per cent to the depreciable property. Below we set out comparatively these different sets of percentages mentioned above: Booths &amp; sp. fittings 5. 5. Exch. pole lines 8.5 7.1 8.1 10.

            <seg id="p237">237 It will be noted from the above comparison of percentages that there seems to be a hopeless confusion in the figures. If this record contained a showing as to why the annual depreciation rate of five per cent as applied to the system as a whole were used, we might be able from tho testimony to determine the reasonableness of the charge. But as the record stands now, we can find no assistance from the figures set out above in our effort to determine the total amount that should be charged against operating revenues for so-called depreciation. We are not convinced from the showing made by the applicant in this case that our general plan of treating maintenance charges as to the applicant should be any different than that employed by us in the consideration of other public utility companies, i. e., consider current maintenance and depreciation together during the period for which the operating results are submitted for the Commission's consideration in a permanent rate case. As a matter of fact, abnormal situations arise in charges against current maintenance as well as for the reconstruction or rehabilitation of fixed property which are, under this company's system of accounting, included in current maintenance charges, and our problem is to eliminate from the calculation as near as may be abnor - mal situations w ithin the period for which the figures are set up. Con - sidering the two figures combined— current maintenance and depreciation charges — for the eleven-month period, shows a total of $1,321,434.43. This figure is 9.22 per cent per annum of the average depreciable plant in service during the period. Included in the above mentioned plant in service figure is the sum of $2,511,779.80 for buildings, in which sum is included all of the Nineteenth and Douglas street building. The appli - cant's valuation engineer testified that the annual percentage for de - preciation on buildings owned by the applicant located in Nebraska should be two per cent. In view of the fact that such a large percen - tage of the total property in Nebraska is represented by the Omaha building, and further that that building is used by the Bell company for the operation of all of its properties located in the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska, it appears to us that it is necessary to take into account this fact in the determination Exch. aerial cable 6.8 Exch. aerial wire . 11.5 Exch. drop wire Ex. u. g. cond. main. 2.0 Ex. u. g. cond. sub. 4.0 Ex. u. g. cable-main 3.0 Ex. u. g. cable-sub. 4.6 Toll pole lines 6.7 Toll aerial cable 6.8 Toll aerial wire (C) 2.3 Toll aerial wire (I) 8.0 Toll u. g. cond.

            <seg id="p238">238 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tan annual percentage figure that we will find as reasonable in this e. Employes of the Commission submitted tabulations in the record which show the average annual maintenance charges, current main - tenance and depreciation asgreg-ated for the Nebraska company with relation to the average depreciable plant in service during a penod of twenty-two years — January 1, 1899, to December 31, 1921). This tabu - lation shows that the maximum percentage expended by the company occurred in 1C04, when it aggregated 17.37 per cent of the book cost of ;he average plant in service during that year. ThisTis the year in which the common battery board in Omaha was installed. The percentage referred to above and as set forth for the years !!&gt;06 to 1920, inclusive, as shown on pasre 9 of Exhibit L-9, are as follows: The percentage for 1912 was affected by reason of the fact that a material portion of applicant's property was sold to other telephone companies in that year. During a poition of the war period it was a settled principle of the applicant not to expend any more money than was absolutely necessary in the reconstruction of its property, although it does so happen that within that period the changes in land and build - ing and some central office equipment in Omaha occurred. The aver - age percentage shown in the tabulation mentioned in this paragraph for the twenty-two year period was 8.37. That is, that cut of each dollar invested in depreciable plant, on the average, 8.37 cents were expended annually for the purpose of maintaining that dollar. By applying the same calculation to a nineteen-year period, 1899 to 1917, inclusive, the percentage is shown to be 8.53 per cent. In the last calculation, the material increase in land and buildings in Omaha has been excluded. After carefully weighing all of the facts presented for our con - sideration in the record, we are of the opinion and so find that 8.5 per cent per annum calculated monthly on the average depreciable plant in service will be a reasonable and just charge to be made against oper - ating revenues for the purpose of maintaining the combined property 1906— 9.29'v 1907—7.35 1908 — 6.58 1909—8.61 1910—7.61) 1911—9.93 1912—7.78 1913—9.41 1914—6.49 1915 — 8.53 1916 — 9.40 1917—6.58 1918—5.14 1919 — 7.92 1920—8.69 </seg>

We find this sum for the eleven months to be $1,184,566.24. This amount is arrived at by applying the 8Vi per cent to the average depreciable plant in service of $15,202,989.27 for the eleven-month period. These figures will be referred to later mmary of operating revenues and expenses for the eleven months. Former orders entered by the Commission will be made to «' correspond with the findings contained in this paragraph. Before we leave this question of depreciation, we should probably discuss briefly the balance in the depreciation reserve fund as of No - vember 30, 1921. By reason of the fact that the assets and liabilities of the Nebraska company were sold and transferred to the Northwestern Bell Telephone company as of December 31, 1920, we are unable to state the present balance in the depreciation reserve fund accrued for the pur - pose of maintaining Nebraska properties. In this particular we are »f the opinion that the accounting system of the applicant should be o constructed that it will show on the books of the company the amount of the depreciation reserve balance which results from the operation of the company's plant in this state, in accordance with the findings here- we will so provide in the order. On December 31, 1920, the balance sheet of the Nebraska company showed a credit balance in the depreciation reserve fund of $2,860,592.63. The credit balance in the fund just mentioned has been accumulated from operating revenues since January 1, 1900. The balance in the fund on l&gt;ecember 31 of each of the years mentioned is shown in Exhibit L-9 to be as follows 1899— s 1917 2.131,477.81 1918 2,521,364.23 1919 2,724.272.12 1920— 2,860,592.63 1900 67,578.96 1901 220,244.89 1902 282 311.65 !!&gt;03 376,774.23 1904 248,574.40 1905 265940.54 1906 231,973.45 1907 228,288.28 1938 364 435.97 19O9_ 731,162.00 1910 1,495,006.00 1911 15t.7.3£3.03 1912 1,587,400.00 1913 1,496,762.94 1914 1,635,852.61 1915 1,725,196.50 1916 1,772,063.92 (&gt;7,578.!&gt;6 </seg>
            <seg id="p240">240 It is shown from the above tabulation that there was a steady in - crease per annum in the credit balance in the fund here described. More money was charged to operating expenses ami credited to this account than was expended anil charged against the account for renewals re - placements and rehabilitation of the propeity during the period shown, with the exception of two or three years in the early history of the account. We are of the opinion that the 8% per cent annual charge we have allowed, as heretofore mentioned, will provide a sum of money that will probably not all be expended by the company to maintain the property in good operating condition. We base this conclusion largely on the fact that there have been added in recent years large sums of money to the plant account of property that has a long life and con - sequently a low annual maintenance charge. Buildings and underground equipment — cables and conduit — represent in round figures $4,700,000, or approximately thirty per cent of the total depreciable property oper - ated by the company a.s of November 30, 1921. There is another point that we desire to discuss briefly in connection with the expenditures and that is the relatively high percentage of charges for superintendence that are reflected in the 1921 operating expenses and charged against depreciation for the reconstruction, re - placements and renewals of plant in service. Numerous comparisons of the superintendence accounts, both in operating expenses and con - struction charges, show that this company's charges for these items are very much in excess of similar charges made by other large tele - phone companies that operate in this state, and, further, generally speaking, the charges made against Nebraska are higher than for the Bell company as a whole. What we say here in regard to the superin - tendence of maintenance accounts is true in the traffic and commercial groups of accounts. A comparison of these charges for the Bell com - pany and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company for the year 1921 per company station per month shows the following figures: Bell Co. L. T.&amp;T.Co. Maintenance 8.9c 5.8c Traffic 9.8c 3.5c Commercial 13.4c 7.7c Exhibit L-4, introduced by witnesses on behalf of the Commission, on page 9 shows that for a certain reconstruction job there was expended for direct labor $40,000 in round figures, and for supervision of these direct labor charges $24,000 was charged on the books of the company. The last figure is approximately sixty per cent of the first and is, in our estimation, very much in excess of what normal superintendence charges should be for an expenditure of money in the sums mentioned here. This is representative of the company's superintendence of re - newals. To illustrate the abnormal expenditure, in valuation cases the courts do not generally allow to exceed twenty-five per cent for superintendence of construction, and for organization, interest during construction, contingencies and legal expenses additional thereto. </seg>
            <seg id="p241">241 i Operating officials of the company have contended that the appli - i-ant -is furnishing exceptionally good telephone service in the territory i which it operate.-.. We are willing to admit most freely that appli - int furnishes' excellent telephone service in its territory. We are not Sling to say, however, that this service is appreciably better than is furnished by some other companies in the state, and we are unwilling to accept the expenditures here discussed upon this argument. Great quantities of exhibits and a large amount of testimony were ubmitted by the applicant in this record to show that the general staff jf the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company performed a very considerable service for the applicant company in the nature of research ■ad general outline work, which should have the effect, in our opinion, i&gt;f reducing the amount of money chargeable against superintendence rather than increasing it. We will expect the company to materially reduce the overhead or superintendence charges all along the line, i. e., the plant, traffic, and commercial expense groups of account. TRAFFIC EXPENSES We will next discuss the combined traffic expenses for the eleven - month-period. The total amount charged against traffic expenses by the applicant for the eleven-month period is shown in Exhibit 1 of the Hecember hearing to be $1,363,288.57. Of this amount, the amount charged against operators' wages, Account No. 624, is, in round figures, $994,000, or, in terms of percentage, 73 per cent. This is the group of accounts that will be directly affected when the machine switching installation in Omaha has been completed and adapted to the services required for the Omaha zone. Operators' wages in Omaha are, in round figures, 63 per cent of the total operators' wages paid by appli - cant company in the state of Nebraska. It is shown in the record that the applicant expects to gradually reduce the average wage paid to operators by reason of the so-called turnover of the employes engaged in this class of service. There is nothing in the record that would indicate that the applicant has in view making a change in the schedule of wages paid first-class operators, but does expect to pay a less wage to new employes coming into this line of service, and to thereby effect an economy in the total amount of money paid out for operators' wages and at the same time receive the same or greater service from these employes by reason of more efficient results being secured from the operators employed. In Exhibit L9, page 26, the operating expense accounts of the Lin - coln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company are compared with the Nebraska company for the years 1915 to 1920, inclusive, and for the Nebraska division of the Bell company for the year 1921. This exhibit shows the following as to total traffic expenses in cents per company station per month : </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 Nebr. Tel. Co. L. T. &amp; T. Co. The above tabulation shows that in 1921 the cost to the Bell com - pany for traffic expenses per company station was almost two and one - half times that experienced by the Lincoln company. This is partly due to automatic operation in Lincoln and manual operation in Omaha during this period. This explanation is not applicable outside the two cities where the conditions are comparable. The applicant contends that it operates a large portion of its telephone property in a more sparsely settled part of the state than does the Lincoln company. This fact would not, in our estimation, affect in any appreciable degree the traffic expenses. It might, anil possibly does affect the expense for any given unit in maintaining its toll lines, and probably to a certain dopree the maintenance of exchange properties. The equated traffic unit* are ?ho*m from the record to be about the same for tt;ll services for both companies. We quote from the record as follov "The equated units of the Bell company throughout 19 determined for a huge number of exchan^e^ an. I finally n&lt; shew that the toll load was 37.33 per cent of the total 'raffic ioai. same computation for the Lincoln company show- 36 61 per cent load." These percentages clearly show that as far as the traffic expense is concerned, there is no reason why the Bell company should be $1.26 per subscriber's station for the year 1921 as compared to 54 cents for the Lincoln company, except as above indicated. Further, upon a revenue comparison basis we find from the record that approximately 34 per cent of the total revenues credited by the applicant to Nebraska traffic is toll business, while the Lincoln company's toll business for the same period of time is a little more than 42 per cent of the total venues. This shows that, if anything, the Lincoln company would be entitled to show a greater cost per subscriber's station for traffic ex penses than the applicant because it costs more in traffic expenses handle toll business per dollar collected than exchange businr In Exhibit L-4 it is shown that if the applicant had operated at the same cost per station outside of Omaha as experienced by the Lincoln company outside of Lincoln, there would have been a saving in its direct traffic expenses of $151,000 for the eleven-month period. It is further shown that if its supervision of traffic had born as low a ratio to direct expenses for the entire state as the ratio shown by the Lincoln company's accounts a further saving of $18,000 would have resulted. 1915 1!U6 li']7 1918_ 1919 1920— i&lt;;2i • cents ) 52 52 59 71 91 113 120 (cen 3 7 35 38 43 43 58 54 ;s </seg>
            <seg id="p243">243 Thus the aggregate saving on the Lincoln basis would have been SKin.OnO for the eleven-month period. The monthly reports to the Commission of the applicant snow that the traffic group of expenses charged by the company to the state of Nebraska for the eleven months ending Noven'bsr 30, 1921, was $13.85 per station. The same figures for the Bell company's system, exclus - ive of Nebraska, show a cost of $11.90, or in round figures, $2.00 less for the system than for Nebraska. The applicant operated an average of H8,5OO subscribers' stations for the eleven months of 1921. If it had operated in Nebraska at the same average cost per station as it did in the balance of its system the traffic expenses would have been $192,000 less than shown in Exhibit No. 1 introduced in the December, 1921, hear- ing:. The following tabulation is taken from the company's monthly re- ports to the Commission for" the period December 1, 1921, to August 31, 1922, and compares the per station cost stated in cents for total traffic expenses in the state of Nebraska and the system as a whole exclusive of the Nebraska figures: State_of System Exclusive Nebraska of Nebraska It will be noted that in July the Nebraska figures are less than for the system as a whole exclusive of Nebraska. We understand this was occasioned by reason of a material reduction in the number of operators required to operate a part of the Omaha exchange on account of the installation of machine switching. The above figures clearly indicate that the traffic expenses of applicant are being reduced. Just how much of this reduction is caused by machine switching we are unable to say, but the figures indicate that the eleven months of 1921 are abnormally high as to traffic expenses and that before a reasonable conclusion could be reached by the use of the eleven-month figures as to the results of operation it would be necessary to reduce the traffic expenses as stated in Exhibit 1. Exhibit L9, page 18, shows that for the major portion of the eleven months of 1921 the average cost per company station per month was the highest ever experienced by the company in the operation of its Nebraska property. The exhibit shows the following average costs for the first eleven months of 1920 compared to the same period of 1921: Uecember January February March April May June July August 120 109 103 113 107 105 103 100 99 105 97 94 102 101 101 101 102 102 </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 After careful consideration of all the facts discussed under this sub - division we are of the opinion that there are many opportunities for economies in the traffic group and consideration will be given to the probability of lower traffic expenses in the future as the result of such economies being practiced. COMMERCIAL AND GENERAL EXPENSES It is shown that for the eleven months of 1921 ending November 30 the total amount charged to the commercial group of expenses is $370,539.63, anil to the general expenses $139,260.19. The commercial expenses are affected, generally speaking in the same manner as to cer - tain accounts in these groups as the traffic expenses. This is especially true in the account for superintendence, with the exception that the charges for supei'intendenee are larger in the Bell company's statement of commercial expenses than in the Lincoln company's statement of similar expenses. Exhibit L4 shows that if the Bell company had operated the property in Nebraska on the same cest per subscriber's station for the direct charges of the commercial group of accounts as compared with the cost to the Lincoln company for the same accounts the Nebraska company would have operated at a cost of $56,000 less for the eleven months of 1G21 than shown in Exhibit 1 ; and if the Bell com - pany had operated at the same ratio of commercial supervision and gen - eral expense to direct expenses as the Lincoln company a further saving of $44,000 would have been experienced for the eleven months, making a total saving in these two groups of $100,000 in round figures. When for this period the Nebraska operations are compared with the rest of the system, commercial and general expenses are slightly less in Nebraska, but on the other hand the monthly reports of applicant for the eight months January to August, 1922, inclusive, as compared with the same period in 1921 show that the company is reducing its cost for commercial and general expenses per company station in the system exclusive of Nebraska, while in this state the costs are a little higher for commercial and very materially higher for general expenses. The same reports show that there was charged to the commercial group of accounts a total of $1,280,138 for the system including Nebraska, and (cents) January 100 February 93 March 102 April 104 May 105 June 115 July 115 ' August 126 September 114 October 117 November 123 (cents) 129 120 135 129 13C 131 126 127 119 120 120 </seg>
            <seg id="p245">245 for the same period there was charged to the state for the same expenses $274,688. This last sum deducted from the total for the system shows that there was expended and charged to this group of accounts outside of Nebraska $985,450. The average number of subscribers' stations operated for the eight -month period mentioned in Nebraska is shown to be 99,439, and fcr the system exclusive of Nebraska 381,168. These figures show that the average cost for commercial ex - penses for the eight months for Nebraska is $2.76, and for the system, exclusive of Nebraska, $2.58. The same computation for the same period in 1921 gives the following results: Nebraska, $2.75; system exclusive of Nebraska, $2.79. These figures show that in Ne - braska in 1922 the cost per company station was cne cent more than in 1921, and in the .system, exclusive of Nebraska, twenty-one cents less. The general expense group of accounts shows even a more marked change in Nebraska as compared to the balance of the system than we have just noted in the commercial group of accounts. For the eight months period in 1921 the general expense per subscriber's station in Nebraska was $1.06; for the system, excluding Nebraska, $1.11 — five cents higher. The same period in 1922 shows $1.17 for Nebraska, or an inciease of eleven cents over 1921; for the system, exclusive of Ne-. braska, ninety-five cents — sixteen cents less in 1922 than in 1E21. These figures clearly show, to our minds, that for some unaccountable reason the commercial and general expenses in Nebraska are ascending in 1922 and for the system, excluding the state, are descending. We will now discuss the so-called 4% per cent allowance made by the Bell company to the A. T. &amp; T. company for (allegeu) services rendered in addition to the rent of station apparatus equipment and ■accounted for in the accounting .system of the applicant -under accouVit No. 527. Licensee Revenue?, Dr. The Four and One Half Per Cent A large amount of testimony and many exhibits were introduced in the record by the applicant in an attempt to justify the amount charged agsinst revenue in the sum of $185,024.84, as shown in Exhibit Imo. 1 for the eleven-month period ending November 30, 1921. The amount just tY.entioned was arrived at by the applicant by taking 4% per cent of certain groos revenue accounts which were accrued from toll and ex - change services for the eleven-month period. . The question the Commission is required to decide in this case is whether or not the $165,000 plus, that is deducted by applicant from gross revenues, which cause the reduction of the amount named from the revenues of the company, and concurrently reduce the net income that might otherwise be available for the payment of a return to the owners of the property, is just and reasonable under all the circum - stances. $185,000 is close to l% per cent of the base figure which we </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 have heretofore found to be a reasonable amount upon which to base the annual rate of return, using the eleven-month period as a basis of calculation. The Nebraska company entered into a contract in 11)18 with the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, which coi tract is al'eged to be a continuation of a substantially similar contract, which was entered into by the parties here mentioned that dates back to about the peiioii when the telephone, as a means of communication, was first put in Oper - ation in Nebraska. The first eight paragraphs of the contract here mentioned are de - voted to the relations that shall exist between the licensee and licensor, with regard to the use of certain telephone equipment owned by the licensor in the form of transmitters, receivers and induction Coils, and outlines the basis upon which the long distance or toll business shall be conducted by the licensee under the grants allowed by the licensor. The territory in which the licensee may do a toll business is specifically out - lined. Section No. 9 of said contract describes in a jjeneral way other services that may be received by the licensee from the licensor, if so desired, and in paragraph No. 11 of said contract are the provisions under which the so-called "4^4 per cent" of the gross revenues of the licensee shall be paid to the licensor in monthly installments. It is provided that all of the expenses connected with the collection, sub - division and accounting of the toll charges collected are borne by the licensee and charged to the current operating expense accounts. In other words, we understand from the contract that on a toll Call origin - ating in the Omaha exchange, destinating in New York City, upon which the chasge rray be five dollars, and for which the applicant herein receives thirty cents of the total charge, and the message is delivered directly from the exchange board of the applicant to the long distance toll board of the American company in Omaha, all of the expense of col - lecting, sub-dividing and guaranteeing the amount paid by the Omaha subscriber is borne by the licensee, in this instance, the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company. It is further provided in section No. 11 that the licensee shall pay to the licensor seventy-five cents per telephone per month for all tele - phones not in use by the licensee in excess of 3 per cent of the total number of telephones charged to the licensee by the licensor. The re - maining paragraphs of the contract, viz., 12 to 16, inclusive, provide how the licensor may take possession of the licensee's property in case of failure to perform its part of the agreement, as provided in the con - tract. In the paragraphs last mentioned is outlined specifical'y the territory in which the licensee may do a long distance telephone busi - ness. We note that the contract provides that the licensee pays all the taxes — federal, state, county, municipal or ether taxes which may be assessed on the property owned by the lessor and operated by the lessee. </seg>
            <seg id="p247">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 247 There was filed with the Commission on April 13, 1922, in answer to certain questions propounded by us in the questionnaire, a copy of the new contracts entered into as between the American Te'.ephone and Telegraph Company and the Iowa Telephone Company, under which the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, the applicant herein, is oper - ating in the live states comprising the exclusive territory in which it pan of the American company's subsidiary organization. Some of the provisions, contained in this and related contracts are ex - nglj interesting, ami to our minds, throw considerable light on the contract herein discussed, and clearly show that there is a ciiieiL benefit accruing tt the American company by reason of the fact that the American company retains to itself the operation of all of the long- distance lir.es that connect the five states with each other and as between each state and other states located outside of the Northwestern company's territory. To our ninds, the toll provisions of the contract here mentioned show beyond doubt, that it benefits the American com - pany in a far greater degree than it does the Northwestern company. Inasmuch as we do not find it possible to permanently decide this per cent'' question in these !iitdinj;s. we believe we had best take the space to pcint out some of the more important features of the Con - tract here discussed. The first paragraph of the agreement now in effect as between the American company and the Northwestern company re:;ils as follows: i- agreement, made this (i day it May. 1: 21. by am! between th' American Tekohone and Telegraph Company, a corporation of the St;&gt;tP of New York, hereinafter called the "American lomrany, 1 ' party of the first part, the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, a corpora - tioi of the Mate of Iowa, hereinafter called the "North western Com - pai \ " parts of the second part, the Northwestern Telephone Exchange Company, a corporation of the State of Minnesota, hereinafter called the "Exchange Company," party of the thiid part, and the Nebraska Telephone Company, a corporation of the State of Nebraska, hereinafter caiifn tile ' Nebraska Company," party of the fourth pait." flow seven paragraphs describing the old and the new re- lation- that are covered by the above quoted agreement, and following these paragraphs, the direct provisions of the contract as follows: Now, Therefore, the parties hereto aerree as follow 1.

Belt Signs as president of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, the Northwestern Telephone Exchange Company, and the Nebraska Telephone Company. The underscored portions of the contract above quoted, to our minds, present a very important question and one that must be thoroughly understood before this Commission or any other regulating body, can definitely decide whether or not the American company should be allowed to collect from the patrons of the applicant four and one-half cents out of every dollar collected in Nebraska for exchange and toll service. It appears to us that here is a situation that must be fully explained before we are able to determine whether the rule as laid down by the United States Supreme Court in the Houston case, is being complied with by the applicant or not. We cannot judge whether or not there </seg>
            <seg id="p249">249 is being an "imposition" practiced "upon the community" until we are in possession of all the fact? related to the subject. This the American company has refused to furnish in this case. Through the applicant's attorney they have said: "We do not have to show this Commission anything regarding the operations of the American company's long lines department so called." A large amount of testimony has been introduced in this record, upon which the applicant appears to rely as the reason why we should allow the $185,000, plus, deducted by it from the revenues collected for the eleven-month period heretofore mentioned. The testimony was very elaborate, and minutely instructive for anyone caring to make a de - tailed study of the work performed by the so-called general staff of the American Telephone and Telegraph company, but for the purpose of deciding the issues in this case, we would like to have had some testi - mony in the record which would enlighten us on why the applicant is paying 4% per cent of certain gross revenues to the American company. The problem we have to decide is why the percentage should be 4V4. Why not 5*4 or 3% per cent? If we understand counsel for applicant, the claim is — that we, in our legislative capacity, have no authority of law to investigate the reasonableness of the 4% per cent charge on ac - count of the contract. In that event, the introduction of the contract was all that was necessary. However, it is our conception of our dutios that we are not limited by the terms of the contract. We think that sentence in the opinion of the Supreme Court, entered in May of tnis year in the case City of Houston v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Com - prr.y, in discussion of the assignments of error as claimed by the city Houston, viz.: "Under the circumstances disclosed in the evidence, the fact that the American Telephone and Telegraph Company controlled the com - pany and the Western Electric Company by stock ownership is not im - portant bt'jond requirirg close scrutiny of their dealings to prevent im position upon the community served by the company." (Italics are ours) is important and leaves the field of investigation open to the regulatory body to investigate and determine the reasonableness of the contract in order to prevent "imposition upon the community served by the com - pany." Considering the question here discussed, it appears to us that the basis of charge as provided in the contract is fundamentally wrong and condemned specifically by the Supreme Court of the United States. The company applies the percentage to certain gross revenues received by the applicant. The more the revenues the more the charge against revenues for the benefit of the American company, which method of calculation constitutes a circle, — the more the rate the more the charge, ad infinitum. In the Minnesota Rate Case, Mr. Justice Hughes used the following language: </seg>
            <seg id="p250">250 "The value of the use as measured by rate cannot be made the criterion when the rate itself is in question." The problem with us in this case is, shall the $280,000 or $300,000 in - creased revenues applied for by the applicant, be allowed, and concur - 8ntly and automatically with such allowance provide for a payment of k per cent thereof to the American company fcr alleged services rvu rendered to the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company. There is no exchange operate&lt;l by the applicant company is directly benefited hj payment herein discussed. Numerous questions were propounded jught to apply the answers attempted, in which we ! by the American company to the E times dubbed by the attorney used a 1 -; representing an ;sv ; hundrp-d subscribers' station applicant's exchange at "Po.lunk. for applicant as "Podunkville", whic age Nebraska exchange of six in service. It was impossible see where "Podunk" was appreciably benefited by the 4*£ per Cent L'harg against the revenues, toll and exchange, collected by the appl this representative Nebraska town. It was clear that in the "tunda mental plans" for a city of the size of Omaha the ccmp; ill ceive benefit from the general staff of the A. T. &amp; T. organization and further, that the long distance lines of the app'icant located in this state were benefited by certain appaiatus and services rendered, v had been worked out under the general staff of the American comi But what we are asked to do here is to allow this 4V2 per cent chars most revenues hereafter collected by the applicant ill this state. From this Commission's many years of supervision of applicant company and its predecessor in business, in connection with many other telephone companies operating large exchanges and long distance busi - ness, we are net impressed with the greater and more successful oper - ation of the exchanges and long distance lines operated by the Be'l and Nebraska companies. We are not so sure from all of our experience and investigation of the matters in this record but that the operatir.fr ex - penses of the applicant company during the year 1921, were greater than they Would have been if said company had been operating in this state as an independent company and not associated directly with the great Bell system. One company in this state that operates between sixty and Pmony in this recoul that even tends to show that the services per- ed by the parent companj warrant additional payments. ■ ■ We listened closely to the witnesses connected with the general staff of the American eompanj and to those wiir.e &gt;es in thft employ rf the Bell company who testified on the value of the services rendered and received in consideration of the payment from the iVi r.cr cent Ctl&amp;rge, and we think it a fair Statement, as a general summary of all of the testimony given on this point, that the major portion of the Services rendered by the general .^taif relate to the long- lines toll bnsines£ ami to the construction and reconstruction &gt;&gt;r lai^e units of exchange pro perty. We were unable to see at any point were the average Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p251">251 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION seventy thousand subscribers' stations in service and does a very con - siderable toll business in the state has found it advisable to discontinue the so-called ' three-legged'" administrative organization in its opera - tion of its business, an&lt;l establish in lieu thereof what might be termed a "one-legged" organization; that is, that in an exchange of, say, two or subscribers' stations the manager of that exchange would c ill re attend to all of the duties connected with the operation of the exchange in that city without regard to whether or not the particular thing under consideration required his attention in the plant department, traffic de - partment or the commercial branch of the service. He is the general head of all the activities of the company in that exchange, and this com - parable company has in this same period, by these economies, converted deficient earnings into a noticable surplus without an increase of rates. We are very strongly of the opinion that this kind of a change in oper- .ition could not be made by the operating officials of the applicant in this state unless the same had been authorized by the American company. It is claimed that by reason of this American company supervision, construction and operating problems of the operating telephone com- pany have been reduced to the most efficient bases that can be devised for the actual operation of telephone companies in this country, includ- applicant. We are not impressed with the conclusiveness of umer.t. Other telephone companies are furnishing most excel- lent service in this state, rToth in exchange and toll business, who are not related in any way to the American company and who do not find it advisable to buy their supplies from the Western Electric com- pany. We are impressed, however, with the contention of the applicant t'-.;it the operation of the coirpany in this state is benefited by the con- tract tlipy have with the Western Electric company. It does appear ecord ihat the applicant company does enjoy warehousing iml a i eduction in the purchase price of materials as corn- i &gt;ther telephone companies operating in this state. However, par ppears from the record that — by reason of then- super-organiza- t ; "' which i- used by the Bell company under the American company's plan of operation, it ultimately costs the applicant a greater amount per unit of property in.-talled, than the same kind of telephone equipment installed in the same relative position in other telephone properties located in this state. We will treat of this in more detail later. The '"supply expenses" which, under the accounting system of the applicant, are added to the purchase price of materials run from 15 to 20 per cent cf the price paid for said materials, so that the ultimate re - sult of the 1 benefits claimed by the applicant for the Western Electric contiact cannot be definitely determined unless we follow the charge until it is finally incorporated in the book cost of the plant in service, upon which a hare rate is figured. We have not attempted to make such a study in this case. Generally speaking, this Commission has found it advantageous </seg>
            <seg id="p252">252 to use the cost of services rendered as a basis upon which to calculate the reasonableness of a general schedule of rates as they have been pre - sented before the Commission in numerous cases for its decision. We do not at this time see any good reason why that principle should not be applied in this case, except for the reason that we do not have in the record sufficient data upon which to calculate the COSt to the American Company of furnishing the services rendered to the Bell company in this state. For this reason we have decided to accept the amount set UP by the applicant for the eleven-month period in the final summary that we shall later on set out in these findings, upon which we finally deter - mine the question submitted for our consideration in these proceedings, viz.; whether or not the application of the company shall be granted. In our final figures we shall calculate the Licensee Dr. charge in the same manner as applied by the applicant to the actual revenue re - ceived for the eleven-month period. In doing this we wish it to be understood that our decision on the question discussed in this subdivision (4% per cent) is not final and applies to the case in hand at the present time. We reserve the right to make a more detailed investigation into the cost to the American company of furnishing the service covered by the contract here discussed. Possibly applicant company cannot avoid this contract which we have here found to be a liberal one to the parent company. All sub - sidiaries of the American company pay this percentage. In so far as it is a contract, more liberal than the telephone industry in Nebraska makes necessary, it increases expenditures and decreases net return from operations in this state. Alterations of certain of the contract provisions would serve to increase the net return, but we are unable to state from the record just what savings would be realized. In allowing for this case the full 4% per cent we realize that the payments go to the same destination as do the dividends earned and paid, and whether called dividends or the unnecessary extent of the 4% per cent payments they serve as returns from the property devoted to public service in Nebraska. We are impressed from the testimony given of record by represen tatives of the Commission, that the cost of furnishing the services under the 4V4 per cent contract, as performed by the American company, can be satisfactorily determined upon a careful investigation of the records of that company. In this case the position of the American company has been as heretofore stated that they are not required under the law to allow the representatives of the Nebraska Commission to go into their books and records for the purpose of ascertaining this cost. In closing this subdivision of our findings, we desire to say that from our investigation so far in the provisions cf the contract and the working of the same, we are impressed with the service rendered by the general staff of the American company to the Western Electric company, </seg>
            <seg id="p253">253 for which — -under their plan of assessing the charges — no revenue ac - crues to the American company. This situation is, in our opinion, unfair to the patrons of this appli - cant who is a part of the American company and pays large sums of money into the treasury of that company. We think the record before US in this case clearly shows that the general staff of the American company is devoting the major portion of its time to matters that have to do with the manufacture of telephone apparatus rather than the operation of the same. The major portion of the output of the Western Electric company is telephone equipment. SUMMARY OF COMBINED REVENUES AND EXPENSES Under this subdivision we will bring together the gross revenues and operating expenses as we have discussed them in order that a final calculation may be made from which we determine whether or not the application of the company should be allowed as made. It is not neces - sary for us to go back and refer to the particular parts of the findings where we secure the figures which we set out below. Anyone desiring to verify the result of our work can, by reference to the preceding pages, check the figures which we bring together at this point. We have de - ducted from miscellaneous revenues $10,000 which represents an esti - mated amount that is said to have been included in miscellaneous re - venues in Bixhibit No. J, presented in the December hearing, to repre - sent the "carrying charge" on furniture and fixtures included in the stipulated plant in service.

After weighing all the testimony of record and carefully giving consideration to all of the matters discussed by us in the preceding pages of these findings, we conclude and so find that the above constructive income statement for the eleven months ending November 30, 1921, re - presents a more normal statement of the results of operation for the period named than the conclusions reached in the tabulations shown on Exhibit No. 1, introduced in evidence in the December 28, 1921, hearing. and, further, that the result? of operation foi the eleven months more nearly represent a normal statement of operating revenues ami expends than the twelve-month peiiod submitted in the 1022 hearing, Exhibits I"l and 1-2, for reasons heretofore fully Bet forth.

We have given consideration to. the combined revenues and exiien.-e.- of the applicant in this state and are convinced that in some particul the rates are not properly adjusted as between themselves the exchange rates, and that the division cf the operating expe tween toll and exchange is not in all particulars tail and reasonable.

We will first discuss the toll rates ar.d follc with our discussion of the adjustment of exchange rates as we thi they should be made.

We are convinced that the volume of station to itation service in toll operation should be increased on short-haul traffic ;o the maximum point that the patrons can use this class of service in facilities nay produce their maximum amount of public ;eivice at a minimum cost. ie applicant shows h net annual return on the book aipmer.t devoted to toll service as of Novembar 30, Inhibit 1-1, a net return from the opera- ies located in this state for the twelve-month The applicant has taken the actual toll rev - operation of its leng distance business in Ne - uul to this stun has added a percentage of the .1 iy the applicant on its interstate business. We do not wish od as placing our stamp of approval upon the methods taleiiitiit of toll revenues which should be credited to the aska. This is a matter which can be left for further if circumstances should require it in the future. As we .i erstand it, the credit to toll revenues dees not give full consideration ;he traffic passing entirely across the long distance lines of applicant ocated in this state and there is in force a general practice of what we short-hauling" the applicant company on interstate toll teas \&gt;y reason of the contractual relationships existing between the rican and the Bell ccirpanies. The result of this practice, brought bout by the contract terms, serves to deprive applicant of toll revenues /hich it would insist upon receiving- were it not for the inter-corporate elatior Toll Income Statement. On page 1 of Exhibit 1-2 are shown the •sjlts of operating the applicant's toll plant in the state of Nebraska for the calendar year 1921. The total toll revenues for the period are shown to be $1,054,278.30, and the total toll operating expenses which the applicant has found chargeable against these toll revenues as 57,278 20. Further deductions from revenues are made by reason of collectible charges ard taxes assigned to the toll business in the total sum of $54,003.7-5. By deducting the expenses here mentioned from the total revenues the applicant finds the total toll operating income for the be $212,1)96.35. Rent and other miscellaneous deductions are iwn amounting to $54,385.71. This amount deducted from the ie net operating income leaves a net income available for paying a return of $188,610.64. On the same page the book cost of toll plant in serv - ice, including working capital, as of Novenber 30, 1921, is shown to be $3,976,133.43, and that the percentege available for a return on the in- ;tment for the twelve months is 4.74 per cent We have carefully scrutinized the several bases adopted by appli - :ant's witnesses for the purpose of apportioning certain operating ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p256">256 penses incurred in common for the transaction of toll and exchange services and in general we have no criticism to offer. We think that the general plan of separating the property and the expenses at the back side of the exchange switchboard is fair and reasonable. We are of the opinion that it is not practical to attempt to prorate the exchange facilities as between toll and exchange. While it is true that a sub - scriber's station is used for the purpose of completing a toll conversation and does constitute a part of the total plant used for such services, yet. at the same time, we see very little difference between the use of a subscriber's station for calling a long distance operator for the purpose of talking to some person in another city and for calling the grocer. We have found that a very small percentage, probably not more than five pei cent, of the subscribers' stations in service produce more than 95 per cent of the toll charges originating on that exchange. And while there is an advantage that accrues to an exchange subscriber by reason of the fact that he can call or be called from any point distant from his own exchange, that standby service is very little, if any, different from the privilege secured by the subscribers in their ability to talk to other subscribers on their own exchange It takes more time of a toll oper - ator to complete a long distance conversation than it does to put up an exchange call, but it takes no more of the exchange operator's time to put up a call to the toll operator for the subscriber than it floes to con- nect them to some other subscriber on the exchange The equated unit basis adopted by the applicant for the division of operators' wages and several ether minor operating expense accounts where the service is rendered in common to both classes of service, toll and exchange, we find to be fair and reasonable, with the exception of the basis used for determining the equated units. This criticism on this point relates almost entirely to the Omaha exchange and is oc - casioned by the fact that the American company has its own long- dis tance toll board and toll operators located contiguous to the toll boards and exchange cer.tial office of the applicant in the Nineteenth and Douglas street general office building. The equated unit study made by the applicant in 1921 and used for the purpose of making division of the operating expenses introduced in testimony by itness Livermore (contained in Exhibits 1-1 and 1-2) shows that the city of Omaha has a materially different percentage of toll units as compared with other ex - changes operated by the company in this state. Out of a total number of 633,296 units only 67,028, or 10.58 per cent, of the total were toll, while at the exchange of Grand Island, with a total number of equated units of 34,216, 13,986, or 40.88 per cent, were devoted to the handling of the toll business. In Norfolk the percentage is shown to be 52.77 per cent toll of the total units; and for eighty-one magneto exchange? operated by the company in this state 35.7 per cent were toll; and six - teen common battery exchanges outside of the larger cities show that 37.99 per cent of the total units handled were toll. Aggregating all of the exchanges in the state, exclusive of Omaha, it is shown that thirty- </seg>
            <seg id="p257">257 seven per cent of the total equated units were devoted to the toll busi - ness. We understand that in the count of toll units no record is made of a call originating at an Omaha subscriber's station, destination some point on the American company's lines. For exmple: Let us assume that Armour &amp; Co. call the South Omaha exchange and put in a long distance call to a party in New York City. The call from the Armour station to the South Omaha exchange is counted as an exchange unit. The call from the South Omaha exchange to the American company's operator located in the Nineteenth and Douglas street building is not counted. The expense of accounting for that call and making- the col - lections for same, the accounting to the American company and the payment of the amount due to the American company, are all contained in the operating expenses of the applicant, and of those operating ex - penses that are divided on an equated unit basis no charge is made against the toll business for the services rendered. We think this practice should be corrected and some account taken of the toll calls that go to the American company's board. This is especially true be - cause we understand that a large percentage of the toll business that originates and terminates in the Omaha exchange goes to or comes directly from the American company's board located in the Douglas street building. The point discussed by us here does not deal with very large figures and would not seriously affect the final conclusion reached by the applicant as shown in Exhibit .1-2. Witness Livermore has shown on page 3 of Exhibit 1-2 that $170,842.67 of the total amount of depreciation reserve credited to the state of Nebraska should be charged against the toll operation for the twelve-month period. The figure just mentioned was arrived at by usin.u- as a iui e the depreciation rates by classification of property as was used by the Nebraska company in setting up depreciation reserve for the year 1920. Said percentages were then reduced approximately thirteen per cent in each class of property in order that the total amount of Ifpreciation reserve charged against operating expenses and credited to the reserve should equal flat five per cent of the total property of the Northwestern Bell system. This computation resulted in the figures for two clashes of property in toll plant as follows: Recast \\ nod ford 1920 1921 Ex. J-8 251— Toll pole line 6.l9f 5.307V, 9.4% 253— Toll aerial wire 3.8% 3.306% 7.2% The applicant's toll pole line and toll aerial wire in service as of November 30, 1921, are approximately eighty-six per cent of the total toll property as shown in Exhibit 1-2. There is a wide variance between the figures shewn in the above comparison of depreciation percentage rates and it is somewhat of a problem for us to determine which is the more equitable for the purpose of deciding how much depreciation should be charged against the cpei- </seg>
            <seg id="p258">258 ating toll revenues in the twelve-month period. There was no oral testimony in this record supporting the 1920 depreciation rates while the rates of depreciation shown in Exhibit J-8 were testified to by the ap - plicant's valuation engineer, Mr. Woodfortl. After careful consideration we have decided to use Mr. Woodford's figures for the purpose of de - termining the proper amount to be charged against toll business. We use the percentage shown in Exhibit J-8 and apply those percentages to the total exchange and toll property by classification as of November 30, 1921. Then we aggregate the sums so found and calculate the ratio that the toll bears to the total of both toll and exchange and get a percentage of 34. We apply this percentage to the total depreciation reserve charges set up by the company in Exhibit 1-1 and Exhibit 1-2 in the sum of S759,219.22 and find the total amount that should be charged aguin.-t the toll business, using the same plan of calculation as adopted by the applicant's witnesses, to be $258,134.54 instead of S170.842.67, as heretofore mentioned. This computation would have the result of decreasing the net income found by the applicant for the toll business from 4.74 per cent to 2.5 per cent, and would concurrently increase the percentage of net return realized on the excnange business from 3.0o to 3.8 per cent. We do not mean to say that the exchange property earned only 3.8 per cent in 1921 and the toll property only 2.5 per cent. We only say that under the testimony of its own engi - neer as to a proper division of depreciation between toll and exchange these figures would be the result of the company's computation. Ex - traordinary repairs in some years constitute a very large percentage of the total amount of money charged against the depreciation reserve ac - count. These extraordinary repairs are in many instances, and in the major portion of the charges against the depreciation reserve account, caused by storms, and generally speaking these storms do more damage to toll aerial equipment than to exchange lines and certainly cause the heavy emergency expenditures. This is especially true as to pole lines. The record does not show the division of expense between toll and ex - change property occasioned by storm damage, but reference to the year 1921 gives some idea of how extraordinary maintenance charges affect the depreciation reserve account and to our minds shows that the toll property should be allowed a greater percentage for extraordinary charp.es than the property as a whole. In 1920 the total amount of charges against the depreciation reserve account for that year, as shown by the Nebraska company's books, was in round figures §750,000. Page 13 of Ex'iibit L-9 shows that there was charged against the depreciation reserve account $456,000 for extraordinary storm damage that occurred in the spring of 1920. The major portion of this toll charge was oc - casioned by a sleet storm that happened in the Grand Island and Nor - folk districts on March 28, 1920. From these figures we conclude that the total amount of money found chargeable against the toll operation for the twelve months of 1921 in the corrected figures we have called attention to are, if anything, understated rather than overstated. </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 259 From various studies made by us of records submitted by this ap - plicant from time to time we have reached the conclusion that the cost of person to person toll service as compared with station to station serv - ice justifies a wider spread than that put into effect in 1918. This cost is measured by the relative time toll facilities are in use for the different classes of service. We have hesitated this long in altering the relationship between the two main classes of toll service in order to ascertain whether the cheaper grade of service is widely available in a satisfactory -vay. Of that we are now fully persuaded. This opinion covers too wide a range of subjects to permit of a lengthy discussion of the complex studies which have brought us to this conclusion. Our conclusions that toll service has been unduly favored in bearing the heavier burdens of a high cost period are strengthened by the fact that whereas the average exchange service offered by this applicant has been increased in cost about thirty-seven per cent since 1916, toll rates have been increased not more than fifteen per cent. Only one increase in toll rates occurred and that was in the period when the properties were temporarily operated by the government. The increase amounted to twenty-five per cent and was applied to only one portion of the serv - ice, which portion at this time approximates sixty per cent of the total toll business. The concentration of engineering attention on toll problems, the preference given in restoring toll service at high cost in emergency effort following storms, the relatively low rate of depreciation reserve allocated to toll properties, and the favored situation of toll in bearing burdens of high cost period all lead us to the conclusion that there should be readjustment between toll and exchange. In making this readjust - ment the class of toll service which costs the most should be affected. We will approve applicant's petition for increasing the differential be - tween station to station service and person to person service to approx - imately forty per cent, anil will leave the station to station service on the same general level which it new occupies. The differential here approved is now in effect in this company on all interstate business and on state business in Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota. The effect of this readjustment on toll revenues will, of course, depend upon the volume of toll business. Increased revenues are var - iously estimated from $130,000 to $175,000. Toll business suffered a slump in volume following 1920 and thus far in 1922 has not entirely recovered the full measure of volume of the peak days, although rapidly recovering. The estimate of increased revenue from this source will oe earned into the final computations. The Kearney Telephone company, the Platte Valley Telephone com - pany, the Wehn Telephone company and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - graph company are interveners insofar as adjustments of toll rates are concerned. It is highly practicable that because of joint use of toll </seg>
            <seg id="p260">260 lines among all these companies the same toll rate bases be used. Within thirty days of receipt of this, order interveners will submit de - tailed figures on the effect of these adjustments on their toll earnings, and suggestions as to exchange reductions in corresponding amounts. Supplemental order will issue. We will now proceed to the discussion of the exchange rates ami charge^ which are shown in the company';; application. EXCHANGE OPERATING RESULTS As heretofore stated the applicant asks in its petition to establish exchar-Gre ratPs by jjroups of exchanges. The petition asks the author - ity of the Commission to advance rates in some exchanges and to lower certain classes of rates in ether exchanges, which in effect provides that the Commission approve as a permanent rate the ten per cent surcharge authorized by it in December, 1920. The application also asks the authority of the Commission to increase certain portions of the private branch exchange charges and to establish a new charge for certain services rendered in connection with the private branch exchange equipment. All of these matters will be considered in this sub-division of these findings. Private Branch Exchange Rates. In connection with all of the matters that have been submitted for the consideration of the Commis - sion in these cases the question of equalizing and, ii: so far as possible, harmonizing the different lates that the Commission has Wider consid - eration is highly important. The company asked in its application to be allowed to increase its monthly rate for private branch exchange services ami other miscel - laneous charges more or less related to the private branch exchange business of the company. It seems clear to us that the testimony sub - mitted in this case strongly indicates that certain private branch ex - change rates should be raised to bring them more nearly in line with other exchange rates. It appears that the private branch exchange charges, as made today, were originally related to an entirely different class of service than that rendered at the present time. There has been r.o change in the relationship of these rates since the telephone companies were placed under control of this Commission. In the earlier years the private branch exchange services were used only occasionally by a few of the larger patrons of the company. Now it has become quite common for even moderately-sized business concerns to have in - stalled private branch exchanges and avail themselves of this service in the transaction of their business. The intercommunicating features of a private branch exchange have grown to very large proportions and have apparently become fixtures in the method of operating large in - dustrial organizations </seg>
            <seg id="p261">261 The applicant attempts to justify the increase in rates asked for in private branch exchange service, largely on the value of the service to the patrons. Some testimony was given on the direct cost incurred by the applicant in furnishing private branch exchange service to some of its Omaha patrons. The comparisons on a cost basis were largely maile with relation to main station individual business service as com - pared with the private branch exchange services of patrons located in the city of Omaha. Under the present schedule of rates private branch patrons are not paying anything for the switchboards used. According tu the tabulation submitted of evidence there are 1319 of this class of patrons in the Omaha exchange who use either a switchboard or some other -witching device. It is proposed by the applicant to establish rates for the use of switching apparatus, varying in degree as to the .-ize of the switching equipment used, which it estimates will furnish a possible added revenue of about $31,000. The applicant further pro - poses some reduction and certain increases for the subscribers' station equipment furnished in connection with the private branch switching equipment here discussed. It is proposed that for patrons using classes "A", "B" and "D" switching apparatus the first ten subscribers' stations will be reduced from $19.80 to $15 per annum. The applicant also asks Commission to approve an increase in the both-way P. B. X. busi- ness trunks furnished by patrons in Omaha from $105.60 per annum to si 33.00 per year per trunk. The tabulation heretofore mentioned shows that there were 12C8 of such trunks in use in the Omaha zone at some ecent date not shown on the exhibit, and that applying the proposed ates to the number of trunks mentioned wiil result in an increased venue to the applicant of $60,000 plus. Other changes are asked for uther classes of trunking services which would have the final result of increasing the revenues of applicant in Omaha for trunk lines to about S70,000 per annum. This amount added to the increase for station apparatus and for switching equipment; as of the date for which the calculation is made, would have the result of increasing the company's -venues in the city of Omaha $87,000 in round figures, not allowing for the certain amount of so-called "throttling effect" which the applicant e-timates will be around $2600 per annum. All of the above calculations, ide from the switching apparatus, are based on the present rates; hat is, with the surcharge added to the rates in effect prior to Pecem ier, 1920. The manager of the Traffic Bureau of the Omaha Chamber of Com - merce presented testimony and certain conclusions reached by him with regard to the cost to the applicant of furnishing certain private branch exchange service to Omaha patrons. Most of the figures were tabula - tions which had been made up by representatives of the Bell company in compliance with the request of Mr. Childe, traffic manager. Most of the data here discussed related to the direct cost of furnishing private branch exchange service with regard to the value of the telephone property located on the customer's premises and did not take into ac- </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 El the value of the applicant's property used in trunking- and central i equipment in connection with the service. Mr. Childe found, for nee, that the reproduction cost new of the private branch exchange equipment used for taking care of an Omaha patrnn was found by the telephone company to be $327.49. This was for a private branch exchange having three trunks. The $327.49 is said to represent the value of the switchboard, the stations and the wiring on the patron V premises. Mr. Childe further showed that under the proposed private tnch exchange rates the telephone company would receive a gross &gt;me from the patron of $600 per annum. Under the present rates it is receiving $455.40. For three individual business telephones, under the proposed rates, the revenue would be $306, and under the present rates is $316.80. This comparison shows that the patron would pay $294 more per annum for the private branch exchange service than he would pay if he had three individual business telephones. From this statement Mr. Childe concludes that even $138.80, which is the extra income received by the telephone company in excess of three business telephones, pays an excessive return on a property investment of $327.49, which is said to represent the private branch exchange equip - ment on the patron's premises. Mr. Childe testified, in presenting the figures here discussed, as fellows: "Now, I will give you the figures I worked up on that, with the i planation, however, that in further talking with the telephone compa those do not appear to be fair to the telephone company or an accur; comparison. 1 think they have some value, however, and that is I reason I want to put them in. The equipment used in furnishing telephone communication in a community is of such a diversified nature that it is almost an impossible thing to separate by component parts or by classification of subscriber the actual cost of furnishing the service, including a return and the maintenance of the property devoted to a particular use, for the reason that it is simply impossible to allocate to any one particular subscriber'; station the actual expense of furnishing service and the property used in doing so. One subscriber may live a block away from a central office; the next .subscriber may be located twenty blocks away. One subscriber may use his telephone many times more than the other. It appears to us in establishing telephone rates for a given community that it is necessary to disregard the actual property put in place for the taking care of an individual subscriber or class of subscribers. The classification between residence subscribers and business patrons appears to have been based on the use of the equipment, and in this sub-division we are discussing a class of subscribers that requires a service materially different from the ordinary individual business telephone service. It appears in the record that the furnishing of this service in the applicant's property in Nebraska has never been given careful consideration for the class of service that they are now furnishing. We can see no reason why a subscriber should not be required to pay for switching equipment </seg>

There was no testimony offered of record which tended to justify the • lifFerent charges for the different switching apparatus mentioned above. It appears to us that the spread in the rates between the different classes of apparatus is reasonable, and for the purpose of this case, we will ap - prove the application as to the monthly charge for switching apparatus. If it is found, after the rates have been put into effect, that actual oper - ating conditions require an adjustment as between the different classes oi' apparatus here mentioned, the matter can be given further consider - ation by the Commission. Trunk Lines P. B. X We will next consider the request of the applicant to change its rates in flunking line services between the centi - al office and the private branch exchange board of the patrons. In its application, the company proposes to charge for a both-way P. B. X. trunk in the Omaha general zone fifty per cent of the individual business rate, and for general zone P. B. X. inward trunks to deduct twenty-five per cent from the individual business rate. At all other exchanges operated by the applicant located in Nebraska, it is proposed on both-way P. B. X. trunks to charge 25 per cent more than for individual business lines, and on inward trunks to charge 25 per cent less than the one-party business rate. In all instances the charge for trunks are not to be less than $2.50 per month. In justification of the increase asked on both-way trunks, it was shown that the number of calls made over both-way trunks in the city of </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 Omaha for a representative period as compared with the calling raie on individual business telephones was as 2.4 is to 1; or, stated differently, on the two-way P. B. X. trunks, it was found that the calling rate was 29 calls per day, and on the individual business 11.9 calls per day. It is apparent that a greater use can be and is made of the company's facilities on two-way trunking lines where the same are used in fur nishing private branch exchange service than on the one-way business telephone. There is a greater number of people served with telephone communicating facilities where the telephones are located conveniently to heads of departments in large business concerns than in a business where a main line telephone is used to transact the telephone communi - cations. It is true that in the private branch exchange two-way trunk - ing service the company does not furnish the same facilities at the patron's terminal as for main line business service. No doubt, the ex - pense of maintaining the facilities that connect the central office with the private branch exchange board, and in many instances, the head set for the operator, more than compensates for the terminal block wires and station equipment used in the individual business service. The difference between the increased rate on both-way P. B. X. trunks in Omaha as compared to exchanges outside of Omaha appears to us t« be just and reasonable. P. B. X. Sub-station Equipment. The application asks our approval of a flat rate for private bra: exchange sub-stations of $1.25 per month to apply to all such station^ While the application does not state, we assume that the rate here men - tioned applies to manually operated sub-station sets, and that it is the desire of the applicant to allow our order of March, 1922, to continue t effect. This order authorized the company to make a charge of snty-five cents per month for subscribers' sets equipped with dials used for machine-switching purposes. Disregarding the surcharge, the rates in effect at the present time for subscribers' sets for the different classes of p. b. X. station? are as follows: For the first ten subcribers' stations, $1.50 per month per set; for the next ten, $1.25 per month; and for the class which uses more than twenty subscribers' sets, the charge is $1.00 per month. Ac - cording to this, as the application is made, it proposes a reduction in the subscribers' station sets for those patrons who use not more than ten subscribers' stations, and an increase for the patrons who use more than twenty. We see no good reason why the charge per subscriber's station set should be less for a large user than for a patron who uses a lesser number of instruments. The switching apparatus is adjusted to serve the different number of subscribers' stations used by the patron, and it .seems fair to assume that a business using the P. B. X. service will adjust its number of stations as required by the business it performs. For these reasons, we will approve the rate asked for in the petition as to P. B. X. subscribers' station sets. </seg>

We assume that the proper charges for the services here mentioned are included in the rate proposed by tke applicant for the furnishing: of switching apparatus in connection with private branch exchange services as it operates the plants in this state, ith this understanding, the application as made is approved. Transient Hotels The application provides that for all P. B. X. service furnished tels, the rates for commercial private branoh exchange systems will applied with certain exceptions. In the Omaha zone an optional uaranty proposition: stations to be 35 cents each; a message rate in ieu of flat trunk rate; all local out-going messages ten cents each re - ardless of the length of talk, with a minimum guarantee to the com- pany of eight messages per station per month, the hotel to be allowed five cents of the ten-cent charge. Second optional (non-guaranty): stations, foity-five cents per month each; trunks to be furnished on a age rate basis; local messages to be five cents each with an allow- ance to the hotel of one and one-fourth cents for each local message. The option is substantially the same as is in effect at the present time. or all other exchanges in the state the applicant proposes the following ption to commercial P. B. X. rates: Stations, forty-five cents per month each; trunks on a message basis, each local message to be charged five events with an allowance to the hotel of two cents for each local message handled. The rates mentioned in this paragraph refer to ex - isting services where the wiring between the switchboard and the sub - stations has been provided by the subscriber, and, further, that when the wiring is furnished by the telephone company the rate will be fifteen cents per station per month additional. The petition also provides that both-way flat rate trunks will not be furnished in cities of over 10,000 population, and will not be furnished for P. B. X. systems which have message rate trunks. There was no protest made as to the rates proposed in the appli - cation mentioned in the next preceding paragraph and after due con - sideration we find that the charges, rules and regulations proposed by the applicant in the petition in connection with the furnishing of serv - ice to transient hotels are just and reasonable and will be approved. The provision? mentioned in the application to apply to family hotels and apartment houses and residences, together with the installation charges for putting in certain switching apparatus where the cost of the "wiring exceeds $10 per station, have not been objected to and the rates pro - posed appear to be properly adjusted so far as we are able to tell at the present time and will be approved in the order entered herein. </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 Our conclusions here have been unescapable regarding the Omaha situation. On this same point we quote from the brief of the corpora - tion counsel of the city of Omaha: "If, however, the Commission deems an increase necessary, under the showing of this application, then I am of the view that in the dis - tribution of the charge, as respects the City of Omaha and its patrons, as between the users of P. B. X. and Extension Ser\ice and those of the General Service, there exists no considerable call for a readjustment of the proposals as made." SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES AND MILEAGE The applicant proposes to increase the rates on business extension sets at exchanges outside of Omaha from $1.14 to $1.25 per month and in Omaha from $].38 to $1.50 for stations equipped with bells, and for sets without bells from $1.10 to $1.25 per month. For residence ex - tension stations applicant asks to establish a rate of 75 cents per month for wall sets, in place of 70 cents now in effect, and a rate of $1.00 for desk type of instrument in exchanges located outside of the Omaha zone, and to reduce the charge in Omaha from $1.10 to $1.00 for wall or desk set.-- with bell and without bell from 83 cents to 75 cents per month. The rate? we are here asked, to approve appear to be about in line with the special services we have heretofore discussed in the&gt;e findings and in our order we will allow the rates as requested The additional ■lirertory li^ti objected to. These rates appear will be approved. char; U be in line with similar rat We am asked to approve a rate of sixty per cent 1V1 ual business rate for exclusive incoming lines and stati computed to the nearest multiple of twenty-five cents, \ minimum charge of $2.50. This method of stating this class of services appears to us to be more equitable than the present plan. We see no good reason why the charge should not be allowed. The percentage should be calculated on the business rate established in oar order herein. We will so order. As to excess mileage charges for exchange lines the applicant asks us to approve an advance from $5.00 per year per quarter mile to $7.20 per annum. No direct testimony was offered on these charges. The charges here discussed have, generally speaking, been established on a relatively high basis in order that this class of users may be throttled as much as practicable. The subscribers using these services usually live close to the city limits and are new home-builders and cannot af - ford to pay more than really necessary for telephone services and we are not disposed to increase their burdens without more definite infor - mation that the present rate is inadequate. This portion of the appli - cation will be denied. </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NKBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 267 EXCHANGE RATES The applicant asks the Commission to authorize a cancellation of special rates for loud-ringing extension gongs and joint users' services now in effect in the following towns: Belmont, Chadron, Cody, Craw - t'ord. Crookston, Gordon, Harrison, Rushville, Valentine and Sidney. In lieu of these rates applicant proposes to establish rates that are i.rged in other exchanges for similar services. We have heretofore made mention on early pages of these findings ihe fact that the applicant desired to establish rates for exchange vices by groups of exchanges, and in the application it is proposed to nide its 108 exchanges into ten groups, towit: "A", "B", "C", "Dl", 1 &gt;2", "D3", "E", "F", "G", and the city of Omaha is to be considered in nil of itself. Generally speaking, the spreads proposed in the exchange ales are to correspond to a twenty-five cent multiple;that is, where the e is S3. 30 to make it $3.25; and where the rate is ?3.40 to make it &gt;0. the idea being to continue in effect the ten per cent surcharge, reason of this grouping the ten per cent surcharge would be reduced -ome instances to six or seven per cent and in others the charge lid be increased to twelve or fifteen per cent. As to the making of rates by groups of exchanges, where the nf.unt and character of service is substantially similar and where the ernent of cost is approximately constant throughout the group, there be no serious objection, remembering, as we must, that any exchange a- the right at all times to make complaint of its rates if its patrons eem then: unreasonable. In the instant case, however, the company based its classification almost wholly upon two factors — population f the town or city and number of subscriber stations. It has done so, otwith.-tandinjr its claim, vigorously urged, that its operation in sparsely settled sections in the northern and western portions of the state adds greatly to its expenses. Its explanation that the universality (if- the service which a company covering a wide field can furnish to all patrons, regardless of the size of the exchange by which they are served or the area which the lines of that exchange may cover, has merit, but it fails to justify, in our opinion, the rather arbitrary groupings which become manifest from a study of the plan submitted. Such an analysis indicates that the reclassification of exchanges was prompted very largely by a desire to produce additional gross revenue and to absorb into a permanent schedule the ten per cent surcharge heretofore con - sidered only as a temporary measure of relief. The re-grouping pro - posed would result in a revenue increase of approximately $41,000. As one of the major conclusions in this case we find that exchange service is now bearing more than its proper share of the revenue burden as compared to toll and that the rates for such service should be reduced to the extent of the surcharge. It follows, therefore, that the plan for re -grouping exchanges cannot at this time be approved. </seg>
            <seg id="p268">268 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Before leaving the subject of the proposed grouping of exchanges we desire to say that much question exists in our opinion a? to the advisability of certain existing grouping whereby small exchanges are linked up with large exchanges at the same or but slightly lower rates for service throughout the combined area. Particular territories where this exists are Howard county, Hall county and Kearney county. Unless it is particularly advantageous to a majority of subscribers in a zone we know now of no good reason why subscribers on a small exchange should, against their will, be placed in a free zone with service to a large center. Our conclusions are not positive and we will not disturb the conditions that now exist, with the understanding, however, that this conclusion is not prejudicial to any finding we may make in the future, either upon complaint or as the result of our own investigation. NORTH PLATTE EXCHANGE The conditions at North Platte require special consideration. In its re-grouping plan applicant classified North Platte with Fremont ami Norfolk, which involved a substantial increase in the North Platte rates, more especially when taken into consideration with the readjustments in rate? at Fremont and Norfolk, made necessary by the re-grouping plan. While we disapprove of the re-grouping of exchanges as a whole, this record establishes good reasons for a change in the rate base at North Platte. The city has been increasing rapidly in population in recent years, the population according- to the government census of 1920 being 11,051. There has been a correspondingly rapid increase in the number of telephone users so that the capacity of the plant at the present time has been reached. The prospects for a still further growth in the number of patrons is very promising. The percentage of telephone subscribers to population in North Platte at the present time is 1T."». The percentage of development in Fremont is 25.9 ami in Norfolk 25.6. These figures would indicate that if development in North Platte keeps pace with the two towns mentioned there will be a very large increase in the number of patrons within the next few years. This will involve a substantial enlargement of the present facilities. Protestants contend - ed that the full capacity of the plant is not fully utilized, but the testi - mony shows that while certain portions of the facilities are not fully Utilized this is due to the fact that the capacity of other portions of the plant has been reached and the idle equipment cannot be used without extensive changes and additions in the plant as a whole. The record shows that the company has anticipated these improvements for some time and has purchased land for a central office building. It is ap - parent, therefore, that North Platte has somewhat outgrown its present classification. We are of the opinion that there should be some read - justment in the rates and see no reason why the rates applied at Fre - mont and Norfolk should not be applicable to this exchange. In the re-grouping plan the company proposed changes in all rates </seg>
            <seg id="p269">269 except for farm subscribers. If we class this exchange with Norfolk ami Fremont, a? proposed, and deny the surcharge the only material change will be in the business rates, which will become $4.00 for indi - vidual business ami $3.50 for two or four-party business, these being increases of fifty cents over the old base rates prior to the application of the surcharge. For the year 1921 the company showed a net return at North Platte of 6.28 per cent. Eliminating the surcharge and sub - stituting the increase just mentioned the return at North Platte will be 5.1 per cent. The operating revenues and expenses at North Platte, however, are subject to the same criticisms and readjustments as we have applied to the company as a whole and it appears certain that a realization at North Platte of the economies discussed would result in an increase of the net return so as to bring it within a reasonable amount. We find, therefore, thatt the business rates should be in - creased a* above described. CONCLUSIONS Applicant presented a financial study for eleven months of 1921 to show that it had in that time earned but $583,736 on its total investment in the state and nothing additional in the month of December. This was hut four percent on the book average value of the property for the per - iod. It has asked us to grant authority to make increases of various kinds which would produce $313,000 additional, which by its own computations would still leave it with less than a six per cent return. Our constructive period computations, we think, have conclusively de - nv. 1 list rated that the showing was for an abnormal period and not to be used in forecasting the future. By recasting the figures to represent 1 year would have shown, based on the history of the company, we have concluded that under existing rates the company would have earned, conditions being normal as they give indications of being in the near future. 6.6 per cent on the investment, lejjs that part of the the property reserved for consideration with machine switching problems in Omaha. From the voluminous testimony introduced in the case we have con - cluded that some readjustments in the burden of rates is necessary and we have already indicated our intention of granting increase in cer - tain kinds of toll rates that will produce somewhere between $130,000 and $175,000 additional per year, the witnesses for the company not be - ing in agreement on the matter. We have granted increases in rates to users of private branch exchange service, particularly in Omaha, amounting to between $80,000 and $90,000, because that traffic is spe - cial in nature and because it has not borne its fair share of heavier ex - pense burdens up to this date. On special services, such as hotel message charges, extra directory listings and extension sets, we have approved increases producing additional revenue of about $20,000. We have thus </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 approved increases in rates which should produce somewhere between S230.000 and $285,000 per year. These same computations have convinced us that exchange rates are bearing more than a fair share of the burden. We are of the opinion ami so find from the record that the surcharge on exchange rates, au - thorized by us in December, 1920, as a temporary measure of financial relief and continued from time to time, must now be removed. The company will by this series of adjustments retain approximately the same revenues it now earns. The elimination of the surcharge will reduce revenues about $293,000. Under the more adverse estimate of toll business in the record the com - pany should, from the readjustments of rates be able to earn 6.2 per cent under the adjustments shown on pages 53 and 54 and on the more favorable estimate the same revenue as would accrue without any ad - justment of present rate structures. We have already pointed out that it should he simple for the company to add to its net earnings by altering the contract with the parent com - pany by which it pays to the latter about $200,000 a year. Failing to do this it cannot complain at the conclusion that any unnecessary pay - ments go to the same destination as the dividends and may be used US the parent company, the practically sole stockholder of the applicant, fees fit. We have also pointed out in these findings that had applicant during the first eleven months of 1921 handled its traffic expenses outside of Omaha at the same per station cost as the practically comparable large company south of the Platte river on all exchanges outside of Lincoln it would have added $169,000 to its net income in that period. If the Nebraska properties of applicant had expended for traffic expenses the same amount per station that was spent on the remainder of the system outside of Nebraska, in the four other states where it operates, it would have been $192,000 better off in net income than it found itself. And if applicant in the same period had conducted its commercial and gen - eral departments on the same expense level that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company conducted similar departments it would have add - ed another $100,000 to its net. We do not say that the situations are entirely comparable. We Only say that we know of no particular differences in conditions in the com - panies compared to warrant particular differences in expenses of oper - ation, and we were able to discover none convincing in cross-examina - tion of the company witnesses. Out of all these opportunities for sav - ings, which we have specifically pointed out, there is no doubt in our minds but what this applicant can perfect economies which will place its net return in the next year fully up to the fair return which the cost of money to it warrants, and even additionally to offset any errors in our forecasts for the next year, which experience may develop. </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NKBRASKA STATF. RAILWAY COMMISSION 271 During- the high cost period, and continuing to the present, we have recognised the rights of public utilities to relief in added revenue such as would meet their exigencies. We acted promptly enough with re - -pect to applicant that the postmaster general did not find during the period of guaranty by the government it necessary to increase exchange rates in Nebraska, whereas he did so generally throughout the nation. We have been going through a period of reconstruction. Business gen - erally, and not the least of these the public utilities, have found it necessary to curtail expenses, that the winds might be tempered to the shorn lamb. We do not think this company has kept pace, although we recognize that this criticism is made in the face of the fact that its expenses have continued at the disadvantage of dividends. We recognize fully that the officers of this company are whole-heart - edly attempting to give the best service which skill can devise. As the body which must weigh both the rights of the public and of the utility, we have, however, loner felt that these same vigorous officers have al - lowed their enthusiasm as technical men, and their confidence in their .ihility to sell their product, to outweigh necessities for moderate re- ichir.ents. in exce&gt;s of those now slowly appearing. In our preliminary order of December, 1921, in this case, we directed e company to keep careful and separate record of the ten per cent sur- m.tioii of which we were authorizing pending our more ition.

            <seg id="p279">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 279 APPLICATION NO. 4406 In the Mutter uf the Application of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company for Authority- to Re-adjust Rates Schedules for Exchange Service in Nebraska and for Re-adjustment and Increase of Toll Kates. THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER. Browne, Commissioner: This proceeding was brought about by the application of the North - western Bell Telephone company for authority to increase both ex - change and toll rates. Other parties, however, intervened. In our orifiinal order in this matter we said: "The Kearney Telephone company, the Platte Valley Tele - phone company, the Wehn Telephone company and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company are interveners in so far as adjustments of toll rates are concerned. It is highly practicable that because of joint use of toll lines among all these companies the same toll rate bases be used. Within thirty days of receipt of this order interveners will submit detailed figures on the effect these adjustments on their toll earnings, and suggestions xchange reductions in corresponding amounts. Supple- entiil oiiler will issue. The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company has made the show - there required. This showing, however, was in conformity to the x application of that company, in which it desired to retain ill rate scales up to forty mile hauls and to substitute the plied for by the Northwestern Bell Telephone company for dis - nore than forty miles. Traffic studies made by the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company indicate that the gross toll increase would probably be 7.6 per cent if the application made by it were ted in toto. This increase would approximate 2V4 per cent on total revenU' As indicated in the quotation supra it is difficult, if not practically - impossible, to have two scales of toll rates applied To one message in - asmuch as toll rates are measured by air line distance. More than forty per cent of the total toll business of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Tele - graph company is shown to arise on business where other companies, state and interstate, participate in the toll haul. We can see no good reason why for short distances, mainly confined to this intervening ap - plicants territory, exceptions should be made to the standard toll rates heretofore approved by us and we will deny that portion of the appli - cation which asks to have continued its present toll rate scales on mes - sages with forty mile haul or less. This denial will have the effect of reducing existing toll rates of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph" company for distances up to forty miles. For example: On intertown service and neighborhood service where </seg>
            <seg id="p280">280 tolls are charged the Lincoln company's rate for station-to-station ser - vice is fourteen cents. The scale approved by us in the original order is ten cents. The person-to-person rate is the same in either instance. For distances above forty miles the scale approved in our original order would increase the toll rates of the Lincoln company chiefly because of the spread authorized between person-to-person and station-to-station service. From the record before us it is impossible to say just what effect this scale of toll rates approved in the original order will have on the total revenues of the Lincoln intervener until after a trial period. It is certain to increase those revenues to some extent, possibly two per cent. In our original order we said we would approve the same scale of toll rates for this intervener that we approved for the main applicant in the original order, but, as already shown, we required suggestions as to whether corresponding reductions might be made in exchange rates. This intervener objects, as was to have been expected, to any reduc - tions, alleging that the amount of the increases are quite conjectural tl that the economies recently inaugurated are still so experimental to make it impracticable to say that they may be a permanent suc - cess. We are inclined to that view at the present. The main applicant herein, The Northwestern Bell Telephone com - pany, secured from the United States district court on December 21, 1922. a temporary injunction authorizing it to collect certain additional revenue pending the outcome of litigation in which the Commission is the principal adverse party. The uncertainty of a fail' return, which led the court to take this action, was brought about entirely by the methods of operation of the company and the level of operating ex - penses which made a showing of too low a net income. This interven - ing applicant did not receive from this Commission any increase when the large company in the northern half of the state secured the addi - tion of a ten per cent surcharge to exchange rates. Despite that, this intervening applicant has made a better net showing. During the five years last past it has paid out as interest on bonds and dividends on stock amounts ranging from 5.6 per cent to 6.2 per cent of the com - bined obligations. To do so at times it drew on the surplus; at other times it had a small surplus remaining. The net results in the five year period were to add to the Surplus $29,700. The Lincoln company, with which we are now dealing, has a dis - tinct financial advantage over its large contemporary in that it is still paying but five per cent on its bonds and five per cent On a Consider - able block of preferred stock. It has thus been able to pay seven per cent per annum on its common stock without depleting its surplus and still the average rate paid to security owners has been below seven per cent on the entire obligations. For the past year or more the Commission has consistently urged </seg>
            <seg id="p281">281 upon public utilities under its jurisdiction, and particularly the two large telephone companies operating in the state, the working out of economies in operation advantageous both to the utility and to the public. The Northwestern Bell Telephone company has not reduced its expenditures up to the present moment in Nebraska when measured by the results on each subscriber. The Lincoln company all through the unsettled period has exercised economies resulting favorably to the vate-payer. Between 1914 and 1922 the increases granted to the Lin - coln company, which include the growth of toll business as well as change of rate, amounted to thirty per cent. Those granted to the Northwestern Bell Telephone company and its predecessor amount - ed to forty-one per cent without the additions recently permitted by the federal court. The net revenue of the Lincoln company has, however, been more favorable in spite of this handicap. It has, by methods of management, ■iuccoeded in retaining a higher net without disadvantage to its prop - erty. It has done so by keeping increases in operating expenses dur - ing the unsettled period down to forty-one per cent, whereas during the same period the expenses of the contemporary have increased fifty - nine per cent. ♦ + To say now that the Lincoln company shall be, against its will, re - quired to reduce its rates here and there to offset the modest increases which would result from the adjustment of toll scales would be to pen - alize it for having earnestly endeavored to do that -which the Commis - sion has been suggesting and to pay a premium on policies of manage - ment which pass- additional burdens on to the rate-payer rather than -eek economies as an alternative. If our order authorizing toll rate adjustments is not accompanied by the requirement to make inciden- tal rate adjustments it can fairly be said that it is in a measure a re - ward for high business prudence. The Commission will, however, keep in close touch with the situation. Its conclusions here set forth and in iijrht of existing conditions and may be readjusted if conditions change. This supplemental order does not extend to other interveners, who have not met the requirements of the original order herein dated No - vember 4, 1922. For obvious reasons we will approve for all inter - veners, and for all other toll companies operating in the state, the scale of rates set forth in the order of November 4, 1922, on all joint haul messages between their stations and stations of the Northwestern Bell Telephone company and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph com - pany.

            <seg id="p283">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 283 APPLICATION NO. 4423 In the Mutter of the Application of the Kearney Telephone Company lor Continuance of Existing Rates. OPINION AND FINDING Tavlor, Chairman: Exchange rates, approved for the Kearney Telephone company in an or&lt;&lt;er &lt;late&lt;l April 28, 1921, expire by the terms of that order on February 1, 1922. In the absence of any further order the rates as Heretofore approved would expire and the old rates would again become effective The company has made application for a continuance of the xisting rates. Throughout the entire period covered by the original order the company has filed monthly reports with this Commission, giving in minute detail the results from operation. The Commission is, there- fore, fully advised concerning the present condition of the company and is able to determine without further information whether or not the present rates should be continued. In this connection it should be stated that a committee of three, appointed at a meeting of the chamber of commerce at Kearney, held on January 18, 1922, has advised the Commission that after going over the books of the company it has concluded that the present rates are not unreasonable and the committee eeommpntls that an extension be made under the present order without prejudice or waiver of any legal privileges or rights. The record of receipts and expenditures for the years 1920 and 1921, as shown by the reports of the company filed with this Commis- sion, are as follows: RECEIPTS 1920 1921 Excnange revenues $50,316.50 §55,274.78 Toll revenue? __ 12,390.38 11,321.30 Total $62,706.88 $66,596.08 EXPENSES t 1920 1921 Operating expenses $24,882.61 $24,699.47 Current maintenance 13,377.20 11,754.81 Depreciation 11,540.54 14,406.43 Taxes - 2,400.00 2,200.00 Total $52,200.35 $53,060.71 NET INCOME 1920 1921 Net operating income $10,506.53 $13,535.37 Sundry net earnings 365.09 198.6'J Total net operating income $10,871.62 $13,754.06 </seg>
            <seg id="p284">284 It will be noted a surplus, after paying interest on the bonds and dividend on $50,000 of preferred stock, of $5,421 resulted from the year's operation in 1921. Operating expenses for the past year have remained stationary. While there was a slight reduction in direct operating costs and taxes, there was an increase in the expenditures for depreciation. There was a loss of about $1,000 in toll revenue during; the year due to a falling- off in traffic, but the increase in ex - change revenue due to the increase in rates more than offset this. The results, however, are very close to the estimate made by the Commission in its original order. In considering the effect of the proposed rates the Commission made allowance for certain increased expenses that would probably be realized during the year and estimated that a sur - plus of from $4,500 to $5,000 would be the result. The surplus for 1921 is equivalent to approximately six per cent on the $89,650 of common stock outstanding. As stated in previous orders the Commission has made no finding as to the fair value of this property. It is not necessary in this case, however, to make such find - ing with reference to the value of the outstanding common stock. By resolution of the board of directors, adopted at a meeting held recently. it was decided to pass to the depreciation reserve the sum of $5,000. This action, of course, makes it impossible for any dividends to be paid on common stock for this year. In the previous order the Commission called attention to the inadequate reserve for depreciation in this com - pany and recommended that every effort be made to build up such re - serve. The stockholders, therefore, are to be commended for their willingness to follow this recommendation of the Commission, although to do so deprives them of any return on their investment. A sleet storm in 1P20 cost the company $13,500, all of which had to be charged to the depreciation reserve. On December 31, 1921, the reserve amounted to $23,458.20. This is less than ten per cent of the book value Of the physical property and at that is not sufficient for complete protection of the property. The management of the company realizes, however, the necessity of establishing and maintaining such reserve and is contented to forego dividends until such results can be accomplished. The public, of course, is protected in its service by the accumulation of such a reserve and to that extent has an interest with the stock - holders in the setting aside of such a fund. There are no prospects of immediate reduction in expenses. Doubt - less such reductions will come later, in which event it will be possible to reduce the rates.

OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: Thi* application was filed in December, 1920. Hearing was held at the offices of the Commission on January 25, 1921. By agreement of all parties action on the application was postponed pending certain readjustments, to be noted later in this opinion. Minimum weight on scrap iron, moved intrastate Nebraska, is generally 40,000 pounds, with a few exceptions thereto. In surround - ing' states, at the time of the hearing, a considerable diversity of minima </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 exi?te&lt;l intrastate as well as interstate. This application was tor the purpose of aiding- in standardisation of minima and of increasing the loading of open top cars in the interest of greater efficiency for trans - portation facilities. Scrap iron, except for a brief period during the late war, is a relatively cheap commodity, capable of heavy loading and carrying low commodity rates. Scrap iron is gathered throughout the state by those who engage in the business and is shipped, carloads, either to concentration points for sorting and re-shipment, or to points where foundries exist. Necessarily shipments move frequently inter - state and frequently intrastate. Objections were filed to the hearing. application which resulted in the Respondents raised two chief objections: 1. That the statement of carriers as to the general upplicatiion of a 50,000-pound minimum, interstate, was incorrect, and that on the con - trary a considerable number of lower minima for interstate application existed, whereby if the Nebraska minimum were increased it would work a discrimination against intrastate shipments. 2. To increase the minimum would work a hardship on the scraj: iron collectors at the smaller points in the state in that they would lie required to tie up more money in scrap iron before shipping date, al! tending to discourage an industry, which, by reason of tremendous slump in price of scrap iron, was already in the doldrums. Against the second of these objections carriers submitted exhihit - showinir that in shipments of 38 cms of scrap iron to Lincoln from intra - state origin points 68 per cent were loaded voluntarily in excess of the minimum and 23 per cent in excess of the proposed minimum; that in shipments of 26 cars to Hastings, on the Burlington, 65 per cent ex - ceeded the proposed minimum by voluntary act of the shipper; that in shiments on the Burlington to Fremont of 18 cars one-third exceeded the proposed minimum; that in shipments of six months on the Nnrth Western the average weight of scrap iron, carloads, was 52,848 pound;-. Against the contention of shippers that these heavy loadings were due to re-shipments from concentration points, it was shown that iery many of the total shipments of record by exhibit were from relatively small origin points. Respondents submitted exhibits showing conclusively that by the tariffs then in effect a considerable amount of scrap Iron could move interstate from. Nebraska origin points to Sioux City, Kansas City, St. Joseph, Atchison, and Colorado points on a 40,000-pound minimum, but that on shipments east of the Missouri river the interstate minimum was higher. Carriers conceded the error in their application and in their testimony upon this showing. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 287 It was atrreerl of record by respondents that the economic disad - ntage of a higher minimum was quite secondary to the competitive lisadvantage if the interstate minimum were lower than the intrastate ninimum. It was agreed by the carriers that the interstate minimum ■uarht not to be lower and it was mutually agreed that the application vould lie dormant until such time as interstate tariffs had been amended roviiie generally for 50,000 pounds minimum, interstate, from Ne- -ka origins and to Nebraska destinations from interstate origins. We have only recently been advised by the carriers that effective September 15, 1922, all interstate tariffs will carry a minimum weight 50,000 pounds on scrap iron, and asking authority to publish at the ne time a similar minimum for intrastate application in Nebraska. On the record established at the hearing- and the general agreement between shippers and carriers we will, therefore, authorize the publica- of the 50,000 pounds minimum in Nebraska and the departure from statutory notice of publication to the extent of making the rate plicable and effective on September 15 1922.

SEAL APPLICATION NO. 4509 In ihe Matter of the Application of the Monroe Independent Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rates. SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING Browne, Commissioner: Effective September 1, 1921, the Commission authorized this ap - plicant to make certain increases in rates at its various exchanges and, </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 at the same time, required that before the increases in rural rates should be made effective definite improvement programs should be carried out and be approved by the Commission. The order was for a period of six months so that the Commission might check against the various requirements made of the company and not extend the schedule of rates unless circumstances warranted. Applicant now asks for an extension period. The improvement program required by the Commission for rural properties of this applicant have been carried out only to a minor de - gree, it apparently being the wish of the subscribers that the service be left in its present condition temporarily rather than to have the in - creased rates based upon improvements. The company has recognized the force of this argument and has delayed its improvement program. Hence, the rural rate increase was not made effective. Certain rate increases for town subscribers were put into effect, the maximum revenues from which increases will not exceed $3,500 per annum, or an increase of six or seven per cent. At the same time, industrial de - pression and other causes have led to some diminution of the number of subscribers of the applicant. This may be illustrated by the fol - lowing tabulation of the total number of subscribers at the enci of various months as follows: Julv 31 —3,217 __3,205 __3,184 September 30 October 31 November 30 December 31 1.-2 _-3,136 The company has had some increase in toll revenues because of the elimination of a certain portion of the free service between ex - changes. It is still too early, because of the disturbed industrial situation, to measure the effects. In our opinion the rates provided in the order of August 15, 1921 should be extended. This order will provide for their extension during the year 1922, subject to all of the conditions in the original order and with particular emphasis on r he filing of monthly summiary statements with the Commission on regular accounting blanks. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Monroe Independent Telephone company be, and it hereby is, authorized to continue the schedule of charges authorized in the original finding herein until December 31, 1922, subject to all of the conditions in the original order, and subject to any modification in the meantime, found proper after due healing.

SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER Browne, Commissioner: We first considered this company's rates structure as a whole with e\v to giving relief from increased operating expenses in 1921 and August 15 of that year issued the original opinion and finding and in this cause. The rates there authorized were temporary in that we might measure more completely the results on revenues ie results of certain recommendations relative to operation and agement •We estimated that the then existing rates would, with normal flow business, produce for the company in the neighborhood of 856,000 revenue per annum. The scale of rates authorized was for the pur - e of increasing the antcunt of revenue about §7,000 per annum. Im- ments were necessary before certain of the rates might be made ive. Because of local conditions the rates thus limited were not ec into effect. Hence, only a part of the increases which we authorized s realized. In February, 1!'22, the rate.- were continued in effect for the re - nainder of that year. The company had lost subscribers, some through ■ citation and others due to business depression. We have before us the results of operating under the present rates, first, for the four months of 1921 subsequent to the publication of the rate&gt;, and second, for ten months of 1922. Based on the record of the four months of 1921 the revenue possibilities from that portion of the authorized schedules, which were then and are now effective, were $54,000 per annum. The results of 1922 for ten months indicate revenue possibilities of approximately $57,000 from the rates. Our estimate of expenditures, plus a fair return, in the original order herein required higher revenues than here produced. However, the election </seg>
            <seg id="p290">290 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the company to forego collecting certain increase? and to postpone the improvements, which would have added considerably to annual operating; expenses, has resulted in substantial economies in operation, as compared to the estimate. After paying- interest on the small amount of note obligations out - standing the company had earned a net income available for dividends of 6.8 per cent on the outstanding stock, all of which lias been author - ized by the Commission after careful studies of the property but with no physical valuation in recent years. At the rate the company has operated for the first ten months of 1922 it will have earned by the end of this year approximately $9,000 for interest and dividends. The property is being well taken care of, as evidenced by the amount of money being spent in its maintenance and there has been added during the past year more than $7,000 in improvements, chiefly at the town of Genoa. Traffic expenses do not exceed thirty-five cents per month per station, which indicates economy born of necessity. Commercial expenses, while relatively higher, are substantially less than we found in the original opinion would not be excessive. The company asks that it be permittee! to continue under the terms and conditions and on the rates approved in the original order and ex - tended by supplemental order. We know of no reason, after careful examination of the monthly report* kept under the uniform system of accounts required by the Commission, for not approving the application. Existing rates terminate December 31, 1922. It n obvious that the company cannot and should not for even a short time revert to rates which would automatically become effective if this order were not ex - tended. Such an emergency exists as warrants the effective date on less than the statutory period of notice ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Monroe Independent Telephone Company be and it hereby is authorized to charge a scale of rates and charges set forth in the original order under this title designation dated August 15. 1921, subject to the terms and conditions in that original order save only that relating to the termination date.

This period was ex - tended for an additional three months because of inability of the Com - mission, to make thorough investigation. On September T, 1921, hear - ing was held at Campbell ami as a result of the facts there developed in testimony a second supplemental order was entered on October 2!'. 1921, authorizing the extension of the existing rates to Julv 1, 1!&gt;22. The company has applied for a continuation of the present rates and has submitted the results of operation for the year 1921 and five months of 1922 in substantiation of the petition, with the further argu - ment that a severe sleet storm occurred in the territory this spring:, necessitating abnormal maintenance. The accounts have been kept under the rules of the Commission and fairly accurately reflect the financial operation of the last seven - teen months. These results are summarized as follows: </seg>

I the extent of maintenance for which the corporation is obligated. In our second supplemental order following the hearing we made a finding as to value, fixed a scale of rates, taking into account the peculiar and divers lelationships of the different groups of subscribers to the company, and found that after allowances had been made for these matters not more than $4.00 per annum should be paid per share of -tick as dividends. It will be noted that in the year 1921 the company ned. available for dividends, slightly more than one-half of this amount and thus far in 1922 has earned somewhat more than the maxi - mum amount allowable by the previous order. At the same time it appears that the setup of $125 per month for maintenance and depreciation reserve was rather low. It is impossible, iowever. to say this accurately without a longer experience. The ■ates authorized are not higher than the average rates for grounded exchanges of this size in the state independently owned. We find and .-o order that the present schedule of rates should continue indefinitely, -ubjert to our scrutiny from time to time and subject to all of the pro - vi-ions of the second supplemental order, or main order, including, with emphasis, the provision that any surpluses earned shall remain as sur - plus- for care of future operating exigencies.

            <seg id="p294">294 APPLICATION NO. 4575 In the Matter of the Application of the Platte County Independent Telephone Company of Columbus for Authority to Increase Rates. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: This matter, involving the level of rates of applicant company and the valuation of it? property, was presented de novo, although in the course of the hearing it was linked with the evidence and findings in Application No. 2544, decided March 8, 1916, and Application No. 4101, decided February 26, 1920. This company was organized in 1902, beginning business in 1903 as an independent telephone company, almost mutual in its operations. In 1915 the company was alleged to have 1,580 subscribers. Its com - petitor in the city of Columbus was the Nebraska Telephone company, with 310 subscribers, a large number of whom were duplicates of the subscribers of applicant, in the fall of 1915 negotiations were con - cluded for the purchase by applicant of the exchange properties of the Nebraska Telephone company in and near Columbus for the sum of $15,000. At the end of 1916 the company alleged itself to have 1.774 subscribers stations. It is not certain that these figures are correct for many errors have been found in the reports of applicant to the Commis - sion in the years past, some of which have been regarding the unmber of subscribers stations. In the winter of 1915-1916 hearing was had by the Commission on application of this same company for authority to issue securities covering the price agreed upon for the Nebraska Telephone company's exchange properties also to secure funds with which to complete the consolidation of the two plants and to do a considerable amount of placing city main leads underground, in accordance with an ordinance passed by the city of Columbus. The Commission's engineer checked the properties of the Nebraska Telephone company and reported verb - ally to the Commission that the price agreed upon was fair and reason - able. The securities were authorized and the company was permitted to increase its rates for business service from $2.00 to $2.50 and $3.00, and to a lesser degree on residence and farm service. Certain pro - visions in that order will be discussed later. In the fall of 1919 application was made for further rate advances of twenty- five cents per month for each class of service offered by the company and for certain other relief. The matter was handled with - out valuation as an emergency application. Rate advances of twenty - five cents per month were granted on business service, from fifteen to twenty-five cents per month on residence service and fifteen cents per month on farm line service. It was provided that these rates were </seg>
            <seg id="p295">295 temporary, to last not exceeding six months, and that in the meantime an inventory and valuation would be made of the properties and further order would be entered in accordance with the facts there developed. It was agreed by applicant during the hearing that until the valuation was made and permanent rates provided dividends should be limited to eierht per cent on outstanding securities. The order also provided that the company should set aside $12,500 per annum, out of which all proper charges for maintenance, replacements and reserve for depre - ciation should be paid. The effective date of the order was March 1, 1020. Applicant was dissatisfied with the provisions of the order and ■efased to put the rates and the other provisions into effect. No ppeal was taken. In July the Commission brought an action in the istrict court of Platte county for a writ of mandatory injunction to compel compliance with the provisions of the order. Preliminary motions and demurrers filed by applicant prevented early consideration of the court case. In May, 1921, this application now under considera- tion was filed. ' The Commission insisted that the case in court, in which jurisdiction was challenged, be disposed of prior to consideration of the application. On November 22, 1921, mandatory injunction was i"Ue&lt;l by the district court by consent of defendant. It was verbally agreed between the company and the Commission that, with the litiga - tion disposed of, prompt consideration would be given to the pending application and that to avoid whatever embarrassment would exist in e putting into effect of a set of rates temporarily and their re- BdjoBtment within a short time the Commission would, upon action by the court favorable to the contention of the Commission, immediately suspend the provisions of the order in Application No. 4101. In conformity to that understanding hearing was held at Columbus on December 7-10, inclusive. Because of discrepancies regarding the quantities of property inventoried by the company's employes and officer? and by the Commission's engineer it was directed at the close of the hearing that a conference would be held between the company's officials, on the one hand, and the Commission's telephone engineer and telephone accountant, on the other hand, for the purpose, if possible, of agreeing on quantities of property. In part this conference was successful and in part no agreements were reached. Delays that are regretted resulted from these intermediate matters. Applicant presented an inventory of all property and valuations representing its conclusions on three bases, viz.: original cost unde - preciated, reproduction cost as of January 1, 1921, and reproduction co«t depreciated in accordance with the judgment of the appraisers after inspection of the property. It presented also a study of book cost from 1916 to 1920, inclusive, added to a figure used by the company of original cost to January 1, 1916. Certain accounting studies were made also by the company's representatives, for the most part pre- </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 i senting theoretical conclusions resulting from the application of certain hypotheses running- through the tabulations. It also filed statement? of receipts and expenditures for ten month? of 1921, as kept Under the accounting system provided and ordered by this Commission. For its own information and in the interest of substantial justice to boih company and public the Commission directed an inventory of the property to be made by its engineers an;l presentation of a valuation ba;e«l on actual and estimated cost of construction. In reaching their conclusions th.P engineers of the Commission took from invoices of the company a large amount of data relative to experienced cost of materials and where such cost? could not be secured the unit cost of materials were taken from data in the possession of the Commission, secured BXtd compiled from a large number of inventories heretofore made. Labor units applied were, in the absence of any segregated data in the pos- session of applicant, based upon estimates by the engineers of quantities and prices of labor which might reasonably have been experienced. Both the company and the Commission gave careful consideration to the overhead expenses, which included organization, legal expense of or - ganization, superintendence and engineering of construction, con - tingencies, omissions, ami interest and taxes during the construction period. In both valuations no effort was made to ascertain the actual experienced overheads. The Commission used the results arrive at by it from various studies of other normal companies ann the company Used the Commission's data but applied them to a different "bare- bones" cost figure The Commission's engineers did not attemf mony relative to intangible values. The fnipan; testimony was put into evidence on this subject. The city of Columbus, through its attorney, appeared as vespoiu as did certain subscribers. They offered no testimony, but did c fully cross-examine the witnesses for the company.

We will first (leal with the figures presented elative to cost, or, possibly, as the matter was presented by both ap- jlicant ami the Commission, a historical reproduction cost. The books )f the company had not been kept in such a manner as to present any onclusive evidence as to cost. The Commission's engineer and the ompany both, according to testimony, used what information could be ned from invoices as guide marks and proceeded to place against ? inventories figures which, in their judgment, represented what the mpany might normally have experienced in costs of construction.

With very much the same method being used by both company and Commission in arriving at the above figures, the disagree - ments have been so wide as to call for a very burdensome analysis of the valuations in an effort to ascertain the causes for the disagreements.

            <seg id="p298">298 handicap. Much of the work had been done by his wire chief, parti - cularly in the development of price units. Since the making of the inventory this man had ceased working for the company and for reasons of its own the company did not desire to call him as a witness. Hence, the efforts of the president to explain many of the points under dispute lacked much of being convincing or satisfying. Several months prior to the hearing the company served notice on the Commission that it proposed to take the depositions of two of its employes who had been active in preparing the inventory and valuation and who were likely not to be in its employ when the hearing took place. The Commission did not have a representative present when the depositions were taken. These depositions were offered in evidence at the time of the hearing and were objected to by respondents on the ground that both of the men whose depositions were taken were within call, the one an employe, the other an ex-employe. The fact was not disputed. Ruling on the objection was reserved until it could be ascertained by examining the depositions whether there was material therein which required cross-examination to bring out the necessary facts. After such examination the Commission is compelled to gnstain the objection and to refuse to admit the depositions. 'The company hired a general manager and auditor subsequent to the taking of the inventory. He was presented as a witness to testify as an expert on the reasonableness of the unit values used, with none of which he had a part in preparation. We can give little or no consider - ation to his testimony on this subject. He allowed himself to make such grievous errors in some respects as to cast considerable clou&lt;i upon his judgment as an expert. For example, in response to questions of counsel he testified that the unit labor price for setting pole? in the city of $5.44 per pole on a pre-war basis and $8.68 per pole on a 1920 basis was reasonable as to the latter and too low as to the former. As a matter of fact the figures about which he was asked were not the labor costs used by the company ir. setting poles, but the unit labor cost of installing instruments. The company actually used in its cost column $2.85 for labor of setting city poles and $3.73 as a reproduction cost in 1020. Again, this witness testified the reasonable life of a twenty-five foot six-inch pole at time of first setting was forty to fifty years and on re-setting twenty years. This is very much out of line with all engineering experience of which we have knowledge. The witness testified also as to the cost of the Columbus switchboard and substantiated the testimony of a previous witness. On cross-examina - tion it developed that he had merely seen figures written down by the witness who had made the investigation and there was no independent judgment. On his testimony relative to the receipts and expenditures and the company's present financial condition the testimony of the auditor was of real value. Real Estate and Buildings. The Commission's engineer left out of </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 299 his valuation a little old brick building and lot purchased by the com - pany five years ago as the future home of its exchange equipment. Thd company is now renting quarters. The engineer omitted the item be - cause not now used and useful by the company. It is being rented at $40 per month and so far as our search goes of reports filed by the com - pany that rental has not been included in the revenues of the company. The president of the company testified (transcript 147) that the rental had been applied on the purchase price. We think this property may properly be included. To rule otherwise is to put a penalty upon the business judgment of a utility management in looking ahead in its development program and making economical arrangements. The rental from the building, however, will be figured in the revenues of the company and hereafter must be included by it as revenues. Switchboards. In considering the value of this group of property we have transferred in the company's inventory the wool-ends from cable to switchboard for comparative purposes. We have adjusted the Commission's engineer's figures by leaving out the furniture carried the company under another heading. We find the conclusions ar- ve«l at by the Commission's engineer as to value of switchboards on of historical reproduction cost considerably higher than that of the company. We are convinced from the testimony on the subject that the figures more nearly represent what the company might be ex- have paid at the time of installation for this property and we use the higher figures. Subscribers Sets. The inventory of the company showed 155 more subscribers sets in service than was used by the Commission's engineer. The engineer did not count the instruments in his appraisal but took the figure found by the Commission's accountant by an examination of the books. The testimony showed no proper reason for this discrepancy. The company's auditor and the Commission's telephone accountant have .-ince checked over the records and are agreed and on the strength of that examination and a signed statement by the two accountants we take from the company's valuation 152 subscribers sets at the unit price used by it and add the necessary number to the Commission's en - gineerV total at the price unit used by him. We have removed booth telephones and put them in under "booths and fixtures" heading to eliminate implication. '■ The company has fallen here into what appears to tis to have been a palpable error. By inspection it put upon city instruments a con - dition per cent of 57%. It has figured the labor of installing the in - strument at 80 per cent condition. On rural sets the instrument is placed at 67 per cent condition and the labor in installing at 75 per cent. The labor in installing an instrument and other material accompanying is wrapped up with the material. It cannot be separated from the material. When the material wears out the labor is gone. It has al - ways been the practice of the Commission, and of other regulating </seg>
            <seg id="p300">300 bodies so far as we know, to depreciate the labor of installing a unit of property at the same rate that the material itself is depreciated. In fact, the company has used that method in the main in its inventory. Inasmuch as by inspection the company's appraiser saw the material and passed judgment on it, we are constrained to change the deprecia - tion on the labor to correspond to the depreciation on the material. This requires a considerable reduction in present value of labor in in - stalling instruments in the city and raises the present value of the same kind of labor on rural subscribers sets. This adjustment leaves the judgment of the company's appraisers and the Commission's appraiser on the matter of condition of subscribers instruments approximately the same. ' The re-adjustment« here explained leave the cost depreciated as found by the company somewhat lower than that found by the Coin - mission's appraiser. We take the judgment of the Commission's engi - neer in this matter and the higher figure, although we recognize that the company erred in using- the same cost for installing hotel phones that it did for individual phones inasmuch as the hotels were already wired by their owners, that the labor cost figured b\ the company as experienced is almost fifty per cent higher than was testi it the labor cost of installing instruments in 1915. i Exhibit 4). We do this because the 1915 judgment was considerably increased by the installation made by the company during the war-time eluded in the historical cost. City I'ole Lines. The figures used by the COlcpa nu than twice as high as those used by the Commission's enj in the inventory of the company are responsible. The cluiled the labor cost of installing the subscribers instrume of the poles, although included in the cost of the instruments installed, thereby duplicating the figure of $7,317, before depreciation. We re - move the duplication. The company has also fallen into the same error regarding the per cent condition of the labor of setting poles as compared with the per cent condition of the poles themselves. On the poles it has used a percentage of 58 anil on the labor of setting the same poles a condition per cent of 93. For the reasons heretofore stated we readjust the item of depreciated labor. The Commission's engineer found the poles in 65 per cent condition. As adjusted the company's per cent condition is 58. The net result of the adjustments leaves the depreciated cost as found by the company $300 lower than that found by the Commission's engineer. We accept the steadier results of the Commission's engineer and take the higher figure. Rural Poles. On this section of property the company's undepre - ciated figure is almost ?9,000 higher than that of the Commission's engineer. Part of this is due to the error of the company repeated here that was made relative to city pole lines; that is, it has included the labor and material cost of installing rural phones with the pole costs in </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 the sum of $2,960 and has included it also with the value of the sub - scribers stations installed, listed in another part of the inventory. It has also considered the condition per cent of labor of city poles as 77 and the poles themselves as 64 per cent. We correct the errors as heretofore described for similar errors on other sections. There is also a discrepancy between the Commission's appraiser and the company's appraisers on the quantity of poles, the company listing 7.670 poles and the Commission's engineer 7,315 poles. Both testified to having counted the poles. In testimony the company alleged that :he Commi-sion's engineer failed to find rural lines near Creston. The engineer testified that he had listed all property shown to him by the Luinpany as owned by it. At the time of the hearing it was directed [hat an effort be made to iron out the discrepancy. This was not mplished. The company did not show the location of any lines contained on the Commission's engineer's map. The engineer found e small duplications between city pole lines and country pole lines e company's inventory. Analysis of the conflicting inventories on the whole, shown that of the Commissions engineer to be reliable where we have specifically called attention to doubts. We do wever. desire to eliminate any property to which the company ist ownership. We are not sure from the record that the s engineer gave full consideration to the amount of piece- Liction involved in the development of this plant. Without '.o • !&lt;■ exact justice we consider it fair to divide the differ - ute and credit the company with the half of it and to adjust eei's iiguies in an upward direction, with the possibility of niecomeal construction. The summary, which will body all readjustments and the changes here discussed. er cent found by the Commission's engineer is used. It from that of the company. City Aerial Wire. On this item the company's appraisers and the mission's appraiser varies but little as to cost new. The Commis- ineer finds the condition per cent somewhat lower. On this iCcept the engineer's conclusions without change. City Aerial Cable and Underground Cable and Conduit. The com- aces the cost of this property at $28,026 as compared with the i ire-ponding figure by the Commission's engineer of $23,249. The ■ompany li-ted its overhead cable as in 91 per cent condition and its underground cable and conduit as in 76 per cent condition. The under - ground conduit was all established in 1916 or later and is almost in - estructible. Fully half of the cable in that conduit is no older than he conduit. On the other hand the overhead cable will average con - ulerably older. Much of it was in existence prior to 1916. It is more usceptible to deterioration because exposed to the elements. We can - lot accept the company's judgment as to condition per cent for these •easons. On the other hand the Commission's engineer found the over- </seg>
            <seg id="p302">302 Id cable in 63 condition and the underground cable and conduit in 94 dition. We accept the engineer's judgment. There is also dispute to the cost and the judgment as to the labor item. After removal the wool-ends, which have been included by us under another head - . and striking out the item of "engineering and superintendence", ch will be treated separately, and giving- full consideration to the ;imony on the question of unit prices of labor and materials, we will a figure somewhat higher than that used by the Commission's en - eer and considerably lower than that used by the company prior to adjustments. The figure found by us as fair, based wholly for the ntient on historical reproduction cost, is $23,900 undepreciated and ,571 depreciated value. Booths and Fixtures. The Commission's engineer (lid not include these, having been told they belonged to the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone company, which owns long distance toll properties entering the city. In response to an inquiry, the Northwestern Bell company claims to own most of the booths anil instruments. We will, however, give the company the benefit of the doubt since ownership has not been es - tablished and will include this item at the company's figures. t Rural Wire. The appraisers are far apart on this section of pro - :y; both as to quantities ami as to proper prices to use on the same s of computation. The company claims one hundred miles of wire, ch the engineer did not find on check. A subsequent check by the ineer of the company's work sheets discloses a duplication of nty-two miles of wire between the city and the country plant, the appraisal having been taken in conjunction by the Commission's ineer and a company representative. Certain other alleged errors e been checked by the Commission's engineer, making a total of ty-one miles against the company. The remaining seventy miles ot accounted for. The company used a labor cost of installing wire of $6.65 per mile. The engineer, following the same general theory, used a figure of $2.50 per mile. In the 1915 appraisal presented by the company the labor cost of stringing rural wire was fully thirty per cent lower than that used by this inventory. On the other hand, it is possible that the Com - tssion's engineer did not give sufficient consideration to the labor cost that part of the wire put in place during the high labor costs of the r-time period. Enough in doubt are we on this that we will make an addition to the Commission engineer's figures on this matter. The company places the condition per cent on rural wire at 70; the Com - mission's engineer uses the figure 60. We will use 65 per cent. On the discrepancies as to quantities we resolve the doubt chiefly in favor of the Commission's engineer inasmuch as the company did not point out errors in his computation and his field notes when opportunity was afforded to do so. For rural wire, then, we adopt the figure of histori - cal reproduction cost undepreciated $10-500 and depreciated $6,825. </seg>
            <seg id="p303">303 Stores and Supplies. Basing his figures on estimated actual cost, the Commission's engineer found a present value of $2,798. Using the cost of the inventory time and depreciating secondhand material the company arrived at a figure of $3,300. Both of these figures are higher than the average experience of the company, as shown by its reports. We adopt the figure of $3,000 as the value of the stores and supplies on the theory of historical cost. Furniture and Fixtures. The evidence was clear that the Com - mission's engineer missed some items under this heading. He took only that shown him by the company. We are convinced that the com - pany owned the additional property shown by it and that its inventory is substantially correct. It presented, however, only 1920 prices de - preciated and did not present any estimates as to historical cost. Using ratios of cost and reproduction cost from other elements of this pro - perty where they are available we arrive at a figure of $1,250 unde - preciated and S950 depreciated cost, the engineer's finding of depreciated cost beintf $632 and that of the company $1,128. Summary Engineering Cost Study From a very careful consideration of all the evidence, as summar - ized in the discussion above, the Commission has arrived at the figures resented in the tabulation below as representing fairly the "bare - ones" historical cost undepreciated and the same data with proper ideration of depreciation. The summary follows Totals- $115,622 $79,114 This conclusion must not be confused with book cost gross and book cost net. Such book costs do not reflect donations, unrequited labor, good and bad purchases as such, or the cost of property paid for from telephone revenues and not recorded as new construction; nor does it represent a bookkeeper's record of investment. Such figures it is im - possible to secure in the case before us.

The figures set out above are the conclusion? the CoitimirFion from all the evidence before it as to what reasonably rht be considered the co:-t to this company to reconstruct its property ing the years in which it was built, but chiefly after 1912, if all istruction had been paid for and if proper records of all costs had •n kept. Full consideration is given to those costs which COukl be ertained definitely from the books and account-, which, however, re - present but a minor portion of the total plant. I The figures above are so-called "bare-bones" assumed costs of this perty. The courts anil regulating commissions have unanimously ignited that in the construction of properties are always included er elements of costs as tangible as the prices of materials them - •es. These include organization expenses, legal expenses, engi - ring and superintendence of construction, contingencies and losses, I interest daring the construction period before the property begins earn. The company first laid claim in inventory to 80,529 under se various headings. This amount was increased, on advice of nsel, to $18,377 added to the "bare-bones" cost figures, and to ,904 to the reproduction cost figures. The basis used was fifteen cent of the '"bare-bones" figures. In testimony it was brought out It the president of the company, who had used the figure of §9.o2i&gt;. not included all the general expenses, but had considered pan of m in a claim for unrequited services. The Commission ha? for many IS used a figure of fifteen per cent added to the "'bare-bones" assume.! t. This figure averages well with the conclusions of legulatory emissions in many other states and has the approval of the courts. studies have ever been made, to our knowledge, involving the extent general expenses under the so-called reproduction new methods dur - the period of abnormal high labor and materials costs. We will the basis heretofore followed by the Commission. These general lenses are as much a part of the cost of construction as any Other tense and since they constitute labor almost exclusively they are sub - t to the rule of depreciation at the same rate as the property de - iciates. Adding the fifteen per cent to the "bare-bones" figures 'etofore arrived at we have the following results: Cost new *132,%:&gt; Cost depreciated 90,981 Working Capital. The company lays claim to $6,400 for materials and supplies and working capital. We have included materials and supplies elsewhere. The amount of working capital necessarily must be arrived at with full consideration of the fact that Collections of this Company are, in the main, made in advance of ser-.ice rendered and that rural collections are made if paid promptly during the first month of the quarter in which the service U rendered. We add $3,000 to the materials and supplies figure, heretofore mentioned, making $6,000 as </seg>

There appear to be three chief difficulties iproviag the data there presented, these being: T'ne accuracy of the figure used u a starting point as of 1. 1916. Failure to make allowances for reserves for accrued deprecia sted in additions and betterments. ( The accuracy of the corrections made on the distribution i- of the company. We will discuss these objections in detail. Property Cost of January 1, 1916. The company has used as a ting ligure $98,577.67 and has built up a property account from that v. The figure was obtained from an inventory filed in 1915 with Commission and made a part of this record in Exhibit No. 4. It alleged in the hearing that this figure has sanction of the Com- ssion and, therefore, as a basis for beginning the study of book lue.- is beyond question. . Review of the record in 1915 discloses that while the inventory was ed, there was practically no testimony introduced in support of it, was it in any manner tested by the Commission or by such respon - s as were present at the hearing. The Commission made no find- ng as to value in that case either as to reproduction value or to repro - iuction value depreciated. The order is highly confusing in its language, &gt;ut we do not think this interpretation of it is at all strained. What the ?on?mission said in that order is best illustrated by this language: ( "Assuming that the estimates made on the present value of $75,000 and the additional investment of $31,000 I for consolidation and im - provements) are correct and that applicant should be permitted to earn eight per cent only on its present capital liabilities, jlus added invest - ment, we have the following result: Eight per cent for maintenance and depre - ciation on $101,000 ? 8,080 Eight per cent return on $76,000 capital lia - bilities . 6,080 $14,160" Total— </seg>
            <seg id="p306">306 It had for years prior to 1916 been customary for the Commission to base the allowance for maintenance and depreciation on the esti - mated undepreciated cost of all the properties. If it had been the in - tention of the Commission to have considered $98,000 as the gross cost base it would have made allowance of eight per cent on $98,000 plus $31,000. Again, the order recites: "Should the city council of Columbus, after the completion of the underground construction, consolidation, and improvement of the farm lines, and a twelve months' operation of the consolidated service, ques - tion the reasonableness of the schedule herein approved, the Commis - sion will, upon request of the council, make a physical valuation and check of its operating costs, etc. and modify the schedule as the fact= may justify." Disregarding Reserves for Accrued Depreciation. The gross cost of $152, 654, derived by the company in its book study, provides for no depreciation either in the early history of the company or in the period subsequent to January 1, 1916. We have, we think, disposed of the propriety of using $98,577.67 as a starting figure without challenge. To support its position in not depreciating the property in any degree after January 1, 1916, in arriving at book value, the company alleges in brief that the order of 1915 did not impose upon it any obligation to set aside more than $8,080 for maintenance and reserve for depreciation, that it has spent for maintenance and current replacements that amount of money since January 1, 1916, to date, and that since the order was not changed it was under no obligation to consider any of the surpluses earned over and above operating expenses, fixed charges and dividends as belonging to depreciation reserve. It contends that because of this fact whatever it did earn and pass to surplus was in no sense deprecia - tion reserve. According to Exhibit 10 it did earn 820,724 during this period and passed it to surplus, reinvesting the full amount in the plant. It earned in addition to that more than $5,000 outstanding now in bills receivable above this amount in November, 1915. The company admits that depreciation did accrue in addition to the maintenance and the current replacements and lays claim ( Exhibit No. 7 • to $23,379 of accrued depreciation not earned, which, it a alleged, is a present obliga - tion which the public must meet. The order, as a result of the 1915 hearing, did not, in fact, impose any obligation upon the company relative to its maintenance and de - preciation reserves. Certain figure, were set down in attempting to measure the reasonableness of the rates, but so far as the terms of the order were concerned there was no obligation to set aside any particu - lar sum for depreciation reserve. Nor is it correct for the company to say that the order had never been modified. As a matter of fact it was modified as of date March 1, 1920, and thereafter the company was required to set aside $12,500 for maintenance, replacements and reserve for accrued depreciation. </seg>
            <seg id="p307">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 307 Aside from the question of fact the company takes, we think, an untenable position. If it is correct relative to these surpluses it was within it.- power to have paid them out in dividends, or at least so much thereof as did not violate the order on Application No. 2544. If at thei same time it is correct, as alleged, that depreciation was accruing it would amount to a declaration; of its right to deplete its capital in dividend payments and then to demand reimbursement of capital from the public. This is contrary to all principles of regulation of which ■we know. Those principles were lately written into the state con - stitution of Nebraska, Article 10, Section 5. As we understand the po-ition of the con-pany the surplus of $20,724, earned in the five years, represented unpaid dividends, that the stockholders had first call on these dividends, and that if the property depreciated because of rates being- too low the obligation rests upon the public to make good the depreciation and until that is done no deductions from capital or fair value can be made representing accrued depreciation. We consider for the reasons stated above that this position is unsound. It appears to us to be contrary to the rule laid down in Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, 212 U. S. 1, and in Railroad Commission v. Cumberland and Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 212 U. S. 414. From another point of view the position of the company cannot be sustained. It alleges in Exhibit No. 10 that dividends unpaid amount to .SI 5.2 17. Ignoring for the moment that in computing these unpaid dividends the company has used a property basis which, as pointed out above, ha? no proper foundation in fact, the company has failed to take into account other surpluses actually earned and invested in property without being called new construction. The company has laid claim to more than $20,000 of overhead cost of construction. Such claim has been allowed substantially. It could not have been allowed if good judgment had not warranted the con - clusion that the costs were actually incurred, but in place of being paid out of capital funds were paid out from time to time in operating ex - penses. No proof was tendered at all as to the actual expenditures for overheads. Such proof was impossible to ascertain because never at any time separately recorded. Hail the company, however, paid these overhead costs of construction out of capital funds, from which they should properly have been paid, the conclusion cannot be avoided that there would have been $20,000 more to have been used for dividends or other corporate purposes. Accuracy of Corrections Made. The accountant who made up the company's Exhibit No. 10 had imposed upon him what appears to us to have been an impossible task, viz.: of checking over the distribution ledger of the company and re-assigning expenditures. The distribution </seg>
            <seg id="p308">308 ledger is made up of three columns — "New Construction," "Mainte - nance", "Operating Expenses", with explanatory catch line for each item distributed. All expenditures during the five years in question were distributed among these three accounts by the bookkeeper. The accountant's task was to rearrange the distribution after a lapse of years. We do not consider that this could be more than guess work. What has been said here applies equally to the study made by the company, page 6 of Exhibit No. 10, where it has arrived at a net or de - preciated book cost of construction in amount $130,076.58. It has taken $76,000 as a starting point on the theory that this was approved by the Commission in its order on Application No. 2544. Such approval was not given. It has failed to depreciate this property after January 1, 1916; nor has any consideration been given to the loss of property brought about by consolidation in 1£&gt;16 of the Bell company with appli - cant, a loss which is shown in the 1916 annual report in that One year to have been $3,529.56; nor has consideration been given to the dis - mantling or sale of certain property. The inventory of 1915 show- a considerble amount of toll properties south (if the Platte river. The ttimony in this case is that lruch- of that property has been dismantle'! sold and that the remainder has been converted into farm line leads. Not to eliminate this removed property results in duplication. We are, therefore, unable to give serious consideration to the of book costs in arriving at a fair value of this property as aga: studies of the property itself. .-t Reproduction Cost Applicant contends, in brief, that as a matter of law it is entitled to a return upon "the present undepreciated value of its physical pro - perty, plus a reasonable allowance for going concern and WOfkillli' capital, minus the undepreciated value of the property built by use of depreciation reserve funds and not subsequently capitalized. Unde - preciated present values of a public service property can only be meas - ured by separating the property into its component parts in an inven - tory and applying present prices to those parts". On such a basis it contends that the reproduction value new of the property is $237,5i:&gt;. plus working capital and going value, and that the depreciated or present value is $174,067, plus going value and working capital. Oil the theory that such a valuation might require rates beyond what the traffic would bear, or the service be worth, the company agrees to ac - cept a fair value of $150,000, without, however, waiving its right to claim a larger present value of the property. These figures of the company are subject to all the re-adjustments for duplications and errors which have been discussed regarding the historical cost analysis. When those re-adjustments have been made and no changes made re - garding quantities or prices adopted by the company, we find the claim </seg>
            <seg id="p309">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 309 to be for undepreciated reproduction cost of $186,264, plus overhead expenditures and intangibles, and a depreciated reproduction cost of $125,922, plus overheads and intangibles. Kven if the controlling factor in arriving at a fair value is the reproduction new, less depreciation, at prices in the fall of 1920, we would be unable to accept these figures of the company. The testimony shows that in part the company was using its experience, including pnV" of materials purchased in that year and labor costs of the same time. Inasmuch as many parts of the property were purchased at other times and there was no experience of 1920, estimates on a per - centage basis were used in increasing the actual or assumed cost to a figure deemed proper by applicant for reproduction. Such percentage increases at best are loose estimates. The results are also influenced by the fact that the experience of the company in 1920 was practically all in piecemeal construction, involving higher cost of labor than would have been the case had this been an extensive construction program, as tempated in the hypothetical reproduction of the system. ure also some obvious inaccuracies in the computations, the ring example of which is in the unit used for labor and material in l!»20 of installing telephones. The company had presented a ►.65 per instrument. (Exhibit 1, p. 18K The items making 1 ■:al did not fisrure to that total. Testimony indicated that ms &lt; f "K. K. wire, insulator.-, knobs and screws" had been omitted. i\ itness of the company testified distinctly that the cost in 1920 would twenty cents for each instrument. He included in that figure labor lich is repeated as another item in the computation, thereby creating iuplitation. However, in making its corrections the company placed &gt; twenty cents in the column of "cost" and put a figure of ninety cents the column of "reproduction cost". We can see no other reason for opting the figure of ninety cents than to make the items total the ?-ente&lt;l figure, with no basis at all in fact. Testimony was also that in the fall of 1920 the company had used union labor cost of sixty cents per hour and that at the time of the learing it was paying: for this labor thirty-five cents per hour. These re merely illustrative. We do not, however, deem it necessary to analyze in great detail the company's reproduction cost figures for reasons that we will now ISCUSS Basis for Fair Value This Commission is fully persuaded that the fairest method of as - certaining the valuation of public utility properties is the investment cost without regard to the source of the funds, based on historical cost new methods, less the investment of those reserves created from re - venues for the protection of property already in existence and invested </seg>
            <seg id="p310">310 by the company in additions and betterments in order that the funds may not be idle. To say otherwise is, in our opinion, ultimately to the disadvantage of the utilities themselves and presently to the serious disadvantage of the public. Much of the improvements made by public utilities are required by public authority. These improvements may be ordered in a period of high labor and materials costs, the company hav - ing no other option than to make the investment. If the theory ad - vanced by applicant is correct, then later when prices drop substantially these investments which have been made on order of the public author - ities will depreciate. However, it is very apparent that these conclusions are not borne out by the weight of decisions of the courts and that if this Commission gives the consideration to those decisions which it is in honor bound to give it cannot stop with a conclusion on value based upon investment. Telephone properties are permanent investments. What consti - tutes a conclusion as to present value of permanent investments outside of public utility properties? This is a period of re-adjustment and rapidly downward trending values. Stocks of gOOdSi On which the turnover is rapid, can readily be priced at the moment, but who is to say what is the present value of such permanent investments as real estate? Farm lands have decreased in value very materially where sales have been made. The end is apparently not yet. The prudent buyer, faced with the prospect of still further shrinkage in values, U hardly likely to offer an appraised present value for farm lands as an investment because he must anticipate his inability to again realize that price in sale. The theory of fair value, based on reproduction prices at the given moment, is impracticable because unstable. In the instance of this company, prices were fixed on 1920 prices of labor and materials a&lt; experienced by the company and estimates where experience was no: had. More than a year has elapsed since those inventories were made. Very substantial re-adjustments in prices in a downward direction have taken place since that time. A rinding now of value based on prices of 1920 would be incorrect. It would appear that in order to be fair to the public the inventory must be again priced if reproduction new at this time is to be the sole measure of the value of the physical unit3 and possibly six months from now it would be again an unfair value. These are practical considerations. It is physically impossible for the regulating body to keep abreast of rapidly fluctuating prices of mater - ials and labor in arriving at a rate base for all the utilities which are under the supervision of the Nebraska Commission. More stability in the measure of value must be found, both in the interest of the company and of the public. But is applicant correct in its contention that the weight of authori - ties requires that reproduction new on the basis of labor and materials </seg>
            <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 311 costs in any given short period is required by the courts as the controll - ing consideration in reaching fair value? In 1897 the supreme court of California in San Diego Water Co. v. San Diego, 50 Pac. 636, rejected reproduction new as too speculative a hypothesis and accepted the book costs as the fair measure of the property there under consider - ation, and argued that there was nothing in the evidence to indicate that it &lt;lid not fairly reflect the value of the property. The next year the supreme court of the United States in San Diego Land Co. v. National City, 174 U. S. 757, rejected the company's contention of investment cost where the record showed a considerable dispute as to whether such book records repre - sented prudent investment. The company contended that in consider - ing- the fairness of its rates a fair return on the cost, the protection of its property by depreciating reserve, interest on obligations, and other fixed charges must be given consideration. The court said: Undoubtedly, all these matters ought to be taken into consideration, and such weight be given them, when rates are being fixed, as under all the circumstances will be just to the company and to the public. The basis of calculation suggested by the appellant is, however, defective in not requiring the real value of the property, and the fair value in themselves of the services rendered, to be taken into consideration. What the company is entitled to demand, in order that it may have just compensation, is a fair return upon the reasonable value of the property the time it is being used for the public." The case is frequently quoted by advocates of the "reproduction heory. Usually, however, only the last sentence is quoted. In Covington &amp; Lexington Turnpike Road Co. v. Sandford, 164 U. S. 578 court said "The utmost that any corporation, operating a public highway, can rightfully demand at the hands of the legislature ***** is that it receive what under all the circumstances is such compensation for the use of its property as will be just both to it and to the public." In 1906 the United States supreme court in Louisiana Railroad Commission v. Cumberland T. &amp; T. reversed the court below in granting an injunction for the reason that the case had been determined upon book investment valuation Without proper consideration to there being in that investment the use of de - preciation reserve funds collected from the public for the protection Of property existing theretofore. No objection was made by the high court to the investment basis of valuation except as stated. In Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, 212 U. S. 1, Co. 212 U. S. 424, </seg>

In the same year the supreme court decided Willcox v. Consolidated (Jus Co., 212 U. S. 19, 52 »Bre the cost of reproduction was used by the court below in arrivin the fair value and the supreme court said in this Connection: "And we concur with the court below in holding that the value of the property is to be determined as of the time when inquiry is niuie regarding the Vales. If the property, which legally enters into con - sideration of the question of rates, has increased in value since it was acquired, the company is entitled to the benefit Of such increase. This is at any rate the general rule. We do not say there may not possibly be an exception to it, where the property may have increased so enor - mously in value as to render a rate permitting a reasonable return Upon such increased value unjust to the public. How .-uch facts should be treated is not a question now before us, as this case does not present it. We refer to the matter only for the purpose of statins that the decision herein does not prevent an inquiry into the question when, i: ever, it should be necessarily presented." &lt; Italics are our.- ' The supreme court of West Virginia in 1910 in Coal &amp; Coke Ry.

S. 34 The court reached the conclusion that "The result of these and other decisions is that almost every Case must be dealt with in the light of its own peculiar tacts and circum - stances." And this court took investment as the fairest measure. One of the most famous of the valuation cases is I Simpson v. Shepard (Minnesota Rate Cases), 230 U. S. 3-52, decided by the supreme court in October, 1912. In that case the valu - ation of the railroads was presented on the reproduction new theory, which was accepted by the master and approved by the federal circuit </seg>

There was ilso involved the right of the company to claim properties to which it '.eld title but which were donated by the public. The court did not listurb the reproduction method except where its hypothetical consider - ttion resulted in abnormal values. A comparison of the findings of he master with the book investments of the carriers indicates that the :hief increases allowed by the master were in the value of lands and n the overheads, which, although presumably incurred, had been paid n large measure from operating revenues and had not appeared in the nvestment accounts. The court rejected reproduction where it resulted n the abnormal values but sustained the master in giving to the com - iany the property to which it had title but which came from donations 'rom the public and others. It appears to us significant, however, that after quoting from San &gt;iego Land &amp; Town Co. v. Jasper and Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., upra. that the company was entitled to demand just compensation in a r :iir return upon the reasonable value of the property at the time it is &gt;eing used for the public, the court continued: "The ascertainment of that value is not controlled by artificial rules. t is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment, laving it-; basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts." \n&lt;! then the court quoted appnrungly from Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. iH'i. that to ascertain that value a considerable number of factors must ■ considered, among them being "the present as compared with the iginal cost of construction". As to whether Justice Hughes, in his conclusions in the Minnesota .- Cases, meant to broadly approve reproduction new instead of inproving it in the lijrht of all the circumstances of the case before him, t appear- to us to be proper to quote from his findings as referee in es Brooklyn Borough Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 17 N. Y. Official Dept. Reports, 81, olvincr valuation and rates, wherein he said: "While it is important to consider the cost of reproduction in tie - termininp the fair value of a plant for ratemakinp purpose?, it cannot be said that there is a constitutional right to have the rates of a public service corporation based upon the estimated cost of the reproduction df it.- property at a particular time regardless of circumstances. To base rate- upon a plant valuation simply representing a hypothetical cost of reproduction at a time of abnormally high prices due to exceptional conditions would be manifestly unfair to the public, ani likewise to base rates upon an estimated cost of reproduction far lower than the actual bona fide and prudent investment because of abnormally low prices would be unfair to the company. This question of taking the hypothetical reproduction cost under abnormal conditions as a rata base should, of course, not be confused with the necessity of recognizing actual costs </seg>
            <seg id="p314">314 of operation even though abnormal. A public service corporation is entitled to be reasonably compensated for its service, and the actual cost of its operations must always be taken into consideration in determin - ing whether or not it receives a fair compensation above that cost. But it is a different thing, after cost has been rlefrayecl, and the question is as to the compensation to be allowed in excess cf cost, to take as the basis for a compensatory return an asserted plant value, far above the actual investment, which is reached merely by expert estimates of a cost of reproduction under abnormal conditions. This would result in al - lowing a public service corporation to take advantage of a public calamity by increasing its rates above what would be a liberal return not only on actual investment, but upon a normal reproduction cost, in the view that unless it could make an essentially exorbitant demand upon the public it would be deprived of its property without due process of law. The enforcement of the constitutional guatanty does not re - quire the application of any artificial formula. It has constantly been \pointed out that the rate base must be what is called the fair value of the property,' and that as to this there must be a reasonable judgment based on a proper consideration of all relevant facts (Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466, 546, 547, 42 L. ed. 819, 849, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418; San Diego Land &amp; Town Co. v. National City, 174 U. S. 739, 757, 43 L. ed. 1154, 1161, 19 Sup. Ct.

As was said by the court of appeals in the case last cited: "The cost of reproduction less accrued depreciation rule seems to be the one generally employed in rate cases. But it is merely a rule of convenience and must be applied with reason.' His conclusions were accepted by the New York courts which later con - sidered the ease. The decision in 1914 in Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238 U. S. 153 is frequently referred to as supporting the basis of reproduction new as a controlling factor in finding fair value. The inventory and valu - ation involved in that case were made in 1911. As the case went to the supreme court it presented no controversy relative to the general principle of reproduction new in arriving at the value of physical pro - perties, the controversy centering around going value and the repro - duction of paving over mains where the mains had been laid prior to pavement by the city and where the company did not experience a paving cost. The high court did not discuss the reproduction principle except on those points under contention. It did not, however, disturb the In considering this case we must bear in mind that there was no controversy as to the method of valuation. The cost of reproduction did not vary abnormally from historical reproduction cost as prices were fairly stable. In approving the master's report where reproduction. </seg>
            <seg id="p315">315 new at the time of the inventory was accepted, except as to paving, the court below did discuss the law regarding the reproduction new principle of valuation. He said: "All concede that the present value is the basis on which returns are to be estimated. ***** It is claimed the true value of any building, structure, or plant is that sum which it takes to reproduce it, less the depreciation of the one to be replaced. But little assistance is obtained from the authorities, although it is claimed the case of Willcox v. Con - solidated Gas Co. is in point. The opinion does not show this to be so. ***** But it is not easily understood how the supreme court in that great case, so ably argued, with so much involved, meant to be so under - stood without expressly so declaring in the opinion. No one doubts but that the cost of reproduction may in many cases be considered and in some cases is a solution of the controversy." 199 Fed. 207. Applicant cites Milwaukee v. R. R. Commission of Wisconsin, et al.. P. U. R. 1920B, 976 in support of its contentions as to the basis of finding fair value. The Wisconsin Commission in that case said: "One of the elements which has always been given consideration is investment prudently made. This element is unquestionably one of the more important elements and at a time of very widely fluctuated unit costs and abnormal conditions should have, as we have said in various cases, a large influence in determining the final value." The supreme court of Wisconsin in Oshkosh Water Works Co. v. Railroad Commission, 161 Wis. 130, said: "The present reasonable valup of the utility determines rate as well as price. In both the original investment is a valuable aid in deter - mining the present value of the property but it is not controlling. It is only one of the several elements to be considered in arriving at present value whether for purchase or rate-making purposes." It will be noted that this court used the expression "present reas - onable value of the utility" in practically the same language that is used in the cases by the United States supreme court and then it pro - ceeds to analyze the expression and does not do so by confining its at - tention tc reproduction new. The supreme court of Illinois in 1915 in State Public Utilities Commission ex rel. v. Springfield Gas &amp; Electric Co., 125 N. E. 891, said: "Appellee contends that the only equitable basis for determining value for rate-making purposes is the cost of reproduction new, less depreciation. This contention cannot be sustained. The basis of all calculations as to the reasonableness of rates to be charged by a cor - poration maintaining a public utility under legislative sanction must be the fair value of the property being used by it for the convenience of the public, and in order to ascertain that value the original cost of </seg>
            <seg id="p316">316 construction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the present cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the pro - perty under the particular rates prescribed by the statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses are all' matters for consideration and are to be given such weight as may be just ami right in each case." In Detroit v. Michigan Railroad Commission, 209 Mich. 395. decided April 10, 1920, the supreme court of Michigan approved the public utility commission's method of finding fair value by use of re- Pluction methods exclusively. But to ascertain the reasons for that ing we must anal\2e the case. The Michigan State Telephone pany of Detroit was seeking to put into effect measured service in ; city. The case was contested and involved a valuation of the properties. This valuation was taken as of December, 1915, prior to any war-time increase in unit costs. It was taken on the reproduction IV.Othod and that method was approved by the public utility commission. On appeal to the circuit court that particular portion of the conclusion of the public utility commission was approved, the circuit court saying-: "No matter how much I am impressed with the idea that fait" present value cannot be determined under the reproduction cost new — less depreciation method, without considering original cost or actual investment, I cannot, in view of the holding in the case of City and County of Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., 246 U S. 178, condemn that method and set the order of the commission aside for such reason.-. *«•«» Such approval there of that method bars disapproval here, even though were this an original matter before me I would not yclept such method. • * • • • I do not understand that the &lt;upr?me court of the United States has decided against other methods bu only that it has appn ved the reproduction cost new less depreciation tnethcd in the case before it." The supreme court, reviewing this language, said: ■ We think the case cited by the learned judge «;.s directlj and is controlling." ' It must be remembered that this case was on appeal and the utility commission would be reversed only if, under the circumstances, the method used were wrong. The citation in this case is to the Denver Water Works case. We find the same situation there. The inventory aken i n 1014 on a reproduction new basif, was approved by the master nd by the court below. On appeal apparently the only question in - olved regarding this method was whether or not the value ought to be educed for the reason that the franchise to occupy the streets had run it and that, therefore, the property was worth only junk value. The ourt discussed that question and found that the length of time in the uture during which the property might be used had nothing whatever o do with its value at the time of consideration. It refused to over - ule the court below on this point, saying; "What we have said establishes the propriety of estimating com - plainant's property on the basis of present market values as to land an« reproduction cost less depreciation as to structures." </seg>
            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 317 The case appears to have been decided with full consideraion of all the circumstances surrounding it, including the fact that the inventory v a- taken at a time when abnormal conditions did not exist and the court found no reason for overturning the conclusions of the master as fair value arrived at in that manner. Likewise the supreme court in Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Lincoln, 250 U. S. 256, upheld the ordinance during a period when unit prices were abnormal and were known to the court to be abnormal, al - though the inventory and valuation presented to it through findings by the master involved only prices at the time the inventory was taken in 1911. There are two or three cases where this line of reasoning apparent - vill not apply. In Consolidated Gas Co. v. Newton, 267 Fed. 231. the court found flatly that present day prices in a reproduction of the property at the time of the inquiry was practically the sole measure. The master who had heard the case had repudiated this principle and based the valuation on the investment prudently made. Both found the existing rates confiscatory and that they should be enjoined. Appeal was taken to the United States supreme court, which court, on March 6, 1922, handed down a decision. Justice McReynolds quoted &lt;im the opinion of the master to the effect that reasonable investment should be the basis for valuing the property and mentioned the dis - agreement of the court below with the master but did not pass on the question. It was not necessary inasmuch as in either instance the rate was found to be confiscatory. In Joplin &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Public Service Commission of Missouri, 267 Fed. 584, 587, the federal district court for Missouri found against the Missouri com- --ion as to its method in arriving at a fair value of the street railway &gt;erties in Joplin. This decision and the subsequent one in Joseph Railway &amp; Light Co. v. Public Service Conin i^sion of Missouri, 267 Fed. 231, cited by applicant in supporting its position It will be noted. however, that the public service coir.mission of Missouri took original cost and in many instances a five year pre-war average in arriving at fair value, with no consideration of "going value". The court said: "it appears upon the fact of the report (of the Commission) that great, if not undue, emphasis was laid upon the original cost of the property ***** at a period greatly antedating that with which this investigation must deal; nor can we say that the present period of high prices is so temporary or abnormal that it may practically he disre - garded in arriving at the value of the complainant's pioperties." (Italics are ours &gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p318">318 The court did not say that the sole measure or controlling measure should be reproduction new at the time, although the decision was rendered at a time when there was no indication of the reduction in general price levels that has since taken place. In Houston Electric Co. v. Houston, 265 Fed. 360, decided March 13, 1920, there had been presented historical cost, trend prices and reproduction new value of the utilities properties. The court used all three in reaching his determination. Although there had yet been no sign of diminishing prices, the upward trend being still sharp, the conclusions gave greater weight to historical cost than to repro - duction cost, and perhaps greatest weight to trend prices. In Georgia Railway &amp; Power Co. v. Railroad Commission of Georgia, (January 27, 1922, and as yet unreported &gt; , decided by three federal judges in injunction proceedings, the court denied the injunction ami declared the railroad commission had not taken such a view of fair value as to be violative of the Fourteenth Amendment where it had taken into consideration various element. 1 -, in - cluding original cost and reproduction new cost. The conclusion of the Georgia commission gave greater weight to the so-called split inventory; or in other words, the actual experience more properly describe' as historical reproduction cost. In the light of these decisions it seems perfectly plain that the fair value arrived at in rate cases of public utilities at this time must include careful and proper consideration of price levels now existing. These levels constitute an important element. In their consideration we must bear in mind the trend of prices in the past eighteen months. Such consideration can lead to no other conclusion than that normal prices, using the word "normal" as pre-war level, will not again be fully reach - ed for a considerable period, if ever. There is enough stability to the fact that prices are not normal to warrant the fixing of fair value with ample consideration of present levels. In dealing with this perplexing problem we cannot overlook the question of amount of property now existing in this case which was built under war-time price conditions and which was given full con - sideration in the figures heretofore arrived at by us in "cost new" and "cost depreciated". The company's exhibits show that during the years 1917 to June 30, 1921, the company spent for additions and betterments $28,389 that has already been taken into the inventory at figures approx - imating the experienced cost. During the same time the company spent $40,437 for maintenance and current replacements. These current re - placements were made in costs of the moment, have been recognize'- as almost new property by the appraiser, and are included at the approxi - mate cost figures at which they were made. Our estimate, based on our own experience with many companies, is that thirty-five per cent </seg>
            <seg id="p319">319 of the total cost cf maintenance and current replacements represents replacements and that during the period under consideration $14,000 Ml spent in replacing units of property. Therefore, the amount of property now in the inventory, which was put there at war-time prices, approximates $42,400. These figures &lt;lo not include general or over - head expenses, which, to date, have been met by this company as ordi - nary operating expenses. We conclude, therefore, that $73,200 of the property was constructed at prices experienced in periods preceding 1917. Under the rule of considering all relevant facts in arriving at fair value, the property constructed during the war-time period Will, at some future time when prices have again approached normal, or pre-war, be found to be worth less than it is included in this inventory. It is also true that for years the major portion of the property will fairly repre - sent values considerably in excess of cost. We take these facts into consideration in the final figure to be arrived at. Cost of Financing .Some testimony was introduced as to the expense and time incurred in financing this company, although no specific figure of cost was named. It was included by the president, Mr. Garlow, in his claim for unre - quited services, totaling $19,400. The cost of financing cannot be hypothetical but must be considered with full weight to the experience of the particular company. This company has borrowed its money on notes from local banks, involving no particular cost of financing. It has, however, been at a definite expense in selling stock. The stock outstanding amounts to $55,000. The cost of financing was paid in operating expenses, so far as paid at all. We will include cost of financing, but will confine it to the par value of the stock. Going Value Applicant says the fair figure representing its going value is from ten to twenty per cent of the value of the physical properties. It is in. a- settled law that the element of going value must be considered and given proper weight. Definitions of what constitutes going value vary. Applicant has fallen into the error of confusing it with good will, inas - much as the company president testified that the amount of going value would increase with the net earnings. Since going value is an element in arriving at a rate which will provide a fair return it cannot be de - pendent upon that fair return. One element of going value is that the plant is completed, its units working together in a coherent whole, functioning for the purposes for which the property was constructed. The value of the property as thus co-ordinated is greater than the value where each of the parts is con - sidered in a sense unrelated to any other part. </seg>

Law 463, 87 Atl. 651 The appraiser? for both the company and the Commission recognize.) a minimum value for each unit in making up the inventory and appraisal, which minimum was higher than the value of the unit removed from the plant and sold as salvage. For example, no pole has been listed at less than thirty per cent condition by the Commission's engineer and appv&gt;&gt;\ - imately the same by the company, although many of the poles were recognized as being- just ready to replace. Even assuming that in an emergency a year or two of use can be secured from such poles the thirty per cent value placed upon them is considerably in excess of the remaining emergency use and the salvage value when removed. This extra value, recognized by the engineers, can be nothing else than a recognition of this one element of goina: value. In this property it amounts to thousands of dollars. Some courts and commissions have given great importance to earlj losses of the business in arriving at the figure of going value. Sod: consideration fails to take into account what we have already pointe. out that early losses may be due entirely to the payment out of curreir revenues of such large construction costs as eo to make up the genera expenditures of construction, amounting in this ca.-e to approximate!} S18,0C0. There is, however, in the experience of each compan Cost of attaching the business to the property. There is testimony 10 this effect in his case, although the testimony was given in support of the claim of the president for unrequited services. In considering the extent of the cost of attaching the business we must give attention to the actual experience of the company, which include-; the rule in the early days of the company that rural subscribers had to be stockholders and that to secure service they must buy stock. This rule acted as a sales agency in an inexpensive manner. With lull and, we believe, proper consideration of all the elements which have been discussed in this opinion, we arrive at a fair value of applicant's property as of date June 30. 1921. of $117,000. The pro - perty for the last half of 1921 is not included because the company has not yet reported the additions and betterments made during that period. Under the rule laid down in Smyth v. Ames, and repeatedly ap - proved by the court in subsequent decisions, we have had to take into account, in arriving at this conclusion, the capital invested. In more recent decisions this factor plays a very minor part. At the time of the taking of this inventory the stock outstanding amounted to $54.*75 and the notes payable to 824,942. These are interest-bearing or dividend-bearing obligations. We thus find the total amount of </seg>
            <seg id="p321">321 This represents the cash investments in this company, but in vi«w of all the circumstances surrounding the construction of the property it does not bulk large in importance in arriving at the fair value. , The respondents urged that there should be subtracted from fair value the discount at which certain stock was sold in the organization period of the company at a fifty per cent discount. Our conclusion in the paragraph above answers this contention. Applicant has urged the consideration of allowance for certain un - requited services, performed by the president and others, in amount $19,400. We do not see how in law such obligation against the com - pany exists. We have further pointed out that practically all the so-called unrequited services fall within the limits of the valuation and have been given full consideration. Revenues In its initial petition applicant urged the necessity of annual re - venues of $55,566 as against $37,190, now a maximum possibility. In its amended application the necessities weie reduced to $53,105. Re - spondents urged that no consideration should be given to increases until the service is in proper state of efficiency. The evidence in this case and the preceding one does not indicate unusually low state of service, nor unusual dissatisfaction on the part of patrons except as to the application of certain rules, which were corrected in a preceding order. Rpspondents also urged that this is not the proper time for rate in - creases when prices are being substantially reduced and the country is in a period of depression. This argument has been rejected by every court within our knowledge to which it has been presented to last year. It must also be borne in mind that applicant is no*- furnishing service raies made effective March 1, 1916, before increased costs of tion had been encountered. It is true that on March 1, 1920, higher rates for this applicant were made effective by the Commission, which would have produced $3,750 per annum additional revenue. By action on the part of applicant this additional revenue was not collected. The patrons were in nowise to blame for this and we are not at all sure that applicant can be heard to complain about financial difficulties resulting from its election not to collect the higher authorized rates for the past two years. Applicant's estimate as to the extent of present revenues is incor - rect by reason of the erroneous record of the number of subscribers stations. As a matter of fact the maximum revenues appear to be about $1,600 per annum less than stated by applicant. Total revenues in 1920 were $35,642 and in 1921 (based on ten months' experience' §35,670. Applicant's auditor estimated that without change in rates the revenues for 1922 would approximate those of 1921, although his testimony as to toll earnings in 1921 was contradictory. On that point </seg>
            <seg id="p322">322 we accept applicant's estimate in the application, as well a? the showing - of tol! earnings in 1919 and 1920.

In Exhibit 6 the company estimates the replacements necessary because of that storm as $7,799. There is do evidence as to the actual amount ex- pended. Based upon the 1!)21 normal current replacement experience we assume the excess replacements to have been $4,516.

The combination of the two make the estimate of 1922 approximate the experience of 1921. The company includes an item for casualty- insurance. The testimony shows that this was paid and it must have been included in commercial expenses ami in that far it is a duplication to again include it separately. The company proposes to create a depreciation reserve of $4,700 annually for five years to offset a failure in the past on the part of the publ ; t to pay sufficient revenues to provide this fu'id. Our dis - cussion- heretofore indicate our conclusion that this claim is based on a fal&gt;e conclusion of law and an erroneous statement of fact. The item cannot lie allowed. We must now give consideration to the rate of return which, under all the circumstances, will be fair. During: the war-time period interest rates were relatively high and this fact was recognized by the Commis - sion by the very general allowance of an eight per cent return on fair value, although in many instances where no claim was made for more than outstanding obligations the rate was figured at eight per cent on such obligations where they were safely within the value of the pro - perty. It is a matter of common knowledge, however, that there have been &lt;harp declines in recent months in the rates of interest. At the present time six per cent bonds are selling at par, or above, even on most public utilities which are not generally looked upon with favor as investments. Seven per cent preferred stocks are quoted in the neigh - borhood of par. This company pays seven and one-half per cent on certain note obligations and we understand six per cent on certain others. Interest rates continue to decline, as evidenced by the advanc - ing price of all kinds of bonds and preferred stocks. The Con. mission has long held to the opinion that the rate of return which it must consider fair is that rate which will, with proper effort on the part of the utility, attract a sufficient number of investors to furnish the additional capital necessary for the utility to meet its obligations to the public in the way of additions and betterments. Obviously, then, this rate of return must take into account local as well as general con - ditijons. We are of the opinion and so find that seven and one-half per cent annually on the fair value of applicant's property represents a fair return at this time. Wo thus have the following estimated revenue necessities for this company for a twelve months period succeeding the effective date of the order: Fund for maintenance, replacements and proper depredation re - serve, 10' i on $132.!&gt;65 estimated original cost $13300 I See page 14 ) Traffic b.636 Commercial 7,280 </seg>

This finding- was temporary in character because there was no inventory of the property and no opportunity to pass intelligently on the fair value. The revenue necessities included eight per cent of the outstanding obligations. We authorized rates which would yield about $1,000 in excess of the needs on the theory that each well-managed com - pany should earn some surplus each year in order to be guarded against unforeseen expenditures, not including storm damage, which is provided for elsewhere in this order. We still consider such a prospective margin proper and apply it to this case. The rates which will be approved in the order following this finding will provide such a margin of safety. Under the proposed scale they will produce S40250 which may be in - creased by any moderate growth of the company. At the same time the siuplus may be further augmented by a reduction in co. ts of oper - ation not now in sight. It follows, therefore, that the rates which will be* approved hereafter will be slightly higher than those ippro.-ed in the order on Application No. 4101, which rate applicant ignored.

Its testimony in support of the valuation was con - fusing-, contradictory and replete with admissions of lack of detailed information regarding the property, the inventory and the basis used arriving at values. The supporting exhibits are filled with errors it are excusable only if those who prepared them had undertaken a task which they could not successfully accomplish. I do not think the ( ommission is justified on such a record in finding a fair value. I believe the proper action should have been to refuse to find a fair value until such time as applicant at another hearing should have presented proper evidence to support its claims. Until that time applicant is not, y opinion, entitled to a return on more than its outstanding obli- ation There is evidence enough in the record of receipts and expenditures ■ring 1920 ami 1921 to justify some increases in revenues but not more lian enough, in my opinion, to warrant the rates authorized temporarily y the Commission in its order dated February 26, 1920. I think the order should be confined to re-authorization of rates of 1920 and to a direction to the company to prepare again its showing on valuation in an intelligent and orderly manner. Moreover operating expenses for several months past have decreased in most directions; labor is lower and more efficient; supplies cost less; interest rates are declining. These conditions require an applicant to make the records very clear before increased rates should be allowed. '&lt;■&gt;■&gt; </seg>

            <seg id="p329">329 the property came into possession of applicant company. Because of industrial depression at the time the application was filed, coupled with the knowledge on the part of the company at the time of acquiring the property that it was on a non-paying basis, we have delayed action un - til this time. Hearing was held at Auburn on June 13, 1922, in order give patrons an opportunity to discuss the proposed rates. This property was originally a mutual company, with the stock wide - ly held. From time to time, for reasons not known to us, shares of stock were sold to George E. Coddington, owner of the Auburn Tele - phone Company, ami at the time of the purchase of the Auburn prop - perties by applicant the majority of the stock was so held. Thereafter supervision and maintenance of the plant was done by applicant, under agreement with the &gt;tockholders. Other stock was acquired until some time in 1919 all the stock came into possession of applicant. The prop- erty was then merged with the system and it is now an exchange of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company. Rates in existence at the time of purchase were: •11.25 per month for business telephone, local service; 2.2.") per month for business service with Auburn included; 1.00 per month for local residence and farm service; 2.00 per month for service local and to Auburn. The company proposes the following scale of rates One-party business $2.50 per mo One-partv business, plus Auburn 3.50 " " _$2.50 per month One-party business, plus Auburn Business extension 1.00 " " One-party residence 1.50 " " Four-party residence 1.35 " " Four-party residence, plus Auburn 2.35 " " One-party residence, plus Auburn 2.50 " " Farm service 1.35 " Farm sen-ice, plus Auburn 2.35 " " Revenues for the year ending March 31, 1922, totaled $1342.51. The company's showing of expenses at this exchange was $2,806.41, with no return on the investment, making the actual deficits, in accordance with the company's figures, $963.90, and no return on the investment. • A scrutiny of the expenses indicates the actual experience for main - tenance and depreciation was $1,430.17, or seventeen per cent of the book cost of the property. This is entirely out of line with the exper - ience of the company as a whole and with the experience on record in this office of other exchanges generally in the state. Adjusting this fig - ure to the normal experience of applicant we estimate the needs of the company at $2,300, exclusive of a return on the investment, which in - vestment is not less than $4,000.00. The company estimates the rates proposed will add $571 to the gross revenues. Under the company's showing of expenses the total revenue asked for would be $713 less than the necessities, including </seg>
            <seg id="p330">330 eight per cent on a $4,000 investment. Under our adjustment of the maintenance and depreciation allowance the deficit would be about $200 under the proposed rates. The rates asked for local application are not out of line with the rates approved heretofore by us for exchanges of like size in the state. In the particular locality the rates asked for are now being charged at Brownville, an exchange about the same size, and the .same rates are being charged at Brock, a somewhat larger exchange. The present applicant inherited the added exchange rate to Auburn of $1.00 per month for any subscriber desiring that sen-ice. With this added rate was free reverse service from any subscriber in Auburn de- siring to talk to the persons paying the higher rates published by this company for added exchange service. Howe is a very small exchange. and, where practicable, a wider territory should be offered for proper compensation. For the same reasons, also, as we set forth in order on Application No. 4588 we think it advisable to publish a two-party bu.-i- ness rate slightly lower than the one-party rate. This will also cor- respond to the classes of business service at Auburn. In our order will adjust the rates for added exchange service to Auburn to confor more nearly to the .general practice for similar service heretofore at proved by us in a large number of orders and to encourage somewhi the use of added exchange service from the vei-y sinal exc Howe to tlie larger town immediately adjacent. It will l&gt;e umiersto that the rates approved by us for added exchange service will not thorize any subscriber at Auburn to free service in reverse direction the subscribers at Howe who buy the added exchange to Auburn. i necessity arises for service in the reverse direction the conipai make application on behalf of the Auburn exchange thereor It is impossible to figure accurately the revenue.- w hich wouli derived under our approved rates because impossible to ascertain extent to which the added exchange service will be used. It ma) it is altogether probable, that the company will not earn a fair returi at this exchange under the method of allocating general expenses. Tilt The exchange will, however, be in no different position than the other very small exchanges of applicant. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company be am it hereby is authorized, effective August 1, 1922, to publish and collect the following schedule of rates at its exchange at Howe, Nebraska Class of Service Net per month One-party business $2.50 One-party business, plus Auburn 3.00 One-party business extension 1.00 One-party residence 1.60 </seg>

E. Mattison, general manager; Lysle Young, dis - trict manager; W. L. Lemon, auditor; George E. Coddington. For respondents, J. D. Graves, attorney; Arthur T. Tart, subscriber. OPINION AND FINDING iro» ne, Commissioner On October 1, 191K, applicant purchased from local owners tele - phone properties serving the city of Peru and certain surrounding trade territory. The exchange consisted of approximately 350 subscribers. The purchase price was $8,955.12 for the physical properties and certain ad- liuiial amounts for the excess of bills receivable over bills payable and materials and supplies on hand. The purchase price, was, therefore, less than $30 per station. It was entirely a grounded system, not in tiist-class physical condition. The rates were the rates which had been in elfect for many years, viz: $1.50 per month for business service; 1.00 per month for farm and residence service. After having operated the exchange for a year anil a half under the rates in effect at time of purchase the purchasing company, applicant here, asked authority to publish the rates which it had been authorized by us to collect generally at exchanges of the size of Peru, viz.: S3.00 per month net for individual business service; 1.50 per month net for individual residence service; 1.35 per month net for two-party residence service; 1.35 per month net for rural service. This application was purposely allowed by the Commission to drag. At the time it was made the state was in a serious business and finan- </seg>
            <seg id="p332">332 cial depression, with agriculture particularly hard pressed. That con- Cn has been partly relieved. Meanwhile the company has operated exchange at very considerable deficits, from which burden it now urges that it is entitled in law and equity to relief. Almost everywhere in the state we have recognized the necessity for telephone rates high - er than the pre-war level and it was a,greed at the time of the hearing by respondents that the company was entitled to an increase, the only question being as to the amount. Since purchase the company has invested $4,000 additional money. It has made the business service metallic, moved the central office to a more advantageous location, placed a considerable amount of cable, and divided overloaded farm lines. Nineteen twenty-one revenues from all sources at Peru, after allo - cating to the exchange twenty-five per cent of originating messages, which allocation is recognized by Nebraska statutes, section 7416, R. S. 1U13, were $5,284.47. The company set aside six per cent for depre - ciation reserve and, after paying the direct operating: expenses and allocating to this exchange a portion of all general expenses, lacked $1,352 of earning the cost of operation, exclusive of a return. It pro - poses to increase the rates in amount $2,365 and figures it will have left, after paying expenses bottomed upon the 1!&gt;21 experienc as a net return. E. K. Good, Peru banker and former officer and stock! fied that the company was losing money at the time it was sold. T phone wages increased rather sharply in the year 1020. TV owners paid $800 for operators. The present owners fii to pay $1,500 for operators, but secure from these opera rt services in collecting from subscribers. The wages pai mi to operators are not out of line; in fact are lower than the perience in towns of like size over the state. These facts in themseh indicate the most powerful factor in causing a direct loss to the I chasing company each year since the purchase. The direct expenses at Peru for labor and materials used in current upkeep, for wages of operators, for batteries and central office power. for directories, advertising, and collecting from subscribers amounted in 1921 to $3,788.84. Rents, taxes, and bad bills increased this expendi - ture to $4,171.48. Of this amount $3,000 was paid directly to local peo - ple in wages. Under the existing rates, therefore, the company was merely able to set aside a modest amount for replacing plant as it wears out and secured nothing from the Peru exchange to help pay the ex - penses of the central office, bookkeeping, supervisor's work, insurance of all kinds, stationery, printing, and other miscellaneous items, and nothing at all for a return on the investment. Since the peak of prices was reached and business generally w T as readusting itself to lower costs of operation the Commission has been </seg>
            <seg id="p333">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 333 reluctant indeed to advance the rates of public utilities. In this instance where the rates reflect no increases during the war-time period and where the showing is as has been outlined in this opinion there is no alternative than to grant relief. With only two or three exceptions the rates of the Lincoln com - pany at towns comparable to Peru are the rates asked in the applica - tion. At smaller towns the business rates are somewhat lower, due chiefly to the limited territory available to the user rather than to the actual cost of transacting the business. As before stated, this exchange was grounded circuit at the time of purchase and is still a grounded exchange except for business subscribers. Peru is the home of a great fduc-ational institution and is entitled to first-class telephone service. At the earliest time consistent with proper economy in the use of its facilities the town exchange here should be made entirely metallic. Without making it a part of our order we will expect the company to fellow that program, with due allowance for the fact that materials which telephone companies mu4 buy remain at unusually high figures. The company does not propose other business service than single arty. We think that where practicable the small business user, the lature of whose demands permit of two-party service, should be (tiven ppcrtunity to purchase such service and we will provide in this for two-party business service. ing the past four years the sub.-cribers ;;t Peru have enjoyed wer than almost anywhere else in the state at all comparable I 1 during a large part of that period this applicant has ab- il a loss. There is no good reason why subscribers at Peru should jay equally with other like subscribers of the Lincoln company. company has been making a most commendable effort to reduce ses consistent with good service and di£erves much credit for the results accomplished. It has now ceased drawing upon its meager sur - iilu.- to meet deficits anil is making its fixed charges and a seven per cent return on the outstanding stock, all of which represents fair in - vestment We are hopeful that the time will soon come when downward revisions can be begun and the patrons at Peru will have equal considera- tion with other exchanges, despite the advantages they have been having luring the past three years over telephone users generally in the .-tate.

            <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 335 furnished through the operations of trains Nos. 7 and 8 between Emer - son and Omaha is objected to by the protestants on the ground that the traveling public is seriously inconvenienced, that the present train ser - vice furnished by the applicant railroad is inadequate for the needs of the cominunities served, and that the present schedule discriminates airainst Omaha in favor of Sioux City. The evidence in this case would not justify a resumption of the service in question. The Commission, however, realizes that Omaha is an important city on applicants railroad and the community served ha-; for over thirty years been accustomed to a train schedule over appli - cant's lines that pave to the people of this territory a morning tr.uin in- Omaha and evening train out of Omaha. The Commission urged the ilroaii company to arrange its present schedule of trains in a way that the territory between Omaha and Emerson would receive a morning and evening service. The officers of the railway company contended that on account of its necessary connections with its network of branch lines it could not rearrange its train schedule to meet the requirements, hut would, as soon as business conditions showed an improvement, re - establish its trains Nos. 7 and 8 to meet the demand. The Commission now has the assurance of the Chicago, St. Paul.

In support of its prayer applicant presents an exhibit containing a statement of revenues and expen-e&lt; for the year 1920 and for ten months of 1921, and as another exhibit the finding: of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, in order on Application No. 1786, said order dated September 1, 1918. The exhibit of applicant shows total earnings at StranK from all sources for the year and ten months ending October "l. 1921, to be $1,812. Jti, and the total expenses, exclusive of reserve foi depreciation and return on investment, to be $2,598.38.

In its order the Commission anticipated such an increase in business that would offset the deficit. «, Respondents rely upon three contentions in resisting the application briefly stated as follows: (a) In 1903 the Fillmore County Telephone company, predecessor of applicant, acquired a franchise to run twenty-five years. This fran - chise has not yet terminated and a contract obligation exists on the part of applicant to continue to meet the terms of the franchise until its expiration. ih) The business interests of the village of Strang- have acquired such a vested right in telephone service as entitled them to be heard successfully in opposition to any plan which would seriously affect their financial interests. (c) The showing made by applicant is for a period of abnormally high operating expenses, which expenses may reasonably be expected </seg>
            <seg id="p337">337 to reduce sharply, thereby rendering the operation of the Strung ex - change compensatory.

Co. v. North Dakota, 236 U. S. 5S5 Attorneys for respondents proposed to file brief in support of the position taken regarding the binding effect of a franchise. No has been filed, although the time for filing has long since ex- red. The record contains a copy of ordinance No. 56 of the village Strang, wherein a twenty-five year franchise was given to the Fill - ore County Telephone company in 1903. This authorized the location I poles and wires "and all appurtenances thereof" on the streets and leys of the village of Strang in such locations as would not interfere ivith the public use of the streets and any such further reasonable re - quirements as might be directed by the village board. Maximum rates ■vere named and the company guaranteed twenty-four hour continuous service. A prior ordinance, No. 38, enacted in 1897, gave a franchise to the Nebraska Telephone company. Its terms are unknown as it was t presented in evidence. We discover nothing in the ordinance that luire.- the operation of a separate exchange at Strang. Applicant ;s not propose to cease furnishing telephone service and does propose continue to use the streets and alleys for "poles and wires and all appurtenances thereof". Respondents allege this is the only valid franchise ordinance, which contention applicant challenges and alleges that it bought the franchise and property of the Nebraska Telephone company, the first occupant. We do not need base our conclusion that counsel for respondents as quite wrong in his contention concerning the binding effect of the anchise upon the expressed terms of the franchise. The ordinance is not etfec:ive against the superior power of the state, asserted in 1907. Kate and service contracts between common carriers and municipalities, or between common carriers and persons, are made subject to the power of the state to amend or alter inasmuch as the state did not surrender its police power of regulation of common carriers to municipalities to ouch a degree that it cannot recall the delegated power. </seg>

At the time the franchises were given the village of Strang the state was permitting- the regulation of rate? and service of telephone com - panies by municipalities, but by amendment to the constitution in 19OS it was definitely decided that the state would exercise that prerogative itself. The franchise terms under consideration were made subject to the known right of the state to assert its prerogative at any time. k Under the above rule of law the Commission, in 1913, authoriied an rease in rates at Strang, at the time of the consolidation, above the ximum amount provided in the ordinance. We know of no rule in support of the contention that a vested rig insures to the users of telephone service which can be insisted up&lt; where the expense of the service is not paid by those using it. We i not have the benefit of the arguiv.ent of counsel who advanced tl^ principle. There were at the time of consolidation in 1913 58 subscrifc nected to the property owned by applicant and 50 switched sul connected with four mutual organizations. Of the 58 stat.it mentioned IT were duplicates which were lost in the consolidat slow slipping away of the territory, in addition to the elimin the duplicates, is shown by the fact that en January 1, 1917, thi 35 town subscribers and on October 31, 1921. only 25. Some ■it &gt; Es was due to dwindling in the size of'the town, but app it, so far as the village itself was concerned, was due julation and new-comers not desiring telephone service. a In a previous order entered in 1918 the Commissioi revenues for 1914 at $1,300 and figured that from this revenue the ompany would not earn any return on rts investment unless condition.-, mproved. It was believed then that conditions would improve. The ata shown above indicated that the contrary has taken place. Total revenues for ten months of H&gt;21 were $865, or at the rate of $1,03* &gt;er annum. The expenses have, however, jumped sharply at this ace, as well as at all other telephone exchanges in Nebraska and in 1 other business of which we have knowledge. The increasing ex - penses going parallel with decreasing revenues finally resulted in the (roblem before us. We are not willing to accept the exhibit of the company as to the loss at Strang without stating that it contains many allocations of ex - penses not directly incurred at Strang, but an allocated part of the maintenance of the general offices at Lincoln, district offices at Hast - ings, and the local manager who oversees the plant. It might be that </seg>

If the subscribers at Strang can be tt[ in such manner as will result in economies we have the power require continued service of some kind, provided the service is com - nsatory. It may be, as respondents say, that costs will greatly re- oce. We see no possibility of their reducing sufficiently to provide a iir result from operating under the present arrangement.

Not less than three circuits shall be used in supplying ivice to the subscribers at Strang provided the maximum number now kins- service continues. We have always recognized the very great desirability of the fur - ishing of telephone service, with due regard to trade territory. The i (ibleni of the adjustment of telephone service at Strang is complicated f the independently owned switching lines which occupy most of the ;sde territory of Strang. These switched lines are entitled to seek oritrj'.ctual relations with exchange companies where they please. It vould. however, be unfortunate for the village of Strang if the switched ines at Strang' hereafter connect themselves to exchanges which do not uive free and unlimited service to the merchants of Strang. At the inie of the hearing- it did not appear that the business interests of Jtrang comprehended that this problem was as much their problem as hat of the telephone company. The limits of our jurisdiction in solving this particular problem ad - antageously to the town of Strang are narrow.

We will expect applicant to seek conference with the officers of the switched companies in an endeavor to reach a satisfactory conclusion. If no such conclusion can be reached a committee repre - senting the switched lines and officers of applicant company should meet for an informal conference with the Commission. The rates for service to the company's own Strang subscribers will be the rates published at Geneva for the same classes of service. If the switched lines take services at Geneva their rate will be the switch - ing rate at Geneva plus any contractual obligations entered into for the purpose of leading their lines to the city limits of Geneva. Service to Strang subscribers will, of course, include all the territory reached with - out message charge by subscribers on the Geneva exchange.

OPINION AND FINDING Cook, Commissioner The Northeastern Telephone company, with headquarters at Walt - hill, Nebraska, serves about four hundred subscribers and maintains three small exchanges, Walthill, Winnebago and Rosalie. Its territory is circumscribed, the Missouri river being on the east and agricultural country on the west and immediately around the villages being occupied principally by tenant farmers and Indians. Very few roads have been </seg>
            <seg id="p341">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 341 constructed in this part of the county. The country is hilly and rugged in a portion of the territory occupied by the rural lines which necessarily makes it expensive to maintain them. Although there are only about four hundred subscribers using the telephones of the applicant it main - tains three exchanges. This results in high operating costs per station »erved. The con-.pany commenced business in this territory and the villages named about fifteen years ago. Its lines were not substantially con - structed originally and during all of its life it has been managed by a non-resident owner, which made it quite impossible to give proper supervision. The results of this operation during a major portion of its existence have been inadequate and unsatisfactory to the subscribers generally. Many complaints have been filed during the later years with the Commission. Several hearings and investigations were had, the manager pleading lack of funds and ill-health and it seemed almost impossible to get results satisfactory to the subscribers. During the trear 1921 E. C". Hunt, an experienced telephone man, acquired the pro - jerty and signified his intention of rebuilding the different exchanges, well as the rural lines, provided adequate rates for service would be mteil. After operating the property for a few months, in order to iecome acquainted with the conditions and its financial needs, the ire.-ent owner trade application to the Commission for a small advance jplv only to business and residence stations, as follows; Present Increased rate rate (net) ..$2.00 $3.00 Busines Residence private line Residence party 1.25 1.75 1.00 1.50 150 1.50 Farm rate to remain as now. Switching per month ..-,() It is u.sked that ten cents be added to the switching charge and twenty-five cents to each of the other charges if payment is not made before the tenth of the month. On this application a hearing was held at Walthill, Nebraska, on February S, 1922, which was attended by many of the subscribers from the different towns, the town boards of the villages participating. Mr. Hunt, representing his company, admitted in evidence at this hearing that the physical condition of the exchanges and rural lines was very low and not such as is necessary to insure satisfactory service and that it would require the rebuilding of the exchanges and additions and betterments to the amount of $10,000 to place the plant in good con - dition. Mr. Hunt assured the Commission that he was willing to make the improvements if the rates applied for were granted. He testified that the rates now being collected by the several exchanges are not sufficient to pay the operating expenses and provide for interest and lividends on the amount now represented in the plant. The following </seg>

There were no objections in testimony by the subscribers or the village Officers interested against the proposed increases in rates as re - quested by applicant, but to the contrary many of the subscribers and villag-e officers testified that they were not so much concerned as to what the rates should be if they represented a fair price for the service received. They also expressed a desire to cooperate with Manacer Hunt in his effort to bring the physical condition of the exchange up to a standard that would insure dependable telephone service and ex - pressed a willingness to have the rates increased if such increase would insure proper service.

By the Commission: This matter came on to be heard on the application of the village Naponee for authority to constnict, operate and maintain a new ransmission line from the village of Naponee to Franklin in Franklin canty. Nebraska. The proposed transmission line will be operated as three phase, alternating current circuit, having a potential of approxi - utely 6600 volts between wires. The line will connect with a gener- nl at Franklin, Nebraska, anil transmit *electric energy to Na^ 1 by the residents of the village for light and power purpose The applicant tiled a map with the application, showing the location of the proposed line and specifications describing the manner of con - struction. At the hearing the applicant filed an amended map showing that the proposed transmission line will be constructed on the west and north sides of section 35, township 1 north, range 16 west' sixth P.

The Bloomington Telephone company objected to the proposed con - struction for the reason that the service on the lines of this company which will be involved in parallel by the proposed construction might be affected by reason of" inductive interference. The decree of impair - ment of the telephone service on these lines by reason of this construc - tion is not clear. In fact, the Commission is not entirely satisfied that the interference, if any, will be appreciable. Therefore, the Commi.- - sion Will authorize the construction of the transmission line and retain jurisdiction of the issues involved -&lt;&gt; that in the event that interference with the operation of the telephone lines of the Bloomington Telep company, caused by the construction of the transmission line, comp can be iraile to the Commission and a hearing had as tc the el nature and amount of the interference and the proper rerr termined.

Commissioner llage boards of Maxwell and Brady, Nebraska, on December •;. 1921, made formal application to the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission for authority to construct a 13,200 volt electric transmission line from North Platte to the villages of Maxwell ami Brady, designating the route for said line upon anil over the Lincoln Highway, which highway parallels the rails of the Union Pacific Railroad company, respondent herein, and is maintained upon and over the right-of-way of said com - pany a major portion of the distance between the villages. After due notice to interested parties a public investigation and hearing were held in the offices of the Commission January 3, 1922, applicant being re - presented by counsel, as was also the respondent. The evidence and plats show the distance between North Platte and the village of Brady to be about twenty-five miles over the Lincoln </seg>
            <seg id="p348">348 Highway. About twenty-two miles of this distance is immediately adjacent and parallel to the railway of respondent, which is double track with heavy leads of telegraph, telephone and signal wires maintained along and over its right-of-way on both sides of the tracks. The Lin - coln Highway, as herein described, offers the short line for the purposes sought and would be the most convenient route for the transmission line to follow between the villages. The only question, then, that con - fronts the Commission under the application is the matter of inductive interference that might arise should the transmission line be located and maintained as prayed for, about sixty-six feet distant from the wires of respondent between North Platte and Maxwell for a distance of nine miles, and one hundred twenty-eight feet from the signal wires of respondent between the villages of Maxwell and Brady for a distance at about twelve miles. The only evidence supporting the use cf the route as prayed for over the Lincoln Highway was given by Witness H. H. Henningsen. consulting engineer, Omaha, Nebraska. Mr. Henningsen discussed the theory of inductive interference as set up by high voltage transmission lines upon adjacent telegraph, telephone and signal lines and gave it as his opinion that if the proposed transmission line were properly con - structed and maintained as prayed for along the Lincoln Highway, paralleling the rails of the respondent company with a clearance of sixty-six feet between respondent's telegraph and telephone wires aim the transmission lino, and one hundred twenty-eight feet clearance be - tween the signal lines and the trasmission line, there would be no hazard from inductive interferpnce. Mr. Henningsen testified as follows: "Q— You do recognize. Mr. Henningsen. tl a thing as inductive interference, don't you ? A — Yes. sir, there is. Q — And that the hazard of inductive interference m lessened by increasing the separation between the two li A— Yes, sir. Q — And you will agree, won't you, that u power transmi - sion line located 500 feet from other communicating lines u null present less hazard of inductive interference than those locate. sixty or seventy feet, as you propo.-ed to locate your line? A — Yes, afar. Q — In your proposition to deposit $2,500 with the Commis - sion you said nothing about the Western (Jniao and Union 1'acific Telegraph lines. Did you purposely omit them from your proposition? A — I did, for this reason, — I do not know what the actioi is of the telegraph line. Q — You are willing to gamble $2,500 that you won't inter - fere with the telephone or signal wires but you won't bet that you won't interfere with the telegraph lines A — I never have had any experience in regard to paralleling telegraph wires, with perhaps one exception, and that is a Iran - mission line from Sioux City to Jefferson, South Dakota. ! never have heard of any complaint there. I have never given (Transcript pp. 95-96* </seg>
            <seg id="p349">349 t any thought to telegraph systems because I know nothing about the sensitiveness of telegraph instruments. Q — Your judgment is that there would be in all probability an inductive interference of telegraph lines because of the fact that they are grounded ? A — Yes. sir. Q — And that hazard could be avoided by moving your trans - mission line a sufficient distance away from the telegraph line? -\ — That is correct." The respondent supports its contention against the use of the route applied for by introducing testimony of several witnesses, contend - tliat to locate and maintain a 13,200 voltage transmission line, alleling its rails along said highway, would seriously interfere with proper operation of its telegraph, telephone and signal wires. Mr. H. McKeen, signal engineer of the Union Pacific system, gave it as opinion that a transmission line such as prayed for should be located east live hundred feet from the wires of respondent's line in order to -.mate interference. He cited two or three specific cases where high -ion fines were located less than one hundred feet from wires con - ling signals on respondent's lines where interference had changed workings of the blocks sufficiently to give a reverse signal from the intended and that conditions of this kind brought about a very ou.s hazard to life and property. The witness was very insistent to grant the prayer of applicant for a right-of-way along the Lin- Highway, as indicated, for a transmission iine of high voltage would ite a condition upon respondent's wires that would make operating litions unsafe and unreliable. Witness McKeen, on direct exami - on. testified as follows: (Transcript pp. 49-50) "A — The higher the voltage of course the greater the lia - bility oi' induction troubles in any communicating circuit. Q — It would span a wider distance in parallel, would it? A— Yes, sir i — How do you account then that they group all electric .eriry into that 500 fool space if it is less than oO.OOO volts ure ? A — Woll. their table specifying feet takes a range of from .000 volts up to 50,000. then they step up — below 50.000 to '5,000 volts, 750 feet; 75,000 to 100,000 volts 850 feet; 100,000 to 150.000, 1.000 feet; 150,000 to 200 000, 1.200 feet. Q — That would eliminate all interference .' A— Yes, sir &lt;) — As an electrical engineer do you think the instance away in parallel is the only consideration ? Does the distance of parallel affect it? A — No, those distances are fixed, as I see it, as a sale range where there would be no appreciable effect on communicating circuits. Of course there would be under certain conditions where unbalance would come on or during .-torms or things of that kind, 1 presume. Q — Would you have more danger of inductive interference in a fifteen mile parallel than in a half mile parallel, all other conditions being the same? </seg>
            <seg id="p350">350 A — Yes, sir, very materially so. Q — They have eliminated that from their report. I presume? A — The distance— parallels are of course cummulative. One in itself for a short distance might not have any harmful effect, but we are forced to meet the conditions nowadays where power lines are being built throughout the country and each added mile of course adds to our troubles, the chances of interference. Witness John Hilbert. telegraph and telephone engineer for res - pondent, testified that they had experienced numerous cases where their entire telegraph and telephone lines had been out of service for as much as one-half hour at a time, due to inductive interference. (Transcript p. 53&gt;. He cited the instance of a high tension transmission line which parallels respondent's railway between Chapman and Central City under conditions similar to those that would prevail here if the transmission line were built where many instances of interference resulted. Witness testified at length as to similar conditions on respondent's line, both in Nebraska and other states, where interference was apparent. Mr. Frenzer, superintendent of telegraph, testified at length and was very positive as to the hazard which would apply were the applicant allowed to maintain the high tension transmission line paralleling respondent's line with less than five hundred feet clearance. Several other witnesses testified at length corroborating the evidence given by Engineers Mr- Keen and Hilbert, that power lines of 13,200 volts should clear the wires of respondent company at least five hundred feet in order to permit ac- curate service. It was quite clear to the writer of this opinion that there was merit enough in the respondent's contention to call for a Very careful consideration of the situation before granting the prayer of ap - plicant: so much so that it led to a personal investigation of the situation by going over the ground and making a close inspection of respondent's wire lines as to their location between North Platte and Brady. This investigation, together with the preponderance of the evidence a.- to interference, led the Commission to the conclusion that it would be wise to seek some other route on which to loe.'ite the transmisison line. If an alternative route can be secured and the application amended the Commission will give it prompt consideration. The respondent's lines are serving very important functions in the control of trains and in the transmission of important transcontinental messages and should not be interfered with by the building of high tension lines within a distance that would create interference. It is the judgment of the Commission that the distance as indicated for the line in question would not be suf - ficient to insure safety at all times for the working of respondent's wires, and that the prayer of the applicant should be dismissed.

Curtiss, Secretary ' SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4669 la the Matter of the Application of the Hehron Light &amp; Power Company for Authority to issue and sell its common stock in the amount of $80,000 par value and bonds in the amount of $25 000 peaiance-: For the applicant, Thomas H Carter, Director; Walter C. Weiss, attorney. By the Commission: The petitioner herein, the Hebron Light ami Power Company, is a ■poiation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of Nebraska. It has applied to this Commission for authority to issue its I'ifiimon capital stock in the sum of $80,000 par value and bonds in the am of $25,000. Applicant owns a hydro-electric generating plant and louring mill. It is engaged in the generation, transmission and sale of electric energy to the public and the operation of the mill. The mill received its supply of power from the generating plant owned by the company; The development of this enterprise began in the year 1873, with construction of a dam and mill at Hebron, Nebraska. The dam was imber structure and the old part of the mill was a substantial stone ucture equipped for a 40-barrel capacity. Frame additions to the ill building were made and equipment added from time to time until .&lt;- present structure with its equipment has a capacity of 150 barrel -i day. In 1920 and 1921 the timber dam was replaced by a concrete ■ ucture and hydro-electric generating machinery was installed with a capacity sufficient to utilize the average flow of the river at this point. The company is now supplying the city of Hebron with electric energy addition to the requirements of the mill. The company was incorporated on the 3rd day of May, 1921. The articles were later amended to provide, among other things, for 850 shares of common stock with the par value of $100 each, 150 shares of preferred stock of the same denomination and bonds as they may be authorized by the board of directors when required for the purposes of the corporation. i </seg>
            <seg id="p352">352 KThis matter came on to be heard at the offices of the Commission e 12, 1922. The applicant submitted an inventory of its property which was identified and explained by Mr. Carter, who prepared it and who has been connected with the operation of the enterprise since 1892. The real estate was included at its market value, the dam and generat - ing machinery at actual cost in 1920 and 1921. The dH building was estimated at its cost new as of the time of the inventory less depre - ciation. The original cost of the stone part of the mill building was much greater than the estimate for the reason that it was constructed before Hebron had railroad transportation and the materials were hauled for a considerable distance at a large expense. The mill equip - ment was included at its market or re-sale value. Other items such as tools and supplies were included at their present market value. Mr. Carter testified as to certain omissions in the estimate of the mill build - ing and certain items of cost which had not been included in the cost of the generating machinery. The Commission believes and so finds that the sums set out in the inventory for the fixed property, tools and equipment were reasonable and should be allowed with the exception of the mill building which was included in the inventory at 90 r i of its estimated cost new. The main part of this building was constructed about fifty years ago and the frame additions were erected at later dates and while this has the effect of reducing the average age of the structure, the Commission believe- I lat 70 # of the cost new of this building, or $11,207, is a reasonable ance for this item. Supplies in the sum of $2,000 were included in the schedule with the mill. The record shows that this amount was duplicated in the sum estimated for working capital. $1,053 for supplies in connection with the power plant was included with the schedule for the dam and gener - ating machinery. This amount was also repeated in the allowance for working capital in the sum of $1,500. Therefore the Commission will deduct the sum of these items, or $3,500, from the applicant's estim&amp;re,! requirements for working capital and will allow $10,000 as a reasonable sum to provide for the ordinary operations of the company. This is done by the Commission with knowledge of the fact that the allowance for working capital in the instant case constitutes a larger percentage of the applicant's property than it has been customary for the Com - mission to use, but it is done having in mind the fact that the applicant will require a larger sum for this purpose than the ordinary public utility on account of the operation of the flouring mill wherein it is necessai-y to buy supplies at periods of low prices and hold them in storage for a time when they are converted into a saleable product. The Commission will require that one hundred shares of the common stock authorized in this order shall be ?old for cash or quick assets or </seg>
            <seg id="p353">353 Having these changes in mind, the assets of the company, including fixed properly, tools and vehicles and working capital, will be as follows: $74,385.00 Applicant's estimate of 10% for general expenditures such as legal anil organization expense, interest during construction, taxes, engineer - ing, supervision, etc., will be accepted and applied to the total of the above items, with the exception of real estate and working capital, or §6,258. This results in a total for the fixed property, including work - ing capital and general expenditures of $80,643.00. Applicant has included in the statement of its property the sum of $10,000 for going concern value. This is intended to cover the value of the contract which the company has with the city of Hebron to fur - nish all the electric current required by the city for a period of ten years. Applicant has also included the dam site at a value of $32,000 and the water right estimated at a much larger sum. The Commission believes that the contract is a measure of the market for the power generated by the use of the dam site and water right. In any event these items are closely related as to value and raise the question of the power of the Commission to authorize the issuance of capital where a franchise may be involved. Therefore the Commission will not pass these items at this time for the reason that our supreme court now has :i similar matter pending before it on appeal. When the Commis - sion has been informed by the Court as to the law in such matters, the Commission will dispose of these items in a supplementary order. The testimony shows that the mill has been operated at a profit for a long period of years, although a clear record of its revenues and ex - penses was not submitted. The testimony shows also that the applicant has received during ?. period of three or four months of operation a net revenue from the city of Hebron in the amount of approximately $1,000.00 per month. It is estimated that this sum will be increased through the development of the use of electricity in this locality. Direct operating expenses of the mill and hydro-electric plant which are jointly operated :ire now approximately $400 per month.

Appearances: For applicant, Eben I). Warner, president; Carl Smith, auilitor; Edgar M. Morsman, attorney. For respondents, none. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: Applicant desires authority, under section 758, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913. to issue and sell one thousand shares of its common stock, par value $100 per share, for the following purposes: &lt;a&gt; To purchase, at par. S25.000 of stock of the Wehn Telephone company, being the total outstanding stock. (b) To retire outstanding indebtedness of the Wehn Telephone company, consisting of notes payable, in amount $44,488.70. (c» To use {he remaining proceeds, in amount $30,511.30. for re - tiring indebtedness of applicant company, or for additions and better - ments. A resolution of the board of directors of applicant company, dated April 15, 1922. states that the outstanding indebtedness of the Wehn Telephone company is held by Eben D. Warner, in amount $33,000, and by W. H. Ostesberg, Sr., in amount $8,678. These two note-holders are the majority stockholders of both applicant company and of the Wehn Telephone company. It is desired, also, to capitalize accrued. interest on the notes, in amount S2.810, by exchanging stock of applicant company for it. The Platte Valley Telephone company had, on December 31, 1921, capita! stock outstanding in amount $250,000. It had also six per cent twenty year bonds, due in 1936', in amount $100,000. Its secured and unsecured bills payable amounted to $65,949. As of December 31, 1921, the Wehn Telephone company had out - standing common stock $25,000, notes payable $49,178, accounts payable $5,944, and accrued liabilities not due $3,183. On the same date the gross assets are shown as $72,095. On April 15, 1922, the stockholders of the Wehn Telephone company voted to sell the property to the Platte Valley Telephone company, the latter to assume all liabilities anil obligations of the former, and to issue stock of the Platte Valley Telephone company dollar for dollar for the stock of the Wehn Telephone company. On the same date the </seg>
            <seg id="p356">356 stockholders of the Platte Valley Telephone company voted to purchase the property of the Wehn Telephone company on the following terms: ki a &gt; To retire the stock of the Wehn Telephone company by issuing » stockholders, dollar for dollar, the stock of the Platte Valley Tele - e company. §(b&gt; To issue $44,488.70 of the capital stock of the Platte Valley ;phone company in payment of note indebtedness of the Wehn Tele - ne company, and accrued interest to April 30, 1922. t c &gt; To assume all other debts and obligations of the Wehn Tele phone company. The Wehn Telephone company owns properties consisting of ex - chancres at Broadwater. Lisco, Lewellen and Oshkosh, and toll pro - perties extending from Broadwater to Ogallala. The history of the company is sot forth in our order on Application No. 4085. After the property was purchased by Eben D. Warner in the fall of 1919, for a consideration of $8,000. and the assumption of bank indebtedness of $15,000. an extensive rebuilding- program was undertaken. Oshkosh was made comn-on battery. All other exchanges, including f:irm lines, were made metallic magneto anil the entire town distribution properties were made aerial cable. The Wehn company set up it- property ac - count, after the purchase in 1919, on a basis of Plant S40.836 This was of date June 1, 1919. On December 1, 1921, the fixed invest - ment showed as $63,622 and material and supplies $4,180. It thus appear- that there has, since the purchase, been an increase in fixed investment and material and supplies, according to the books, of $27,800. As before stated, the capital obligations, at the time of purchase, were $40,000, consisting of stock and notes payable. At the close of business in 1921 these accounts had increased to $69,178, and there was additional to that floating accounts of approximately $6,000 and accrued liabilities, not due, of ?3,200 additional. I Our accountants have checked the accounting of the company from i time the present owners set the property upon the books to the close business in 1921 and find that in the main accounts have been ac - rately kept under the rules of the Interstate Commerce Commission, me discrepancies were found to exist. These have been corrected in part am! the uncorrected portions are, according to the Commission's accountants, of not large importance. In so far as the increase in in - debtedness of the company has exceeded the gross additions to the plant it may be explained by the fact that the last two years saw a very ex - tensive reconstruction program, with demands on depreciation reserve largely exceeding the current accrual of reserve funds. In the original property setup by the present owners of the Wehn company practically Material ami supplies 1.162 </seg>
            <seg id="p357">357 no consideration was given to accrued depreciation, due to wear and tear, obsolescence, and inadequacy. The heavy reconstruction program, almost immediately undertaken, indicated that these factors existed in large extent in the property. We are not considering in this instance the consolidation of two competing- companies where, under the provisions of the constitution, it is necessary to secure the consent of this Commission prior to the consolidation. It is a consolidation of non-competing properties. The stockholders of the selling company are the stockholders of the pur - chasing company to almost the exact extent of holdings by each stock- holder. Under the stocks and bonds act it is necessary for us to approve issots of stocks and bends of Nebraska public utilities before they may &gt;e made. The Commission is directed by law to make a finding as to a -nether in its opinion "the use of the capital to be secured by the issue of such stock, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness is reason - ably required for the said purposes of the corporation", viz.: for the "acquisition of property,_ the construction, completion, extension or im - provement of facilities, or for the improvement or maintenance of its -ei vice or for the discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations". The purchase by applicant has already been made, although not completed. The proposed issue of stock is for the acquisition of pro - perty. Our iluty is tc pass on whether the proposed issue is •'reason - ai&gt;ly required for the said purposes of the corporation." On the face of the agreement of purchase it appears that applicant agrees to pay $83,000 for the property by 'a) Buying stock or exchanging stock with creditors in liquidation ilebts in amount $69,489. (b&gt; By assuming other obligations in amount $13,816. As of December 31 last the books show $6,472 of quick assets. Hence, for the fixed investment the applicant company is agreeing 10 $7&amp;833. The gross book value of the fixed property as of Decem- bei 31 was $65,622. In the liabilities statement accrued and unearned ilividends are listed as indebtedness of the company and the assumption is that by the terms of purchase applicant agrees to assume the unpaid dividends as an obligation and as a part of the purchase price. Un - earned dividends are not an obligation following the property. In lt*20 the company failed to earn its fixed charges by $2,970 and in 1921 by $5,409. Together with unpaid dividends these items are carried in notes and accounts payable. It is proposed to capitalize part of these unearned fixed charges. The present stockholders of the Wehn Telephone company paid $23,000 for property which an engineering firm shortly before that had </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 said was worth §32,335. This sum was arrived at by an inventory on the ground and by the application of reproduction prices as of 1916, and in some instances five year pre-war average prices, and also by theoreti - cal loadings for various factors, including length of haul of materials due to absence of a railroad at the time some of the construction was made. The Commission's engineers, using the same quantities and using 1916 prices, together with overhead expenses, but refusing to consider the absence of a railroad because the railroad had been built before most of the property was constructed, found a value which, de - preciated by exactly the same percentage used by the engineering com - pany, was $25,432. Whatever this property was actually worth at the time of purchase it was put on the books by the purchasers at $41,998. It is claimed that this is the value on which the company is entitled to earn and for which it might reasonably capitalize. The theory ad - vanced is that $40,000 was invested in the company, that no depreciation reserve was earned, and that the public owes to the company this value of property. We cannot agree with these contentions. There i.- no proof that the property cost the amount stated, but in fact there is some proof to the contrary. If the company failed to earn its depreciation reserve, and this is only an assumption, it was not the fault of public regulation as only one application «as made by the original owners for an increase in rate? and that was withdrawn. The Wehn Telephone company at this time has very extensive ad - vance construction. It has a common battery plant at Oshkosh, serv - ing 150 subscribers, wkh a capacity of approximately three times that number. There is much advance construction at other exchanges. This work was done at peak prices. While largely increasing the capacity of the plant at abnormal costs the company has been facet! with steadily decreasing patronage in the period of depression. According to the records and file? of the Commission it had on May 1, 1920, 328 sub - scribers, on December 31, 1920, 286 subscribers, and on December 31, 1921. 241 subscribers. The results of diminishing patronage and in - creasing plant, together with the assumed value of $42,000 at the time of purchase, show in a very high per station investment. The follow - ing comparisons will illustrate: Comparative Per Station Investment Total above accounts Total fixed investment _ .$183.37 $123.18 $138.94 -$271.40 $134.70 $153.00 * Includes $4.00 per station for property owned by licensor.

The company complained in testimony that the rates being charged it are too low and that in justice it should be allowed to increase the rates of the Wehn Telephone company. In authorizing a heavy ad - vance in rates of the latter company in 1920 the Commission said: "No rates which the traffic will bear on present development warrants the expenditures undertaken. The pr&lt; sent owners are well aware of this and are basing the investment wholly on their confidence in the rapid development of the valley and adjacent table-lands as irrigation and wheat growing territory. "I hey are Kood telephone men and are able to render high class servico. Whether they can continue to do so will depend en the accuracy of their judgment that the country will develop with considerable rapidity. The immediate situation is that they cannot he e for a proper return on their investment." The territory has not developed. The construction costs were con- siderably over the estimates at the time the above quotation was made. Subscribers have decreased in number. There is much idle plant. We ilc not say that the present rates are all that they should be, but it does appear that what the company now needs most is more subscribers. The law does not presume to prevent the consolidation of properties or this character and location. However, the public has an interest in the extent of securities issued by one public utility in the purchase of additional property. The stocks and bonds act contemplates that the state may reasonably scrutinize the purchase price and the securities to be sold to secure that purchase price; otherwise there would be little no use for the act in question. It must be assumed from the facts set forth in this finding that no such liberal purchase terms would have been made, as they are set forth in the resolution of April 15. 1922, had not the board of directors of the purchasing company been making the purchase fiom themselves as board of directors of the selling company. The subscribers of the Platte Valley Telephone company have a direct interest in the proposed consolidation which must not be over - looked. That company is now paying its way. The rates are earning a fair return at least on the outstanding obligations. If additional properties of considerable extent are added from adjacent territory, and these properties are not able to earn their way because of local condi - tions and the nature of the property, it follows that the consolidation would add a burden to the subscribers of the purchasing company in the upper valley. Rates are not based on outstanding securities, but those </seg>
            <seg id="p360">360 securities count as one of the factors in success or failure of public utility operation. There is the same objection to issues of securities for improvident purchases as for issues of securities when no considera - tion is received. The difference is only one of degree. Applicant wants to issue stock to liquidate certain unearned fixed charges of the company whose property is being purchased. Those fixed charges run against revenues and, if the revenues for the pay - ment of fixed charges have not been diverted to construction, cannot be capitalized. They continue a liability against the future revenues of the property in question. We so hold in this instance and must dis - allow that portion of the application. There is some dispute between the engineers as to the value of the property at the time it was purchased by the present owners. We are forced to the conclusion that if, as claimed by applicant, there was a real bargain in the purchase in 1919 for $23,000 that bargain has disap - ered in the rapid retirements of the purchased property, considerable t at junk prices. We find and so hold that the Platte Valley Telephone company may reasonably issue stock, dollar for dollar, in exchange for the actual cost of the properties of the Wehn Telephone company to the present owners. In the absence of any testimony on the point to the contrary we find that this is represented as follows: Paid to J. H. Wehn in 1919- &gt;.ooo Bank indebtedness of Wehn Telephone Co. assumed by purchaser in 1919 _ Construction funds loaned by E. I). Warner, now CO by note, total ?33,000 &lt;«!5.000 plus $18,000 Loans by W. H. Ostenberg, Si\, covered by uotp ti Total cost to present owners i i;,,s among the liabilities of the Wehn Telephone company as listed mber 31, 1921, there are other notes and bills payable, representing construction only, we will, upon showing in writing in proof of that fact, amend this order by authorizing additional securities. However, the indebtedness of the Wehn Telephone company representing unpaid fixed charges must be carried by the purchasers as obligations against the future revenue.- of the purchased properties. No obligation shall be considered as existing against the purchasers for unpaid dividend?. I In finding that securities may reasonably be issued in amount equal actual cost to present owners of a public utility property, even though the property holds out no immediate hope for a fair return from that cost, we are not to be understood as holding that in a rate case un - reasonable advance construction may not be discounted in arriving at a DroDer rate base AVe do not decidp thst noint </seg>
            <seg id="p361">361 The rejuvenation of the territory served by the purchased properties will remove much, if not all, of the objections to the purchase. It is a risk the purchasers are taking. No one can say at this time as to the future conditions of the valley other than that they will probably im- prove. The necessities heretofore mentioned of protecting the rate payers &gt;f the upper valley against a burden imposed upon them by the pur - hmm of the properties of the lower valley require that the purchasing: applicant company shall keep the books of the purchased property se - parate until such time as existing fixed charges shall have been liqui - dated and the properties shall have been placed upon a six per cent earning basis. Upon showing to the Commission that this goal has been reached we will authorize the consolidation of the accounts. The constitution requires that public notice for sixty days shall be given of contemplated increases in securities issues. Such notice was given by applicant company although in an amount differing from the present application. This difference was due to change in plan. There is probably technical non-compliance with the requirements of the law but since no protests have been lodged we will not consider it a bar to issuance of the order at this time. Applicant desires also to issue and sell $30,500 of stock for the up use of liquidating bills payable which stand as liabilities against its existing; property. These bills payable totaled $65,949 on December :fl la.-t. of which approximately $20,000 are in short-time and demand notes held by stockholders. This portion of the application appears reasonable. We will authorize the issue of stock, to be exchanged dollar for dollar for any existing indebtedness accrued by applicant prior to this order, or to be held in the treasury and sold from time to time as opportunity affords for the purpose of securing funds for ad - litions and betterments. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Platte Valley Telephone company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and dispose of common stock for the following purposes: (a» Fifty thousand dollars to be exchanged for all the stock of the Wehn Telephone company and short-term notes held by Eben D. Warner, in amount $33,000, and by W. H. Ostenberg, Sr., in amount *8,678.

OPINION AND FINDING Cook, Commissioner: This matter comes up for adjustment on application of the Antelope County Mutual Telephone company of Elgin, Nebraska, which company i.- &gt;eeking to apply a rate of fifty cents per month for the switching service extended to fifty-seven rural subscribers of the Oakdale Tele - phone company of Oakdale, Nebraska. The companies will hereafter be referred to in this finding as the Elgin company and the Oakdale company. The fifty-seven subscribers in question are located on rural lines of the Oakdale company near and adjacent to the exchange of Elgin. Naturally the subscribers of the Oakdale company, comprising this group, do the major portion of their business dealings in the village of Elgin. A mutual arrangement and agreement between the Elgin com - pany and the Oakdale company, by which this group of subscribers can call in on the Elgin exchange and the Elgin company's subscribers can call out to this group of subscribers, have been in existence for several years, the Oakdale company paying the Elgin company ?100 per year in consideration for the switching work in connection therewith. </seg>
            <seg id="p364">364 Upon the urgent application of the Elgin company for the privilege of charging a rate of fifty cents per month for the switching of the fifty-seven Oakdale subscribers, who enjoy the partial use of the Elgin exchange, the Commission made an investigation and heard the interest - ed parties at Elgin, Nebraska, on March 17, 1922. The Elgin com - pany based its justification for its claim on a previous finding of this Commission, made by Commissioner Taylor after a hearing on December 3, 1919, for an increase of rates to be charged by applicant company, which finding reads in part as follows: "The (Elgin! company has in effect a rate for switching farm lines of fifty cents per month. We find, however, that it has different rate in effect for two farm line companies for which it furnishes service. * * * * * In the opinion of the Commission, the practice the company has followed of charging 'he subscriber.-- of these two companies a less rate than it charges to other sub - scribers, results in discrimination and should be discontinued hy in- creasing the rates to these two companies to the regular basis fifty cents per month." The evidence did not disclose a real need for additional revenue for the Elgin company. The financial showing of the Elgin company indi - cated that under the rates now being charged for all classes of service =ufTic : e;it revenue was produced for the maintenance of the company and for proper dividends. The Elgin company based its claim for a rate of fifty cents per month, to apply to the fifty-seven rural subscribers of the Oakilale coirpany, clearly upon the order referred to above and not upon its financial needs. Officers of the Oakdale company stated in evidence that they were at all times ready and willing to perform all of the switching service for the fifty-seven rural subscribers in question through its exchange at Oakdale; that they would run an ad - ditional wire from their exchange to this neighborhood in order to in - sure quick anil dependable service, if found necessary. There now ex - ists a mutual agreement by which free service is maintained between .subscribers of the two companies and between the exchanges of Elgin and Oakdale. This free service extends to the fifty-seven subscribers Die privilege of going onto the switchboard of the Elgin company "ugh the Oakdale exchange. The arrangement would perhaps slow the connections somewhat of the fifty-seven subscribers reaching we Elgin exchange, but would not prevent them from enjoying this added connection. It seem&lt; clear to the Commission that on account of the switching work required for the fifty-seven Oakdale company subscribers, done partly by the Elgin company and partly by the Oakdale company, that the arrangement now existing between the companies is not placing any undue hardship or unjust charge upon other subscribers of either com - pany. As the applicant renders only a part of the switching service required by the fifty-seven subscriber!? it cannot expect to receive the full rate of fifty cents charged other switched subscribers; it is a ques- </seg>
            <seg id="p365">365 -don of what part of the regular charge of fifty cents should be assessed. The Oakdale company is able, by careful management, to furnish its subscribers service at a rate much below the average rate charged by companies of like size. Its officers testified that they are able and willing to perform all of the switching service for their subscribers at their Oakdale exchange. The Commission will not order an additional charge for the direct Elgin connection when the way is open for thia connection through their own exchange. We are, however, agreeable to the present mutual arrangment whereby the Elgin company may switch the fifty-seven subscribers of the Oakdale company when they desire connection with subscribers of the Elgin company in the village of Elgin. If, however, the two companies in interest are not able by mutual agreement to continue the direct connection which has long been eiven the fifty-seven subscribers of the Oakdale company with the Elgin exchange, the said subscribers may make application to this mmission for a rate justifying the continuance of a direct connection ith the Elgin exchange. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway . orrrmi.ssion that the application of the Antelope County Mutual Tele - phone company for the privilege of charging a switching rate of fifty Bests per month to apply to fifty-seven subscribers of the Oakdale Telephone company, be, and the same is, hereby denied.

            <seg id="p366">366 OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Chairman In this application the Union Pacific Railroad company seek^ author - ity to discontinue its motor trains Nos. 509 and 510, between Genoa and Spalding. and its steam trains Nos. 23 and 24, between Council Bluffs and Albion, and its steam trains Nos. 33 and 34, between Genoa and Albion. In its original application the company asked to discontinue the trains operating between Genoa and Spalding only but by supple - mental implication extended its request to cover the trains operating between Council Bluffs and Albion, via Columbus. It is proposed that main line trains Nos. 3 and 10 will do the work on the main line between Kumbus and Omaha, now performed by Nos. 23 and 24. For this pur - e No. 10 would be held at Grand Island several hours so as to make connection at Columbus with the branch line trains from Albion and Spalding. thus furnishing a direct service from that territory into Omaha. The time of the steam train on the Spalding line would be «nged so that it would leave Spalding about 7:00 o'clock a. m. and re - n leaving Columbus in the evening after connection with the main line evening trains. A motor train would be installed between Genoa and AUticn which would connect with the Spalding steam train just re - ferred to and provide service for the stations from Genoa to Albion. It iis also the plan to change the tinre of the mixed train which now leaves Columbus about 6:00 o'clock to a later hour, probably 0:40 a. m., and to speed up its time so as to provide a more adequate passenger service. At the hearing the company indicated a willingness to run the motor train between Genoa and Albion for an extra round trip in the middle of the day, thus making connection with the mixed train running to Spalding. It was also agreed to operate a Sunday train on the Spald - ing branch although this is not provided for in the application. The service on the branch lines involved in this application has been the subject of frequent hearings and investigations by this Com - mission and it will be unnecessary for that reason to enter into an ex - tended discussion of the details. The irotor train operating between Genoa and Spalding was originally installed by order of this Commission in 1914. A few months thereafter, upon complaint of citizens at Albion and intermediate points uskinir for a similar motor service, the company changed the terminus of trains Nos. 23 and 24 from Grand Island to Albion, thus providing a very satisfactory and desirable service to the people on the latter branch. In support of its application the company submits studies which show that passenger traffic fell off in Nebraska in 1921, 27.3 per cent and that the falling off in January, 1922, as compared to January, 1921, was 30.7 per cent. The decrease on the Albion-Spalding branches was slightly less, being 26 6 per cent in 1921, as compared to 1920. This decrease in traffic is ascribed by the company to the business depression </seg>
            <seg id="p367">367 which prevailed durinjf all of 1921 and to automobile competition, par - ticular stress being laid upon the latter factor. A count of passengers ■ i&lt;linj» on the trains on the Albion and Spalding branches was made for two weeks in January and submitted at the time of the hearing. At the request of the Commission a further study of thirty days was made in February and March immediately following the hearing. These studies showed that for the two weeks in January four-hundred and forty-one passengers rode on No. 23, the west bound steam passenger train from Council Bluffs to Albion, and two-hundred and nineteen passengers on No. 24, the east bound train. This was an average of thirty-four passengers a day for No. 23 and sixteen and three-tenths pasocngerg per duy for No. 24. During the thirty day period between February 13th and March 14th No. 23 carried one-thousand one-hundred and eighty-four, or an average of thirty-nine per day, and No. 24 car - ried seven-hundred and eighty-one, or an average of twenty-six per day. This showed a substantial increase for the latter period. During the two weeks period in January the motor No. 509, operating from Genoa to Spalding, carried two-humlrrd and thirty-one passengers, or an average of seventeen and seventy-six hundredths passengers per day, ami its companion train No. 510, cast bound, carried one-hundred ii nil forty, or an average of ten and seventy-seven hundredths per day. During the thirty day period No. 509 carried four-hundred and ninety passengers, or an average of sixteen and thirty-three hundredth.-! per day, and No. 510 carried three-hundred and sixty passengers, or an average of twelve per day. The showing for the motor for the thirty day period is practically the same as for the two week period in Janu - ary, being a slight increase on the east bound train and a slight decrease on the west bound train. On the whole, however, the showing for the four trains indicates a slight gain in traffic due doubtless to improved business conditions. The company submitted train mile earnings and direct expenses per train mile for both the motor and the steam trains for the years 1919, 1920 and 1921. For the motor these figures are as follows: Subsequent to the hearing, and as a result of a request made there - at, applicant submitted similar statistics covering the operation of the Train No. 509 — Genoa to Spalding: Yeiv Pass, earnings Expenses per per train mile train mile I'll!) 45c 50c 1&lt;J2O 45c 56c 1921 33c 50c Under Expenses 5c lie 17c Train No. 510— Spalding to Genoa: Year Pass, earnings Expenses per per train mile train mile 1919 32c 50c 1920 37c 56c 19 -M 27c 50c Under Expenses 18c 19c 23c </seg>

For example, for the two year period from January 1, 1913, to December 31, 1915, the average revenue per train mile for train No. 501&gt; was 53c and" the average num- ber of passengers carried was sixty-seven, while the average revenue for train No. 510 during the same period was 63c per train mile and the average number of passengers forty-two. This exceeds the revenue for any of the last three years. This train has shown a substantial margin of earnings over expenses throughout the period, not even excepting the year 1921 when the traffic was much lighter. It should be explained in this connection that none of the figures as to revenue contain the receipts from mail, express and baggage. While these revenues are not heavy they would improve the showing as to both trains. The motor does not handle express but does handle mail. With reference to the favorable showing made by the steam train applicant contends that the principal part of its patron - afire oriirinate^ between Columbus and Omaha on the main line and that Columbus - Spaldinfr -53 67 .63 42 The showing made by trains Nos. 23 ami 24 for 1919, 1920 and 19! is much more favorable as the following figures disclose: 2 Train No. 23 — Council Bluffs to Albion: Year Pass, earnings, Expenses per Earnings over per train mile train mile Expewtes 1919 $1.21 $0.70 $0.51 19-&gt;0 1 26 0.74 0.52 1021 0.92 0.72 0.20 Train No. 24 — Albion to Council Bluffs: Year Pass, earning* Expenses per .

            <seg id="p369">369 this traffic could be handled without discommoding the public by some of the other main line trains. The expense of operation for Nos. 23 and 24 for the year 1921, according to the company's figures, was NT 1.7-14.40. It is contended that the principal part of this expense would be saved by the discontinuance of these trains. Account should be made in these comparisons of the traffic for various years of the fact that 1920 was a very prosperous year with the carrier and their passenger traffic was the largest in their history. This is reflected in some degree in the figures shown although it is not lie as to the motor. On the other hand the year 1921 was marked by a serious business depression from which we are only now emerging. The comparison between the two years is, therefore, hardly fair. It is altogether probable that the traffic on these branches for 1922 will be greater than it was in 1921 and with the return of normal business con - ditions it should continue to improve. Much testimony was submitted by protestants as to the inconven - ience to which they would be subjected through the removal of these trains. It is unnecessary to analyze the service conditions that would result since, as we have stated, we have discussed this question at great length hi previous orders. It follows necessarily that removal of the trains would impair not only the passenger service but the mail and express service as well. The service as it now exists is highly satis - factory to the people along these lines. The public, therefore, should not be subjected to such a sacrifice of railway conveniences unless the necessities of the company imperatively demand it. While this record discloses a falling off of traffic it is not conclusive thi't the trains taken as a whole are being operated at a loss; nor would all of their cost of operation be paved through their removal. Other service must be substituted in some instances, trainmen's overtime would be increased in others and main line schedules involving some expenses would have to be readjusted. It appears to the Commission that the general financial condition of the Union Pacific Railroad company cannot be disregarded. While the results of operation of the particular trains involved are, to a large extent, controlling, the general condition of the carriers, whether pros - perous or otherwise, is of value as an element in determining whether this particular portion of the public should be required to surrender a service which is very much desired. The annual report of the Union Pacific, filed with this Commission, shows that it had gross earnings from passenger and freight traffic, in Nebraska for the year 1921 of §41,867,867.12. Its operating expenses, exclusive of taxes were $28,638,839.11, leaving a net operating income of $13,229,028.01. The net income for the Union Pacific Railroad company as a whole was $34,307,524.50. Out of this dividends of ten per cent on the common stock and four per cent on the preferred were paid, aggregating </seg>
            <seg id="p370">370 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT $26,210,900.00 leaving $8,096,624.50 to be passed to surplus. It is very manifest, therefore, that applicant company fared very well during: 1921. and annual reports for the other years riled in this office discln-e an even better showing. The only reason assigned by applicant for the discontinuance of these trains was for the purpose of saving money. If the company were suffering a loss on its operations as a whole, or on its operations in the state of Nebraska, the elimination of its losing, or least profitable service, would be wholly justified. Since, however, the coir.pany made more than a reasonable return in 1921, and since the saving from the economies proposed would result only in swelling the surplus, there appears to be no serious need for the exercise of such economies, particularly when they impose burdens upon the traveling 1 public. At this point it is well to observe, however, that the encroachment of the automobile upon the passenger train traffic, if continued at the present rate of progress, will result, in the not distant future, in a con - dition of affairs that will make necessary a curtailment of railroad serv - ice. This will apply particularly to branch line service since the short - haul travel is that most largely affected. The advent of the automo - bile has provided a substitute in a large measure for local train service. The public should understand that if it elects to use some other method t transportation it cannot always expect to have a passenger train [liable when, for weather conditions or other reasons, its substitute cannot be used. It follows from what we have said i" the foregoing that we are of the opinion that the application in this instance should be denied under the facts and circun-.stances as they now exist. But it also follows that if traffic on these lines continue* to decrease the company will be justified, and the Commission, under the law, will have no other recourse, than to permit a curtailment of the service.

E. Brown, Miller; M. E. Schneringer, Callaway; F. A. Fonda, Oconto; H. D. Bergen, Omaha Chamber of Commerce; OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Chairman: Applicant seeks in this proceeding to discontinue its motor trains Nos. 519 and 520, between Kearney and Stapleton, No. 519 leaves Kear - ney at 4:00 p. m. and arrives at Stapleton 9:25 p. m. and No. 520 leaves Stapleton at 7:30 a. m. and arrives in Kearney at 11:35 a. m. Other passenger service is furnished between these two points by a steam passenger train and by a mixed freight and passenger train. In con - nection with this application the company also applied for authority to discontinue certain of its passenger trains on the Spalding and Albion branches and the record in the two cases as to relative revenues and expenses for the year 1921, as compared to previous years, is much the same. The company urges in this case that its passenger revenues fell off in 1921 approximately twenty-seven per cent and that the falling off in January of this year was almost thirty-one per cent as compared to January of 1921. In the interest of economy, therefore, it is desired to eliminate the motor train on this branch and perform the passenger service with the two remaining trains. In 1921, according to the com - pany's showing, the earnings per train mile on motor No. 519 was 47 cents while the expense was 50 cents per train mile. On motor No. 520 the earnings were 41 cents per train mile as against expenses of 50 cents. . The earnings on the steam passenger train were slightly less while the expenses were materially greater. The earnings in these statements do not include receipts from- mail, express and baggage .service. Pursuant to requests made at the hearing the company later supplied the Commission with these earnings in so far as they were </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 available. The mail earnings on June 1, 1919, to the present time averaged 3.75 cents per train mile for trains Nos. 519 and 520. The express earnings in November, 1921, for the branch as a whole, were $1,915.67. Of this amount $988.59 were receipts from local business handled on the branch. The motor involved herein handles mail but only a small amount of express. The total excess baggage revenues for the branch for all trains was $776.31, or about 4 mills per mile for the six trains. It is impossible to definitely allocate to the motor trains their proportion of these earnings except as to mail. It is reasonable to assume, however, that the total earnings per mile for 1921 for both trains amounted to at least 50 cents. This is equal to the direct operating cost of the motor. According to the showing of revenues for train No. 519 it was less in 1921 than in 1919 and 1920, but was greater than for any preceding year back to 1907. Train No. 520 showed a less earning than for the years 1919 and 1920 and slightly less than for any of the preceding years. As was stated by us in Application No. 4691, the business depression from which we are just now emerging was responsible for a considerable falling off in traffic. It is probable that 1922 will make a better showing in that respect than 1921. A large portion of the record in this case is made up of testimony by protestants as to the great inconveniences they and the traveling - public would be put to by the removal of these trains. It is unneces - sary to go extensively into this testimony. Removal of the trains would without question greatly inconvenience the people living along this branch and they ought not to be subjected to such impairment of serv - ice unless all the conditions and circumstances make it necessary. As we have shown the company is operating these motor trains at practically no direct loss. The steam train, if the revenue from all sources is added, is likewise operating without material loss. Applicant has a very large freight traffic from this line and the branch is, of course, a feeder to its main system. What we had to say in Applica - tion No. 4691 with reference to the general financial condition of appli - cant applies with equal force in this case. The general condition of the company calls for no drastic economies. It is recognized, of course, that the elimination of these trains would result in a saving to the company of considerable money each year, since the passengers, to a very large extent at least, would be accommodated on the other trains. It is our opinion, therefore, that the application should be denied. We desire to emphasize in this connection, however, that if the use of the automobile continues to expand it will result necessarily in a curtail - ment of railroad passenger service. It constitutes a menace to short - haul traffic and the public should begin to take it into consideration. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the application herein, be, </seg>

Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 471« In the Matter of the Application of The Deshler Liirht and Powex Com - pany for Authority to issue and sell its capital stock in the amount of £53,500.00 and for the validation of stock heretofore issued in the amount of $46,500.00. Appearances: For the Applicant— Henry C. Struve, president. M. H. Wiess, attorney. By The Commission: This matter came on to be heard April 4, 1922, on the application of the Deshler Light and Power company for authority to issue and sell its common capital stock in the amount of $53,500.00, and for the vali - dation of stock issued without the authority of the Commission in the amount of §46.500.00 par value. The organization of this corporation under the laws of Nebraska was begun October 31, 1917. The articles of incorporation were filed in the office of the county clerk of Thayer county but were not filed with the secretary of state, as provided by law and stock was issued without the authority of this Commission, in the amount of ?46,500.00 par value. These things were done thoughtlessly and through lack of knowledge of the law and not for the purpose of avoiding its provisions. About December 6, 1921, the company was reorganized, the articles of incorporation were amended and properly filed with the county and state. This application followed on February 7, 1922 for validation of the $46,500.00 in stock illegally issued in 1917 and for authority to issue :ind sell $53,500 par value of additional common stock to provide funds for additions and betterments and other legitimate purposes of the corporation. The Commission's engineering department made an inventory and appraisal based on a count and inspection of the applicant's physical property at Deshler which includes stores and supplies and merchandise on hand March 10, 1922. The costs of equipment, material and supplies used therein were obtained from the applicant's records and labor costs of installing and erecting the same were also obtained from this source and used when available. The testimony shows that much of the physi - cal property was replaced and substantial additions and betterments </seg>
            <seg id="p374">374 were made during three or four years preceding this inventory and that the costs experienced and used would fairlv reflect both the reproduction cost new now as well as the historical reproduction cost or investment. The applicant accepted the engineering department's appraisal as to cost new but claimed excessive depreciation on power plant equipment, which appeared to result from the application of the straight line method of depreciation where equipment had been purchased and in - stalled but net used. Therefore the Commission will take and so finds that $60,000 is the depreciated cost of the property now in place in - cluding stores and supplies, which is somewhat highei than the figure found in the engineer's appraisal. asset and liability statement will be Using this amount the applicant's as follows: The testimony shows that the $18,517.00 were created by additions of the applicant's physical property. bills payable in the amount of to plant included in the inventory Accounts receivable and cash on the asset side fairly offset accounts payable of the liabilities. It fol - lows that the net assets of the applicant were approximately $46,473.00. Therefore the Commission will authorize the issue of stock in the amount of $46,500 par value in lieu of and as a substitute for stock in this amount irregularly issued in 1917 and will pass to the consideration of the approval required for the issue and sale of stock in the amount of $53,500 for other purposes. The Commission understands that the applicant desires to retire the bills payable in the amount of $18,517.00 and Will also require new - capital in the amount of $27,625.00 to cover the cost of a new trans - mission line from Deshler to Byron and Hardy including distribution systems in these villages or a total of approximately $46,142.00. This estimate of the cost of additions and betterments is conservative as several branch line connections with the transmission line are in pros - pect which have not been included in the applicant's estimate. It is also realized that additional working capital may be required as the cor - poration's operations are extended. Having these facts in mind, the Commission believes and so finds that the sale of new stock in the amount of $53,500 par value is reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation and this amount will be authorized subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this order. Applicant shows that it furnishes power for a broom factory, ice plant, city lighting and pumping in Deshler and other manufacturing purposes.

Applicant estimates that the net revenue without fixed charges on account of the additions and betterments will be $3,350.00 or a total of $9,222.00. No deductions for maintenance, de - preciation, taxes, etc., have been considered in this calculation. The Commission is of the opinion and will provide that the appli - cant shall set aside an amount of money out of the operating income of not less than 67' annually on the amount of stock validated and author - ized by this Commission when issued and outstanding as a maintenance and depreciation fund. The Commission will also require that said company shall keep true and accurate accounts showing the receipts and application in detail of the proceeds of the sale or disposal of the stock hereby authorized to be issued and shall make a verified report to the Commission showing the sale of said stock, the terms and crnditionr; of the sale and the money realized therefrom. The Commission will further provide that the proceeds of the sale of stock in the amount of .■518,517.00 shall be used to retire bills payable in a like amount on or before September 1, 1922. Quarterly reports will be required of the applicant showing these transactions as they occur in detail, beginning September 1. 1922, and will continue thereafter until the stock authorized in this order has been sold and the proceeds applied to the property. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the stock irregularly issued by the Deshler Light and Power company in 1917 in the amount of $46,500 p:ir value be called in and cancelled and thereby made null and void and new stock in a like amount be issued as a substitute therefor.

OPINION AND FINDING By The Commission This is an application requesting validation of certain notes payable, the same extending for a period of more than twelve months after the date thereof, the same given by E. H. Stutheit and H. W. Meyer in part payment for property at the Byron Telephone company purchased from G. R. Mead. The application is made by the Byron Telephone company, it being thought advisable that such notes be validated in view of the provisions of sections 676, 677 and 678, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. Quoting from section 676 it reads in part as follows: "A common carrier or public service corporation organized ami incorporated or hereafter incorporated, under or by virtue of the laws of the State of Nebraska, may issue stocks, bonds, note? in other evidence of indebtedness payable at periods of more thr&gt;". twelve months after the date thereof, when necessary for the ac - quisition of property, the construction, completion, or extension or improvement of facilities, or for the improvement or maintenance of its service, or for the discharge or lawful refunding of its obli - gations: Provided and not otherwise, there shall have been se - cured from the Nebraska State Railway Commission an order authorizing such issue and the amount thereof, and stating that iu ■the opinion of the commission, the use of the capital to be securtti by the issue of such stock, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebL - edness is reasonably required for the said purposes of the cor - poration." Applicant company is an unincorporated common carrier, function - ing in the nature of a partnership. The conclusion of the Commission is, therefore, that it is not such "a common carrier or public service corporation" as contemplated by law, as would place it within provisions of section above referred to.

Commissioner March IS, 1922, the village of Merna, Nebraska, made application for the privilege of constructing and maintaining a 3-phase 60-cycle 6.600 voltage transmission line, to be built along the unoccupied side of the highway from the sub-station at Broken Bow to the village of Merna, a distance of about twelve miles. The application was accom - panied by a blue print (Exhibit 1) showing the location of the route. A hearing was had after due notice to all interested parties. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company introduced evidence, voicing its objections to the proposed route of the pcver line for tb.8 reason that the highway, one side of which the power line must occupy, paralleled its right-of-way for a distance of about three miles out of the village of Merna, which would place the wires of the power line about 144 feet distant from the wires of the railroad company. The railroad company also offered testimony showing that it proposed in the near future to extend its block signal service west from Broken Bow, which would require the signal wires for the use of the blocks be placed on the side of its right-of-way next to the highway which the power com- </seg>
            <seg id="p378">378 pany proposed to use, and would place the sensitive signal wires about eighty feet distant from the wires of the power line. After the hearing the village of Merna filed an amended application and another blue print, (Exhibit 2) with the corrected portion of the line shown in red, this amended route being the same as that originally prayed for in Exhibit 1 except that portion which parallels the railroad company's right-of-way near Broken Bow. The change in the amended application and blue print is described as follows: "Commencing at the southwest corner of section 24. showi on Exhibit No. 2, east along the north side of sections 25 ami 30 tw miles, thence south along the east side of section 30 o: e n-ile. tiienc? east eighty rods to the village of Broken Bow." the power line to use the unoccupied side of the highway. !The railroad company now says that it will not insist upon tU ob - lons but reserves the right to bring to the Commission's attention interference that may develop in the future because of what is »ed the Merna parallelism. There is therefore no issue before the imission and the route of the applicant's transmission line, according |a amended location, evidenced by a marked blue print on file with Commission. (Exhibit No. 2&gt; will be approved; conditioned, how - , that all of the rules of the Commission with respect to the con - ction of such lines and the construction of the crossing in the high - over the railroad company's right-of-way be observed; and con - •ned also that the voltage of current transmitted over the lines shall exceed 6600 volts ami that the line shall be of a closed delta type ited from the ground, with transpositions determined necessary for protection of the service of the telephone lines occupying the oppo - side of the highway, such transpositions to be determined by the mission's engineer.

Maguire, acting for all Nebraska Railroads, has re - quested authority to publish the following rule governing the receipt of baggage: "Excess Value: The shipper of baggage or other prrperty per- mitted to be transported under this tariff must at the time of de - livery to carrier declare in writing the value thereof on form pre- scribed by checking carrier as below.

Minimum charge ten (10) cents. Charges for excess value should be prepaid wherever possible a;id are separate and distinct from the charges for excess weight and size. The proposed rule has been in effect in territory east of Chicago and north and east of St. Louis for some years past, and has recently become effective throughout Western Passenger Association territory, on interstate traffic, including the movement of baggage between points in Nebraska and points in other states. The baggage tariffs have carried a rule for some years past, which provides that unless a passenger declares a higher value his baggage will be accepted as of an agreed value, not exceeding S100.00. If the passenger declared a value in excess of $100.00. he was compelled to Station (Date) . 19. </seg>
            <seg id="p380">380 pay excess baggage charges on account of the higher liability assumed by the carrier. w Under the proposed rule, the passenger is merely required to de - finitely state the value of the baggage offered for transportation, and he may fix any sum as that value. Baggage of a value not exceeding $100.00 will still be transported without additional charge, but if the value is staled as in excess of $100.00, the passenger will be required to pay the excess baggage charges which are now applicable for bag - gage having a value in excess of $100.00. After preliminary consideration of this matter, it was thought ad - visable to set it down for a hearing, which was held at Lincoln on March 27, 1922. The carrier's witnesses emphasized the proposition that the new rule (lid not increase the charge for the transportation of baggage, but would operate to safeguard the interests of both the passenger and the carrier, by requiring passengers to make an estimate of the value of their baggage before making a trip, and giving them an opportunity to secure full protection against loss or damage in transit, by paying the excess charges if the value is in excess of $100.00; and, at the same time, the carrier would be protected in the handling of claims, by de - finite agreement as to the value of the baggage. Some testimony was also produced as to the desirability of having the name and address of the person offering the baggage for shipment, which could be kept on file at the point of origin, to assist in locating baggage which had gone astray, or to identify baggage which was found at a station or in transit, without a baggage check as a means of identification. Although notices of the hearing in this case were sent to various chnmbere^ of commerce and associations of traveling men, no testimony was offered in opposition to the carriers' application. In view of the facts outlined above, the application herein will be granted.

OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Chairman: Under date of March 7, 1922, the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company made application to this Commission for authority to change the route of its South Omaha and Sherman Avenue line and to abandon certain track, as follows: "It is planned to build a new section of double track from 16th and Cuming street to Sherman avenue and Clark street eo.ineci.iine with the existing line at both these intersections. Also to connect with a double track curve the tracks on Cass street with the tracks on 16th street at the intersection of loth and Cass, and when this has been done to abandon service on the tracks running on Cass Station (date) 1!L__ </seg>

In support of its application the. company stated that the object of the change in route was to shorten the Sherman avenue line between its northern terminus and the down town section of Omaha by a distance of two blocks. Incidentally four surface railroad crosiings on 17th street would be eliminated, in place of which there would be one new railroad crossing on 16th street. Before taking action on the application this Commission thought it advisable to submit the matter to the mayor and cit? commission of Omaha for their advice and recommendations. This action on our part apparently was misunderstood by the city authorities of Omaha and by the newspapers of that city. As a result of such misunderstanding vigorous opposition was expressed as to the proposed changes to be made by applicant. As a result of the agitation thus created the com - pany on March 17, 1922, withdrew its application, stating that "Inasmuch as the people of Omaha are opposed to the contempl&amp;'ed dhange in the route of the Shermafi avenue line, assuming that ths city commissioners and 1 newspapers are correctly representing their ■wishes, we have decided not to press the matter further." It appears, however, that the public attitude with reference to the application was misunderstood, this attitu.te having been made known to the company through voluminous petitions, visits by numerous citi - zens and favorable expressions in the three daily newspapers. The company has accordingly, under date of April 4, 1022. renewed its ap - plication and asks for prompt action. It submits with the application a petition fifty feet in length, signed by upwards of thirty-five hundred residents of North Omaha, whose service would be improved by the change. In addition thereto the Commission is in receipt of a letter from Mayor James C. Dahlman and City Commissioner Joseph Koutsky. confirmine the favorable sentiment as above indicated. Since the change proposed by the company will re.-:ult in substantial improvement in the service and increase the safety of several thousand riders on these lines through the elimination of two unnecessary blocks on each trip and three surface railroad crossings, and since no complaint has been filed with the Commission in opposition to the application, we are of the opinion that the proposed change is reasonable, desirable and should be approved. This Commission, of course, has no jurisdiction over the streets and alleys of the city of Omaha and the approval granted herein is necessarily subject to the jurisdiction of the municipal - ity in that respect. Upon completion of the improvement the company should submit to the Commission a full statement as to the cost of making the same, together with a showing of the debits and credits i i 4-v.fi ranitpl nrnnprtv a _j rlpnrp "Motion jii»poiint' </seg>

Appearances: For the Applicant — George W Steinmeyer, Secretary. Bv The Commission: This matter came on to be heard on the application of the Beatrice P. wex Company for authority to issue and sell its capital stock at par in the amount of $100,000 and bonds in the sum of $75,000. The stock is to be divided equally between common and preferred. Applicant's petition was later amended to strike all reference to the bonds. A hearing was held and testimony was taken in the offices of the Commis - sion April 7. 1922. Proof of notice to the public was filed at a later date. Petitioner has been authorized to issue and sell its common stock at par, in the sum of $100,000, and preferred stock in the same amount in an order issued by the Commission under application No. 4256. A supplemental order was issued by the Commission June 16, 1921, under </seg>
            <seg id="p384">384 the same application authorizing petitioner to increase the rate of re - turn on its preferred stock from seven to eight per cent. Applicant now represents to the Commission that the sale of the securities authorized under the original application in the amount of $200,000 will not be sufficient to provide the funds necessary to complete the construction described in the first petition, and this applicaton to the Commission is for the authority to issue and sell additional stock to provide the funds necessary for this purpose. tThe record shows that large additions to the quantities of materials 1 labor entering into the construction of the dam were made necessary en the foundation of the structure was uncovered, and its character - istics fully determined. It also shows that prices of construction ma - terials and labor advanced during the construction period, which could not have been anticipated in the estimates supporting the original application. These facts combined with thp shortage of labor and delays in the delivery of materials had the effect of increasing the an - ticipated construction costs to a figure approximating $375,000. The total cost of construction will exceed the applicant's stock outstanding: when these issues are disposed of in the amount of $75,000. The testimony further shows that all the sums included in applicant's total cost of construction represent money actually expended and to be used in payment for materials contracted for and labor entering into the pro- ject. In the total cost figure, however, $24,000 has been included 1 interest during construction. Interest on bills payable in the suit. $3,393.45 also appears as a general expense item in the asset stateme This is a duplication and can not be capitalized. The principal sto&lt; holders have advanced the money to pay dividends on the preferi stock outstanding. This is a proper charge to capital or it may amortized from revenue. If it is capitalized it should be deducted f r&lt; the $24,000 which has been estimated for this purpc-e or it will re* in a further duplication. Applicant represented that by reason of an agreement with the Homesville Mill and Power company, it would be able to buy the entire output of electric energy of the Homesville company in the amount of one million five hundred thousand kilowatts at one and one-half cents per kilowatt. This amount of electric energy added to the quantity producer by the applicant's generating plant makes a total of four million five hundred thousand kilowatts, which is more nearly a measure of the maximum generating capacity of these plants than the amount average annual output of current which the applicant will have for sale.

This results in annual gross earnings of $79,500. In computing- the current sold the applicant has apparently allowed for the loss in transmission and a reasonable variation in operating con - ditions. Petitioner has also estimated its annual operating expenses in - cluding fixed charges, and not including dividends on the stock out - standing at $46,000. It has included $9,500 in this calculation for a maintenance and depreciation fund. The Commission believes and so finds that four per cent computed on the total amount of stock out - standing, or $12,000, will be necessary for this purpose. This will have the- effect of increasing applicant's annual operating expenses to $48,500.

(SEAL* APPLICATION NO. 4772 In the Matter of the Application of the Skeedee Independent Telephone Company of St. Edward for Authority to Sell Stock. OPINION AND FINDING Browne. Commissioner: Applicant company has for almost twenty years operated a tele - phone exchange in St. Edward and .--urrounding territory in active com - petition with the Nebraska Telephone company, and its successor the Noithwestern Bell Telephone company. It has never had physical con - nection with the competing exchange either for local or toll .service, because it was following a vigorous policy of making inroads upon its competitor where opportunity afforded. Negotiations for purchase or sale have been earned on spasmodi - cally for a considerable period. Recently the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone company sold to the Skeedee Independent Telephone company all its physical property at St. Edward, excepting its switchboard and sub - scribers' sets for the sum of $4,500. In the consolidation some pro - perty will be lost, both that which was recently purchased and property of the Skeedee Independent Telephone company. Hewcvfr, Zte Skeedee company has a very considerable surrlus due to its methods of operation with large amounts of donated construction work in the early days, and such loss due to consolidation *"ill in no sense threaten the relation of property to securities. With the Commission's present knowledge of the amount of pro - perty owned by the Northwestern Bell Telephone company and pur - chased by applicant in this deal, it has not been deemed necessary to make an inventory of the purchased property and the purchase price is without doubt well within reason. The consolidation is to the large advantage of the entire community, so much so as to have warranted the payment of a premium for the purchased property had such a price been essential to the consolidation. Fortunately, it was not. Applicant desires to issue and sell $4,500 of stock, consisting of ninety shares, par value $50 per share.

When title to the property finally vests in applicant company, the notes will be paid at the bank and stock will be issued to the citizens who have done the financing. This purchase of stock already arranged for is at par. On August 27, 1921, this applicant was authorized to issue $3,000 of common stock and to sell same from time to time for additions and betterments. Not all this stock has been sold. Our approval of the sale of notes for the purchase of the Northwestern Bell Telephone com - pany is entirely distinct from the previous approval and shall not by the company be confounded with the previous authorization.

            <seg id="p388">388 APPLICATION NO. 4785 In the Matter of the Application of the Holhiook Central Telephone Association for Authority to Increase Rates. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: Applicant asks that its rate for business service be increased- to $2.25 per month net and for switching service, from forty cents to fifty cents per month net, and pleads as reason for this increase that its plant was almost destroyed by a destructive sleet storm 01, April 10, 1922; that stockholders have made temporary loans for the purpose of -im - mediate repairs; that the company has no cash reserve and no means of secining permanent additions to its capital. §Two years ago the Commission authorized this company to make •tain increases in rates. Switching rates were advanced from enty-five to forty cents, residence and business rates were advanced twenty-five cents per month. The company had askea for a consider - ably higher rate than this but the Commission could not find necessities warranting the full measure of increase. There are fifty-nine shares of stock outstanding, par value -&gt;20 per share. These represent the original shares sold at the time the com - pany was organized. A majority of the stock is owned by farm line companies being switched at Holbrook. There are one hundred thirty - one subscribers all told. From the company's reports it appears that town properties are metallic. Switching service is rendered for about two hundred sixty independently owned stations. The original stock outstandirg amounted to $1800, as shown by investigation made by the Commission at the time of the previous order under Application No. 4187. There is some indebtedness additional to the lecent loan made by stockholders. No dividends have ever been paid except once and that dividend was inadvisable. The property owned, without doubt, considerably exceeds in value the outstanding obligations, due to an investment of dividends and of depreciation reserve and of any .surplus that may have been earned in years gone by. However, there is no cash. The record of the com - pany, since its organization, places it in the category of a community, almost a charitable enterprise. The stock is practically worthless be - cause it pays no dividends, or is particularly erratic in that respect. There is no inducement for stockholders to invest additional sums in any other way than as a gift. . L Ordinarily where a company has suffered a destructive storm, as company has suffered, and with the property record that it has, we would deny an increase in rates, not needed otherwise, and require the company to sell stock, restore the borrowed depreciation reserve with </seg>
            <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 389 the proceeds and use the money for reconstruction. This company cannot use such means of relief because of the very nature of its organ - ization and business procedure. The annual report for 1921 shows the judgment of the Commission was sound as to the level of the rates necessary, as found in the preceding order. However, no such emer - gency as this storm was then faced. Telephone service is essential in the community and the local company has furnished it economically. It would appear essential at this time to authorize an increase in rates temporarily to help tide over the embarrassing situation. How long such increased rates will be necessary time can tell. We will authorize an increase for a period of a year and take at that time such action as circumstances warrant. In &lt;&gt;ur order which first advanced the rates of this company it was provided that not less than $1,000 should be set up annually on a pro - rated monthly basis for maintenance and depreciation. The annual report shows that the company is setting up on the basis of $640 per annum. This error should be corrected and change made transferring from profit and loss the required amount to make the total maintenance si. 000 and to readjust its account No. 630 correspondingly. Through- out the year 1923 the company shall continue to set up at the rate of $1,000 per annum. We do not consider the spread between residence rates and business es, as proposed by the company, an equitable spread, but will grant increases as will provide approximately the same amount of money.

OPINION AND FINDING Cook, Commissioner: This application is presented by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Cor - poration operating in Nebraska requesting authority to withdraw from operation its trains Nos. 637 and 638, between Auburn and Omaha. Train No. 637 is a daily passenger, express and mail train, except Sun - days, leaving Auburn at 6:55 a. m., arriving at Omaha 10:25 p. m. Train No. 638 is a daily, except Sundays, leaving Omaha at 2:00 o'clock p. m., arriving in Auburn at 5:50 p. m. Applicant company's only other service on this line is a mixed train between these points which leaves Omaha on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 7:10 a. ni. and arrives in Auburn at 1:30 p. m. The alternate mixed train leaves Auburn on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7:25 a. in. and arrives in Omaha at 2:30 p. m. Applicant company advises that this mixed train will be run daily except Sundays if the authorisation of abandon- ment of the present passenger trains is granted. In support of the application for tne discontinuance of passenger trains Nos. 637 and 638, the railway company contends that the auto - mobile and motor bus service along its lines into Omaha and Lincoln has taken the passenger business from surrounding territory so com - pletely that the trains in question cannot be run without serious loss to the company. The exhibits offered by the applicant, together with testimony of officers of the company, presents a loss of approximately $40,000 per year tributary to the operation of the trains in question. The evidence of the carrier to establish this loss was built entirely upon the passenger revenue of the trains and can be reduced to the extent of the amount received from express and mail revenue aerived from the trains. The representatives of the different communities affected testified that it would be a serious loss to them to have the passenger service in question discontinued; that they had long enjoyed a service of this kind and had based the commercial conditions of their communities upon the continuance of said service, their principal contention being that </seg>

The railway company stated for the record that if the Commission felt that there was force to the contention of respondents as to longer stops in Omaha, and its beneficial result on traffic, it would try out any suggested change of schedule proposed. The Commission does so feel. It recognized that in this period of high operating costs, excellent roads, and prevalence of automobiles, branch line railway passenger service presents a grave transportation problem which must soon be solved. It i&gt; reluctant to aid in a solution that means reduced service, and will approve it only when absolutely necessary. Railroad passenger train service is important to the people in the territory tributary to the branch in question, and without doubt they will loyally support the effort to make it as nearly compensatory as possible. A sixty day trial of an altereri schedule should show whether the suggestions of respondents have force. At tine end of the sixty-day test period the company should then make a complete showing of the earnings of said trains during the test period, b&lt;&gt;th as to passenger, express and mail earnings, for the period covering the sixty-day trial of the new -schedule, at which time the Com - mission will consider the matter further and render final order based upon the records in the matter and the facts developed by the results the test period ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway (A.mmission that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska lie. and the same is hereby, ordered and directed, effective June 19, 1922, to revise its operating schedule of trains Nos. 637 and 638, oper - ating between Falls City and Omaha, making the time of the train con - form to a running schedule that will give at least a period of five hours and thirty minutes between its arriving time (Leavenworth depot), Omaha, Nebraska, and its departing time, each day except Sundays.

The company claims that additions to the plant have been made since the date of the last issue of securities in excess of S28.000 and a careful analysis of the records of the company made by the Commis - sion's accounting department verifies this claim. As a matter of fact the records show that approximately $32,000 has been expended in additions and betterments during- the period. The company now asks to capitalize $28,000 of this amount. Eighteen thousand eight dollars of the total asked for is to be issued as a dividend to stockholders in lieu of cash dividends earned during 1920 and 1921, but not paid. The fney which was thus earned and which might have heen distributed the stockholders in the form of a dividend was used in the con - uction of additions and betterments to the property. The propriety of the issue of stock for such purpose and under such conditions cannot be questioned. The public has benefited through the use of the facilities thus paid for out of these funds and has had the use of the same with - out interest up to the present time. It is clear, therefore, that stock in this amount should bo authorized and is reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation. tWith reference to the remainder of the issue applied for the facts not quite so clear. The company has outstanding at the pre.-ent </seg>
            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 393 time $9,244.30 in notes payable. It asks to issue stock for the retire - ment of this full amount. An analysis of this account, however, dis - closes that there has been an increase in the notes payable since Janu - ary 31, 1916, the date of the last issue of securities, of only $1,425. During the same period, however, $6,000 of notes have been paid off so that in reality there has gone into property during this time $7,425. A portion of the outstanding indebtedness, was therefore, covered by previous issues of securities, although it appears clear that the amount we have mentioned, viz: $7,425, is in addition to that already capitalized ami since the proceeds therefrom have been used in additions and better - ments to the property they constitute a proper basis for capitalization. It is intended, of course, to dispose of the stock and pay off these notes. The sum of $18,008 to be issued in the form of stock dividends and the amount of $7,425, just referred to, make a total of $25,433 which may be properly capitalized at this time. As to the remainder applied for there is doubt. It appears from the accounts that a portion of this, while properly invested in additions and betterments to the property, wta taken from the depreciation reserve. It would be proper to capital- ize this amount at this time if the company intended to use the pro - ceeds ol the sales of the securities to replenish the depreciation reserve But that is not the intention. Stock not needed for a stock dividend will be used to retire notes payable and the depreciation reserve for which it might be issued would thus not be protected. An item of s 1,075.27, accounts payable, is presented by the company as a part of the basis for its claim of request for stock in the amount of $28,000. It would require careful analysis to make sure that no part of this amount had been used to defray operating expenses. It is possible, of course, that a portion of this amount may have been used for the con - struction of new property. We are of the opinion, however, that the interests of the company will be safeguarded and its purposes fully met if we authorize at this time stock in the amount of $25,500. This, with the $1,475 of stock already authorized and in the treasury of the com - pany, will provide an additional issue of approximately $27,000. An oiiler will be issued in conformity with these findings.

I NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, H. G. TAYLOR, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4811 In the Matter of the Application of The Yellow Cab and Baggage Com - pany for Authority to Issue and Sell $50,000 of Stock. Appearances : iFor applicant, S. A. Harris, attorney; S. A. Houser, auditor. For the state, Hugh LaMaster, assistant attorney general. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: By application filed May 31, 1!&gt;22, this applicant alleges itself to be a common carrier under the terms of the law and asks our authorization to feme and sell all or any part of $50,000 of common stock for the purpose of acquiring additional equipment in extending its operations and for the purpose of enabling its employes to invest savings on a participation basis in the securities of the company for which they work. An informal conference was first held between representatives of the applicant and the Commission on the question of jurisdiction. It was determined under the findings of the United States supreme court in Terminal Taxicab Co. v. Kutz, 241 U. S. 252 that a portion of the business of applicant is that of a common carrier. The Commission thereupon took jurisdiction and hearing was held on June 22 at the offices of the Commission. A check of the books of the company was made by the Commission's accountants and matters there developed led the Commission to set the case down for additional hearing to determine, first, by what authority of law existin* outstanding stock was issued; second, whether such stock was equitably issued; and third, ■whether before acting upon the pending application it. was necessary for the Commission to pass upon stock already outstanding. The company did not specifically amend its application, but in brief filed admitted the strong probability that previous issues of stock would be found not complying with the law and expressing a desire to comply •with all the conditions of the so-called stocks and bonds act of Nebraska statute. The requirement of the constitution as to (fivinsr bixtv &lt;la v* notice </seg>
            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 395 prior to issuing of stock had been met by applicant regarding the pro - posed issue of $50,000. Inasmuch as previous is'sues did not constitute an increase in stock, but rather a re-issue by a new corporation upon consolidation, it is our conclusion that publication is not necessary prior to determining the status of the stock already outstanding and approval or disapproval thereof. A brief history of this applicant is appropriate. For many years prior to January 10, 1920, the Omaha Taxicab company and the Omaha Transfer company had operated in Omaha and had built up relatively strong: business connections. In the main their operations were not those of common carriers and up to the time of the decision of the higrh court above mentioned it had not been considered. ; that they fell under the stocks and bonds act. Hence, their issues of corporate securities and capital obligations had not been supervised. Such issues were said to have been prior to the passage of the so-called Blue Sky !:•.» in 1913. In January, 1920, these companys consolidated into a new corporation known as the Omaha Taxicab &amp; Transfer company, incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware. At the time of the consolidation the outstanding capital stock of the Omaha Taxicab company had a par value of $81,000. The statement of the company as of March 1, 1920, shows a surplus of $2,531. The assets c^nU-In^i an item of $20,000 for good will and $961.53 for leases and contracts, which appear to have differed very little from good-will. As cf the same date the Omaha Transfer company had outstanding capital stock of the par value of $15,000 and carried a surplus item of •*2,000. The assets did not carry a good-will item. There was, how - ever, an item of $12,724 as value of leases and contracts, which appears to us to have differed but little in fact from an item of good-will. Each of the companies which consolidated in 1920 had in turn during years been built up from absorptions and purchases. The record is not available to indicate how much was paid by each of those companies in actual cash for good-will. It is evident, however, that the standing reached by the two companies which merged had created a considerable •rood-will value in a highly competitive business. The Delaware corporation, the consolidated company, permitted by its articles the issuance of no-par common stock and preferred stock with par value of $100 per share. By the terms of the consolidation previous owners of the Omaha Taxicab company received $80,000 pre - ferred stock in the consolidated company and 2500 shares of no-par common stock. The Omaha Transfer company came into the new cor - poration by receiving in return for its property $16,500 of preferred stock and 500 shares of no-par common stock. By the terms of the same agreement there was subsequently issued 1500 .-hares of no-par common stock to the parties to the consolidation. A glance at the statements of the Omaha Taxicab company and the Omaha Transfer company and the first statement issued by the Omaha Taxicab &amp; Trans- </seg>
            <seg id="p396">396 fer company, the Delaware corporation, indicates that the no-par stock was issued on the basis of assets worth $1.00 per share. v Some time after the consolidation the company sold $40,000 of its preferred stock at par, but by the terms of the sale issued 1250 shares of no-par common stock as a bonus. This bonus issue was charged up in assets to good-will. In the early part of 1921 the Omaha Taxicab &amp; Transfer company, predecessor to this applicant, filed application with the Nebraska bureau of securities for authority to sell additional stock to cake care of de - veloping business. It was then ascertained that a stumbling- block existed by reason of the no-par stock. The company thereupon decided to incorporate under the laws of Nebraska and did so, making the par value of the common stock $10.00 per share. Certificate of filing was issued by the secretary of state in April, 1921. The bureau of securi - ties finally determined it had no jurisdiction in the case inasmuch as applicant was a common carrier public utility. For some reason not explained the company proceeded with the re-issue of its stock, calling in the previous stock and issuing an equi - valent value in stock at $10.00 per share. The common stock called in carried a nominal value of $1.00 per share as measured by the assets. In handling this common stock the company cancelled one-half the total number of shares called in and issued the remaining fifty per cent of shares at a par value of $10.00 per share, thereby increasing the as - sumed value of the common stock by about four hundred per cent. Ir; November, 1920, the company had executed a ten-year Lease on a building at 27th and Farnum, which it proposed to use as a garage. It sub-leased a portion of the building to a tenant. On March 1. 1921, an appraisement committee of the Omaha Real restate Board found that the leasehold was reasonably worth $20,000. Thereupon the company wrote into its assets an item of $20,000 as the value of the lease upon the 27th street garage, thereby offsetting the increased liabilities by reason of the re-issuing of the no-par common stock. In our opinion the Nebraska law required that applicant, if not a public utility, should have secured authority from thf bureau of se - curities of the state of Nebraska before having issued the stock of the consolidate'! corporation. If it were a public utility, organized under the laws of the state of Nebraska, it was necessary to secure the author - ization of this stock from this Commission. Neither course was pursued. Inasmuch a? in taking jurisdiction over the application we have deter - mined that applicant is a common carrier public utility it follows that, in our opinion, authorization should have been secured from this Com - mispion before issuing the stock of the Nebraska corporation, the Omaha Taxicab &amp; Transfer comDany W f J . </seg>
            <seg id="p397">397 In September, 1921, the company purchased the name "The Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage company" and amended its articles so as thereafter to be. designated by that name. We will refer to the company hereafter as The Yellew Cab company. By reference to the balance sheet of the consolidated company on the day after the consolidation, viz.: March 1, 1920, it appears that good-will and leases and contracts were capitalized to the extent of ap - proximately $35,000. The leases and contracts were to a large extent fictional. Upon the organization of the Nebraska corporation this cap - italization of the item of good-will was extended into the Nebraska corporation. Ordinarily under the holdings of this Commission and the almost uniform conclusions of the courts public utilities cannot claim a value in good-will. It appears, however, that this case stands on a considerably different footing. Most public utilities are either mono - polies or semi-monopolies. Applicant company does a very consider - able business which is not common carrier in its nature, viz.: the filling of demands for incidental taxicab service on call from stands on the street or from the central garage. It does, however, have a virtual monopoly of business between various railroad depots and certain hotels. It also has contract agreements with certain railroads by which it has exclusive right to solicit business upon the private property of the rail - road earners and delivers baggage for the railroad company, being responsible to it for safe delivery- There is, however, very strong competition on most of the business done by this company. In a rather precarious field it has built up a strong organization and wide reputation for business integrity. There can be no question in our opinion but that this is a thing of high value and a source of considerable net revenue. We are not, therefore, disposed to question the capitalization already issued against assets items of good-will and the other semi - intangible item of leases and contracts. We will validate the stock so i»ued. The equities involved in the proceeding of the company in increasing its liabilities by retiring no-par common stock and issuing common stoclf of par value of $10.00 per share are not so clear. The testimony clearly showed that the value of $20,000 placed upon the leasehold on the 27th street garage was dependent upon the length of time the lease had to run and that had the lease been for one or two years in place of ten years this value would have been correspondingly reduced in the opinion of the appraisers. This testimony led to inquiry at the time of the hearing as to whether or not the issue of stock against the value of the leasehold were not in violation of section 5, article 10, of the constitution of Nebraska, wherein it is provided that "No dividends shall be declared or distributed except out of net earnings after paying all operating expenses • ♦ «■ " We are inclined, however, to agree with applicant that the issue of </seg>
            <seg id="p398">398 this fommon stock against the assets item of "leasehold" is rot a de - claration of dividend such as is contemplated in the constitutional pro - vision- just quoted. Ordinarily a dividend is a partial distribution of assets of a corporation among the stockholders. In this instance no such distribution took place and the total assets were not changed by the increase in the liabilities. Rather, the action of the company was merely to change the form of the liability from surplus to stock. This conclusion appears to have the support of judicial decree. Kisner v. MacComber, 252 U. S. 189. This conclusion, however, does not finall/ dispose of the question. The company Mas included in its assets the item of $20,000, the value of which item depends wholly upon the length of time the lease has to run. It is perfectly clear that at the termination of the lease the item disappears from assets. The company has, however, issued stock of no termination date against thi« assets item. If no other arrangement were made it would result in a situation at the termination of the lease of .$20,000 of stock outstanding with no corresponding assets. The company has recognized this situation and with ffood business prudence is amortizing the value of the lease annually out of earnings so that at the termination of the life of the lease other assets cf equal value will exist. If this policy i« carefully continued the purchaser of new stock in the future could have no reason to complain. This would not be true if the amortization policy is not continued. We are not unmindful of the fact that the placing of a value upon a leasehold at tne time the lease is secured and the issuance of capital against it as a stock dividend, or something akin thereto, is highly dangerous. It is limited only by the optimism of those who place the value upon the lease and is an anticipation of the future not unlike the so-called watering of stock of public utilities in days gone by in anticipation of future growth of business due to increasing density of population. . We think the record shows this lease ha.* value. That value may prove to be greater than that fixed by the appraisenient board, or it may prove to be much less. The value will depend upon earnings, or the equivalent of earnings in the saving of operating expenses over what otherwise would be necessary. To insure a continuation of this amortization policy we will require as a condition to the approval of the issues of common stock that before any dividends are paid, or set apart for future payment, on either common or preferred stock, an amount shall be passed from revenues to an amortization fund in such an amount as will eliminate the assets item of "Leaseholds 27th street garage" by the end of the lease period. Such fund shall be held in tangible property and shah not be: subject to capitalization nor to payment of dividends. Annual reports shall </seg>
            <seg id="p399">399 be made to the Commission showing; the balance sheet at the end of the current year and of the preceding year, and such other detail as will indicate that the conditions of the order are being complied with. On these terms the common stock now outstanding will be approved and validated. We see no objection to the approval of further issues of common stock, to be sold at reasonable market price, for the purpose of increas - ing the tangible property of the corporation necessary to the conduct of its business. The evidence is not sufficient for us to indicate at wliat minimum price other than par such stock should be sold. The approval will be granted subject to the company making such represen - tation, for brief supplemental order, as will cover the point of minimum price per share and the handling of the item of discount, provided the market will not absorb the stock at par.

Commissioner: In the original order herein it was provided that the selling price of the securities should not be less than par unless upon additional show - ing amendment, to this order were made. That finding was the result of lack of evidence as to the market value of the securities under ques - tion. Supplemental application has now been made, asking authority to sell the securities to net the company ninety per cent of par. It is set forth that the company desires to sell to employes, which sales will be made without charge to the' company, and that it is desired to sell to such employes at ninety per cent of par. The company also has ar - rangements made with a brokerage firm of Omaha to market any se - curities offered to the general public at a ten per cent commission. In view of the nature of the enterprise, the high competition of a large part of the business done, and the very heavy depreciation on the property, we consider the commission which the company asks authority to pay not out of reason. We will provide, however, that officers of the company shall receive no commission directly or indirectly from the sales of securities. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that effective on this date The Yel - low Cab &amp; Baggage company be ami it hereby is authorized to sell the securities approved in the original order herein to net the company not less than ninety per cent of the par value of the securities.

OPINION AND FINDING Hrowne, Commissioner: Through F. Montmorency, as chairman of a committee representing Nebraska carriers, authorized to speak for all of them, this application is made for authority to make certain reductions in freight rates and charges intrastate to conform generally, and as near exactly as may be. with reductions in freight rates and charges about to be made on interstate traffic in accordance with the finding of the Interstate Com- merce Commission in I. C. C. No. 13293. Carriers ask that we consider the application a.s falling under the statutory provisions governing emergencies and that they be authorized to publish tariffs effective on le&gt;&gt; than statutory notice. The present level of freight rates in Nebraska on intrastate traffic has generally resulted from the superior order of the Interstate Com - merce Commission in its docket No. 11829. imposing certain advances intrastate to conform in a general way with interstate rate advances. The action of the Interstate Commerce Commission was supported by federal injunction which in turn was deemed valid by the settlement of controverted, principles in the decision of the United States supreme court in Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R Co., 42 Sup. Ct. Rep. 232. More recently this intrastate freight rate level has had the approval of the Nebraska State Railway Commission in orders on Application No. 4299. dated April 7, 1922, and May 5, 1922, and by the cancellation of the Interstate Commerce Commission's order on docket No. 11829 the present freight rates in Nebraska rest upon the order of this Com - mission. The application for reduction is bottomed upon the same principles as underlay the authorized general advances. On interstate traffic the findings of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission in the territory of which Nebraska forms a part, read as follows: "That the existing freight rates and charges, including charges for switching and other, accessorial services and all other charges </seg>

This does not apply to rates or charges which have been reduced since August 2\ 1120, primarily for the purpose of removing all 6r a part, of the geneial increase of 1920. "(b) Where previously existing recognized iate relationships were maintained in applying the increases of August, l!'2O. &lt;r v.-heie rates have been readjusted since August 26. 1920. to restore pre - viously existing recognized rate relationships. Ir these cases, such recognized rate relationships should be maintained in applying tiie reductions herein prescribed; or, if that is impracticable in the first instance, the rates should be readjusted to restore such relationships as soon as practicable.

These general provisions in the finding of the Interstate Commerce Commission as to interstate traffic shall be followed by the carriers so far as applicable in making the reductions on intrastate traffic, whether such changes in rates referred to in the exceptions above quoted were made as applicable to Nebraska intrastate traffic upon the direct author - ity of the Nebraska State Railway Commission or or. authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission during any period when the Nebraska Commission lacked jurisdiction to consider amendments to intrastate freight tariffs, but since approved by us &gt;n a general finding.

The financial statement of the company as of May 31, 1922, shows liabilities as follows: The annual reports of the company for the five years ending De - cember 31, 1921, show that it has earned interest on the bonds and notes outstanding, certain dividends, and has passed a small amount t&lt;&gt; surplus, with the exception of the year 1919. The bills payable, there - fore, appear to represent no operating 1 obligations unearned such as interest on indebtedness. This order will provide that if notes of the company were given to stockholders in lieu of dividends such notes shall not be retired unless an equal amount were earned and used for addi - tions and betterments ir. lieu of being- paid out as dividends. The present bonds, in amount of $W0,000, bear six per cent interest and are due in 1936. They are secured by a closed first mortgage on the property. The company has been embarrassed by its inability to sell stock in recent years and by its inability to borrow further under the mortgage which now rests on :ill existing property.

The trust deed provides that from time to time other bonds may issue under this first mortgage, to be denominated '"Series B", "C'', "D", etc.. but that so long as the trust deed is in existerce any further issues of bonds shall not bear interest higher than 6% per cent and shall at no time in toto amount to more than two-thirds of the out- standing capital stock. kThe trust deed further provides that beginning in 1932 the company 1 arrange to amortize indebtedness at the rate of $10,000 per annum, amount of money to be paid to the trustee for the purpose of buying &gt;a in the open market.

It provides also that the company shall have the option between 1927 and 1932 of retiring on any interest date at 105, between 1932 and 1937 at 103, and after 1987 at 102. Applicant no doubt understands that in complying with the amorti - zation feature of the trust agreement the funds therefor must be se - cured from the fair return, the sale of other securities, or other sources not a burden on the public. The present bonds bear interest at six per cent, the proposed bonds at 6V4 per cent. The refunding will, therefore, be disadvantageous to the company. However, the other indebtedness of the company bears interest at eight and ten per cent. Its funding it will be financially advantageous. We are the more constrained to approve this financing by the fact that it appears the only feasible way for this company to continue to meet its common carrier obligations. A new territory is being opened along the Union Pacific extension from Oering into Wy - oming, which territory is within the legitimate district se.-ved by appli - cant. Construction funds must be secured. It is difficult to borrow on short-time notes and the interest rate is high. In approving the issue of these bonds we call attention to para - grjph 9 of section 2 of the trust deed, wherein it is stipulated as to the amount of depreciation reserve which shall be annually set up and the rule by which charges against that reserve shall be met. In our opin - ion this contract provision will be illegal whenever it contravenes the legitimate requirements of the proper regulating authorities, whether it be the state commissions of Nebraska and Wyoming or the Interstate Commerce Commission. We do not, however, consider this a bar to the approval of the securities. We finct an emergency existing by reason of the necessity of re - financing on or before August 1, 1!&gt;22, and this order will go into effect immediately.

Curtiss, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION' NO. 4902 rie Matter of the Application of the Beaver City Telephone Company for Authority to Increase its Switchiim Kates at the Edison Ex - change. * * » OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Chairman: About three years ago applicant purchased the telephone exchange at Edison. Previous to that time, and for many years, it had operated the system at Beaver City. The plant at Edison had greatly run down and its purchase by applicant was made largely at the solicitation of patrons at Edison who were desirous of securing improved service. Since the purchase the applicant has greatly improved the plant and now has it in good operating condition. It now asks that the switching rate of 25 cents per month which applies to approximately forty-five farmers who own and maintain their lines, be increased to 50 cents per month. The accounts of the com - pany are kept according to the Commission's uniform system of account - ing and the record for the twenty-one month period from January 1» 1921, to September 30, 1922, show that it is not making a fair return. </seg>
            <seg id="p407">407 If allowance is given- to the actual expenditures for maintenance and depreciation, the company earned during that period on an annual basis 3.3 per cent of the average plant value, and 2.9 per cent of the capital. The Commission hap found from numerous investigations that a rate of 25 cents per month for switching is inadequate and that a rate of 50 cents is reasonable under practically all circumstances. In this in - stance the company proposes to extend to its switched subscribers a free exchange of service with the neighboring town of Oxford. This will materially extend the zone of service which the farmers have here - tofore been receiving. The rate of 50 cents per month for switching, which applicant prays for will not be out of line with the present rate to .farm subscribers of $1.25 per month. The rate of 25 cents as now in effect amounts to a discrimination in favor of the switched sub - scribers. In other words, they are receiving a service from this com - pany, a portion of the cost of which is borne by the other subscribers. It follows, therefore, that the rate as applied for should be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Beaver City Telephone company he, and the same is hereby, authorized to charge and collect a rate of 50 cents per month for switching service fct its Edison ex - change, the same to become effective on and after January 1, 1923.

            <seg id="p408">408 additions and betterments to its property between December 31, 1917, and June 30, 1922. It desires the right to sell this stock at the price of 90. At the time of the hearing on the application, which was held on November 23 and December 2, 1922, the application was orally amended to ask that certain previous authorizations be changed in cer - tain particulars, towit: tta) That in place of the requirement that the :..ecurities be sold cash they might optionally be issued to meet any valid obligations. 1 b ) That the price be fixed at 90 for unsold portions of these prior authorizations. The other authorizations affected by this amendment to the appli - cation were as follows: 1. The order on Application 2369 dated November 15. 1915, ap - proving the issue of bonds or preferred stock, in face amount $122,730.42, to be sold, if bonds at 92 or more, if stock at not less than 95. The unsold portion of this application is now $36,468.00. 2. The order on Application 3298 as consolidated with Application 3667, said order dated June 17, 1918, and authorizing the issuance and t; of either stocks or bonds, in face amount $173,892.81, at not less n 85 for either class of securities. The company has charged against this application $5,600 of preferred stock sold in 1909 without being specifically charged against any authorization of issue. 3. The order on Application 3461 as consolidated with Application 3667; dated June 17, 1918, authorizing the issuance and sale of either stocks or bonds or both, in face amount $107,306.90, at not less than 85 percentum of face for either class of securities. 4. The supplemental order on Application 3667, dated October 1, 1919, the sole purpose of which was to renew the authorizations of Applications 3298 and 3461. which, as consolidated with Application 3667, had been appealed by the company to the supreme court of the state and reversed to the Commission with specific directions to proceed further. The matters dealt with by the court in reversing the decision of the Commission had nothing to do with the securities authorizations but to clear up the record a supplemental order was entered. By the authorizations mentioned above under (2) and (3) and repeated as per (4) above there have been no sales and the only debits against these authorizations are those shown in the testimony of the company, Ex - hibit No. 1. . . Hence, the amount involved in the present proceeding totals $452,136.15, of which $140,068.44 is being considered for the first time. To the application the city objects for various reasons, chief of which may be briefly stated as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p409">409 . 1.. That the proposed issue violates section 5, article 10, of the constitution of the state of Nebraska, both as to notice required and as to the requh-ement in the said paragraph of the constitution that dividends may not be paid unless earned. 2. That the proposed authorization violates section 6 of article 12 of the constitution of the state of Nebraska in that it is not shown that the equivalent in property delivered or labor done has been received by the corporation. 3. That in justification of the proposed issue the company has transferred as a book entry $200,000 from the heat, light and power rompany, a Nebraska corporation, to the assets of applicant company anil that this is a ficticious enlargement of assets. 4. That no proper credits have been made to plant for property abandoned and sold during the period involved in that portion of the application mainly set forth in this proceeding. Applicant has paid no dividends whatever from the beginning of the year 1918 to date. During that time it has haa outstanding an average of approximately $1,190,000 of preferred stock entitled to the first six per cent annually earned above the fixed charges. These dividends are cumulative. The accumulated obligations of the com - pany, then, with respect to this preferred stock were on June 30, 1922, approximately 8321,000 Ontrary to an impression that has been rather wide-spread, the failure of the company to pay any dividends on this preferred stock during this period was not entirely due to a failure to earn any net re - turn over and above the fixed charges. 'However, the transporation properties have been rather discouraging from an earning point of view, due to rapid increases in expenditures and to the constant dwindl - ing in volume of traffic. A check of the records indicates that during four and or.e-half years the transportation properties have earned net $55,866.54, from which dividends might have been paid. This low net earning does not, however, fully and accurately reflect the producing power of the transportation properties. At the time the Commission entered upon a comprehensive investigation of the value of applicant's properties it was stipulated and agreed, either verbally or in writing, that all net profits from all sources should be considered together in the making of rates pending the final adjudication of the value of the pro - perty and that not more than the dividends on the preferred stock should be paid. It was a period of violently fluctuating prices. Under this agreement or understanding it was not necessary for the Commission to repeatedly investigate and adjust the price at which steam w.as sold by applicant company to the heating company and the price at which electric current was figured in allocating between the electric and power departments and the transportation department. In the absence of an </seg>
            <seg id="p410">410 the net earning from the transportation company would have been somewhat higher than that indicated by the books. I From all sources the net return available for corporate purposes, »r fixed charges and taxes, for the four years and ten months be - ning January 1, 1918, and endin? November 1, 1922, was $384,087.96. This figure includes all net profits from the operation of the heating corporation, the stock of which is owned by applicant herein. None of these net earnings have been paid out a&lt; dividends. While the stockholder is more concerned with what became of such net earnings than are we in this proceeding, it might be stated in passing that the company's books show that $140,068.44 had been invested in fixed plant of applicant corporation, of which $18,366.78 is now repre - sented by notes payable on certain purchases of street cars and $14 : 084.41 by cost of pavement not yet paid for but against which city bonds have been sold. The company has paid off $96,000 of obligations in favor of the heating corporation and has credit with that company of $41,000. It has reduced its apparent interest-bearing obligations by something like $50,000. The company asks, however, in this proceeding tne right only to issue securities to cover the amount of additions and betterments to plant, electric and transportation, that have been made from net re - venues during the period under consideration. This is a proper and logical proceeding if the actual additions and betterments to plant have been the amount set forth in the application. As to the authorizations in Applications 3298 and 3461, renewed by supplemental order on Application 3667, the approval by the Commission of the amounts involved and its finding that these amounts represent additions and betterments to the plant from net earnings at various times, is, in our opinion, res judicata. A slight error in the supple - mental order, above referred to, in designating an amount of unsold securities, will be corrected. The company, however, asks to have the terms and conditions amended as we have heretofore stated. Had the securities been sold directly after the authorizations the proceeds would have been available for any proper corporate purpose, including payment of dividends, with the exception of a provision con - cerning $98,538.49, the proceeds from which were specifically designated for replenishment of depreciation reserve. Part of this debt, owed by the company to its depreciation reserve, has been paid out of earnings during the period under consideration. That fund had owed to it by the corporation $66,788.00 as of June 30, 1922, and $46,801.74 as of No - vember 1, 1922. The company is of the opinion that it has eash enough in hand to represent this depreciation reserve. We cannot agree that depreciation reserve and working capital are one and the same thing, although each may be represented in liquid assets. It appears, how - ever, that liquid or working assets are ample to cover any accrued re- </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 411 serve for depreciation and working capital, and that the restrictions of the previous order may well be lifted at this time. The purpose of the company is, of course, plainly evident from the record. It purposes paying its accumulated preferred stock dividends in stock and not in cash. There can be no valid objection to the prin - ciple involved. It makes no particular difference whether securities are sold for cash in order to restore cash to the treasury which has been borrowed for construction purposes and then to use this cash for the payment of dividends, or to use the securities in liquidating the obliga - tion direct. The proposed price of 90 cents on the dollar is well beyond the market price of the stock, although that market price has been for the past few years undoubtedly depressed by temporary conditions, chief of which is that the company in performing its obligations as a common carrier has been required to invest all available cash in additions and betterments and has had none left with which to pay dividends. . Details of the investment of the $140,000, which the company now desires to cover with an issue of stock, were set forth in Exhibit No. 2. At the request of the city supporting data has been filed covering the matter of abandonments of plant, such data presuming to show the irethod of arriving at the value of the displaced plant in order to sub - tiact it from the assets, the amount of salvage, or the value at which the recovered property went into material yard, and the manner in which such recovered property went again into plant, and also the manner in- which credit was given for the salvage. The engineer of Commis - sion has checked the estimates at which the property was written out of plant and has given the conclusions his approval. The accountant of the Commission has checked the book entries covering the subtrac - tion of property from plant, due to abandonments and the subsequent handling of the physical items, and has found them in .-trict compliance with our rules of accounting. Ordinarily the Commission would not authorize an issue of stock covering additions and betterments where a portion of such additions and betterments was still represented by outstanding notes payable, as i.s the case, in amount $32,451.19, in this record. However, it appears that this company has paid off other note obligations out of net earnings. If it hail elected to pay the particular note obligations which we have totaled above no question would now be presented. We consider it immaterial what particular obligations were paid and will not subtract from the amount asked to represent the outstanding notes payable on the street cars and the indebtedness for pavement. The city of Lincoln has not pressed its objections already men - tioned, but they should receive attention. We will take them up in order presented heretofore: 1. In the absence of a definition by the Commission or the legis- lature as to the manner of giving public notice it cannot be said that the ' </seg>
            <seg id="p412">412 company has violated the constitutional provision, although it might more properly have published its notice weekly throughout the sixty days. The constitution does not, as we read it. require that dividends paid should have been currently earned. To so interpret the constitution would destroy all value of creating a surplus cushion fund. A depreciation reserve has been charged currently against operat - ing revenues at the rate fixed by the Commission as sufficient to keep the investment intact and it must be assumed by the Commission that the property is not only currently maintained but that a reserve has been accumulated to take care of the unrealized depreciation during this riod. Otherwise the previous finding:* of the Commission have been error. 2. As already shown by the findings, the question is clear that pro - perty has been acquired equivalent in value to the amount of securities prayed for in this order, viz.: $140,068.44. •i. Our findings take no account of the transfer on the books of $200,000 from the heating company to applicant company except that in arriving at the total net earnings from all sources current profits from the heating company have been included. From that angle earnings from the transportation, light and power departments alone for the four and one-half years exceed the issue asked for. There still remains the question of whether our approval of an rie of preferred stock in amount of $350,000 or more in liquidation accumulated preferred stock dividends; in any way prejudices the conclusions which may be arrived at hereafter in the matter of the fair value of this company's property used and useful in the public service. We think not. The average amount of preferred stock, bonds and in - terest-bearing notes outstanding during the four-year period was $2,834,721, bearing interest and dividends at five and six per cent, with a small amount at a higher rate. On the basis of seven per cent as a fair return the amounts which have been paid out as interest on senior obligations and which have been accumulated as dividends on preferred stock would represent a return on a valuation of about two and one - quarter millions of dollars. We find that the proposed issue of $140,068.44 of preferred stock to be reasonably required for such purposes of this corporation as are authorized by the terms of article 17, chapter 12, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and in like manner find favorably on the amend - ments to preceding authorizations in order to permit the use of the securities in a way not technically authorized in those prior orders.

            <seg id="p414">414 APPLICATION NO. 4965 I the Matte::- of the Application of the First Farmers Electric District for Authority to Issue Securities. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: ► Application was filed November 7, 1922. by the First Farmers Eiec- DiFtrict of Sauivleis county for authority to issue bonds not to ex - ceed $30,000, face value, with the propertv of the district pledged to their payment, for the purpose of securing funds with which to con - struct an electrical distribution plant to serve the territory embraced within the district. This district is formed under the provisions of Axticle 7, chapter 67, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. Section 8 of said article, being' section 7153 of the statutes designated, provides that in the is - suance and sale of securities the provisions of chapter 14 of the Re - vised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, relating to public service corpor - ations shall be followed. It also provides that the rates to be charged by the district for service to those within the district shall first be ap - proved by the State Railway Commission. It is under this section only that application is made to this Commission. L Applicant district has filed a complete transcript of proceedines er which the district was formed and proceedings rifcce the' formation of the district to date. It does not appear that the law contemplates that this Commission shall scrutinize whether the district has been pro - perly organized, but the data at hand would give that information if that were a necessary part of our function. Chapter 14 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 provides that public service corporations shall issue securities, with due date more than twelve months from date of issuance, only after approval has been given by the State Railway Commission, which shall find inter alia that the capital to be secured by the issuance and sale of securities is reasonably required for the pur - poses of the corporation. The district involved comprises portions of Center. Marietta, Wa - hoo and Stocking, precincts, located east and north of the city of Wahoo. The district has employed an engineering firm to draft plans and to supervise construction. Copy of those plans are filed with the pleadings. Application also has been filed by the district, under pro - visions of article 3, chapter 67, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, for authority to construct the transmission lines. The manner pro - posed for the construction will be passed upon in order entered on that application. In the petitions filed with the board of county supervisors, asking for an election, it was set forth that the cost of the distribution system should be secured from the sale of bonds. Section 7 of the act provides </seg>
            <seg id="p415">415 that the board of directors shall determine the manner of providing for the operating expenses of maintenance and depreciation, the fixed charges, consisting of interest on the bonds, and the rrartner and method of retiring bonds. The board of directors has determined that the in - terest and the sinking fund for retirement of the bonds shall be secured from an annual tax levied on all taxable property within the district. The application and supporting data, as well as the testimony of the board of directors, set forth that it is proposed to issue all or the necessary part of $30,000 in bonds, bearing hVi per cent interest, each bond to he of denomination of $500, due and payable as follows: One thousand dollars each year for the first ten years and $2,000 per annum for the remaining ten years of the life of said bonds, together with all interest due and payable. By resolution of the board these bonds are he sold at not less than par. The board of directors has r.ot yet ascertained the exact cost of the distribution system. It proposes to ask for bids and to let a con - tract to the lowest and best bidder, reserving the right to reject any and all bids. It proposes further not to issue and sell bonds in excess of the cost of construction, plus a reasonable working capital. It pro - poses further to purchase current from the lighting plant of the city Wahoo. contract for which has already been entered into. The following schedule of rates is also submitted and approval of the Commission asked: For power: 50c per K. V.

We are not much impressed with the estimate of the engineersi either as to the volume of current that will be consumed or as to the expenses which will be incurred. Much depends upon the actual working out of the plan. JThe rates appear reasonable under all the circumstances, at least for a trial period. It is better to have them too high than not high enough for such initial period. It appears a fait construction of the statute that if after trial it is found that these rates are not the proper rates either to meet the expenses or to develop the maximum use of current the district will apply to the Commission for authority to alter the rates. We will, however, approve the schedule asked for and will require that the company file a financial statement at the end of each fiscal year after the beginning of operations.

Nebraska, not more than twenty years from date. At the option of the board of directors these bonds may be made callable on any interest payment date in any amounts which may appear advisable to the board of di - rectors to have shown in the indenture; provided, that said bonds shall be sold at not less than par and that the proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be used for the construction of the proposed electrical dis - tribution system and to secure working capital and for no other purpose. And it is further provided that not more than three per cent of the face value of the bonds sold shall be considered a proper expense for financ - ing.

            <seg id="p418">418 ORDERS ON RESOLUTIONS RESOLUTION NO. 49 In the Matter of the Investigation of the Finances of the Burchard Telephone Company. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: matter arises on resolution adopted by the Commission, on its motion, because from reports of defendant company ti the Commis - it appears that excessive dividends are being pair* to stockholders 1 year to year, and also that an unusually small amount of money was being spent annually upon maintenance and replacements. Upon this paper showing it appeared probable that the company was main- Ening a high dividend . rate at the expense of the properties and ulti - tely at the expense of its service. I The hearing held at the offices of the Commission developed what ia haps the most remarkable record of any telephone company in the te. Defendant is an independent company with forty-six stock - holders, largely local, with three hundred twenty-five subscribers, almost all receiving grounded service and with a rate of $1.25 per month for all classes of service, business, residence and farm. These rates have been in existence since the origin of the company in 1905 and have not been altered during the high war-time period of maintenance and oper - ation. The company's central office is locate. I in Burchard. in the center of territory which it exclusively occupies. It is a rich agricultural sec - tion, closely settled. The territory occupied is so compact that no tele - phone line appears on the map to be more than eight miles in length. After its incorporation the company sold $5,300 of stock and borrowed a like amount. There was not more than a normal amount of donated labor in construction as compared with similar independent companies. In course of time the company paid off its note obligations from earn - ings, and at the time of the inventory by the Commission's engineers two years ago it had physical properties the net worth of which exceeded the original investment. Its properties cost according to the engineer's estimate with normal allowances for general expenditures, whether paid or not, in excess of $20,000. The present worth of the properties based on cost was found by the engineers to be $11,800 in round figures. At the same time the company had not invaded its original investment, it had been able to pay all operating expenses and fixed charges and had been able to pay 18 per cent on the outstanding stock per annum. </seg>
            <seg id="p419">419 grounded telephone service. At the time of the hearing the officers of the company incited the Commission to find dissatisfaction as to service among its subscribers, declaring there was none. The record indicated that the remarkable showing made by this company has been due chiefly to these conditions: its officers have work - ed for nominal compensation; it occupies an unusually congested terri - tory with the maximum number of subscribers and the minimum amount of plant when compared with like companies in Nebraska; because of local condition.- it has been able to "farm out" the maintenance and operating labor costs at a price experienced in few other places in the state. Its rates began somewhat higher than rates of some other com - panies similarly organized. On the whole the level of the rates through - out the period of its history cannot be criticized when compared with the necessities of the average company in Nebraska. With the record before us we find that the fair value of the pro - perties of this company is $12,000, which fair value excludes all in - tangible values and considerations of any accretions due to higher price levels than were experienced by the company. No claim is made by the company for more than present worth of the company based on cost. In 1020 the company's operating revenues were $5,781. It spent $2,031 on maintenance and replacements and drew on its depreciation reserve in sum of $629 because of insufficient allowances for that class of expenditures against current revenues. It paid 15 per cent dividend on the outstanding stock and paid to surplus $1,994. When proper al - lowance ha&gt; been made for maintenance and replacements there would still be left in surplus earned more than $1,000. In 1921 the telephone operating revenues were $5,004. current maintenance and replacements amounting to SI, 590, which exceeded the set-up for these expenditures by $251 with nothing remaining for accrued depreciation. The com - pany paid 10 per cent dividends on the outstanding stock and when proper consideration has been given to a proper accrual for depreciation reserve there would be remaining a profit and loss or surplus earned of more than $700. If dividends had been paid on the fair value of the property in the past two years, am! indeed for several years last past, the returns paid would not be materially beyond the reasonable. The record does not show that the company has added to its properties in extensions and betterments to any degree in the past two years. Tiie record here set forth of this small independent company is one of which it can be prouu. During- the history of the company its orig - inal stockholders have been unusually well compensated. At the same time the patrons of the company have enjoyed at least reasonable rates when compared with an equal period of time in the general surrounding territory. To call upon the company lo rtduce its rates is to frown </seg>
            <seg id="p420">420 upon rhe high business sagacity exercised by its officers in the past decade and a half. At the same time we do not feel that the company - is properly protected for the future. Its switchboard is old, having outlived the normal life of switchboards. Our engineer found tKis board almost worn out two years ago. The annual reports do not in - dicate its replacement yet. If this is so the company must run no further risk, but must replace the board this year. We will make this a part of the order. Its lines show indication of necessity for rapid re - construction in the future. There were on January 1 heavy accounts receivable outstanding but no cash on hand. The annual set-up on a monthly basis for maintenance and depre - ciation was arrived at by the Commission's accountants from the pro - perty showing of the company, and proves to be insufficient. This has been the case for the last two years and possibly longer. The company will, therefore, transfer from its surplus account $1,500 to its deprecia - tion reserve account, this being a bookkeeping matter only to more properly reflect the existing condition of the property. It will be re - quired also to limit its dividends to 7 per cent on rate base of $12,000 plus a like amount on any future sales of stock or borrowings for con - struction or for unusual replacement?. It will also, as rapidly as possible, secure from its revenues and carry in liquid securities an amount of not less than 51,000 as an insurance of its ability to make extraordinary replacements. When this fund is &lt;ira\vn upon for that purpose it shall again be replenished at the earliest practicable date. The company will also set up on a monthly basis for maintenance, re - placements and reserve for unrealized depreciation $2,000 per annum until further order of this Commission. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Burchard Telephone company be, and the same is hereby, ordered and directed to pass from its surplus account to its de - preciation reserve $1,500. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company set aside for the year H&gt;22 until further order of the Commission $2,000 per annum on a prorated monthly basis for maintenance and- replacements and reserve for accrued depreciation, charges against which fund shall be in accor - dance with rules for accounting provided by the Commission. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall take steps as early as practicable this year to replace its switchboard, and to that end shall report to the Commission as of date June 1, 1922, as to what has been done.

            <seg id="p421">421 RESOLUTION NO. 61 In the Matter of the Investigation of the Alleged Violation of Certain Provisions of the Nebraska Statutes by the Fordyce Farmers Tele - phone Company. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner : (^application of the Fordyce Farmers Telephone company, newly .orgafeiaad as a common carrier at that time in the state, the Commission "authorized rates for telephone service effective June 1, 1920, as follows: Business service _^ i S2.00 per moruh. Parwi service 1.40 " Residence service 1.40 " Switching service .50 The exchange was a small one and it did not appear that even under these schedules the company would be in a favorable financial condition. For local reasons the board of directors elected not to publish the ite authorized by the Commission, but a rate fifteen cents per month lower for residence and farm service. This action on the part of the iioard of directors 'was in violation of the statutes and on June 15, 1921, at which time the 'Commission first learned of the alleged violation, the company was cited to appear and show cause why action in court should not be taken against it for violation of section 232, chapter 67, Revised statutes of Nebraska for 1913. At the hearing on July 7, 1921, the company was represented by its -ecretary. The evidence showed that, in common with a good many other similar occurrences, the company had taken action innocent of the law and while in court this is not a defense against violation it has long been recognized by the Commission as a sufficient defense if no actual harm has been done. The company acted in accordance with its best judgment even though illegally. As soon as possible the board of directors increased the charges to those set forth in the Commission's original order, effective August 1, 1921. Informally the company was told that its previous rates would be validated in order that it might be technically within the law and that it might proceed on that assumption. The Commission has no desire, however, to compel the company to charge rates in excess, of those under which it now feels it can oper - ate. It is charged with the rates set forth in the order of June 1, 1920, but if the company now feels that it can return to the rate of $1.25 for residence and farm service and will file a written statement to that effect the Commission will approve the reduction. It will be assumed that if such reduction has the approval of subscribers and that if service suffers in consequence, and through no other reason, the diminished service will have been elected by those who urged the reduction. </seg>

            <seg id="p423">423 RESOLUTION NO. 65 In the Matter of Reduction in Hours of Service at Depots by Chicago. Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company at Certain Stations. Appearances: For C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., Jesse L. Root, attorney; For pptrons at Berwyn, L. G. Davolt and Roy L. Welsh. Browne, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing in the offices of the Commission on May 12, 1922, on our own motion, following receipt of various in— formal complaints from patrons at Burlington points to the effect that hours of service had been reduced so as to interfere with necessary con - venience cf patrons. The complaining towns were Hazard, Berwyn, Ragan. South Minden, Comstock, Giltner and Guide Rock, with additional complaints at the last moment on behalf of Hyannis, Mullen. Whitman and-Thedford. By the disposition of this investigation of the Commis - sion, Informal Complaints No. 6224, 6168, 6229 and 6187 will be dis - posed of. At the time of the hearing the carrier had received notice of only j portion of these complaints but was able to develop all essential facts fro'ip its point of view. Public representatives were present only from Berwyn. At the close of the hearing the Commission directed that the case would be held open a reasonable time so that the carrier might take up the matters in dispute with the various towns in an effort to read - just hours to the best satisfaction of the people served in the towns. As a result of these conferences since the hearing the Commission has been notified of agreements at Berwyn, South Minden, Corrsiock and Giltner. Just prior to the hearing Guide Rock withdrew its complaint. For many years station agents in Nebraska worked on a twelve our basis, being confined as closely to the task as circumstances required. Just prior to the period of government control the basis was reduced to ten hours in twelve and straight overtime was paid for addi - tional work. ' During the period of government control rules were put into effect whereby agents were required to work only eight hours for straight time pay and the eight hours might not be in split shifts. All time beyond eight hours was paid time and a half. This rule continued after the railroads were returned to their owners. In an effort to per - fect economies the carriers generally reduced the hours of service at country stations and adopted such devices for additional time as helpers and custodians to meet trains scheduled at those towns at times not falling within the eight hours straight time of the agent. We had many complaints regarding this reduction in hours of service and adjustments were made where found essential for the public interest. On March 3, 1922, the rule regarding hours of service of station agents was modified by the United States Labor Board to provide for </seg>
            <seg id="p424">424 eight hours service in a twelve hour period between the time of starting and the time of closing of the day's work. Several shifts might be re - quired daily of the agent without additional pay provided the periods during which he was released from duty should not in each instance be less than one hour. Pay for the ninth hour of service was pro-rata and thereafter at time and one-half. Under this arrangement the readjustments in hours have taken place which gave rise to these various informal complaints. The re - adjustments were for the purpose of having agents on duty when trains arrived and tc secure further economies by dispensing, where the carrier deemed it practicable, of helpers and custodians. Careful consideration leads to the conclusion that no other general rule can be made to apply than that the hours of service must be suffi - cient at each station to not greatly interfere with patrons who transact business with the railroad company. Generally speaking, however, complaints of this character will have to be handled individually because the circumstances at different points vary considerably. At very many points in Nebraska the train service is so arranged as to be both early and late each day. It is highly advisable to have the agent on duty at time of arrival of train. Unless overtime is to be paid for at time and a half, or additional employes installed, there .will, at many stations, be certain periods during the day when the station will be closed. Whether this results in unreasonable inconvenience, not warranted by the pur - pose, will depend upon circumstances. It is not a sufficient complaint that it is something- new. These hours when the station is closed during the business day ought not frequently to be changed and then only after such notice to the public as will keep them a&lt;!vised of railroad business hours. . The Commission desires to encourage economies !n operating the railroads as an essential element in future reductions in rates. It de - sires also to insure, as far as it may, adequate station service. To that end it will investigate all complaints on this subject and make such orders as necessities require. tin the Dresent instance we are able to pass over the complaints at i points where agreements were reached that were reasonably sat - tory to the patrons. There remain two stations where no such ements were apparently arrived at. namely: Ragan and Hazard. At Ragan they desire the station open twelve hours continuously. For a considerable time prior to last spring the station was open from 6:45 a. m. to 3:45 p. m. This did not enable the agent to meet one of the freight trains and the night passenger train. A custodian was, therefore, essential. This custodian was the wife of the agent who met the evening passenger train, sold tickets and checked baggage. By rearrangement of the schedule the agent's hours are now 7:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. and 1:00 p. m. to 7:00 p. m. The recess U, therefore, four </seg>
            <seg id="p425">425 hours in the middle of the day. This is the basis of the complaint. No trains are due during this period. It is not necessary to bill live stock. We do not have any adequate testimony from the citizens as to the ex - tent of the inconvenience but it apparently consists of an occasional telegram which cannot be sent during the recess hours. We have not sufficient information to warrant directing any change at this time in the hours of service at Ragan. At Hazard, for a period succeeding March t, last, the hours of service were split to three shifts, namely: 4:45 a. m. to 6:00 a. m., 7:15 a. m. to 11:30 a.m. and 2:15 p. m. to 4:45 p. m. These peculiar hours were in order to handle the mail, according to testimony. The mail is now handled by government employes and the hours of service are now 7:15 a. m. to 4:15 p. m. with lunch time at noon. Against this the com - plaint is lodged. The complaint consists of letters from the local banker which dwell more upon the high level of freight rates than on station service. Here again we have insufficient detail on which to t&gt;ase a conclusion as to whether the service is sufficient to meet the moderate needs of those doing business at Hazard with the railroad company. We will dismiss this complaint with leave to citizens to file again in more detail as to the disadvantages arising from the present ■jrs of service. There remains the group complaint relative to towns Thedford and ive&gt;t. On this general complaint no facts were presented We cannot at this time see the reason for it. Whitman was complained about al - though it has 24 hour service each day. Mullen has service by agent and helper from 1:15 a. m. to 4:00 a. m. and from 6:30 a. m. to 5:00 p. m. Thedford has station service from 4:15 a. m. to 8:15 p. m. and Hyannis from 8:00 a. m. to 5:00 p. m. It is evident that the complaint •nncerning these towns should be dismissed without prejudice to its re - filing with some cogent data back of the complaint indicating a lack of reasonable station facilities and service. We will expect the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company to follow the practice of posting conspicuous notices in its depot at least one week prior to any change in the hours of service of its agent and helpers and to advertise the change locally to the end that the pub - i.ic rr.ay be well advised as to the periods when business may not be transacted with the carrier. Order to this effect will not be entered unless essential. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the informal complaints of citizens of Ragan and Hazard regarding hours of depot service of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, be and they are dis - missed without prejudice, and also the complaint filed generally for the towns of Whitman, Mullen, Thedford and Hyannis. </seg>

(SEAL) RESOLUTION NO. 66 In re Service and Equipment of Philpot Telephone Lines. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing in the offices of the Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p427">427 on this date as result of an order to show cause directed against W. J. Philpot, owner of certain telephone lines in Cass county, because of complaint by certain of his subscribers against the class of service being rendered by him. The case at first had been set down for hearing on May 10, 1922, on complaint of Philip Schafer. Neither complainant nor defendant appeared and the order citing defendant to come in was thereafter issued. By agreement no record or formal taking of testimony was had, defendant frankly confessing that his lines were out of condition and must be repaired. It appears from statements of Mr. Philpot that his small system of approximately twenty-five subscribers originated as a private line for personal service in a day when rural telephones were not numerous. From time to time the plant was enlarged to give ac - commodation to people in the immediate vicinity until at the present time lines occupy almost exclusively a major portion of the township. Switching is done at Weeping Water. W. J. Philpot is sole owner. His rates are S15.00 per annum and have not been changed during the high price era. Mr. Philpot is a large farmer and stock raiser. He does not desire to be in the telephone business and is thus engaged mainly by force of circumstances. No question exists but that Mr. Philpot owns a small common r.arrier company. The subscribers are entirely dependent upon him for the class of service rendered. The plant is old and must soon be extensively reconstructed. Ouv telephone engineer made a survey of the property and finds it in bad physical condition, with many poles broken and rotted, insulation poor or gone, and tree interference heavy. The wires are badly rusted and transmission is weak. All these things defendant admitted. We find that the plant has been neglected and that the service is poor beyond reasonable excuse. We find further that it is the duty, under the law, of defendant to take steps promptly to eliminate, to a veasonabie degree, the lack of proper service and give such service as may reasonably be demanded at the rates paid. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that W. J. Philpot, his successors or assigns, be, and they are, hereby ordered and directed, within sixty days, to (a) Replace the broken poles, trim trees as necessity requires so as to eliminate short circuiting, install new wire where wire is so badly rusted as to interfere with transmission, and to correct faulty insula - tion; or (b) Dispose of the property to a commercial company or to a local organization which may be formed in the community for the pur- </seg>
            <seg id="p428">428 pose of purchasing the existing Philpot telephone properties, thereby dividing the responsibility of maintenance. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that not later than July 15 said de - fendant Philpot, or his successors or assigns, shall report in writing to the Commission what steps have been taken and what acts completed in compliance with those findings.

(SEAL) RESOLUTION NO. 67 In the Matter of Designating Certain Terminal Points Under the Pro - visions of Section 1, Chapter 243, Laws of Nebraska, 1915. OPINION AND FINDING Taylor, Chairman: Chapter 243, Section 1, Laws of Nebraska, 1915, commonly known as the public grain warehouse law, provides that elevators or grain ware - houses at terminal points shall be excepted from the provisions of the act, that portion of Section 1 being as follows: "Any grain elevator or grain warehouse (other than at tein-.ina points, which terminal points shall be designated by the State Rail - way Commission) in which grain is held in storage for a perio.1 longer than ten days is hereby declared a public warehouse with the meaning of this act, etc." It will be noted that the law contemplates that the State Railway Commission shall determine what are terminal points within the mean - ing of the statute. No definition of terminal points is contained in the act, that being a matter left wholly to the discretion of this Commission. In 1915, when the law first became effective, the Commission desig - nated Omaha as the only terminal market in Nebraska. This selection was made after a public conference with grain dealers representing all of the interests in the state. It appeared that at that time Omaha was the only point in the state that had a grain exchange and which main - tained a market at which grain could be shipped for sale or upon con - signment ami at which there were daily quotations of prices. It was the only point in the state at that time, moreover, at which there was inspection of grain. It appeared to the Commission that these facts and circumstances established Omaha as a terminal grain market. It is now brought to the notice of the Commission that Lincoln and Superior have established markets which meet the conditions above outlined. The Commission has had informal conferences with accredit - ed representatives of these two cities at which full inquiry was made as </seg>
            <seg id="p429">429 to the methods of purchasing and handling grain at those points. It appears that they compare in all respects with the methods in effect in Omaha. There are organized, and actively functioning, grain ex - changes in both cities. Federal inspectors pass upon all grain sold in or consigned to these points. It follows that there are established markets at both places at which quotations on all kinds and grades of grain are made daily. It would appear, therefore, that Lincoln and Superior should be designated as terminal points and thus made exempt from the provisions of the warenouse law. ORDER IT IS THP:REFORE ORDERED that the cities of Lincoln, Nebras - :a, and Superior, Nebraska, be, and the same are, hereby designated as Terminal points for the handling of grain, as provided in Section 1, Chapter 243, Laws of Nebraska, 1915, this order to become effective on after the date hereof.

SEAL RESOLUTION NO. 70 In the Matter of the Investigation of Local and .loin I Rates and Carload Minimum Weights Applicable on Cement, in Carload Lots, between all Stations in Nebraska. OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: By the terms of this resolution, dated August 22, 1922, the Com - mission entered upon an investigation, on its own motion, as to the law - fulness of existing local and joint rates and minimum weights applicable on cement moving between all stations in Nebraska; with a view to prescribing a scale (or scales) of rates and carload minimum weights which will be reasonable, just and non-discriminatory for future appli - cation in Nebraska. A hearing was held at Lincoln, September 11, 1922. All Nebraska lines, The Nebraska Cement company of Superior, Nebraska, and the </seg>
            <seg id="p432">432 Lincoln' Chamber of Commerce were represented, and assisted in de - veloping: the facts of record in this case. A brief statement concerning the history of the existing cement rate structure in Nebraska may prove helpful in considering the situation here under review. In formal case? No«. 252 and 271. cen.ent producers located at Su - perior, Nebraska, complained as to the rates in effect from that point to the territory lying- north and east thereof, which is the most densely populated section of our state and the heaviest area of cement con - sumption. After due hearing and investigation, we prescribed specific commodity rates, applicable on cement from Superior to points in Ne - braska lying east thereof, and on or south of the Platte River. We also required such specific commodity rates to be used as the basis for rates from Superior to points north of the Platte River, using the Class 1) rate from the basing point to destination, where such combinations would produce rates lower than the Class D rate otherwise applicable on the continuous mileage from Superior to destination. Cement moving under these rates was subject to a carload minimum weight of 30,000 The rate adjustment outlined was in effect when the United States took over the railroads for war time operation January 1, 1918, and the resulting rates were increased in accordance with the provisions of General Order 28. The further increases in Nebraska rates authorized by I. C. C. Docket 11829 and our order in Application No. 4299, produced the level of cement rates here under consideration. At the time our decisions in cases 252 and 271 were made, the rates in effect from ceiv.ent producing points in other states to Nebraska, were the result of carrier and market competition; and manifestly there was no interstate rate standard with which our rates could be compared &gt;-r harmonized. After an exhaustive investigation, ending early in 1918, the Inter - state Commerce Commission handed down its decision in docket 8182, Western Cement Rates. 48 I. C. C. 201, wherein it prescribed specific rates from cement producing points to important consuming points designated as Key points, and required that certain scales of rates should be applied, in and between territories described in the report; as maxima for interestate shipments. All of the rates so prescribed were subject to a carload minimum weight of 50,000 pounds, with the further pro - vision that carloads of 38,000 pounds might be transported at rates 13 per cent higher than those applicable on the 50,000 minimum. That portion of Nebraska lying east of a line through O'Neill, Spalding, Central City, Grand Island, Hastings and Lester was included in Scale III territory, in which rates somewhat lower than those appli - cable in Scale IV territory, which included the balance of the state— </seg>
            <seg id="p433">433 were applied. The order of the Interstate Commerce Commission did not prescribe rates to apply on the intrastate cement traffic of any state, although it did point out the desirability of having substantially similar rates to jrovern the movement of like and contemporaneous cement ship - ments moving in state and interstate commerce. The director general of railroads publishe.l the rates so prescribed, after subjecting them to the increases named in his General Order 28. The director general did not attempt to make state rates in Nebraska conform to the basis fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission; and it will be remem - bered that the powers of this Commission were largely curtailed during the war period, as an incident of federal operation of our railroads for military purposes. The rate adjustment described above was continued in effect after .March 1. 1920, subject to a limited power of revision on our part, until after September 1, 1920, by the provisions of Section 208-A of the Transportation Act. Before September 1, 1920, the Interstate Commerce Commission lorised general rate increases in Ex Parte 74, which increased Scales III and IV cement rates 35 per cent. Similar increases in Nebraska cement rates were made in compliance with the order of the commission I. C. C. Docket 11829 Interested producers and consumers of cement filed petitions with the Interstate Commerce Commission in February, 1921, seeking a re - vision of the rates applicable in Scales III and IV territories. The Western Cement Rate Case, supra, was reopened, and representatives of the Nebraska Commission were present at the subsequent hearings, and offered testimony and suggestions as to the existing interstate cement rates affecting Nebraska, and the proposals as to rates for luture application. As a result of this proceeding, the Interstate Com - merce Commission entered an order on July 10, 1922, 69-1. C. C. 644. establishing new scales of rates applicable to cement moving in scale territories III and IV, which substantially affect the interstate rates on this important commodity to all Nebraska destinations. The order in question becomes effective on October 27, 1922. As a result of the rate history outlined above, there are substantial differences in the state and interstate rates applicable between points m this state for similar hauls; and in some cases the state rate between two points is higher than the interstate rate between the same points over a longer route. Examples of these differences are shown below, and it should be remembered that greater rate differences would exist after the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission becomes effec - tive on October 27, unless we correct this situation by our order in this case. </seg>

At this point it seems proper to call attention to the fact that the new rates named in the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, if applied to the movement of this commodity from Superior to des- tinations in southeastern Nebraska, would produce some increases in rates, as well as reductions. This situation is shown by the subjoiner table. Table II. Rates in Cents per ( wt. From Superior To Distance State Rate Interstate Rate Jub 1 On ICC basis July 1 Fairbury 62 mi. 10.5 10.5 11.

The Nebraska Cement company, which operates a cement n-.ill Superior, Nebraska, has no objection to the establishment of rates. whic conform to the basis prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission for Scale IN and IV territories generally. It does, however, object to any change iti the existing rate from Superior to Omaha. It contends that the present rate of 12.5 cents per cwt. is necessary to permit the sale of Superior cement on the Omaha market, in competition with other cement producers. The Superior company also states that its mill can reach but few large consuming points on a rate base which permits the company to dispose of its surplus production or keep the mill in oper- ation during periods of light demand. Witnesses for Nebraska car- riers discussed the rates applicable from Superior to Omaha, and offered no justification for the increase in such rates which would follow a strict adherence to Scale III rates; and, in fact, we may properly conclude from the testimony submitted that they are inclined to the view that the existing rate should be continued in effect, to accord the Superior ce- ment mill fair and equitable treatment. Based on volume of traffic and other transportation conditions which should be considered, we are not convinced that the existing rate from Superior to Omaha should be increased. Our order will therefore require the continuance of the existing rate from Superior to Omaha, with the understanding that if </seg>

No objection to the interstate minima was voiced by any Nebraska interest, and the ate&gt; prescribed herein will therefore be subject to the minimum weight if 50,000 pounds, with a proviso requiring the movement of carloads carrying- 38,000 pounds, on the basis of rates 13 per cent higher than the basic scales herein found reasonable. 'Upon consideration of all the facts of record in this case, we are the opinion that the cement rates now in effect between stations in Nebraska are unjust and unreasonable, insofar as they exceed the rates prescribed in the subjoined order.

Group C. The rates shown in Column C. shall be applied between points located in groups A and B. Exception. The rate of 12.5 cents per cwt. now applicable from Superior to Omaha shall be continued in effect after October 27, and shall be applied as a maximum at directly intermediate points on the lines of carriers participating in the movement from Superior to Omaha. All of the rates herein prescribed are subject to a carload minimum weight of 50,000 pounds; provided, however, that the tariffs of all lines establishing such rates shall provide an alternative minimum weight of 38,000 pounds, subject to rates thirteen per cent higher than the rate applicable on the standard 50,000 pound minimum.

OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission By our order dated August 31, 1922, instituting the above entitled proceeding, a hearing was set down to be held at our offices in Lincoln on September 14, 1922. At the hearing in question Messrs. Steele, of the Blue Valley Sand company and Du Val, of the Du Val Sand company, both residing at Fairbury, appeared on behalf of shippers. Judge Holmes, of Lincoln, </seg>
            <seg id="p439">439 and J. C. La Coste, of Kansas City, appeared on behalf of The Chicago. Bock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company. In the course of the hearing testimony was submitted by shippers to the effect that the existing rate of 2.5 cents per cwt., applicable on sand and gravel from the Du Val and Blue Valley Sand Pit spurs to Fairbury, is of little or no service to the people of that community since the cost of railroad transportation at present exceeds the cost of trans - porting this commodity from the pits to the building or other con - struction jobs at Fairbury by the use of wagons or motor trucks. Ship - pers^ contended that they would gladly avail themselves of rail trans - portation facilities if they were permitted to ; do so on the basis of reasonable rates for the service involved and that the movement of sand by rail would facilitate the business of several industries at Fair - bur.y and would be most desirable in connection with the movement of paving materials for a rather large paving program which is now con - templated at this point. Testimony was submitted by J. A. Little, rate expert for the Com - mission, indicating that for switching services involving similar hauls in the vicinity of Central City, Grand Island, Fremont and Endicott a charge of $0.00 per car is Tiade and that for a considerably longer haul from pits near Columbus to that point a charge of $13.50 is applied. Witnesses for defendants called attention to charges applicable on movements for similar .listances at points in Kansas which were as high ami in some cases hig'ier than the charges assessed under existing rates at Fairbury. The cii'rier's witness was not informed as to the move - ment of sand under the rates compared and was not conversant with the. circumstances sirrounding the publication and application of the rate in question. In view of all ♦ le facts of record in the case it is our conclusion and we hereby find that the rate of 2.5 cents per one hundred pounds, now applicable on sand and gravel moving from the Blue Valley Sand Pit and Du Val Sand Pit to Fairbury, is unreasonable and excessive. We further find that a rate of $9 per car for such movement is just, reasonable and compensatory.

Bergen, assistant traffic manager Omaha Chamber of Com - merce. A. L. Lierk, for Omaha Steel Co. J. A. Little, rate expert, for the Commission OPINION AND FINDING By the Commission: tThis matter came on for hearing at Lincoln, October 31, L922, pur - t to the provisions of our order of investigation dated September The gravamen of public complaint concerning the imposition of car rental charges of $3.00 per car, applicable in connection with intra - terminal and inter-terminal switching; as shown in Missouri Pacific G. F. D. No. 7 and 4778-C, seems to be that the switching charges in effect are already as high as those imposed by other lines for similar services at the same terminals, without including car rental, and that the car rental is assessed at some points and waived at others, with no ap - parent differences in circumstances and conditions. The evidence shows that the general basis for intra-teiminal and inter-terminal switching charges, applicable at Nebraska stations on the Missouri Pacific with - out the addition of a car rental charge, is the same as that applicable generally at points on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy and Union Pacific Railroads for similar services performed in any of the states served by those lines. The facts in this connection are shown by the in subjoined table: Intru- Car Total Terminal Rental .. Jti.30 per car $3.00 *!'.3O - 6.30 per car 6.30 6.30 _ 6.30 per car G.30 </seg>
            <seg id="p443">443 Car Total Inter- Terminal Rental Mo. Pacific $3.15 per car $3.00 $6.15 L'n. Pacific . 1 3.15 per car 3.15 C. B. &amp; Q. 3.15 per car 3.15 Applies at all stations on the system (except lines in Missouri) where .specific charges are not named. X Applies at all Union Pacific Station* where specific charges are not named. Applies at all C. B. &amp; Q. stations where specific charges are not named, excepting lines in Montana and Wyoming where intra-ter - n:inal is $5.85 per car. The testimony shows that this car rental charge is assessed at Omaha and all points in Nebraska excepting Lincoln, Louisville and Superior. No explanation for the more favorable treatment accorded shippers at Lincoln, Louisville and Superior, has been offered by respondent. Shippers located on Missouri Pacific rails at Omaha call attention to the fact that cars loaded for inter-terminal movement from their plants are subject to car rental charges, but that the same car moving in the reverse direction is not. No justification for this situation was offered by respondent. The Missouri Pacific contends that car rental should be included as part of its switching charges, and asserts that the total charges so arrived at are justified by cost of service, as measured in part by the per diem earnings which cars engaged in switching serv - ice might have earned during; a similar period on the lines of other com - panies. This showing is not convincing, and we find it hard to escape the conclusion that there is no justification for the imposition of so-called car rental charges, in addition to intra or inter terminal switching chareres already as high as tho&lt;e generally applied by other Nebraska lines, and as high as the charges assessed for similar services at Lincoln and else - where on respondent's lines, where the car rental is waived. In a recent case the Interstate Commerce Commission considered the inter-terminal switching charges applicable on live stock from East St. Louis to St. Louis points served by the Missouri Pacific (St. Louis Independent Packing Company, et al., v. C. &amp; A. Ry., et al, 73 I. C. C. 459-«5i and held that on and after July 1, 1922, the Missouri Pacific should assess a charge of $3.15 per car for its inter-terminal switching service. This is the charge now generally applied by the Missouri Pacific for inter-terminal switching at Nebraska points, if the car rental charge were eliminated. In general, we know of no case where common carriers have been permitted by any regulatory authority to apply car rental charges in connection with either switching or road haul service, for the use of ordinary freight equipment and the farts in this case do not justify an exception to this general rule. After carefully reviewing all the facts of record in this case, we are of the opinion and find that the car rental </seg>

Thereafter, on January 27, 1921, an order was made and entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its Docket No. 11829, by which it #as determined that the rates, fares and charges reqaired by the Ne - braska state authorities were found to subject interstate traffic and persons and localities outside the state of Nebraska to undue prejudice and disadvantage and to constitute unjust discrimination against inter - state commerce. Thereafter, this suit was instituted and on the 21st day of February. 1921, a temporary order of injunction was entered restraining the de - fendants from enforcing certain sections of the statutes of Nebraska and from taking any other action that would prevent, or tend to prevent, plaintiff, its agents and servants, from collecting the rates, fares and charges intrastate as authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion in its said order in Docket No. 11829. On the 5th day of May, 1922, the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion duly made and entered the following order:* Taylor, Chairman: "It appearing that the form of the amendatory order issued in this case on April 7. 1922, raises a doubt as to what would be the status of intrastate rates in Nebraska in the event the Interstate Commerce Commission revokes its order in Nebraska Rates, Fares and Charges, Nc. 11829, we are of the opinion that the form of saifl order should be modified so as to remove, so far as possible, such doubt.

This dismissal the Railway Commission refused to grant and proceeded to a final hearing and de - termination, at the close of which it dismissed the cause. S Complainants urge that the Commission was in error in refusing to smiss the cause, at the time complainants first made the request, and that a dismissal after a hearing and on the merits was prejudicial to them. The order of the Commission granted no affirmative relief against complainants and in no way commanded action or restrained action on the part of complainants. It does not appear that the order of dismissal entered by the Rail - way Commission has in any way prejudiced, embarrassed or controlled the complainants, nor do they show that they were in any way aggrieved by the dismissal of their cause, which dismissal they had in fact prayed for. It does not appear that the parties interested in this proceeding have presented to this court any justifiable controversy involving the substantial rights of the parties or seeking any remedy for any wrong committed.

The re - lief prayed was denied and complainants have appealed. </seg>
            <seg id="p455">455 I A line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company ex - ids from St. Louis, Missouri, by way of Kansas City and St. Joseph, ssouri, Falls City, Table Rock and Wymore, Nebraska, to Denver, lorado. A line of the Union Pacific Railroad company extends from nsas City, Missouri, to Lincoln, Nebraska, by way of Topeka and nhattan, Kansas, and Beatrice, Nebraska. The city of Wymore is ated in the south central part of Gage county on the line of the icago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company and the village of Blue rings is located one mile north of the city of Wymore on the line of Union Pacific Railroad company. The two lines of railroad inter - t. 2M: miles east of the Burlington depot at Wymore and run parallel one another in a northwesterly direction about one mile. The Bur - lington line then takes a more westerly direction and enters the city of Wymore, while the Union Pacific line takes a more northerly direction and enters the village of Blue Springs. There is no physical connection between the two roads either at Wymore, Blue Springs, or the point of intersection, where cars may be transferred from one road to the other. The nearest point at which transfers may be made is the city of Beatrice, 13 miles distant from the city of Wymore. Adjacent to the lines of railroad, where they parallel one another, there is a stone quarry from which is shipped large quantities of rock in carload lots varying from 400 to 500 cars a year. Each railroad has a spur track on its line to handle this freight. The rock to be shipped over the Union Pacific line is loaded directly from the rock-crusher to the car by means of a chute. The rock to be shipped over the Bur - lington line, because of the absence of physical connection between the two lines, is hauled from the chute of the rock-crusher across both lines of track with teams and put on a dump from which it is loaded into the cars. The "round trip" for this haul is approximately 1500 feet. The testimony shows that the cost of loading the cars on the Union Pacific track, through the chute from the rock-crusher, is merely nominal, while the cost of loading by means of teams on the Burlington line runs from $2 to $4 a car. ,The shipments vary from year to year, but during the first nine months of 1918 there were shipped over the Burlington 142 cars, and 130 cars were shipped over the Union Pacific In the year 1912, 594 cars were shipped over the Burlington. As the record stands it presents a showing of an ice plant on the land of the Union Pacific Railroad company at Blue Springs which is inconvenienced because of the ab - sence of the physical connection asked. However, the showing as to this industry is not strong, and, since the argument in this court, the owners of the plant have filed in substance a disclaimer of interest in this proceeding. The Farmers Lumber &amp; Grain company, doing business at Wymore, complains chiefly of its inability to handle Rock Springs coal which originates on the line of the Union Pacific because of the added freight </seg>
            <seg id="p456">456 Irge by reason of the shipment having to travel north to Beatrice and nee south to Wymore, or a truck haul from Blue Springs. The timony on behalf of complainants show an added cost on this coal of &gt;roximately $1 a ton, but the testimony on behalf of defendants makes rlear that because of a new rate, of which complainants were not in - metl, there was in fact a difference of only 30 cents a ton. The mtity of this coal affected is not easy to ascertain. There has been y a small quantity handled by this company, but with the installation the connection sought, or with the lower rate now in force, the quan - • may be increased. Complainants contend that the Farmers Grain Elevator company, located on the line of the Union Pacific at Blue Springs, suffers inconvenience and injury to business because of the ab - sence of the connection. However, the testimony of the manager of this company fails to support the claim. At most, his testimony shows that this connection would be of substantial advantage only during the seasons when there is a failure of the corn crop west of his place of business. His testimony is to the effect that, when, "there is a scarcity of corn, we would not ship any wheat in that direction, but it might happen, and has happened, that through that territory there might be a tmce to ship corn in preference to further south; not very often, but has happened." The industry chiefly affected is the Rawlings Ice Plant located on the line of the Burlington about ZVt miles west of the proposed connection. The plant has a storage capacity of between 25,000 and 30,000 tons. Mr. Rawlings testified that he shipped about 600 cars of ice during 1917; that at various times he has shipped con - siderable ice over the Union Pacific lines, and that when shipments are made over that line to points south of Wymore the shipments go north to Beatrice over the Burlington line, where it is transferred to the Union Pacific line, and comes back by way of Blue Springs, practically repass - ing the point of origin. That in 1918 he thus shipped 33 cars of ice, and that on this shipment he paid $489.94 freight in excess of what it would have cost him had the connection which he here seeks been in - stalled and in operation, except that from the amount stated there should be deducted a small sum for switching charges. He also mentions an - other shipment of 14 cars which was prejudicially affected because of the lack of the connection sought. Among other shipments pointed out is one of 40 cars sold to the Pacific Fruit Express, a subsidiary com - pany of the defendant Union Pacific Railroad company. Under his contract of sale he was required to deliver this ice to the purchaser for shipment over the Union Pacific railway and, the nearest point at which he could make the delivery being the city of Beatrice, he was compelled to pay the local freight on this shipment from his plant to that city, amounting to $800. In 1917 he claims to have lost the sale of 2,000 tons of ice to the same company because he could not profitably make a sale and pay the freight to the point of delivery.

The Railway Commission found, and apparently its finding is supported by the evi - dence, that the interchange of carload traffic at Beatrice from Novem - ber, 1916, to April, 1920, was approximately 500 cars, and that of this number, had there been a transfer switch at one of the points in ques - tion, 50 of these cars would have been there transferred. As to the shipments of rock, the Commission found that the transfer if installed would effect a saving only to the amount of the difference between the cost of loading the cars on the Burlington by wagon and the cost of loading from a chute, less a proper switching charge which it would be the duty of the commission to fix. No evidence was offered trom which the cost of this switching charge may be determined, but it is said in the opinion of the Commission that "it certainly would not be an appreciable amount less than $4. Therefore, there would not be an appreciable saving to the rock industry if the connection were made." If the conclusion of the Commission that the switching charge on rock would be approximately $4 a car, and there is no evidence to indicate a different rate for switching other commodities, we may assume that it would be approximately that rate on ice, coal and grain. So far as the affirmative proof goes, it shows Mr. Rawlings' sale of ice for shipment over the Union Pacific lines to be made chiefly to a subsidiary company of the defendant Union Pacific Railroad company, ami it is claimed by that company that it has built, or has in process of construction, plants for the manufacture of ice and that it is not likely to remain a purchaser of the Rawlings ice. The main market for the Kawlings ice appears to be along the Burlington lines, and so far as shipments to these points are concerned a transfer switch would be of no service. The statute under which this proceeding is had, section 5379, Comp. St. 1922, provides that the State Railway Commission has jurisdiction to make such order as is here prayed, "where the tracks of trie two railroad companies are within five hundred feet apart, whether on the same grade or not, where it is practicable and deemed reasonably necessary." Appellants demanded an answer to the two questions: "(1) Is the construction and operation of the proposed transfer switch between the two railroad companies practicable? (2) Is the con - struction and operation of the proposed switch between the two com - panies reasonably necessary for the use arid benefit of the complainants or either "of them or the public?" It is said that the Commission left the first question undetermined, while answering the second in the negative. From a construction standpoint there is little, if any, difficulty to be encountered. A number of different forms of construction are suggested and there is a sub - stantial difference of opinion as to the cost of construction, but it is plain that no serious difficulties would be encountered in the matter of con - struction alone. It does not follow, however, that such construction is </seg>
            <seg id="p458">458 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT • practicable. Indeed, the testimony offered by defendants raises a serious question as to the practicability of the transfer. It would serve no useful purpose to set it out in detail. It may be summarized by saying that it indicates a first cost of construction varying from $2,000 to $8,000 or $10,000. The objections seem to be made not so much to the cost of construction as to other matters. It is claimed that n the practical operation of the roads the cost tcv the companies would e out of proportion to the revenue derived. The only persons who ave testified on this subject were officers and employees of the defen - ant roads. This testimony is calculated to show that, because the witch, if installed, would be located outside the yards limits of either Wymore or Blue Springs, it would be difficult and expensive to send witching crews to make the necessary transfers; that if switching crews re not sent to make the transfers it will be both difficult and expensive o the carriers to have the work done by the regular train crews; that he federal safety appliance act requires interstate carriers to hl6pect cars when transferred from one line to another to make sure that the afety appliances are in order and that this would entail the expense Of sending an inspector to overlook the cars transferred ; that as the switch would be located at a point far distant from the regular office of either ompany it would require additional labor and entail unusual expense n the 'l mi far of waybills. Also, that the transfer tracks being with - out the city limits of either city the cars of merchandise left upon the tracks would be without police protection. TI'.'e testimony is not disputed. After a careful consideration the Ccmir!issio:i reached the conclusion that the connection prayed was not reasonably necessary. The rule in this state is: "Appeals, from the orders of the State Railway Commission directly to this court. Under section 7, ch. 90, Laws 1907, as amended by chapter 94, Laws 1911 (Rev. St. 1918, sec. 6182), are to be considered and determined in the same manner as appeals from a judgment of the district court upon trial by jury in civil cases. Such orders will not be reversed Unless it affirmatively appears from the record that they are clearly wrong." Byington v. Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co., 96 Neb. 584.
