Permits are sold by over a thousand accounts including county clerks, hardware stores, banks, sporting goods stores, etc. Each year it is necessary to print the permits and send them out to the accounts and make collections for the same, accounting to the State Auditor for all sums collected. The books are audited at the end of each year and reports of same are filed. The amount of money derived from permits each year can be ascertained by referring to the financial section of this report. Maps. During the past two years the program of mapping of vari - ous natural resources of the state was continued. Maps cover - ing about one-half of the counties in the state, showing the drainage, lakes and other natural resources are on file in the Secretary's office. These maps are cased and made in such form that blue prints can be made from them at any time de - sired. These maps are supplemented by data in many cases regarding the suitability of such waters for stocking fish, food conditions and other information of value for stocking pro - grams. This work has not been carried on as extensively as originally planned owing to lack of funds, but the records are </seg>

During 1933, through the efforts of the Chairman of the Commission, four Emergency Conservation Work camps were obtained for Nebraska. These were located at Louisville in Cass County; Fremont, Dodge County; Parks, Dundy County; and Chadron, Dawes County. These were administered through the Secretary's office and a great deal of valuable develop - ment work was accomplished at the several sites. Records pertaining to such activities are on file in the Secretary's office. Contracts. During the two years covered by this report, numerous con - tracts have been made for the purchase of lakes, recreation grounds, fish, etc. Such contracts have been duly executed and are on file in the Secretary's office. In a number of cases, activities of this nature have been carried on by the Commis - sion's own personnel, thus using employees during off-seasons and equipment already on hand. All of the legal papers per - taining to the transfer of real estate have been approved by the Attorney General of the state and properly recorded in the counties where such real estate was purchased and the papers pertaining thereto filed in the Secretary's office. Educational Work. The Commission has felt that education is an important part of law enforcement and has authorized steps to be taken which would bring to the people of Nebraska a realization of the need of conservation and the strict observance of all game laws. In order to carry this to the majority of citizens of the Commonwealth, the State Press has been used, and at this time the Commission desires to^ acknowledge the fine cooperation which has been given them by the staff of reporters on duty at the State Capitol, as well as the Press Association representa - tives and editors of the various state papers. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION A quarterly publication, known as "Outdoor Nebraska," has been published. Some ten thousand copies of this bulletin are distributed each quarter of the year to schools, organizations and individuals interested in conservation work. Other bulletins published by the Commission during the two years are as follows: "Outdoors in Nebraska" : This is a map and information regarding Nebraska's outdoor resources and has proved very popular with tourists from other states as well as citizens in Nebraska. During the past two years 50,000 copies have been distributed to tourist agencies, hotels, tourist camps, filling stations, etc Bulletin containing the Game Code of the state of Ne - braska; 20,000 copies. Synopsis of Game Laws: 50,000 copies. Notices of Open Season on Muskrats: 20,000 copies. Sunrise and Sunset Time Tables: 1 5,000 copies. Notices of Federal Open Season on Migratory Waterfowl: 15,000 copies. During 1933 a series of radio talks and broadcasts which reached thousands of citizens of the state were broadcasted. At this time the Commission desires to acknowledge the co - operation and extend thanks to Radio Stations KFAB and KFOR of Lincoln, Nebraska, for making it possible to broad - cast these programs. Motion pictures have been taken of the Commission's ac - tivities and these have been furnished free with a game warden in charge to lecture to the schools and organizations desiring same. During the past two years 1 50 showings have been made to approximately 30,000 citizens of the state. Correspondence and Records.

Each Warden is required by the Commission to wear a uni - form while checking permits and when coming in contact with the public generally. Of course it is not always possible for the Warden to be in uniform, therefore they are not required to wear same when performing such duties where it is advisable not to disclose their identity. Transportation. All District Wardens are furnished automobiles purchased by the Commission and in no case are Wardens paid mileage. Experience has shown that it is better for the state to own the vehicles than to pay mileage owing to the fact that it is difficult to check the latter. Small automobiles are used and traded in at , the end of each year, thus making the depreci - ation cost per man very small. Cars are operated on the aver - age for from two to four cents per mile, including depreciation. __E__H_j____p j_^^L_f ___iM__Shs- - *T_— tjHir" t^fE^V I *' __^aj_l Fish traps and lllcgul devices taken by Nebraska Game Wardens. </seg>

This diary calls for a complete report on expenses, personal and transportation expenses, miles traveled (daily), complaints investigated, permits inspected, arrests made, de - vices confiscated and such other work as the Warden is called upon to do. Complaints. Hundreds of complaints are handled each year from all parts of the state. These reports which come into the office are re - ferred immediately to the District Warden of the respective district who makes a personal investigation, reporting back to the office what action was taken, if any. All special permits such as those issued for scientific pur - poses, damage caused by pheasants, muskrats and beaver, are likewise investigated by the Wardens.

A large number of people visited Arbor Lodge State Park during 1932 where they found many trees of interest as well as articles of considerable historical significance on exhibition in the mansion. During 1932, more than 35,000 visitors entered the mansion and an additional 10,000 entered the Park, mak - ing a total of 45,000 who entered the grounds during the year. A number of picnics were held by fraternal orders, schools, Sunday Schools, church societies, etc. These were estimated at around 200, and some 1 000 family picnics and reunions were held during the year. A feature of the activities during 1932 was an Arbor Day celebration. April 22, 1932 was the Centennial Anniversary of J. Sterling Morton's birth, as well as the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of Arbor Day. A special observance of the Centennial was held at Arbor Lodge and at Nebraska City. Nine members of the Morton family were in attendance at the Lodge and assisted in the planting of two trees in front of the mansion. A number of additional trees were planted during the day, both at the Park and in Nebraska City. The United States post office issued a special commemorative stamp in ob - servance of this Centennial and one-hundred million stamps were printed. During 1932, drives were graded and repaired, some forty rods of same being re-surfaced with gravel. Several hundred trees and shrubs were planted as well as inferior trees being removed from the pine grove. The roof of the mansion and those of the greenhouse and stables were repaired.

Attendance at the Park during I 933 was estimated at 85,000 with the customary large number of picnics, concerts, athletic meets and the like taking place. The attendance at the Park, use of the cabins and swimming pool, etc., was not as great during 1933 as usual due to general economic conditions and the further fact that the Park was partly closed owing to con - struction work. Through the federal government, a Civilian Conservation Corps of 200 men were obtained to work in the Park through the summer and winter of 1933. The entire Park was worked over, with many roads being built, cabins constructed, etc. Through the use of this camp, the area opened to the public was increased from around 200 acres to nearly 800, making the Park much more attractive. The entrance and playgrounds were completely rebuilt. Nearly 200,000 feet of lumber was salvaged from the aged trees, the larger part being used for the building of cabins and other buildings. A new water system was also installed and the Park generally beautified. Victoria Springs State Park. Activities of 1932. During 1932 it was estimated that some 18,000 persons visited Victoria Springs State Park. During the year four troops of Boy Scouts, twenty picnics and six. band concerts and four - teen church organizations made use of the Park. The principal improvement during 1932 was the erection of a caretaker's residence — a one-story building, 28x34 feet with full basement, equipped with water, electric wiring and sewers. In addition to this, several thousand trees were planted, planted. During 1932 a disastrous flood damaged the picnic grounds of this Park and a large amount of work was necessary to re - store it. The grounds were covered with debris, banks badly washed and other damage which was repaired, as well as trees trimmed, etc. During the year a grove of 800 trees was started </seg>
            <seg id="p027">STATE OF NEBRASKA and some 1 ,000 trees in a nursery were cared for. Activities of 1933. The attendance for 1933 was estimated at 30,000 persons. During the year thirty-five picnics, eight band concerts and a number of athletic events were held at the Park. During the summer the lake at this Park was open for fishing and a large number of anglers were on hand to engage in this past'.me. During 1933 two cabins were constructed, each with two apartments. These were made from the old residence. In addition to these two cabins, tents were erected and equipped for camping purposes. During the year a large amount of work was done on the grounds, large quantities of poison ivy in the grove were removed. The lake was also improved, part of it being fenced off for swimming purposes and a large amount of sand and gravel being placed on- the banks. The federal government, through the Civil Works Adminis - tration, furnished ten men to work at Victoria Springs Park during the latter part of 1933. The labor of these men was used for the construction of a building for storage purposes, sawing of timber blown down and aged, grubbing out stumps, cleaning groves, trimming trees, etc. A septic tank, cesspool and bath room fixtures were also installed for the residence as well as general improvements being made. Stolley State Park. Activities of 1932. During the past two years a much larger number of people visited Stolley Park than heretofore. The attendance ranged from 300 to 1,000 persons per day during certain days of the summer. A count made found visitors came from twenty-one different counties of the state. Most of the visitors used the picnic grounds where around one hundred persons can be accomodated. In addition to the picnic grounds, baseball, vol - ley ball and hand ball courts were made available. Improvements of the year -were the enlargement of the flower </seg>

A new well was driven, twenty - four tables and benches installed, several hundred trees planted, etc The caretaker's residence was re-shingled and the old school house was painted and repaired and other minor im - provements made. Activities of 1933. Owing to the increased attendance at this Park during the year, the picnic grounds were enlarged and additional tables, benches and seats provided. A horse-shoe pitching court and additional playground equipment was provided. As in the other parks, the federal government furnished labor through the Civil Works Administration. All roads and ditches surrounding the Park were cleaned and all of the trees in the Park gone over, the aged and diseased trees being removed. Some two thousand guard posts were placed along the drives. Over a thousand small trees were placed in a nursery for future planting. Fort Kearney State Park. During 1933 a large planting of trees was made at Fort Kearney State Park. These were placed in a way to provide for future beautification of this Park. Owing to unfavorable ♦ climatic conditions, a considerable number of the trees were lost but these will be replaced. A lead-in from the public highway was constructed so that the public would have access to the picnic area of the Park. Niobrara State Park and Game Preserve. During 1933 this Park was enlarged and a considerable portion of it opened to the public through the clearing out of undergrowth. The road was extended, picnic building repaired and other minor improvements made. </seg>

Owing to economic conditions during the past two years, it has been impossible for the Game Commission to carry on its program of providing more recreation grounds. Only one new project has been added to the twenty-five recreation grounds in existence. This was the purchase of 1 00 acres and the con - struction of a 50-acre lake located on Rock Creek in Dundy County, Nebraska, where a camp of Civilian Conservation workers was employed to build a dam. During the two years three new recreation grounds were opened to the public. These were located at Arnold (Custer County) ; Verdon (Richardson County) ; and Alexandria (Thayer County). However, during the past two years, the Commission has improved all recreation grounds wherever possible. Some of the major improvements made are as follows: Walgren Lake Recreation Grounds: The ditch feeding the water into this lake was cleaned out and deepened. Louisville Recreation Grounds: At this recreation grounds the federal government provided an E. C. W. Camp where two hundred men were employed during the summer of 1933. The entire grounds were worked over, roads built, trees and shrubs trimmed and planted, landscaping and grading done and the grounds were beautified generally. Cottonmill Lake Recreation Grounds: During the past two years the dam at Cottonmill Recreation Grounds was raised and widened.

This work consists of studying forestry condi - tions, cooperating in educational work with the view of encour - aging the planting of trees on private property and the planting of trees on public lands. There are in Nebraska hundreds of acres of land of limited value for the purpose of agriculture. Plans of the Commission provide for a survey of such lands and the development for forestation. During the past two years, the Nebraska Game Commission has cooperated with the state-wide committee on forestation. This Committee has succeeded in getting Nebraska citizens to plant millions of trees. A considerable number of trees have been planted by the Commission on state property during the past two years.

            <seg id="p039">STATE OF NEBRASKA GAME RESERVES One of the goals of the Nebraska Game Commission is a state-wide system of game reserves and sanctuaries. The sanctuary program includes both those for migratory waterfowl and upland game birds and animals. At the present time there are over 300,000 acres in Ne - braska which are used for sanctuaries and where no hunting is permitted. Part of this is federal and state land and part is private land leased for sanctuaries. Among the more important sanctuaries are the following: Niobrara Game Reserve: Located in Cherry County. This Reserve is under the control of the Bureau of Biological Survey, U. S. Department of Agriculture and contains 1 6,68 1 acres. Buffalo, eik, antelope, prairie chickens and ducks are protected here. Crescent Lake Reserve: Located in Garden County. This Sanctuary is also under the control of the Bureau of Biological Survey, U. S. Department of Agriculture and contains approxi - mately 41,000 acres. This Sanctuary is devoted entirely to mi - gratory waterfowl. U. S.

Dundy County Hatcheries.- Harry Runion. Sup't. Hatcheries and Nurseries. The Game Commission operates four major fish hatcheries and a number of nurseries. The oldest hatchery is located in Cass County on the Platte River, eight miles south of Gretna. The Valentine Hatchery is located in Cherry County, one and one-half miles from Valentine with a sub-station thirteen miles from Valentine. The Dundy County Hatcheries consist of two; one located near Benkelman and another located on Rock Creek near Parks, Nebraska. The four hatcheries are now used as propagating and hatch - ing stations and the nurseries are used for feeding and growing stations. Gretna Fish Hatchery. The Gretna Fish Hatchery is used partly for recreational purposes, there being excellent picnic grounds located there where thousands of visitors come each year. During the past two years this Hatchery has been improved in a number of ways, but the most important feature has been the installation of ponds for the propagation of channel catfish. Experiments have been carried on during the past two years and it is believed that these fish can now be propagated in large .numbers. Hatching troughs together with a battery of holding ponds have been constructed. During the past two years, this Hatchery has been used for the propagation of bass, crappie, sunfish and trout. It has also been used as a station for the trapping and distribution of chan - nel catfish taken from the lower Platte and Missouri Rivers. </seg>

A large number of bass, crappie and sunfish are produced each year. During the past two years a number of new pcnds have been constructed, old ponds and dams improved, a garage built, a residence built and other minor improvements made. At the sub-station, some twenty ponds were built, grounds finished, the residence repaired and other minor improvements made.. Dundy County Hatcheries. The Dundy County Hatcheries are used for the propaga - tion of bass, sunfish, crappie and trout. During 1933 a flood destroyed the ponds at the Benkelman Hatchery but these were repaired immediately. Most of the improvements have been made at the Rock Creek Hatchery. Here a modern hatch house was built and equipped which has a hatching capacity of five million trout a year. A residence was also built for one of the employees and other minor improvements made. Nurseries. Modern fish culture requires the use of nurseries where the small fish may be taken from the hatchery and held until they are partly grown. By this method a much larger percentage of fish reach maturity when they are finally put in the fishing waters. During the past two years the Commission has maintained a number of nurseries among which are the following: County Where Located Near Town of Kind of Fish Brown County .

            <seg id="p056">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION CONSERVATION AND SALVAGE OF FISH Foreman — Lee Hudleson, Lincoln Each year a considerable amount of conservation and salv - age of fish is carried on by the Game Commission. While a large number of fish are hatched and reared at State Fish Hatch - eries and Nurseries, nature likewise hatches thousands of fish in ponds, sloughs, bayous, etc., many of which would never reach maturity because of such waters drying up in the summer and freezing in the winter. The Commission has, therefore, found it advisable to carry on salvage work as it is cheaper to save the fish which nature hatches than to propagate them at State Hatch - eries. Besides the salvage of game fish which are planted in deeper waters, the same crew is used for the removal of coarse fish from waters where they become a menace to game fish. Salvage of game fish and removal of non-game flsh is an impor - tant part of the Commission's work. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">STATE OF NEBRASKA These coarse fish consist mostly of carp, buffalo, shad and gar and those which are edible are marketed where possible, revenue from the same being placed in the state game fund. 1932 Activities During 1932, some million game fish were salvaged and 161,580 pounds of coarse fish sold. Seining activities were carried on at the following lakes and ponds throughout the state: Carter Lake, Omaha Culbertson Projects, Culbertson Fremont Boy Scout Lake, Fremont Schimmers Lake, Grand Island University Lake, Scottsbluff Blue River, Milford Beatty Sand Pit, Scottsbluff Wisner Lake, Wisner Memphis Lake, Memphis Louisville Sand Pits, Louisville Whitman Lakes, Whitman Revere Lake, Bingham Abbott's Lake, Hyannis Willey's Lake, Bingham Anderson Lake, Bingham Collins Lake, Whitman Burton's Lake, Ellsworth Platte River, Ashland Siers Sand Pit, Doniphan Egan's Lake, Hyannis Club House Lake, Hyannis Mrs. Bud Moran's Lake, Hyannis West Diamond Bar Lake, Flats Charley Moran's Lake, Hyannis Bremmer Lake, Hyannis Walker Brothers Lake, Hyannis Cottonwood Lake, Whitman Home Valley Lake, Whitman Crescent Lake, Oshkosh Blue River, Dorchester Veterans Sand Pit, Fremont Stevenson's Lake, Hyannis Silver Lake, Hyannis State Lake, Hyannis Ponds south of Lickny Lake, Hyannis Butler County Lakes, Millerton Nuckolls County Lakes, Angus Buffalo County Lakes, Shelton Lakes north of Waverly Moon Lake, Alnsworth Duck Lake, Alnsworth Hackberry Lake, Valentine Belvls Lake, Brownlee East Marsh Lake, Brownlee Clear Lake, Alnsworth </seg>

The film library has been added to and kept up to date as well as a number of still pictures of parks and recreation grounds, game farms, etc., having been taken. During each quarter of the two years a quarterly magazine, "Outdoor Nebraska" has been published, 80,000 copies being distributed without cost to libraries, schools, outdoor organ - izations and individuals interested in the conservation of our natural resources. During the past two years the Commission published 50,000 copies of "Outdoors in Nebraska". These have been made available to tourists who are interested in making a trip to Ne - braska as well as citizens of Nebraska desiring to know more about their state. A small booklet giving information about Arbor Lodge State Park has been published each year and sold at that Park. During the two years 1,044 copies were sold. Other additional pamphlets such as "State Laws", "Open Seasons", "Hunting Hours", etc., have been published from time to time during the two years. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH Scientific research began several years ago and has been continued by the Commission during 1932 and 1933 although not to as great an extent as desired. Owing to lack of funds this work has not been carried on as extensively as had been hoped for. However, some work along this line has been done. An investigation was made of the different species of fish found in Nebraska and the pamphlet setting forth findings is now ready for publication. This covers practically all of the known species of fish in the state with scientific data regarding the same. Studies have been carried on during the past two years of the channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus). This has not only covered the histqry and spawning, but food habits, diseases, etc. A study was also made of the sand pit lakes and ponds of southern Nebraska in order to get more data regarding the food of the fish and relation of species to one another. A cooperative study of the Bobwhite Quail has also been undertaken by the Nebraska Commission. The Commission is aiding Professor Myron Swenk of the University of Nebraska and Dr. E. W. Nelson of the Smithsonian Institute, in a national survey and study of this game bird. Specimens from different sections of the state were taken by representatives of the Game Commission and furnished to Prefessor Swenk and Dr. Nelson to study. EXHIBITIONS During 1932 and 1933 the customary exhibit of fish at the Nebraska State Fair was made. Over forty species of fish were shown and thousands of visitors viewed the aquariums. During 1932, in cooperation -with the Nebraska Nursery Association, a pond exhibit was made. Permanent pools were constructed and each year these are stocked with fancy fish and aquatic vegetation. </seg>
            <seg id="p061">STATE OF NEBRASKA An exhibition of various fish raised in the state is also to be found at the Hatcheries located at Valentine, Gretna and Benkel - man. These exhibitions are permanent in nature and are open for inspection throughout the year. TEN YEAR PROGRAM Among the more important activities of the Nebraska Game Commission during 1933 was the adoption of a Ten -Year Pro - gram. Owing to the need of continuity of policy and the need of trained personnel it is necessary to have a program covering a number of years with definite goals. In order to build up the outdoor resources of the state, the Commission adopted the fol - lowing program and all of its activities are now directed along this plan : -~%_M_*_"iEfi)M2MgCTB_l^jlrV'*.*;.

General Policies The Plan shall at all times be bound by the following as its fundamental policies and rigidly adhered to: (a) Business Aspects: All phases of activity to the smallest detail shall be weighed carefully to ascertain if it is sound in prin - ciple and can be put into force economically. All activities shall be properly placed under budget control, and all budgets shall be fixed in advance by the Commission. Systematic control of expense shall be obtained by fixing responsibility of employees and providing a working method of control for all activities. (b) Scientific Aspect: All phases of activity involving propagation, food, suitability of water or cover, desirability of species, etc., shall be considered and weighed scientifically. Where new activities are undertaken, scientific investigation I should first be made to ascertain if scientifically correct in its premises. Scientific surveys should be undertaken and reports made for the guidance of committees and employees. Goal of the Plan The ultimate goal of the Plan shall be to meet the needs of </seg>

Plan of Action Increase of Hunting (D In order to bring hunting to the greatest number of people and to provide good bags for those taking to the field, a ten - year stocking program, to be financed over that period, shall be put into effect. The stocking of game birds will be done in accordance with such scientific data as may be procured. The Commission will use game reserves and sanctuaries as its basic breeding areas, and birds will be stocked in parts of the state found to be most suit - able until a foundation stock has become well established. Fol - lowing this, all parts of the state will be stocked. The Commission will determine what upland game birds are to be stocked during the next ten years, after first making an investigation of success had in other states and making a survey in Nebraska as to suitable cover, food, protection, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p068">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION Open seasons, bag limits, etc. 7 on both waterfowl and up - land game birds will be recommended to the legislature and fixed by resolution on the basis of supply of birds available and pre - vailing conditions. Every possible -way of eliminating guesswork and political influence will be utilized by the Commission in its stocking pro - gram. Land not suitable for certain species will be determined and such areas not stocked. Accurate records will be kept of annual stocking and annual investigations will be made to determine the extent to which the plan is succeeding or failing. Increase of Fishing (2) The stocking of game fish will be carried out on a ten-year production program. All of the waters of the State will be sur - veyed. This survey will determine the suitability of species, food conditions and fish already stocked, and all the future plantings of fish will be based on scientific data that a survey will bring to light. Every effort will be made by the Commission to increase production and an attempt will be made to raise larger fish so that fingerlings and adults may be stocked rather than fry. A better plan of salvage work will be undertaken, holding ponds for salvaged fish will be secured in such parts of the State as may be needed, and fish salvaged during extremely warm weather or during the winter will be placed in such holding ponds in order to secure better distribution. Efforts will be made by the Commission to cut down the cost per thousand of fish produced and to produce the fish in parts of the State where needed in order to lessen the transpor - tation cost. Open season, bag limits, etc., will be recommended to the Legislature and fixed by Resolution of the Commission on the basis of fish available. </seg>
            <seg id="p069">STATE OF NEBRASKA State-owned lakes or those under the jurisdiction of the Com - mission will be first in the plan of stocking. Privately owned lakes open to the public will be secondary in the scheme of plant - ing. Scientific investigation of disease, food and relation of species will be continued by the Commission in the several parts of the State and such data as may be secured will be compiled for future use. Accurate records will be kept of all planting of fish each year and annual investigations will be made to determine the success of the program. Recreation Facilities (3) In order to provide places for the public to fish as well as recreation facilities, the Commission will continue its program of the purchase and development of recreation grounds. | In all cases recreation grounds will have some water for fishing and it shall be the purpose of the Commission to have al least one-half of the purchased acreage under water. Recreation grounds will be established in the future on the following: (a) Funds available for such purpose. (b) Need of recreation grounds in section of the State. (c) Suitability of proposed project. Recreation grounds will not be purchased until the Commis - sion's engineer has made a preliminary survey as to the feasibility of the proposed project. Upon receipt of such a survey the Com - mission shall determine if funds are available for the purchase of such proposed recreation grounds if it is needed in that sec - tion of the State and if the project is feasible. After such is de - termined a committee of not less than three members of the Commission will be appointed to visit the proposed project to determine initial cost and development cost and report back to the Commission for further consideration. </seg>
            <seg id="p070">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION It shall be the policy of the Commission to dispense with caretakers on recreation grounds, but to have them administer - ed by district game wardens and the Commission's engineer and the Commission's forester. The district game wardens will make periodical trips to each recreation grounds in his district, report - ing to the Secretary of the Commission frequently as to prevail - ing conditions. Any repair work or construction will be handled by the engineer, who will go to the various projects as directed by the Commission. Planting of trees, mowing of weeds, etc., will be done under the supervision of the Commission's forester, who will go to the recreation grounds at the direction of the Com - mission to carry on such work. i Tbe Commission will determine a fair price to pay for each acre of water or land on recreation grounds and in the future purchase of such projects try to arrive at such a price in the pur - chase thereof. It shall be the aim and the desire of the Commission to carry on its ten-year program in the purchase, maintenance and de - velopment of recreation grounds to the end that these shall be available to all the people of the State. Scientific Study (4) The Commission will over a ten-year period carry on various phases of scientific investigation to the end that it will have available data concerning all wild life found in the State of Ne - braska. Investigations will particularly deal with the cover available for certain species of birds and fish, food and disease. AH scientific data procured will be compiled and made available to all members of the Commission and such employees as it may specify. Scientific work carried on by other states and by the Fed - eral Government will be made available for the Commission and its employees and such data will be considered jointly with the scientific investigations made in Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">STATE OF NEBRASKA Utilization of Waste Land ■■■ (5) ; k '■■' There is in Nebraska hundreds of acres of land of doubtful value for the purpose of agriculture. It shall be the purpose of the Commission to make a survey of such lands with a view of taking the same out of agricultural production and where possible flooding such areas in order to provide cover for waterfowl, shore birds, and fish. Studies should be carried on to determine possibilities of utilizing such areas on a co-operative basis by the State and owners of such land. Cooperative efforts should be given by the Commission to other governmental agencies in the establishing of reservoirs along the Platte river basin and in the sandhill lake sections of the State. Marginal Land for Reforestation (6) The Commission will make a study during its ten-year pro - gram of the possibilities of using waste and marginal agricultural land for reforestation purposes. It will keep in touch with the Federal Government at all times cooperating with that agency in such reforestation work as may be undertaken in Nebraska. An educational campaign will be carried on to the end that such waste and marginal agricultural land will be planted to trees by the owners thereof and a reserve of timber established for future use. Particular attention will be given to islands in the I latte river basin and waste land along smaller streams where trees would thrive and be of value not only for timber and fuel but for cover for wild life. Control of Pollution Canals, Ditches and Dams (7) The Commission will initiate an investigation to determine to what extent fish life is being damaged by pollution of streams, unscreened irrigation canals and ditches and power dams which do not maintain fishways. </seg>
            <seg id="p072">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION Upon the determining of the need, if any, of these factors, efforts will be made to get such control of the same as may remedy the damage being done. Control of irrigation ditches in western states will be in - vestigated, reports made available to the Commission and the fishway situation in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan will be investigated and made available for the Commission. Game Refuges and Sanctuaries (8) The Commission will lay out a ten-year program which -will seek to provide adequate game refuges and sanctuaries through - out the State of Nebraska.^—These sanctuaries will be considered for use for both migratory waterfowl and upland game birds. Such refuges will be secured either by lease or purchase upon the following basis : (a) Suitability in the way of cover and protection. (b) Compactness and size of the proposed reserve. (c) Need of a reserve in part ofState where same is lo - cated. The Commission will cooperate with the Federal Govern - ment in the enlarging and maintenance of the Crescent Lake refuge and will work to the end of securing several more such reserves, particularly in Sheridan, Cherry, Brown, Rock or Holt counties. The Commission will cooperate with the forestry service in a fuller utilization of the Halsey and Bessey Divisions of the National Forest as game sanctuaries. The Commission will work to the end of securing more areas in the Platte River basin which are inviolate to the hunting of migratory waterfowl and will continue its policy of making state recreation grounds game sanctuaries. Predatory Animal and Bird Control. (9) The Commission will issue a plan for the better control of </seg>
            <seg id="p073">STATE OF NEBRASKA predatory animals and birds in the State of Nebraska. Parti - cular attention will be given to the control of the crow, which is increasing at an alarming rate, particularly in the northern section of the State. Conservation and Education (10) Education is the best means to stop violations of game laws and for that reason the Commission should work out an edu - cational program covering the ten-year period with a view to securing a broader and more comprehensive obserbance and understanding of the needs of conservation. This educational program should be divided into two parts: (a) That dealing with the adult population of the state. (jb) That dealing with the school children. Efforts should be made by the Commission to secure the interest and cooperation of boys by organizing a protective society among boys which would seek to make each of its mem - bers a protector of wild life. Such an organization would not only have a very wholesome effect on the family life of the com - munities throughout the State, but would have the tendency to make the citizens |of tomorrow vitally interested in conservation. Cooperation of Sportsmen's and Civic Organizations. (11) There are a large number of civic and several sportsmen's organizations, which can be readily interested in the building up of Nebraska outdoors. The Commission should work out a program to place before such bodies with a view to getting them interested in conserva - tion as a general program, but particularly in some local pro - ject, such as a game sanctuary, reforestation project, etc. Con - ferences and meetings of such organizations should be contract - ed by the Commission and uniform programs worked out which could be adopted by such bodies. The support of such organizations in carrying on a campaign in the sale of hunting and fishing permits should be sought. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">GAME, FORESTATION AND PARKS COMMISSION Better Law Enforcement (12) The Commission will make a survey of the entire game law enforcement situation throughout Nebraska and adopt a policy which will have for its purpose: (a) Securing of high type of law enforcement officers. (b) Better service from such officers. (c) Reduced cost of operation. (d) Better cooperation with local law enforcement officers and citizens. The Commission should seek at all times to keep the law enforcement division completely divorced from political in - fluences. Wardens in the service should be given examinations from time to time to ascertain their knowledge of conditions and to determine proper rating as to their value to. the Commission. </seg>
