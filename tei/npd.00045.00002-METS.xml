Many things have been accomplished, but 1 fear much that should, or might have been accomplished, may have been left undone. There is almost no end to the valuable work that might be done were the runds available for carrying on the work that the Board hai in mind and would like to do. You are aware tliat the one big item in the Board's activity has been the building up and holding of the State Fair. Of this work I think every member of the Board and the people at Inrge may well feel proud. The Nebraska State Fair is rated generally by State Fair men all over the United States, as being right in the front rank, not only from an educational, but from an agricultural standpoint as well, and holds first rank as furnishing a clean and up to date amusement attraction. Our agricultural exhibits are considered by people in positions to know, to be the best in the world. Many of the foremost State Fair Managers come to our Fair Keeking Information which they hope will enable them to furnish as good agricultural shows as does the State of Nebraska, but none dare hope to be able to excel It. Our county ex - hibitions of agricultural products has proved a wonderful success and could be made a world wide wonder If all the counties In the state could be persuaded to make an exhibit. Our agricultural exhibit in generally considered to be the best anywhere; our livestock show Is a close second to Iowa, which Is probably the best all around livestock show held any place. Our cattle and hog show is not excelled by any state in the union, or by any show except, possibly, the National Live - stock Show hi Chicago of cattle, and by the National Swine Show In Omaha. Our swine breeders have been laboring under a tremendous handicap on account of the poor accommodations the Board has been able to furnish them for showing their products, yet with this handicap, they have made as good, or better, showing than any other state. The last legislature made an appropriation of $80,000 for the con - struction or a swine building which Is now being built. This building will be completed In time for use at the 1918 State Fair. With the splendid facilities that this will afford exhibitors for showing their stock. I am sure that our swine breeders will be so encouraged that they will place an exhibit on the grounds next year that will surpass both In quality and numbers, any other state exhibition, and posulbly will excel the National Show. Our racllltlrx for hIiowIiik rattle have been reasonably adequate until the last two years, but th« cattle show l» coming to bi of such magnitude- that the cattle barn It too small to accommodate all. and to </seg>

            <seg id="p023">PK«H'KKI&gt;IN&lt;* NKIIKASK.V STATK IMi.VKli Hi auku ri/rruK left in winter wheat with as small as one-fourth of a stand produced a fair crop. The cool and wel months of May and June, which were so lavorable for small grain, had the opposite effect on corn. Us growth was re - tarded, first by cool and wet weather and later by extreme July drought. Alter the rains came, in the early part of August, corn made an unex - pected progress and by the latter part of September an average crop of a fair grade of corn was promised. The killing freeze, early In October, changed the situation entirely. While perhaps 75 per cent of the corn was ready for a frost, it was not ready for a killing freeze. All corn had a high moisture r&lt; .iten; and had not started to cure. As a result of this hard freeze follcved by warm weather, the wet cob and corn began to sour and failed to dry out. It is estimated that at least 20 per cent of the corn is s icv.sly damaged, while most of the remainder will range from poor to fair grade after it becomes thoroughly dry. Sofr as much of the corn was. however, there is little of it that will not be Ip&lt;1 and the ■"i .its ■■■' Nebraska stand to lose no great amount of monej thereby One thing in particular 1 would point to with pride is the fact that the farmers this year planted every available acre and made each acre produce better than it ever did before. The farmers of Ne - braska are making progress in a substantial &gt;\ ijr and inefficiency if lie - ing slowly relegated to the background. It is interesting lo note that the tendency of last year was toward extensive, rather than intensive farming. This is indicated by a sub - stantial decrease in the number of owners and a smaller decrease in the number of tenant farmers. I might mention that the figures submitted are somewhat open to question, but they do show the tendency of the present time. Here is a condition that is worthy of s &gt;me thought -a condition that is not for the best. The concentration of land into tlu hands of a few is to be decried and while conditions are not such as could call for alarm, they nevertheless show the tendency toward the land system of the over-populated countries of the old world. But even though the number of owners decreased, improved land showed an in crease of 500,000 acres which shows that farms are being better devel - oped and placed on a basis for larger production. Live stock, during the past year, was subjected to varying fluctua - tions from the figures of the preceding year. Horses decreased in num - bers by 7,000, due in part to war demands and in part to the uncertain status of the horse in the future. Mules showed the same tendency. 2,600 less being reported than in 1916. Cattle, on the other hand, showed a nice increase, milk cows num - bering 18,500 more than in 1916 and other cattle increasing by 370,000. It seems reasonable to suppose that cattle will continue to increase under the unusual demands for food as will hogs which, in 1917, suffered a de- </seg>
            <seg id="p024">ri«H'KKl&gt;IN&lt;;s NEBRASKA STATIC ItuAKH i(h Auuirri.TrKi- creas*" of 73,000. Hogs have always been subjected lo varyiuu nuctua - tiong in numbers, but it is to be remarked that the number of hogs in 1917 was but little more than two-thirds of the number in the state thirty years ago. Consider this in the light of the fact that the popula - tion of the country has increased at the rate of about ten millions of people a decade, it is not to be wondered that the price of hogs has showed such a phenomenal increase. This fact is laid down for us — that we must have a great increase in the number of hogs in this state. The business will be profitable, but this is secondary. If Franco can give every able-bodied man to the war and suffer the enormous 'oil of life that they have, the least that we can do is to feed them in return whether it be profitable to do so or not. To do this, it is up to every farmer in America to raise more hogs than he ever raised before and it must be the mission of this organization to lend every assistance and in - fluence in effecting this increase in production. Hugs can be increased enormously in but a year's time. Cattle, on the other hand, could not show such increases within five years' time, so we must concentrate on the hog industry. • Sheep showed an increase of :io.300, which is gratifying, but insuffi - cient. In view of the agitation for bringing the number of sheep to what it has been in years past, let me say that something must be done in the near future with the dogs. In 1914 there were 95,000 dogs in the state, in 1916, 105,000, and in 1917. 109,00", showing that dogs are on the increase. Without question, the decrease of sheep is due to some extent ,at least, to dogs — not perhaps because of the number of sheep actually killed but because with dogs so numerous sheepmen are afraid to take a chance on sheep. I am firmly convinced that this state should see some legislation providing for a substantial tax upon dogs, which tax should go into a fund for indemnifying farmers for losses in sheep by dogs. A good dog has his place, but a good share of our dogs have not, so to speak, had the proper home training and are not useful members of society. There is one matter that 1 would call to the attention of ihis body, concerning which too much cannot be said. I refer to the reliability of information sent us from each county from which are compiled the agri - cultural statistics of the state. Gentlemen, I would urge each of you, when you return home, to do all in your power to aid a more efficient discharge of the duties of the county assessor in your county. With present conditions, some counties fail to set in any report at all. Others come in in a very bad condition, showing on the face of them glaring errors. This can. I believe, be remedied by a better understanding and appreciation within each county of the purpose, importance and func - tion of these reports. Many assessors labor under difficulties in securing this information by reason of an unwarranted prejudice against our re - ports. There are still many farmers within the state who believe that our reports are the specific information under which the speculator </seg>
            <seg id="p025">l'HOC'UKLllNOS NEBRASKA STATE BOAKD OF AGU1CULTUKK 24 operates to the detriment of the farmers' interest. A* a matter of fact, as I hardly need tell you, our agricultural reports are the one counter weapon the farmer may have against the speculator. They serve, how - ever, in a more important function than this. They are a direct means of the government ascertaining the food requirements of the country and provide a means of counter-balancing any shortage. The statistics of the State Board of Agriculture are the only real statistics compiled in this state. Estimates are made by the government but these are, at best, merely estimates and at that they are based funda - mentally upon the reports of the State Board of Agriculture. It is most essential that we have these reports exactly as the conditions are found and free from prejudice or bias. This requires the work of competent men in the offices of the assessors and requires, further, an under - standing and appreciation of the function of our reports that we may have this information in the proper shape and at the time asked for. Let there be a general understanding of the nature and purposes of our reports and I believe that we will see a better co-operation and a more valuable report. I have no hesitancy in stating that the work of the State Board of Agriculture has for years been effective and of value to agricultural Ne - braska. A worthy work has been carried on extending into mauy phases of farming. I do not feel, however, that the work of this organization, while of great value, is all that it might be — all that it should be. We are handicapped by lack of funds iot extending the scope of our activi - ties. In hoeing our own row and building up a million dollar institution in the name of the state at the fair grounds we are limited in our other activities, which are just as necessary and just as essential as the one which is our sole meant of support I need but cite our sister state, Kansas, to illustrate what a board of agriculture might be if given a certain measure of support by the state In whose interest it works. The sole explanation lies in the fact that the Kansas State Board of Agriculture has extended an influence over agricultural Kansas that has placed them second to none. Their exten - sion work has been extensive and effective. They have been of staunch service to the farmer in any help that he might need They have served much the same function as an agricultural school, but have extended their influence to the man who has no opportunity of attending a school. They have employed experts in various lines, such as entomology, geol - ogy, etc., and have brought the services of these experts to the farmer's door. How have they been enabled 10 do this? Such work costs money. You can't get valuable things these days without paying for them. This work has been made possible by legislative appropriations. Why should this not be true in this state? We are not realizing from our farms all that we could. Nebraska, farmers are losing and a nation needing food </seg>
            <seg id="p026">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 25 Is losing by lack of a few dollars spent in a most worthy cause. I feel that a campaign should be launched to secure legislative appropriations for the State Board of Agriculture so that Nebraska may be brought into its own. Such a move must not be haphazard nor unmediated. We would probably receive setbacks and disappointments, but th| task should be planned carefully and there should be no letup until our task is accomplished. I feel that in time such aid must come. It is merely a question of time. We need that aid at present In bringing agricultural Nebraska to Its most efficient basis. I do not believe that the State Board of Agriculture is performing its full function if It fail to try to get an appropriation that will make its work of the greatest service to fanners and government alike. It Is with great satisfaction that I have to report that since the last meeting of this organization that the state legislature has passed a bill providing for an appropriation of $80000 for a new swine barn on the fair grounds and that the work is now in progress. A bill for the new swine barn was first introduced in the legislature of 1915 and after consider - able manipu'ation died a quiet death. The bill was, however, duced in 1917 by Jacob Sass as House Roll No. 74, and after a good many adventures in both house and senate, was finally passed and signed by the governor on April 23rd. A detailed history of the swine barn legislation may be found in the 1917 year book. The bill originally asked for $100,000. but came out with an appropriation of $80,000. To this the State Board of Agriculture has already added $10,000 and better In grading done in the past two years, in preparation for the building. This new swine barn will be a most creditable addition to the fair grounds and will stand as an encouragement to an Industry the im - portance of which can scarcely be overestimated at the present time. It is no longer news that the Nebraska State Fair of 1917 was the largest state fair we ever held. And yet, during the early summer, there was grave doubt as to whether there should be a state fair or not. There was. first of all. the question as to the advisability of holding a state fair during war times. There was also a question as to what pa - tronage a state fair would receive at such a time. As merely an amuse - ment enterprise, unquestionably the state fair would be an ill-advised event. Amusement, as such, should have no place at such a time, in - volving as It would considerable demands upon transportation facilities which are so essential to war time activities The state fair, however, is fundamentally an educational institution — one of Nebraska's largest. It is built upon sometihng bigger, more worth while, than amusement for amusement's sake. As such, everything argued that it should be put to use in the cause of the war- that it should be made a strong and effective ally of the government. Accord - ingly, the decision was made to build a state fair that would be an effec - tive aid in the war — that would prearh the gospel of usefulness and national service, </seg>

I). ('.. July Srd, of the representatives of the various fairs and expositions in an effort to prevent such governmental action. A meeting of the Hoard of Manager* of the Slate Board of Agri - culture was called for the next day. This meeting disclosed the fact that already ho much money had heen spent in preparation for the fair, not only by the State Hoard of Agriculture, but by the farmers who were fitting animals for show purposes, that It would entail a great, expense 10 do away with the fair an expense that could only be compensated by going ahead with arrangements. The Hoard of Managers accordingly authorized the sending of your president and secretary to the Washing - ton meeting as representatives of ihe Nebraska State Fair. At this meeting it was decided to meet with government officials aud tender them the services of the various fairs in disseminating any information they wished to get before the people. This was done, the representatives of the fairs meeting with Food Administrator Hoover, Secretaries Hous - ton. Baker and Daniels and later with President Wilson. Their tender of services wag gratefully accepted aud at once began plans for n big and effective campaign in behalf of government interests. It is worthy of note that the Nebraska State Fair fired the first gun in the campaign for increased food production and the conservation of every available food resource. The month preceding the opening of the fair the papers were kept lull of articles on food conservation and pro - duction and the Food Training Camp to be conducted at the state fair which would teach Nebraskuns the most efficient use of food. Our state fair stories never failed to mention food conservation and in every piece of advertising and every bulletin there was placed before the peo - ple the work that the state fair proposed to do in conserving our food. Few of the many thousands of people who attended the state fair failed to see the exhibit in Agricultural Hall, devoted to this great work, and I am convinced that by means of it there was evolved a general accept - ance of the importance of conservation that paved the way in a most effective manner for the great campaign that Is now In progress through - out our country. Through our advertising there was left with the people of the state, aud particularly the farmers, the thought that it was the duty of every producer to produce more food, and that valuable lessons were to be had in a study of the finest of the state's products which were to be on exhibition at the state fair. As a result more people viewed the won - deMtil exhibits of stock and agricultural products than ever b»fore and the matter did not stop with merely a view they were studied earnestly. </seg>

Did the war cut down our aiU'iiduncr? There Ih every reason to be- lieve that it Increased it.

It is i of the war Canadian fairs have enjoy ire is reason to believe that there during the war so long as the belter citizenship and usefulness ignitlcaut that since the outbreak 9d the largest attendance in their history, and, incidentally, it Is even more significant that the Canadian government has made provision for the support of these fairs by reason of the fact that they have proved themselves to be of such great value to the government. That must be our mission here — to make ourselves of such great value to the government that we may receive its seal of approval in the nature of government aid. In Canada recognized fairs receive from the government sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the premium money offered. And. further, believing that as regards the live stock, the industry will be advanced by comparisons wit'.i standard types of animals, the Canadian government pays Ihe expenses of secur - ing the best judges to be had. This is probably doing more toward establishing a common conception of the standard type of each class of animals than any other thing that could be done. Last year, in the one province of Alberta, governmental aid for the fairs amounted to $125,000. Improvement*. Karly last spring it became evident that most of the buildings on the fair grounds were badly in need of painting, from the standpoints of both prservation and improvement of appearance of the grounds. Conse - quently some $3,000 was spent in painting machinery hall, the amphi - theatre, the west bleachers, the coliseum, cattle barn, auditorium, do - mestic products and bee building, textile building, pony barns, ladles' comfort house, Boys' Camp tent houses, the new lecture hall and the dwelling house. In addition, the owners of private buildings were com- </seg>

Thla policy, I believe, should be rontlnupd a* it aavet the expense Inci - dent to sending a man here and the cost of material left on their hands, some of which would result in a loss. During the past year at the Boys' Camp there was constructed two new tent houses and good-sized lecture hall, In which the boys are a - sembled lor the lectures on agricultural subjects delivered by Instructor* from the State Farm. Northeast of the Boys' Camp and west and north of the new swine bam, In a section of the grounds as yet unusued by the fair, we have done a great deal toward Oiling the deep gully which ex - tends across the northwest part of the grounds. The cost of this Oiling and grading, since the last fair, has amounted to $4, 196.60— a most neces - sary Item of expenditure, yet one that doesn't show as other expendi - tures do, such as, for example, the new street which, as planned, will run In front of the new swine barn, extending from the coliseum In a southeasterly direction to the Seventeenth Street entrance. This street, which will be curbed and parked and a full hundred feet In width from curb to curb, will eventually be one of the most beautiful things about the fair ground!. Due to a lack of water pressure we had never been able, heretofore, to use all toilets, lavatories and drinking fountains In Agricultural Ha I. Attar consideration by the Board of Managers, It was decided to have laid a six-inch water main coming from Twenty-flrst Street Into the grounds and running along the east side of Agricultural Hall down &lt;u Machinery Hall, where another hydrant was established, then along the west side of Machinery Hall to where It could be connected with the four-inch main at the toilet building Just west of Machinery Hall. At the northeast corner of Agricultural Hall the four-inch main coming from the west was connected to this new six-Inch main and thus circulation was obtained from the six-Inch main coming In at the main gate and our water troubles were at an end. This was done at a cost of f 1,720.78. In planning for the new swine barn it became necessary to provide an adequate water supply for the bog exhibit so a new four-inch main was laid from the main coming in at the Seventeenth Street entrance running west on the south side of Humphrey Avenue to the new sanitary toilet erected last year. From this point a two-lcnh pipe was laid to the Boys' Camp grounds, thus affording a sufficient supply of water and doing away with the laying of a pipe just under the surface of the ground each year and compelling the boys to drink the sun-warmed and far from refreshing water. The laying of this new main called for the expenditure of $709.22, or a total of $2,430.00 for the two new systems. These should prove sufficient for some time to come.

Never before had a state fair undertaken an attraction of th* Mlze of the modern circuit It may be said that perhaps never before did a state fair attendance approve of an mirarilnn an did Nebraska people approve of the Hagenbeck-Wallace (Mrcus. From newspaper! and ■poken opinion alike came the unanlmoui verdict that the clrcui was the finest amusement ever presented at the state fair. There are bigger circuses than the Hagenbeck-Wallace, but none better In quality. The acts of the circus, between which were sandwiched the races, provided a continued series of thrills that gripped the spectator for more than four hours. There was never a moment when Interest lagged, and the whole amusement program moved with smoothness of clockwork. Nebraska realised an awakening In horse racing this year and not for some time have we been favored with better racing than was pre - sented to our patrons last fall. Perhaps this was In no small measure due to the Increased Interest engendered by a Lincoln committee which Joined the Nebraska Racing Circuit and put on a summer meet at the fair grounds the first week In July. This was a most successful meet, our track record having been broken and a great many new racing men Introduced to our track. Much will be found In the year book for 1017 which has Just come from the press regarding the 1917 state fair, and I will not go Into great detail In regard to the work of each department. A new de - parture Is being presented this year in publishing a report of the state fair In the annals of the year rather than, as la the past, waiting until a year bad elapsed before the same was published. In this way It Is possible to place the wonderful work of the state fair before the people while It Is still fresh In their minds and still a matter of Interest. The Live Stock Exhibits. Perhaps more Interest was manifested In live stock this year than ever before. For this the state fair advertising urging an Increased pro - duction of foodstuffs was largely responsible. The horse show was somewhat below normal, due, mainly, to the curtailment of Importations for the past three years. In addition to this must be recognized the fact that interest In horse breeding Is lagging by reason of a prevailing question as to the future of the horse, the pony exhibit was, however, the best in Its history and all that was lost in the horse exhibit was made up in the ponies. The cattle show, with its 633 animals, while not quite as large as in some former years, presented an exhibit unequaled In quality. The strik - ing uniformity of each breed in the exhibit was the noticeable thing about the exhibit. As usual, the number of entries from out of the state was greater than the number of Nebraska owned entries. The swine show had 1,746 entries, which assuredly Justifies a claim for new exhlbi- </seg>
            <seg id="p031">30 I'liixKKMNiiS NKHKAXKA STATK HOAKH III AOIMITI.TI Ul lion quarters such as will be provided for next year. The show was like - wise of rare quality, with Nebraska entrants taking about 80 per cent of the premium money. The sheep exhibit was the largest in its history and of the usual excellent quality. For the first time the poultry show, consisting of 2,673 entries, was piesented in uniform coops with which the exhibitors in this depart - ment were greatly pleased. It gave the opportunity for better -showing of the birds as well as better ventilation throughout the building and exhibitor* will greatly appreciate the continued use of these coops. A great many changes were effected this last fall in Agricultural Hall. The Better Babies exhibit was removed to the main floor of the textile building and the Fine Arts exhibit was placed on the west balcony of Agricultural Hall, where the Better Babies exhibit had been. The Educational exhibit was the finest ever presented and required much additional space. The lecture room in the northeast corner of the hai was torn out and in its place were placed booths (or housing the Food Training Camp. In the southeast corner was placed the Boys and Girls Canning Club demonstration work. In the agricultural exhibit eighteen counties were represented. At this time of so urgent need of food products the men who assembled these fine exhibits are to be highly commended for their increased efforts in helping stimulate the production of more food. The removal of the large ice box from the west end to the center of the north side gave the Horticultural Society more space and better light for displaying their excellent exhibit. To finish up these changes and make the building take on an effect never before attained the old cement tank in the center was made into a rustic, rock-enclosed foun - tain and the florists, catching the spirit, filled the parking space with a marvelous display of palms, shrubbery and other foliage while the use of foliage, in decorating the sieel posts and overhead beams, was sup - plemented by bunting in the national colors. In the Dairy exhibit a martial spirit predominated, this being evi - denced by a group of figures moulded from butter entitled the "Spirit of 1917, same as in 1776." The exhibit was first class throughout and strongly indicative of the splendid co-operation enjoyed among the dairy interests in this state. The Domestic Products show received no little favorable attention, particularly the canning work which gave evidence that at this critical time we need not fear for want of fruits and vegetables, even should the canning factories of the country be unable to supply the increased de - mand, for Mother has not forgotten how to use the Mason jar.-;. Should this war continue, I predict that our premium list will have to be changed, and should be changed, to encourage and allow an exhibit of breads and pastries made of flours other than wheat.

The Textile department saw equally as large an exhibit as last year with a perceptible increase in entries from outside the City of Lincoln. By the removal of the art exhibit from this building more wall space v as made available for the display of articles in this class, and relieved the difficulties incident to hanging articles two and three deep upon the walls. The problem of adequate quarters being solved, I would recom - mend the next step taken should be to make the display safe from loss. This can best be done by providing glass cases, have the judging done before the opening of the fair and then lock the exhibit up in these cases during the week. One of the great drawbacks tu the educational exhibit has been the delay in ge'ting before the schools our premium list. This has not been done, heretofore, until along in the spring of the year in which the fair was held, giving the pupils but a short time before school closed in the spring to prepare the articles which our premium list called for. This Fail the matter was taken up and the Board of Managers decided to try out lhe plan of having this list compiled in the fall and sheets printed and se.it to the various schools of the state that the pupils might have the best part of the school year to prepare their work for the coming fa : r. This, I think, will provide an incentive for an even greater edu - cational exhibit next fall. The Machinery exhibit once more came to its own in the 1917 state lair. It would seem that after a few years' absence the implement manu - facturer has awakened to the necessity of exhibiting his products at a place where they are viewed by the progressive farmers of the state from an entirely different angle than on the retailers' floor. It is at the state fair that the farmer has the opportunity of comparing the different makes of a certain implement and the manufacturer who has the most efficient implement in that line no doubt has gained a customer. As the army and navy continue to draw the man power from our fields it be - hooves the farmer to turn towards more labor-saving devices, that agri - cultural production will not suffer. The automobiles and trucks, for the first time, exclusively filled Machinery Hall and the overflow had to be accommodated in two other buildings. This is indicative of the growth of this exhibit and it is pract'cally a foregone conclusion that we must find other quarters for the exhibit in the future. Nebraska Manufacturers' Hall never appeared to better advantage than at the last state fair. Manufacturing is growing in Nebraska and the exhibits of Nebraska-made products keeps pace with the progress of the industry.

A light oak compo-board back was put in each booth, which gave a more finished appearance than we have hitherto had. In the Better Babies exhibit a new plan was tried out, in securing paid examiners for the babies, rather than relying solely on volunteer service. The plan worked out much better than had been true under the volunteer system and should, I believe, be continued. To the Boys' Camp of 1917 belongs the banner for number in at - tendance, 147 boys taking advantage of this short course in agriculture and other educational features connected with their week's stay at the fair. Here the boys learn the first principles of co-operation, in organi - zation of the tent group, in the grandstand while ushering, in the class room and in the camp as a whole. This is a great work the state fair Is doing. The boy is the state's greatest resource and I consider the money spent in this work one of the best investments we make. Let me say, in conclusion, that governmental interests have, and will, stand first in the consideration of this Board. We have been of whatever aid was possible to the government and in the future this must be even more true. Not only have we used the state fair In promoting governmental interests, but we have done our share in financing the war to the extent of a subscription for $5,000 worth of Liberty Bonds, only $1,250.00 worth of which were allowed us. In addition, we have subscribed $100 to the Red Cross fund and donated to that organization the space used in Agricultural Hall for the presentation of their exhibit.

The county fair banquet will be given at the Commercial Club this evening. The price of the tickets will be $1.25. I hope the extra 25 cents will not keep anybody out.

            <seg id="p042">PROCEEDINGS NKHKAKKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE 39 REPORT OF THE PREMIUM REVISION COMMITTEE. a. m Your Committee begs leave to submit the following report: All dates in the 1918 premium list be changed to conform to the dates for the Fair of 1918. Page 16: Recommended that the salary of the superintendents of Class A, B and C and that of the superintendent of gates be increased from $50.00 to $60.00. McLeod: What I object to is the raising of salaries of the super - intendents. These superintendents do not need a raise and it is not wise, the war is on and we do not know what we will need in the way of money, and this is the time to curtail expenses, and I believe we should count our resources and if found sufficient I could not object, but on account of the war I move to amend, to leave the salaries of the superintendents as they are at the present time. Leave A, B, C and Oates as they are for the present. Ollis: There is a motion made that the salaries of the superintend ents shall be left as they were in the past. Jackson: I second the motion Hall: As a member of the committee I want to make a little explanation. There are some superintendents getting $60.00 and it oc - curred to us that there were superintendents there who were doing as much work as those getting $60.00 and who were only getting $50.00 and we thought to raise or lower, to come to the $60.00 mark for it seems to me they should all be the same. Ollis: Is there anyone else who wishes to talk on this subject? Jackson: Read those that you raised again Wolcott: Superintendents of A. B. C and of Gates Ollis: If there are no further remarks, you may vote. The Re - vision Committee has recommended the raising of the salaries of four superintendents from $50.00 to $60.00. The motion is that the report be refected In that particular and that the salaries remain the same as before. Leftwich: I want to make an amendment to that motion, in order to be consistent in this matter; that the salaries of those named and of the superintendent of machinery hall and all those whose salaries are now $60.00 be placed at $50.00. Ollis: The nuestion as it now stands is that the salaries of all superintendents who have received more than $50.00 heretofore be re - duced to $50.00 and those at $50 04) remain the same. Mr. McLeod. do you accept this amendment to your motion? Seconded and carried Pace 16: That the assistant superintendents, except those specified also the ticket seller*, clerks rnd Kate keeper! receive a salary of $4.0fl per day.

Hall: In the making of these revisions there has been a lot of repetition, we have tried to trim it down, to eliminate these little things as we thought it just as well to cut this out as it is handled by he Board of Managers. Mellor: In case you du his will not all these people come in and ay they are clerks and get $3.00 per day, in other various departments? Roberts: Would it not be up to the Board of Managers to say whether they are clerks? Mellor: There are always a few in the baby department who are employed at $1.00 or $2.00 per day in the past, they would surely come under the heading of clerks if you do not have some way of desig - nating them, they were termed helpers heretofore. Ollis: Is there any objection to the recommendation? There have iiet-ii remarks but no motion made. Mellor: Mr. President, I move that the words be left just as they are in the book. Seconded and carried. ollis: If there are no remarks un the recommendation it will be con sidered passed.

Seconded and carried. Page 22: Take out the figures "$1,500.00" and insert in lieu thereof •$1,800.00". McLeod: Why was that change made? I want some information Member: Just another member was added to the Board of Man agers. Johansen: In regard to this, you pay the secretary the same as you did before. I would either say take it out of his salary or give ■him the right to vote. I was not in favor of taking the vote away from the secretary last year and I do not think it is necessary. It is addding to the cost and not helping matters a bit. Ollis: Do I hear a motion? If not we will pass it and this section is adopted.

Ollis: Can any member of the committee explain this? Member: Have you a premium list? Hall: Mr. Chairman, we discussed the idea of having three judges. They are required to judge the best animals and it says here that their ballot shall be without consultation. Jackson: We were talking about No. 29. Hall: No. 29 is specified in another place Ollis: If there is no objection we will adopt this paragraph in regard to the awards, being made by the judges. Page 24: Eliminate paragraph 31 and to paragraph 30 on page IS add "The committee or judge shall sign the entry books". Oills: If there are no objections, this section will be adopted. Page 24: Change paragraph 32 to read as follows: "When an animal or article is shown in a class to which it does not belong, it may, at the discretion of the superintendent, be transferred to the proper class previous to the awards being made". Ollis: We will adopt this section if no one objects. Page 24: Change paragraph 33 to read: "Protest must be made by an interested party to the superintendent before the awards have been made. Protest with evidence must be filed with the Board of Managers on the day the awards are made and must be accompanied by a forfeit deposit of $10.00 in case the protest is not maintained. The judge or judges sholl have power to disqualify all animals or articles which do not come up to standard". Jackson: How can the protests be made before the awards are made? Ollis: Read it again Mellor: Mr. President, often times there is an award made on some animal reported to be a certain age and afterwards you find out </seg>
            <seg id="p045">PBUCKEltlKOS NKHUASKA STATK KOAK1) OF AGRICULTURE 42 that the horse, we may say, is nm that age and according to that rule you could not get away from giving that award. I think you had better leave paragraph No. 33 the way it is, because it covers that matter now; you can take up a protest any time before this winter meeting and compel the return of the money. Ollis: The rule as it is established hag the same provision. Mellor: I did not understand that he covered the other point Ollis: The rule at present does that. Member: No I do not think they have covered that but what it intends is merely to shorten the paragraph and leave it practically the same. Hall: That is the intention. Member: It should be so you could do that afterwards, so the report would be made within a reasonable time. The next winter meet - ing is a reasonable time. Ollis: I ion't know but it seems to me that it would open up the field for thru* months, if he won he would be satisfied but if he lost it would give him three months in which to make his complaint. Mellor: Supposing a man comes in and claims an animal is a young animal, is younger than it is, now if you pass this resolution as the premium revision committee has made it here you eliminate the opportunity of making that man cough up. Smith: I think the provision stated by Mr. Mellor is good. I know from personal experiences that sometimes complaints have been filed in regard to ages of animals, the reason that they have not been brought before the Board is that the protest must be made before the committee made the report and I think it would be an incentive to exhibitors to come in with the proper ages of their animals. 1 think provisions should be made and could be made to take up this matter before the next winter meeting. Graff: I do not think this rule is as good a rule as could be de - vised. There must be a limit to the time when no one can come and claim that there has not been a fair deal in an award. Have it read within twenty-four hours, there must be a time when no one can reopen this matter and we must protect the honest exhibitor. I think within twenty-four hours after the award has been made is sufficient, if we could work that it would be satisfactory. Smith: The only objection I would have to the twenty-four hours is that it would not give a man sufficient time, if this were left so that it could be opened within a reasonable time it would be an incentive to bring in honest exhibitors. There is no reflection on the honest exhibitors — there is no one who wants to file $10.00 on hearsay but give them time and I would be in favor that a time limit be put on. Cheney: 1 move that the recommendations on No. 33 be referred to the Board of Managers with power to act and that they take such action as they deem best and insert the same in the book of rules. </seg>

W'olcott: As I understand it there will be only three monies paid? Member: Yes, sir. Mellor: It seems to me that to be up to date our list should contain provisions for these articles and that this discussion is brought about owing to our list, like many other things during this war, having gone out of style. Wolcott: Well I noticed this and my attention was called to it at Fair time. I think some parties had some 40 or 50 articles that were nut listed and I am satisfied there would be a big roar put up on those 40 or 50 entries if they had only allowed the three premiums. Mellor: That is up to the Board. The superintendent has nothing to do with it. Wolcott: On further down you will see where the superintendent made a note of it and asked for various articles to be added. Ollis: Any further remarks? The motion is that the recom - mendations of the committee in regard to this item be not concurred in. Seconded. Mr. Wolcott here read a list of the articles to be added to that part of the premium list under discussion. The following articles, as recommended by the superintendent of class H. to be included with the same premiums as in other entries in this class. In canned fruits and vegetables, add chokecherries, elder - berries, onions, mulberries, crab apples, sweet potatoes, fruit juices, swisschard, cabbage, cauliflower. In preserves, add chokecherries and rhubarb. Add "Conserve" and how rhubarb, pineapple and cherry. In "Marmalade" add watermelon, plum and rhubarb. In "Jams" add loganberry, gooseberry and cherry, and to "Jellies" add loganberry, plum and cherry. In "Cakes" add cherry cake. Mellor: Those are all good recommendations except it is doubtful about the one relative to pineapple, we do not grow pine apples in Nebraska: otherwise I think it is a splendid recommendation.

All in favor of this will please signify by saying aye, contrary minded no. Carried. Smith: Class S is Speed. My attention has been called to the speed program arranged by the Board of Managers which seems to be a very good program. Attention has also been called to the fact that it might have been better made if men living within the confines of the state who make possible to have good racing at our State Fair were called into consultation, not as an arbitrary matter, but there is today a desire on the part of some of the horse race men of Nebraska to be called into consultation when the program is made. Ollis: I think this last year every effort was made to get them in Smith: If you will allow me I will make a motion that when the Board of Managers prepare this speed program that they be authorized to again call before them some of the noted horse men and ask their co-operation. Ollis: Mr. Mellor's motion will take precedence over Mr Smith motion, as it was first. Seconded and carried. Ollis: Now Mr. Smith's motion is in order. Mellor: For Mr. Smith's information I think an explanation is due him, as to the method of making up this race program. Ollis: I would like to make a statement. I think that the matter you are bringing up was not an amendment to the report or an amend - ment to the premium list. That matter was before the house and I wanted to finish it up. Now your motion is in order. Mellor: I think it has been the custom of the Board to have the horse men who are interested enough come in and discuss with them these matters. The neighboring fairs, Iowa, South Dakota, and Ne - braska, the four large fairs in these three states, Iowa, Sioux City. Huron and Nebraska have gone together and made up this program.

Some fellow nets a little the worst of it, while his horse may win the race— we never can tell — it does not seem to me that you can very well make a more equitable disposition of the racing game and we have to be governed to a great extent by what other race tracks do to get the proper line of horses Smith: 1 have heard no objection on the part of any individual race horse man in regard to the program, but have had a request to ask the President and the Board of Managers to specifically name a committee of horse men, this committee to consult with the Board the same as with the swine men or the horse men. I brought this up to get the feelings of the Board on the subject. If under the wisdom of the Board they feel this should be done, I would like to have that matter taken up. Danielson: 1 would like to further explain, for the benefit of Mr. Smith and others here, that last spring in making up the program we had some seven or eight prominent race horse men at our meeting. The day we made up the program for the last State Fair and already four of the men in Nebraska have spoken to me and asked for that privilege again and I told them 1 thought there would be no question and if the horse men would write to the association giving them a list of the horses they expected to race and the class to which they were eligible, if not there in person. I know their proxy would be accepted by the men making the program. I think it will work to better advantage, when they get this information from these horse men. Purcell: That covered what I was going to say. I think the Board of Managers will get help from the various organizations that come before them and I want to second Mr. Smith's motion, and think it will be acceptable to the Board of Managers. Ollis: Mr. Smith please state your motion. Smith: It is the sense of this body that the Board invite a com - mittee of race horse men and arrange the speed program for the coming year. Mellor: I wish to amend this by having the Board give a general invitation to the horse men to come in and express their desires in regard to the make-up of the program. Smith: I accept the amendment. Ollis: Moved and seconded that the Board of Managers be re - quested to give a general invitation to the horse men to come in and express their desires in regard to the make-up of the program. Any remarks? Seconded and carried. Graff: Mr. Chairman, I noticed when this report was made by the Revision Committee something about putting up a special money by the State Board for Nebraska exhibit of sheep. That is as old as the hills, that idea; it crops out every little bit not with the sheep men but with the different live stock associations. It has been a contention with the association of fairs, it is going to get the Board into trouble. I </seg>

Now I know the intention is good, I know the gentleman back of this move and he is doing so much for the sheep industry, in fact it would take a hundred of us to do what he is doing. If we made just one little addition we would do very little in comparison with what he is doing, and there is no good reason why we should not give special money to other breeds by Nebraska exhibitors and let us take that into consideration. We are going to run into something that will be difficult to get out of unless wp go clean down the line. 1 make the motion that that part of the report be eliminated. Ollis: You understand. Mr. Graff, that this was referred to the Hoard of Managers for action. Graff: Yes. 1 think it is our duty to lessen the labor and the trials and tribulations of the Board of Managers during their meetings through the year, and give such assistance as can be given to the Board of Agri - culture. 1 move to reconsider. Ollis: The motion is that this recommendation of the committee in regard to class D, Sheep, be not adopted. Cheney: 1 move to reconsider. I moved for it originally Leftwich: I want to inquire whether that is to eliminate ihe possi - bility of making a schedule for Nebraska exhibitors alone? Is that in - tended? Graff: That is the understanding. If the sheep breeders wish to put up a special premium that is all right, but for the Board to put up a special premium for Nebraska sheep would be unfair to all other live stock exhibitors at this Fair. Leftwich: I think our sheep industry being weak, we should en - courage the breeding of sheep in this state. I do not think it should be left open to the sheep of other states; I think it should be open to Ne - braska sheep alone. Mellor: 1 would like to ask Mr. Leftwich if it is not a fact that Nebraska sheep breeders take nearly all of the money anyway, I think you will find that there is more money paid out for sheep, that there is not as much money in the hog department per hog as there is in the sheep department, I think you will find there is more money paid per sheep. Mr. Danielson here stated that there were 384 sheep and $1,441.01 was paid for premiums, and 1,803 hogs with $5,605.50 paid in premiums Mellor: $2.00 for the swine, $4.00 for sheep.

Mr. Ollis called the meeting to order and stated that the Secretary would call the roll.

Leftwich: I move the report be adopted and the committee dis- charged. Jackson: Bet ore we proceed with other business, I want to place before you a resolution. The Secretary will read the same. Danielson: This is the resolution, which I will read at this time: "Believing that the meetings of the State and County Fair officials are highly beneficial and, in turn, educational, and that subjects under discussion at these meetings are very beneficial to the whole people of the state, if they are taken back to the people by the accredited delegates to these meetings, and especially are they beneficial to our County Fairs and the building up of agriculture through these Fairs, taking a broad viewpoint it is essential that all information to be obtained at these meetings should be in the hands of the various Fair Boards, given to them by their accredited delegates. "RESOLVED, That at future meetings of the State Board of Agricul - ture and the State County Fair organizations, a roll be made of the mem - bership of said Board and all duly accredited delegates from the various agricultural societies, that said roll be called at each session of the State Board of Agriculture and State County Fair Association and that any members or delegates failing to answer the roll call and remaining, unless excused by the President, shall not be entitled to the regular mileage and per diem for attendance at said meetings." Jackson: Mr. Chairman, I move the adoption of the resolution. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRILTI.TURK 50 Seconded Ollis: You have beard the resolution read, moved and seconded are there any remarks? Jackson: I do not think it is necessary to go into any extended explanation, the resolution explains itself If we are sent here to attend these meetings we should attend them. If we are sent here to have a good time we should do it at our own expense. The resolution covers the whole story. The motion carried. Ollis: The next thing on the regular program would be the election of officers, but I thought possibly that if there was anything to be brought before the meeting for the good of the Board, this would be as good a time as any to take up things of that kind. I hope that every man here, as the president of a county fair or a member of the State Board of Agriculture, comes here with the intention of trying to do something while here that will help the State Board of Agriculture in the work it has to do and if there are any suggestions to be made 1 hope that some good may come out of them. Lawrence: Gentlemen, the State Fair Board has a very good sec - retary and a very good president, from the reports that you heard yes - terday, but there are two or three things in those reports that touched the affairs of this Board. The law which created the Board was a law which states that we are gathered together from all over the state to discuss agriculture. This was said in the reports we heard yesterday and there was much food for thought in those reports and after they were read, we came down to the discussion of agriculture in this state. We discussed for about one and a half hours a very delightful revision of the premium list. Very laboriously and solemnly we brought up the question as to whether a rooster should have 50 cents in the premium list or not; we decided very cumbersomely and stolidly as to whether the sheep men should be protected or that all sheep exhibitors be entered and finally we put it up to the Board of Managers. After we had scratched our heads we reconsidered the provision and decided that we would handle this matter all by ourselves. I have come 450 miles to decide these things and then we decided among all the very terrible things as to whether we should have eight new kinds of dessert, and we decided that we could take all these with the exception of pine - apple. I put it that way because that is the way that it looked to me. It looks to me that the time spent in considering the very small things in these meetings is too great. I would like to know what we are going to do when we get back to our county. I want to know the live things that hold for us a very great interest, but being interested here seems to me talking about 50 cents on a rooster premium. There are not many men who have any interest in this matter. I want to discuss topics of interest to the people out in the state, and in coming to these meetings, we came up here this morning, and as I understand it, that when we </seg>
            <seg id="p054">PROCEEDINGS NKUKASKA STATK KOAKI) OK AGRICULTITRK 51 elected the officers we quit. The big thing that we have to decide is what we are going to do to help during the ensuing year, and in order that this mistake shall not be made again I am going to propose that this arduous task of changing the premium list be put in the hands ot a committee of eleven, of which the Secretary is one. The things that are vital shall be talked over by us, but those other things should not. When you ask me to decide about the sheep, and last year it was the hogs, and we had to decide if the date of the birth of a hog should be September 15th or August 15th, and we spend three-quarters of an hour trying to decide, it is my motion that this committee of eleven shall de - cide and work on this premium list and get rid of it without ever en - cumbering this meeting with it. Purcell: I had quite a little talk last evening with Mr. Lawrence and other members and I think the sentiment he voices is quite general, at least I felt so from expressions I had heard along the same line. This practically has been going on for some time, and I believe this is the time to change this so that next year we should have things of more importance brought up here. I rise to second the motion of Mr. Law - rence. Ollis: I do not understand that Mr. Lawrence made any motion; did you make that a committee of eleven? Lawrence: Yes, so we could touch as many of the propositions as we could, with the Secretary not an ex-offlcio member, but a working member. ' 7 V Ollis: Would it not be well to embody that in four motion? Lawrence: They are to be appointed by the Board of Managers Ollis: It has been moved that a committee of eleven be appointed by the Board of Managers to revise the premium list. Mellor: Mr. President and Gentlemen: I realize that what Mr. Lawrence has said is to the point. At the time the State Board of Agri - culture was organized it was the only body dealing with agriculture in the State of Nebraska. From this body has grown the different societies we have today, who take up the specific propositions he has mentioned, swine, dairy and horticulture. All of these different organizations have sprung from the State Board of Agriculture and the rules and regula - tions as stated here in our by-laws have not kept pace with the times. This week there are meetings that convene at different points in the city and it is supposed that the members will be interested enough to go to these meetings and to take part. Of course, it has resolved itself into this, that this body which also constitutes the State Board of Agri - culture shall take part in these meetings and it has been our custom to take charge of all special matters and leave the other matters as to what might be done in the different socities. We have a meeting in which these matters are discussed and the people interested are sup - posed to attend, and we should attend, and I believe every member is in duty bound to attend the meeting of the County Fair Association ; these </seg>
            <seg id="p055">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATK KdAKH OK AUEICULTUKI county fair associations are the backbone ot this organization and thai is the reason Mr. Lawrence has seen the inconsistency in these things. 1 think, however, an amendment should be made to his motion about eleven men being on this committee; I think it should be the superin - tendents of the different departmests giving premiums, together with the Board of Managers. The Secretary would be with the Board of Managers, that would not eliminate him, but I think the Board should invite the superintendents of the various departments to meet with them to fix the premium list. Lawrence: I act-ept the amendment Ollis: The motion stands now that tile revision of the premium list shall be left with the Board of Managers, with the superintendents of the different departments which pay money premiums at the Fair. Secnoded and carried McLeod: It looks to me as if we eliminate the nice little job of pulling the premium on the best rooster it will leave us without a job miles* we take up the other things, as Mr. Mellor suggested, and I be - lieve we should take up the big things and think we can find other things that we should take up and I am against coming do'vn here, electing officers and going home. Mellor: 1 do not believe thai this Board should try to disorganize any of these specific organizations working to the best of their ability to further the interests of some specific product of the state. If this Board desires to appoint some person 10 read a paper or deliver an ad - dress at some of these meetings, I think it is within their province to do so and if they do, show your good will by attending, and I am not in favor of making this specific work along this line. McLeod: I would like to know how many of these men attend the meetings. I have been coming down here for twelve or fourteen years and when I go to the State Farm I never see any of these members there; I presume some of them go and I have heard that many are go - ing as quickly as they get out of this meeting and how are we going to get these things unless we get a little of this into these meetings? How would it be to take a standing vote on those who would take in these meetings at the State Farm this afternoon and all week? Ollis: Would it not be a good idea to make a motion or ask for a standing vote on this subject, as to who will attend some of these meetings at the State Farm before they go home? Smith: The thought occurred to me it would be well to inject a motion similar to the one Brother Jackson offered, that we would hold up the mileage until they do attend those meetings. I do not believe it would be necessary. Seriously, I feel like Mr. Mellor, that these special organizations have a place in agriculture, this State Fair Board is a State Fair Board and is as much of an agricultural board as this body purposes to make of it. I do not object to having a program, I think it is right. Thirty years ago they had a couple of papers read and did </seg>
            <seg id="p056">I-KUCEKOINUS XEBKASKA HTATK HUAKb OF AUKIlTL'l'l'KK nut want those instilled into the annual meeting to the detriment of these other societies. I believe we should have representation in all of these other meetings. I think we should be put on the programs of these other meetings; I hope we can put a ban on this staying away from the meetings; I do not want to burden business organizations with a long program that might be construed that we were having a side show here of our own. I hope we can bring about something that will compel us to do so. Jackson: In order to get this thing before the house I am going to move that before the next annual meeting the President be instructed to appoint a committee of five to attend the different meetings. 01li8: If there is no second I was going to make a suggestion Jackson: All right OUis: It occurs to me that Hie Secretary should lake this up along toward the time of the next meeting, he is devoting his time to the State Board of Agriculture, I suggest that he study up and come in touch with some of the big questions, that the Board of Managers at their last meeting before this meeting have laid before them this matter and that they would agree on a schedule of questions that they thought needed particular attention by these different meetings held at the State Kami and have one or two short papers read before the meeting. I do not think it would be a wise plan to have half a dozen different papers read here. Then the Board of Managers can get their heads together and study these matters seriously and then bring them her", and ap - point a committee to attend each of these meetings at the Farm. Mitchell: I have been coming to these meetings for the last five years and I have been pretty busy attending these meetings here and the County Fair Managers' meeting and have not had time to attend other meetings held during the week of Organized Agriculture. I am not Tooling away my time, when we are working revising the premium list I am learning something there, 1 find out how to revise it and take it back to the boys at home and we know better what to do with our own premium list and I would not like to see any rules injected to send men to other meetings. Jackson: My object in making the motion was that it should mean after we had completed our work here, when there will be meetings all week. oilis: That was my idea. These meetings always adjourn on Wednesday noon, there are a good many hundred men in Lincoln who expect to stay over the week to attend these meetings, and a good many men who could afford to stay one day. Mellor: About five years ago we divided the State Board of Agri - culture into about nine committees and gave each of these committees a chance to report at this meeting, like Good Koads, Live Stock Industries, Agricultural Industries, Marketing, Production and Marketing, and (or a year or two one or two of these committees made reports and then it </seg>
            <seg id="p057">54 I'KOCKKtJINOS NKMKABKA ITATK KOAKD OK AOKICL'I.TI'RE began to be said that "I made a report last year and It U to be the samp this year," so there was nothing done after we had those meet' Ings, and I think the way to get this Information is to get it at the meetings of each particular branch. Hoffmeister: I do not think this body of men has a right to tell any certain person to attend the meetings next Friday and Saturday and stay here at his own expense and the rest of us go home. I do not think this body should dictate what meetings should be attended. I am In the fancy cattle and hog business, and will go to the State Farm as soon as I am through here and will attend a meeting tomorrow. If I do not take interest in my own business I do not want you to do it for me. Any man who is in the business if he does not take enough interest to at - tend these meetings he should go out of that business and go into something else. OH in : The Doctor has just proven the suggestion I made a short time ago. That kind of a man could be appointed to go to these meet - ings and the Doctor would be a good man to be appointed in that par - ticular line and the same thing would apply to others. Lawrence: I think I have not made myself clear or you have not understood me. I have not asked that this meeting be thrown open to the cattle or hog or sheep men for discussions; somebody offered a resolution about three years ago that we ask the State Railway Com - mission not to raise the two-cent fare. I am asking right here, under this stress of circumstances, with this great war on, that you make your resolutions as to where you are going to stand on the Increased nog production that the United States is asking for, or any other question rt national importance. Leftwich: It may be a little late to make this suggnsticn, but it seems to me yesterday morning at the opening of our meeting a com - mittee on resolutions touching the live issues of the state and nation, and especially in regard to agricultural matters, would be in a letter position to discuss these matters. Ollis: In the Secretary's report everything as recommended by the Secretary was adopted. If this convention wants that done you could ap - point a committee to sift out a few things and put them out as resolu - tions adopted, that would be a very easy thing to do, but I do not think anything should be discussed here that was not included at tnat time Lawrence: I believe it should be discussed, but we had too much rooster. We should discuss the reports of the President and Secretary. Ollis: An honest confession by all, I guess; a discussion was called for. Strader: Mr. Danielson took me to task for the fact that I did not take up the boy problem in the meeting. 1 suggest that we have a period taken up with the boy problem and what the Boys' Camp means to the State of Nebraska he thing does occur to me that if we could have a man who rould give us a talk on community relations it would not cost </seg>

Member: Mr. President, I find that In our program on page 4 there is a topic, "War Day," which says the officers were trying to «&gt;■&lt; two or three speakers here to talk at this time about questions of national im - portance and I would like to ask if any of these speakers are coming to talk this week, and where. Dantelson: I will Bay for the information of the member that 1 think Friday and Saturday have been set aside as patriotic day; and most of the men are going to be here and speak at St. Paul's church. Mellor: We will have some good speakers here Danielson: At St. Paul's church? Mellor: At night, yes; I do not know about the day meetings Danielson: The men who were asked to come were asked to be here Friday and Saturday so as not to conflict with these meetings. Hall: The reports of the Secretary and President cover a good many points that are before us at this time. I think this fact is appre - ciated by everybody who heard those addresses, but the fact of the matter is those reports will not reach many people under the present conditions, until the year book is published. By that time, as condi - tions change very fast, they might not sound so good as they do now and it would be a good plan to get these out to the different organiza - tions in the state. I make a motion that the Secretary be instructed to have these reports printed and mailed out the same as the regular bulletins. Seconded and carried. Hervey: I would like to ask what became of the sheep provision that was presented; it seems to have been lost. I represent a committee here, backed by the State Council of Defense, to look after the sheep and wool industries of the State of Nebraska. We are vitally in earnest; it may be taken as a joke, of course, by some people of the state who do not understanding the sheep conditions that exist. I have a little statement here I would like to read, as a matter of information to the Board. Nebraska is the twenty-eighth state in sheep population. </seg>
            <seg id="p059">56 rKiM KKI.INli.-- NEHKASKA SI A IK BllAUll Ol' l«KK:l I.Il'HK In 1915 there were 6,5imi sheep destroyed by dogs and wolves, valued at from $60,000 to $70,000. This is about tin average annual amount of destruction by these animals. Nebraska has almost double the land area of Ohio. Nebraska should have a flock population of at least two to three millions of sheep and x wool product of 25.000,000 pounds. This would not be out of reason. Nebraska does not produce ."&gt;" per cem of the wool demanded to clothe her people. Ohio has 26,000,000 acres of land. Nebraska has 49,850,000 acres. Ohio has 3 to 4 millions of sheep. Nebraska has not to exceed an average of 300,000 sheep. Nebraska, in all respects, is as well adapted to sheep raising as Ohio. Nebraska feeds more sheep than any state in the Union, but is forced to barricade its feed lots to keep the dogs out. Besides this, the dog contributes to the spread of contagious animal disease more than any other means. Ohio has a consistent special dog law. Olli.s: When you first got up you started by asking a question, and 1 was going to answer that, but I did not hardly have a place to break in, if you will pardon me, Mr. Hervey: the question came up yesterday afternoon when the Premium Revision Committee reported and the sheep question was discussed for quite a considerable time and action taken on it and it was afterwards brought up for reconsideration and I think there was as much time spent on the sheep question as on all the rest of the premium list put together, and I think yesterday was the proper time to discuss this. Hervey: We were assured it would be taken care of OHis: I just wanted to give that information. Hervey: We are doing what we can, in the State Council of De - fense, to promote the sheep industry and one reason why we asked for this classification was to build up the State Fair. Our State Fair is away down in sheep; we are not in sight with the other states that have not the advantages and opportunities our state has. Iowa, right across the river, has been maintaining a double classification to protect its own exhibitors. Our State Fair does not invite young exhibitors and young exhibitors are the ones we want to come here, and there are a hundred or more sheep breeders on a small scale and we give them to Nebraaka'a ( Dog and Sh heep Population. »14 Sbeep 300,00(1 Dogs 96.19:. 915 280.O0H 105.47S gain one year of 9,288 dons 916 185,000 108,777 gain one year of 3,299 dogs* 917 217,000 109.742 gain one year of 965 dog* • (lain three years 13,547 dogs </seg>

There are two big ex - hibitors here in Nebraska that come in and take first and second and possibly third, and a few exhibitors from Iowa take the balance; our young fellows are invited to stay at home — they cannot get any premiums. Now we would like to have some kind of an arrangement whereby our exhibitors can be protected. We are willing to call it an Amateur Sheep Breeders' Association, that will take it out of the way of two or three of our important breeders who are able to exhibit at Iowa and Nebraska and other states and stand a show of getting the premiums, but we do insist upon an amateur classification to protect our young breeders and help the sheep industry in Nebraska. We have no selfish interests, we are not sheep breeders in the way of exhibitors, but we would like to raise the sheep exhibit in Nebraska to the third place in the United States, that would be leaving out Iowa and Ohio. We can do so if you will give us the opportunity. Graff: Perhaps I can throw a little light on the subject, a; least so it can be understood. I am willing to make a confession right here that it was I who struck the fatal blow to the sheep proposition on this floor yesterday and I did it because it was impracticable to put it in that form, as I look upon it. It was rather cute for the Revision Committee to pass it on in that way. I might say this, gentlemen, the Nebraska Improved Live Stock Breeders' Association is willing to hang up a little special fund and those men, with Mr. Hervey at the head, shall see that it is paid to Nebraska exhibitors. I do not know what the State Board of Agriculture will do, but I believe they are big enough to look at it from the same viewpoint and they will duplicate that amount and it will be given, say in the guise of a war measure, and when you fellows with other breeds will show us first whether or not you are growing wool on your animals and not merely for exhibition purposes I think the Board will stand for it. Hervey: What is being done at other state fairs should be done in this state. Now Iowa is conducting a State Fair that does not em - barrass them in any way and the sheep classification is a good one. I do not think you will be embarrassed by other outside breeders coming in.

ANDERSON, Field Ageni. Nebraska Board of Agriculture Division of Agr. Statistics K R. DANIELSON, Secretary This bulletin marks the first annual cooperative report ot the Ne - braska State Board of Agriculture and the Bureau of Crop Estimates. While it does not differ materially from previous annual statistical re - ports issued by the Nebraska Board of Agriculture, it has the advantage of the combined efforts of the two statistical departments. Heretofore, the independent reports of the two departments differed slightly which was due largely to differences in acreage. Most farmers have shown greater appreciation for agricultural statistics and have cooperated with the assessors to the fullest extent. However, a few still believe that crop reports furnish the specific in - formation under which the speculator operates to the detriment of the farmers' interest. As a matter of fact, the agricultural report is the only counter weapon the farmer has against the speculator. Those interested in the grain trade have crop reporting systems through which they receive advance information, and do not wait for the official reports of the state an dgovernment which are made public to all at the same time. Through these official reports the farmer learns the facts and need not be misled by false reports. With them he can then judge more nearly as to what he is entitled to receive. Prices are. or should be. governed by the law of supply and de - mand; it is this uncertainty of supply and demand that gives rise to speculation, o eliminate this uncertainty by publishing the unbiased facts to all, at regular intervals, is the work of the Crop Reporting Service. This prevents, to a large extent, undue advantage which could otherwise be taken by certain individuals if the facts were not published by an unbiased source of information. he assessors' reports on acreages are exceptionally complete this year, and show as great a degree of accuracy as any of the census re - ports on acreage. Much credit is due to the splendid efforts of the assessors, and the county clerks in the compilation of the acreage statistics. Valued assistance has been received from many other or - ganizations. Special credit is also due the large force of regular crop corres - pondents, who not only furnished yield estimates for this report, but for all preliminary monthly reports as wefl. In addition, a large number of farmers who are not regular correspondents furnished estimates for this final report. Crop correspondents seve without compensation other than the personal satisfaction of the consciousness of rendering a wrvice beneficial to all. A slight difference will be found in the production figures between thi* report and thone published in the monthly orop bulletin of the </seg>

This is due largely to the fact that the Bureau publishes its acreage figures in even thousands, while in this report the exact figures are given. The state average yield in this bulletin is obtained by dividing the total production by the total acreage (with the exception of wild hay) and carried to one decimal point only; therefore, the acreage multiplied by the yield will be slightly less than the total state production. This explains why the production estimates do not agree exactly in the two reports. CROP REPORTING SERVICE (State and Federal).

            <seg id="p218">PKOCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE POAKI) OF AOBKXLTl'RE 207 THE PURE BRED SWINE INDUSTRY SELECTING — BREEDING — RAISING — FEEDING AND SHOWING Paper read by E. R. Danielson, before the Swine Breeders, State Farm, Lincoln, January, 1918: My purpose in appearing here today is to touch upon some of the problems of hog-raisins — to g^' down into the more practical phases of the business and leave with you a few thoughts th&amp;.t will result in greater hog exhibits in the future, and an increased production of a most necessary article in Uncle's Sam's diet. Little that I can say will be new to most of you. The old hog man. if he be at all of a thoughtful and observing nature, knows thoroughly the fine points of the business. The difficulty is either carelessness or forgetfulness. Rather than make greater efforts he remains content with lesser results. The things i would bring up here are aimed to encourage increased efforts and pe - haps to remind some of you of things that you have allowed to slip you • mind. First of all let me remark as to the sire of your herd. It is no nev: saying to most of you that "the sire is half of the herd." How many of you believe it? How many of you are governing yourselves accord ingly? If you are not, you are losing money every day and you' 1 ', appreciate the fact in a few years when your herd begins to show c marked deterioration which it will if your boar is not all he should b&lt; In these days, when pure-bred males are plentiful and reasonable i ) price, there is practically no excuse for any one using anything but a pure-bred boar, even though the sows be merely grades. The pure-bred male will transmit his own qualities to his progeny with greater cer - tainty than a grade or cross-bred, and will get pigs of a more uniform quality and excellence so that it pay3 to use a pure-bred boar even for producing market hogs. It is true that many pure-bred boars should not be used for breeding, but this affords no reason for using a grade boar. The "scrub" pure-bred should be rejected along with the grade and cross - bred and there are reasonably good pure-bred boars always available to the man who will make an effort to get one. When selecting a boar to head a pure-bred herd it will not do to be too economical regarding price. This does not mean that we are to pay - fancy prices running into the thousands such as one sometimes reads about, but it is well to bear in mind that a. boar, which is not good enough to command a fair price, is seldom good enough to put at the head of a pure-bred herd. The importance of the herd will determine the price which the owner can afford to pay for a boar, Out a few extra dollars on the price of a boar Is a small matter when it is the means of securing something that the breeder really needs. The mere size ol the price, however, is not a safe criterion of the merit of the boar, but it rests with the man who makes the selection to see that be gets value </seg>
            <seg id="p219">208 I'lilM'KKIUNUS NKRRASKA STATK BOAKI&gt; OF ACRHMI/n'RK For liis money. It is right here that a wide experience and a seasoned judgment count for so much in stock breeding. Sometimes aged boars, which have proved their excellence as stock-getters are to be had at a very reasonable price and if they are still active they are much safer to buy than young, untried boars. There is much unreasonable prejudice against aged boars and many an excellent aged boar is sent to the butcher long before his usefulness is past, merely because no person would buy him for breeding purposes, and young boars, many of whic&gt;&gt; should have gone to the butcher before being used at all. are taken in prcfcronio. These things are matters of judgment and to select wisely, breeder must know what he requires Whe:i buying a young boar, it will be found safer to buy one from cs'-.t to tvelve months old than a pig two or three months old. The rcr.rrn fcr this is plain, it being impossible to foretell just how the lf» going to develop. It is more satisfactory to select by vc.y yc p.-rrrnr.l inspection than to buy through correspondence. A visit to the herd v.-'.iic'i produced the boar enables one to judge the general qualities cf tro hrgs produced in the herd and one can pick up information re- ing the sire and dam that could not otherwise be obtained In selecting the boar consideration should be particularly given size strength, robustness and power. He should be stronger in the hen ' nnd possess a more muscular neck, more massive shoulders and heavie" bone than a sow or barrow. He should conform to the best type of ttr&gt; breed to which he belongs and should have a bold, impressive carriage and general appearance. There should be nothing effeminate about (••" appearance and general make-up. Coarseness and roughness are no* desirable, but if it came to a choice between two boars, one of which was fine and effeminate and the other inclining to coarseness but strong - ly masculine, my experience would lead me to choose the latter, other things being equal. Probably nothing is more essential to the health and vigor of an animal than exercise. In summer it is usually a comparatively simple matter to provide exercise in a paddock or pasture lot, but In winter •' is mere difficult. A roomy pen should be provided with a sheltere ' outside yard. When practicable, it is a good plan to feed the boar outdoors at some distance from his sleeping quarters, thus compelling him to take exercise in walking back and forth between his pen an-' the feeding place. Icy ground is the greatest drawback to this method, but this can be overcome by littering the walk with some strawy horse manure. Sometimes the boar can be fed in a well-littered barn-yard. When several boars are kept, it is difficult to provide separate runs for each boar, and it simplifies matters if they are taught to run to - gether. The tusks should be removed and a cool day should be selected for turning them together for the first time. It takes a very short time to settle the question of supremacy and when once settled no further disputes arise. The two mentioned conditions are necessary — namely, the tusks must be removed and a cool day selected for the tournam«n'. </seg>

It requires good judgment to keep a boar in the best possible condi tion. Extremes are to be avoided. The over-fat boar does not make a satisfactory sire, as a rule, and a half-starved boar cannot transmit vigor and constitution to his progeny to the same degree that he would if in fair flesh. A reasonable amount of fat upon his bones will do him no harm if he gets sufficient exercise. An exclusive meal ration will not give results, particularly if the ration is made up of corn. It is true that corn can be fed to a boar without injuring him. but it must be fed in the right way. Corn is. of course, fattening, but its exclusive use is debilitating and the feeder must combine something with it to get results. A great variety of grains can be fed instead of corn as long as the feeder uses judgment. In summer the boar may be kept in good condition with ease. Grass, clover or other pasture will furnish the bulky, succulent feed necessary for health and gathering part of his food from pasture compels the boar to take exercise. If it is not possible to provide the pasture he should be liberally supplied with grain feed in his pen. During the season, the boar should be fed liberally but at no time more than he will clean up before leaving the trough. During idle seasons a very light meal ration will be sufficient. If on pasture he will require little feed in addition. Never make sudden changes in a ration, but rather, grade up or down by gradual changes. The brood sow should be a good breeder, a good feeder and of good type in order that she. too, may transmit these characteristics to her offspring. She should be short faced, wide between the eyes. She should have a long, deep and roomy body with wide hips and be large and full in heart girth. Note her quality of bone and the style with which she carries herself. See that her back has a strong arch and that her rump is level and full, carrying its width to the tail. The nee '■ should blend smoothly into the shoulders. Do not overlook the import - ance of fine hair and good skin and refinement about the head and ears. Bright, expressive eyes and an active disposition are most essential. These win insure exercise, which is a necessary attribute to the hog's health. A wild, nervous, mean sow will often kill her young, either by accident or intention. On the other hand, a lazy, sluggish sow that will not exercise is very likely to crush her pigs by accident. Like pro - duces like. If your sow or your boar are not true to type your pigs are going to be off type and market price on your stock is going to be "off" as a result of the deficiencies. While my interest is chiefly in pure-bred hogs, let me remark that for the production of market hogs it is not essential that a sow should be pure-bred. A grade sow of good type and parentage will usually produce very satisfactory pigs for market purposes, if mated with a boar of good breeding and quality but. of course, none of her boar pigs should be kept for breeding purposes. Whether pure-bred or grade, a sow selected for breeding should bo from a prolific mother and by a boar that cornea of a prolific family, for </seg>
            <seg id="p222">210 PI'.orKKDIXGS XKBUA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTVRE fecundity is hereditary to a high degree. It is safest to select a sow from a matured mother who has had a chance to demonstrate her usef ;■ ness. In making a selection, the number and character of the teats should be noted. A sow is more likely to make a good mother if sh&lt;^ has at least twelve well-developed teats, set well apart, and the front ones well forward on the body. In character the sow is directly the opposite of the boar: there is a femininity about her general appearance and bearing which indicates the prolific and indulgent mother. When a really good sow is once obtained, she should be kept in th" herd as long as she retains her usefulness. A really good sow Is not t* easily obtained and when once acquired it will be found the part of wisdom to keep her as long as she continues to produce satisfactc- - litters. The age at which a young sow should be bred depends chiefly upon her development, but it is seldom advisable to breed her before she is eight months old. Many good breeders prefer not to breed sows before they are ten or even twelve months old and if they are intended for show purposes it is scarcely advisable to breed them earlier. One of the great objections to breeding sows very early is the fact that the young sow is seldom able to raise a fair sized litter of pigs and if she raises only a few pigs in her first litter her mammary glands do not develop properly and she rarely makes as good a nurse with subsequent litters as the sow which raises a good sized litter. Another objection to early breeding is the fact that the young sow has not the strength to stan ' the strain of nursing a litter of pigs and her vitality is sapped to such a degree that she never develops as she should. As a result, she will not retain her usefulness for so long a period nor is she so likely to give strong, vigorous litters as though she had possessed more maturity before being bred. The man who is breeding for show purposes ani who wishes to have his pigs with the sow as long as possible as well a-. «et his sows into high condition between litters will find it necessary to breed his sows only once a year. The general practice of farmers, of course, requires more of their sows than this. There is no good reason why a sow should not produce two litters a year, when properly handle '. provided the sow is not to be fitted for show purposes. I-et me add just a word concerning the care of the sow during the period of gestation. Let her be kept in good, strong condition and not overloaded with fat. Avoid extremes in condition. The fat sow is likely to become clumsy with her pigs, which will frequently be few in number and lacking in vitality. On the other hand, the sow in poor condition cannot do justice to her pigs or herself. A sow may be in fairly high condition and still produce good litters if she gets plenty of exercise. During the period of gestation do not feed too much corn. Corn produces fat. Muscle and bone-building constituents are needed at this time rather than fat. Corn may be fed but with a liberal amount of good judgment in the ration. Corn should never, at such a time rpmprise more than one-third of the ration. Remember that the one </seg>
            <seg id="p223">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 211 antidote for heavy corn feeding is abundant exercise, and that a good pasture provides the best feed to be had. Constipation is the bane of the swine breeder and is to be avoided at all costs. If the sow becomes constipated before she farrows there is danger that she will lose, not only her litter, but her own life. Once the sow becomes constipated, I know of nothing that can overcome it and save the pigs. It must, therefore, be prevented. If a sow is taken direct from the pasture and shut up in a pen where she is fed a heavy meal ration the chances are all in favor of her becoming constipated. She should be taken from one ration to another by a series of gradual changes. After being taken into the pen her feed had best be more sloppy, perhaps, than before. Some linseed meal added to the ration will help prevent constipation. While the sow is still on pasture the feeding of meal had best be started so that they may become accustomed to the feeding of meal necessary during the farrowing period. Farrowing dates are now regulated by an almost universal rule making the dates for spring pigs March first and for fall pigs September first. A record book should be kept which will show the date of service of each sow so that the date of farrowing may be known and prepara - tions made. This knowledge will save a good many litters. A week or two before farrowing the sow should be placed in the farrowing pen so that she may become accustomed to the surroundings and the change . conditions. I have already mentioned the importance of exercise tc the health of both the sow and boar. Let me say right here that exe cise during the period of gestation is the equivalent of an insurance policy on the litter. Little trouble, in this respect, is usually had with the gilts as they are more active than the old sows which must usually be forced to take exercise. They should be fed by scattering their feed over considerable area and by turning them into a field where they must rustle for part of their feed. A hog-tight field of corn stalks, in good fall and winter weather, and an alfalfa patch, in the spring, are the best possible means of providing sows with a sufficient amount of exercise. The kind of farrowing house used is one of the lesser questions. This should be noted, however, that if sows are allowed to farrow with - out hogs about there should be plenty of ventilation and fresh air. The air of an illy ventilated hog house is poisonous to little pigs. Good results may be had with small, single, portable pens which are boarded up and a thatched roof built over with a ventilator to insure a good circulation of air. On cold days a lighted lantern may be hung inside to take the chill and dampness out of the air. During the first twenty-four hours after farrowing the sow should be given no grain. She should, however, be given plenty of water. After the first day she should be given light feed, increasing it grad - ually until normal. Do not force her to eat Do not disturb her should she lay quietly for ten or twelve hours. At first feed thin slops. Should she lose appetite try feeding new milk.

If this does not remedy conditions, feed the sow a slop of scorched shorts and milk. 1 have never known this simple remedy to fail in getting results. Above all, do not allow the troughs to become sour from accumulated feeds. More disease comes from thir practice. 1 believe, than from any other cause. One shoulld be on hand when the sow farrows to see that everything goes well. Unless the sow is having difficulty in the farrowing it i better not interfere. Sows that have been correctly cared for will have no difficuty in their farrowing. If the pigs are weak or the sow restless, it will be best to take them away and keep them in a warm basket until all are born. The pigs should be placed at the so&gt;v teats as soon as possible, in some cases before all are born. An aj&gt; - parently lifeless pig can often be revived by blowing in its mouth or im - mersing in warm water and rubbed dry when removed. Thrifty, growing pigs will, at the end of three weeks, try to eat short slop with the mother. A separate pen should then be provided which will allow the pigs access to the sow, but prevent her from gci - ting to their trough. The trough for the pigs should be shallow. Wit i a high trough the young pigs, climbing and tumbling over each other, are in danger of hernia. Sunlight and exercise are two essentials in the welfare and growl. of young pigs. Scare them out of their beds; they enjoy scampering about. Let them grow fat and get but little exercise and you may be - sure that you will shortly lose several from thumps. Young pigs re - quire dry, clean, disinfected beds. If possible, change the beds every day or two and disinfect with a spray dip at least once a week. Ii the weather is cold, air slacked lime or dry dip may be used instea ! of a spray. Other things to look out for are sore mouths, sore eyec. stub tails, pig measles and lice. Pigs which have had proper care should be ready to wean in eight or ten weeks. They had best be separated into lots of fifteen or twenty. This affords a better means of observing and caring for the individual pigs. Prom the time weaned the pigs should be crowded in their growth. At six months, If in good growing condition, they should tip the scales at from one hundred seventy-five to two hundred pounds. They should weigh two hundred and twenty-five pounds or better before you be - gin fitting them for the market. I have found no better feed for young hogs than a rich slop composed of two parts bran, four parts shorts, four parts fine corn slop and one part meat meal or tankage. They should occasionally have a feed of corn without the above mentioned feed. If possible they should be allowed to run at all times on a good alfalfa pasture. Do not forget that wood ashes and charcoal are dis - ease preventers. Watch for worms. They are one of the hog's worst enemies. Above all, mix brains with your hog feed.

            <seg id="p225">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 213 to cover such a broad field exhaustively. My purpose has been, rather, to mention just a few of the things that my observation hits shown me are largely overlooked by the average farmer, and which are essential to the success of the industry. True, many farmers are violating many of the established principles of the business and still make money. How much more would they make, though, if they devoted a little more effort and a little more common sense to the enterprise? So far, gentlemen. I have, in a rambling and superficial way, treated of hog raising in general. My purpose in coming here, however, was rather to discuss the fitting of hogs t'or show purposes. This fact is ob - vious though, that sounder methods in hog raising are practically all that need be advocated to encourage the showing of the finer stock. That is, essentially, the real purpose of the showing of hogs — the develop ment of the industry. To properly fit a hog for show purposes one must use sound methods of raising. The use of the same methods in raising the market stuff will result in better market prices. There is a grow - ing tendency to discriminate, on the market, between the types of hogs as well as between degrees of finish. Today, one can "gel by" — make money — on hogs off type, but not with the ease c? yes - terday. The age of tomorrow will demand that the market hog be true to type and finish and the scrub will be a losing proposition. We have every reason to believe that such conditions will be true. It is practically as essential to give the market hog attention, time and thought as it is the show hog. Thus it is that in discussing the propo - sition of sounder hog raising in general I am arguing in behalf of the show business which I represent. The largest factor in making a success of the show business lies in selecting the animals for the herd. There is an art in judging youag pigs. Before they have grown much, little difference can be seen in the litter by the average observer yet each pig represents a different possibility. The animals to be selected should be chosen with the ut - most care and consideration for all of the details that go to place one animal above another when they meet in the show ring. It is best to develop two herds at a time. The business is beset by reverses and disappointments. Hogs may not develop properly or may become sick or die. The only insurance against such possibilities is to fit a dou - ble herd. Complete herd records are of prime importance. As has been men - tioned, the farrowing time of the sows should be on record so that the pigs may not be lost by reason of lack of preparation. There should be a system of marking the hogs by litters, which marking should be done within a day or two after the pigs are born. Only by so doing, is the danger of mixing litters altogether eliminated and I have found that the marks are plainer when the pigs mature. A record of the feeds used should be kept and comparisons continually made. The hogs shouic be named and one should become familiar with the appearance and char - acteristics of each hog in the herd. By knowing them individually one will be able to give each hog better attention and know at the earliest </seg>
            <seg id="p226">214 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATK BOARD OF AGRICIILTtRE moment if there is any variation from the best possible condition. Not an individual should be able to miss a BC*J without him knowing it. Do not bunch the show herd with the market herd and do not try to fit young pigs and aged hogs together. Neither can be done with the best success. In the first place, hogs being fitted for show purposes cannot receive individual care and attention when included in a large herd. Care and attention they must have if they are to pull down any blue ribbons. In the next place, should a prospective buyer look over your herd he will invariably pick out your show hogs — the very ones, in all probability, that you do not wish him to see. After seeing them he is dissatisfied with the others. If young pigs are fitted with the aged hogs the former will suffer by being crowded out of their feed. Males had best be isolated from the sows during the fitting period. Keeping the show herd cool during the summer months is a prob - lem. If you are fortunate enough to have plenty of natural shade the problem is partially solved. Cement wallows are the best alternative, but one should remember to keep the wallow clean as possible and to use dips and oils liberally. During the hot, dry summers, if you desire to do justice by your show herd, forget the picnics and fishing trips unless you can leave a competent man in charge. The successful show man does not hesitate at the expenditure of time, strength and money. Once on exhibition, attend to the feeding and watering of the herd exactly as has been the custom at home. Any decided change will be reflected in the hogs condition in a comparatively short time. Watch the herd all the time and do not let spectators drive the hogs to their feet that they may be viewed, particularly the larger and heavier ones. Attend to this yourself. Familiarize yourself wilth the show ring program and have suffi - cient help to get your animals to the show ring promptly at the time asked for. Watch the hogs closely for they may become frightened amid the confusion and changed surroundings. Above all do not allow yourself to become more excited than the hogs. Watch the judge and make sure that he has a good view of the hogs from all angles. As regards all other considerations, as I have already suggested, use lib - eral applications of common sense. The hog raiser who would succeed with a show herd must have a natural ability along these lines. Further, he must have considerable sales ability and be a good entertainer — in short, be a good "mixer." The best advice that could be offered the beginner is to exhibit at the local or county fairs until he becomes familiar with the requirements of the show ring and better fits himself to compete against the old experi - enced show man and breeder. After that, the state fair is the place to get before the public. It is at the state fair that the standards of breeds are determined, that values of pure-bred hogs are largely set and that one becomes personally acquainted with other breeders and exhibitors. All of these considerations are big factors in the success of any breeder and the industry as a whole. From the standpoint of premium money alone, the fitting of a </seg>

A prize ribbon, however, in the hands of a man with business ability is an advertisement that will pay him such dividends as he cannot find elsewhere. It is an advertise - ment for the individual, his community and his state. Fitting a show herd requires some experience, much time and a great deal of effort, but it affords the hog breeder the handsomest profits to be enjoyed in the business today." </seg>

During the years 1917. and 1918, 3,216 samples of seed were voluntarily sent to the Seed Laboratory for test. These samples required approximately seven thousand tests as most of them were tested both for purity and germination. There were also 671 official seed inspection samples collected during this time and these were also tested for purity and germination. The number of samples received during 1918 represents an in - crease of 76 per cent over those of the previous year. Thi9 increase Is due to several facts: First: The Pure Seed Law passed by the legislature in 1917 called the attention of the farmers to the necessity of cleaner seed and made it possible for the residents of the state to have samples of seed tested free of charge. Second: The administration has shown a desire to co-operate with the farmers in making the new law as effective as the legislature in - tended it should be. It has given publicity to the fact that seed would be tested free of charge and has installed a better equipped laboratory for carrying on the work. Third: Every effort has been made to co-operate with the County Agents and the Council of Defense in aiding agriculturists to obtain viable crop seeds and keep their crops and fields free from weed seeds. Four: To a constantly increasing demand everywhere for a higher grade of agricultural seeds. In 1914 the Seed Laboratory was established in order that farmers and seed dealers might be able to obtain better grades of seeds. When samples are sent in they are tested and report made as to their purity and germination. These tests have undoubtedly greatly aided farmers and other buyers of seed. The examination of various samples of seed from different parts of the state are also of value to the Seed Laboratory in that they give Information regarding the condition of seed grown In various localities. For instance, the alfalfa of the 1918 crop in certain sections of the state shows an alarming condition with regard to Dodder infestation. Seed from these fields will be given special attention. The following is a copy of a report illustrating the method used in informing the farmer or seed dealer of the condition of the seeds which he sends in for testing: John Doe, Scottsbluff. Nebr.

Among many kinds of leguminous seeds, such as red clover and alfalfa, some seeds remain hard at the end of the time usually allowed for a germination test. These so-called "hard seeds" have unusually hard coats, preventing them from taking up water readily. While some of these hard seeds will remain in water or in the ground for a long time without germination, they are practically all good seeds, grow - ing quickly at any time if the seed coat is scratched or broken or has become sufficiently softened so the seed can take up water. The presence of a large percentage of hard seeds is of considerable practical importance, as a good stand may not be obtained on account of their delayed germination. The number of germination tests during the past year shows an ex - ceedingly large increase over previous years.

While our present seed law has made it possible for the Seed Labo - ratory to assist agricultural work in many ways, due to the free seed testing service for residents of the state, it also has features that should be changed in order to make it still more effective. It is a well known fact that moisture and various other weather conditions cause rapid deterioration ;rn the germinating quality of seeds. Age also has its effect on viability. This is especially true with oats, corn, wheat, millet, cane and timothy. Some seed, such as clover and alfalfa often contain seed having very hard impervious coats, called "Hard Seeds', which do not take up moisture readily and may not show a lower per cent of germination the second or third years than the first. As a study of the hard seed shown in the sum - mary of seed tested during 1917 demonstrates that the average of hard seed ranges from 8% in red clover to 26% in sweet clover. Alfalfa averages 18%. It is undoutedly true that some seeds lose their vitality, but it is probable that some of the "Hard Seed" coats become more per - vious with age so that when placed in proper conditions will respond and grow. But such seed also after the third year show marked de - terioration due to age. The present seed law does not provide that any date shall be given regarding when the germination test was made. For instance, a pur - chaser might obtain seed labeled "Standard" which in the case of red clover would mean that its purity was 92% or above and germination 80% or more. This seed might have been "Standard" some time in the past, but if any appreciable length of time has lapsed, through vari - ous changes in storing and weather conditions, this seed would prob - ably not be seed that the purchaser would wish. A statement of the date of the germination test with the percent of germinable seed would give the purchaser a basis on which to value the seed. In one instance the State Seed Inspector discovered a lot of red clover seed labeled "Standard" which upon examination proved to have only 16% of germinable seed, and when reported to the dealer he protested that he had a report on the seed from the government laboratory. Upon investigation this proved to be a report on a test made five years previous. A report on a germination test without the date given is of little practical value. The seed corn of the 1917 crop was damaged by a freeze which left it soft, with poor germinating qualities. Tests made on this corn in January and February were found to be of comparative little value in April as there was an average of 10 to 20 per cent deterioration in this corn during the two intervening months. The corn of 1917 was exceptional, however, for germs in grain do not ordinarily lose vitality so rapidly. </seg>
            <seg id="p232">220 PROCEEDINGS XKBKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Nebraska Seed Law states that every package of agricultural seeds containing ten pounds or more shall have affixed thereto in a con - spicuous place outside thereof, a distinctly printed or written statement certifying (1) the name of seed; (2) full name and address of the seeds - man, importer, dealer or agent; (3) whether the seed is "Standard" or "Below Standard" as defined in Section 12 of this Act. Section 12 is a table of various agricultural seed giving the standard of each in purity and germination. In fact the word "standard" to the ordinary buyer stands for very little. Probably he does not know that "Standard" refers to a certain percent purity and a certain percent ger - mination. If he does, he possibly is unaware what percents have been considered to be sufficiently high to permit of the term "Standard" on the label so that if he is planning on planting cane seed, the "Standard" of germination being given at 75%. he does not know whether the seed is just 75% or 95%. Therefore it is impossible for him to figure accu - rately how much more seed he must obtain in order to secure the de - sired stand. The American Seed Trade Association, at their meetings during the past two years have agreed voluntarily to give their customers the following information regarding seeds, by labeling all lots of seeds of ten pounds or over: (1) name of seedsman; (2) kind of seed; (3) percent - age of purity, percentage of germinable seed, with month and year of the germination test; (5) country and locality or origin in the case of the following imported seeds: beans, soy beans, Turkestan alfalfa and red clover from southern Europe and Chile. This information is of ut - most importance to the progressive farmer who is conscientiously at - tempting efficient food production. The action of the American Seed Trade Association should be highly commended for they voluntarily offered information which the citizens of our state are not yet demanding, as is shown by the present seed law. It would seem that an ideal seed law would be one which would compel all seedsmen to fall in line and give the same information which the American Seed Trade Association has voluntarily agreed to give to purchasers. Our Seed Law also has other minor faults, such as covering only two of the varieties of millet while there are others as commonly used in Nebraska; not sufficiently covering the labeling of mixtures of seeds; and failing to give the purchaser the information that he is purchasing "not cleaned seed," if that be the case. Before the war the United States imported large quantities of seeds in order to meet the demand. Economic conditions have made importa - tion impossible and it is the task of the Nebraska farmers to arise to the situation of assisting to make up the shortage as well as to make seed raising an industry in the United States which will need very little, if any, assistance outside of America. It is therefore the duty of every farmer to urge that the proper seed laws be passed and en - forced to save useless labor on farms, as must be the case if poor stands are due to unviable seeds. Also to save the cost of such seeds </seg>

Every conscientious agriculturist who is doing his utmost to aid In alleviating the suffering and hunger of the world by efficient food pro - duction should certainly demand that every possible support be given him in the way of securing good seed, in order that he may lessen the sufferings of his fellowmen.

            <seg id="p234">222 PKOCKKD1NGS NKHKASKA BTATK HOARD OF AGRICULTURE BLUE SKY VS. SQUARE DEALING IN LAND AND OIL BUSINESS By G. E. CONDRA, Director, Nebraska Conservation and Soil Survey This is a state welfare paper based on our experience in administer - ing the provisions of the Blue Sky Law relating to the sale of foreign realty in Nebraska. It should be of interest to the investing public and particularly to investors in land and oil properties. The purposes of the paper are to: (1) Review the provisions of the Blue Sky Law of Nebraska. (2) Show the methods used by promoters of unsound projects. (S) Point out the effects of bad investments in land deals. (4) Warn against dealing with persons who evade the law or mis- lead the public. (5) Review the elements of good business and safe investments in land and oil propositions. (6) Assist la conserving the state welfare. Blue Sky v*. Business. The principles of conservation are permeat - ing every branch of industry to improve processes, increase efficiency and promote square dealing. A byproduct is the conservation of legitimate business against fraud. Business proper stands for honesty, reliability, and permanence, whereas sharp practice, double dealing and doubtful promotion are ele - ments of fraud which do not conserve the general welfare. The terms "promoter" and "promotion" vary in meaning depending upon the purpose. Good and bad deals are promoted. Too often this activity is directed towards unsafe projects in which the organizers and those on the ground floor have too much advantage over the investors. This causes most people to look upon promotion enterprises with more or less suspicion and to place them about midway between business and blue sky. The term "Blue Sky" has significant meaning and wide usage. It de - notes nothing for something, error for truth, and fraud for business. Any proposition or transaction embodying one or more of these unfavorable elements is a Blue Sky deal— a deal without true merit. Blue Sky Laws. There are many state and federal laws for the con - servation of business. The federal government prosecutes persons who make fraudulent use of the mail. It is possible for one to recover under the law on account of misrepresentation and fraund. Federal laws re - cently enacted as a war measure require a proper showing before permits are given for the sale and issue of stock in excess of $100,000. Several </seg>
            <seg id="p235">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OK AGRICULTURE 223 states have enacted laws to regulate business and to prevent fraud. Some of the statutes are defective in that they stress the regulation of legiti - mate enterprises more than they prevent the operation of fraudulent en - terprises. Several states have created departments and agencies to prevent the operation of blue sky projects relating to land, minerals, oil, and stocks. These departments investigate projects and censure them through infor - mation requested by citizens and by publicity. Some states go further than this by registering the dealers and issuing permits to sell approved projects. Administration of Blue Sky Law in Nebraska. Our state took the lead in opposing Blue Sky methods. The director of the Survey discussed this subject before National Conservation Congresses in Washington. Seattle and St. Paul before the well known act of Kansas was passed. Senator John Cordeal was the author of the Nebraska bill which has done so much to eliminate fraud from the state. The State Conservation and Soil Survey has the duty of passing upon foreign lands sold in the state. This work covers the agricultural, graz - ing, mineral, and oil lands. The department serves also as a land infor - mation bureau. The State Railway Commission acts upon all stock companies for which it is necessary to secure permits to operate in the state. When the stocks are based on land, the Conservation and Soil Survey is supposed to make the field investigation for the Railway Commission for final action. The administration of the blue sky work relating to land is not complicated compared with stocks and the work of the Railway Com - mission. The State Conservation and Soil Survey is equipped with special maps, atlases, reports of state and federal soil surveys, weather bureau data, and other publications. It is in close touch with state and federal departments and receives valuable information from soil experts and ge - ologists engaged in practical work. In passing upon a land deal, the department consults reliable sources of information bearing upon the case. Data are assembled and compared with the statements made by the dealer seeking to sell in Nebraska. If it is found that the project is bad, the promoters are directed to keep out of the state. If there la doubt, a field examination is made by some member of the department. This is done at state expense. Thus far in passing upon foreign projects, much of Wyoming, Kansas, and Oklahoma and parts of Montana, Colo - rado, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida have been cov - ered. Little time is given to the investigation of valuable agricultural lands. Nor does the department interfere with the work of reliable real estate men. Most attention is directed towards blue sky deals. Three things stand out in the investigations made by the State Con - servation and Soil Survey. First, inquiry is made of banks regarding </seg>
            <seg id="p236">224 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the credit and reliability of dealers. Second, the representations made In securing sale are scrutinized to see whether they tally with the facts shown by the investigations. Third, it is determined whether a good title is conveyed. As a rule, blue sky projects do not show up well under these investigations. Most of them fail on account of misrepresentation and are denied the privilege of operating in Nebraska. It should be more generally understood that some land, oil, and stock deals though permitted do not offer good investments. Though correctly represented they may be risky. Censorship by the state is made pri - marily to reduce promotion and to eliminate the work of unscrupulous operators. It does not guarantee projects because there are otber ele - ments of success and failure which the state departments do not and should not attempt to control. Dodging the Law. The land part of the blue sky work in Nebraska is principally a delegated service to be extended upon requests coming from citizens. The department takes the initiative in many cases, bui according to the law, an investigation is supposed to start with an in - quiring interested party in the state, i. e., with one who is thinking of buy - ing land. Some dealers coach the would-be investors not to consult the Conservation and Soil Survey, claiming that the department is conser - vative and biased against foreign land deals. The Railway Commission has a difficult work in passing upon stocks. Various methods are used to evade this commission, and some citicens are harsh in their criticism of Its administration. The safe thing for dealers to do, however, is to comply with the law. If the law is defective, it should be amended. If unjust, it should be repealed. The law has been evaded as follows: (1) Many old charters have been revived in order to evade the law regulating the issue and sale of stock. (2) Some parties have attempted to under- write stock jobbing propo - sitions, making it appear that they were selling private property. This procedure has not worked well for there are other statutes which cover such cases. (3) Many citizens have gone into other states to buy into blue sky projects, the sale of which is not permitted In Nebraska. (4) Promoters and blue sky concerns advertise in papers published In other states. The state law does not cover these cases. (5) The legal status of stocks sold in Nebraska without permit has not been fully determined in the courts. No doubt the dealers are vio - lators of the law and the investors may be committing an offense. Soil, a Basic Resource. Soil is the world's greatest natural resource. It is the primary source of life and industry and must be conserved in Soil Survey, in co-operation with the U. S. Bureau of Soils, is mapping </seg>

Everything mutt be done to maintain the productive capacity of the soil and nothing should be done to decrease its power to produce. Drain from Home and State. Nebraska Is fertile; the soils produce food of great value. Most of the returns from the sotl and agriculture go to the development of farms, communities, the state and nation, but too much of it is dissapated through promotion and blue sky projects both in the state and outside the state. It is not right to farm the land, cash-in- soil fertility, and waste the proceeds. There is room for real conservation. Though our state lisa checked much of the drain caused by bad management and blue sky oper - ators, there is room for further improvement in this line. The citizen* generally should assist in solving the problem. Many farmers, though remaining on the home places, lose enough, in bad deals to improve homes or to put their sons and daughter* through the high school and agricultural college. The drain is away from home and schoo', and persons losing through bad investments at Ions range become suspicious and critical of real business directed by reliable men in the community. Some are put out of buiness by fraud. The blue sky deals have taken millions of dollars from the state and returned only dollars and cents. They have taken away many well-to-do citizens and returned paupers. Nature of the Realty Business. The land business is based on thing* fundamental. It relates to soil, production, distribution, and the people. Good service in this line is helpful and far reaching, but bad guidance is costly and destructive. The transfer of land has little consequence compared with the farmers and their families when they are taken from successful agriculture to impoverished land and unhealthful places where failure is inevitable. Persons having no regard for the welfare of people and the country should not be permitted to engage in the land business because they do much harm if not restrained. Reputable realty men render a useful and necessary service. They are in business— not fraud, and are in hearty accord with the welfare measures bo generally opposed by blue sky dealers. The realty business is on the advance. The dealers have organized in some places to suppress fraudulent operators and it would seem that the legls'ature should enact laws to conserve the interests of the dealers, Investors, and the public. One of the first necessary steps in this line will be a qualification requirement of dealers. A second step would be the registration of dealers in foreign realty or that a showing be made con - cerning the land or project before it is offered for sale in the state. </seg>

Some grazing and and small areas of dry farming land remain in public ownership. Agriculture has been standardized in many places and the farmers have technical knowledge of the soils on their holdings and there is a growing tendency for families to stick with home places. The overflow of young peopde frcm the farm and in search of lands presents a big problem. Good land is all taken and held at a comparatively high price. There is opportunity to locate and bui d up ranches. bi&lt;t things have changed regarding the homesteadin? of farm land. Irrigation and drain - age add small tracts each year, but not enough to m?et the normal de - mand. Our country is entering upon a period cf intensive farming, more permanence of families on farms, and an increasing density of rural popu - lation. The permanent, successful farmer is a valuable rsset- Anything that tends to keep him on a farm for a longer period is a move in the right direction, and anything that discourages him regarding his condi - tion and success and causes him to move from the home place is working in the wrong direction as a rule. Mcneirents which assist renters to become owners of land and per - manent tillers of the soil are constructive and helpfu . Agents who induce successful farmers to sell out and to n.ove to new places where they cannot succeed do a criminal thing. We know of many persons who sold valuable farms in Nebraska and failed elsewhere. The damege done these unfortunate people is irreparable. There is no way to recover from the irresponsible persons who committed the fraud. Some states have boomed the land buines regardless of resu'ts. In much of this, more has been heard abcut increasing the population and of the success of land men than about the welfare of those who build homes on the land. Time has shown the error of such methods. The talk now relates to the welfare of farmers who live on the land, make it pro - duce, and become gocd citizens. Any community or state not looking more to the welfare of its farmers than to the successful grafters is working absolutely in the wrong direction. Blue Sky Methods. We recite under this heading a bird's-eye view of history enacted a few years ago. It has no particular bearing ai this time, but may cover an occasiona' deal reverting to old methods. Blue sky deals are interesting. A tract cf inferior land, a mineral claim, or an undesirable oil lease is secured, probably by contract. The matter of title is not very imporant. The selling scheme !s perfected. Agents and decoys are secured. Extravagant claims are made rezardins the project. The influence of nationality, church, and fraternal order are used in selling. Decoys get a rake-off for their names and influence. In - terests or stocks are offered at a price greatly advanced over co*t. Re- </seg>

Persons fi led with a greed for money and a desire to get-rich-quick be - come easy marks. The clean-up continues and no investor checks either the project or the promoter. This kind of thing was common in Nebraska before blue sky laws were enacted. Over-valuation is a feature of blue sky deals. Not long since a pros - pectus was received from Oklahoma advertising mineral land at $6.00 i&gt; block. There were 1,089 blocks in a tract of ten acres. If sold, this would clean up $6,534. The writer is acquainted with the region In quetion and knows that large tracts of land can be purchased there for less. than $10.00 an acre, so the ten-acre tract should nc have a value to exceed $100.00. The difference between $100.00 and $6,534 rep - resents over-valuation and promotion. The land was claimed to have girat value and possibilities for the production and zinc and lead. The promoters used a statement of a geologist, showing that the forms i Km carrying lead and zinc in the Joplin district, some thirty miles away, ex - lends through the promoted land. Technically, this had no value what - soever, yet it was used to sell the project. Nebraska told the promoters to keep out and It is our opinion that Oklahoma should not have per - mitted such fraud. We have numerous statements from the citizens of Texas and Florida claiming that dealers in the north have promoted the south in numerous land deals. Two things stand rfut prominently in this connection, namely, that very little has been done by the southern states to prevent land frauds and that the north has permitted the grafters to do their work. Dry Land Realty. There are considerable areas of dry land well suited for agriculture in such states as Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska Kansas, and Oklahoma. Some areas in these states have soils on wh'ch the sod should not be turned. Unserupu ous dealers do not distinguish between the qualities of soil making it suitable and unsuitable for culti - vation. Some of them go too far in representing all land as being suit - able for successful agriculture. Buyers should examine the soil to see that it is drouth resistant. Four things are to be determined. First, the soil should be deep, fine tex - tured, and fertile. Second, it hould not be under ain near the urface by sand and gravel. Third, it should not be so loose and light as to blow when plowed. Fourth, the best land for dry farming has a relatively heavy layer in the subsoil at a depth of two to six feet below the surface. This prevents the percolation of water beyond the reach of crops and serves to store and hold the rainfall. There may be drouthy soils under heavy rainfa'l. This means that the amount of rainfall is not the only factor in dry farming. Nebraska is trying to determine what land should be plowed and what should be retained in the native sod. The State Conservation and Soil Survey, in co-operation with the U. S. Bureau of Soils, is mapping </seg>
            <seg id="p241">228 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and describing the soils of all western counties. The work is being rufhed at this time because much of the land should come under culti vation particularly for wheat raising. The published reports of tbe counties completed show the soil types and what is thought to be their best use and management. Such reports are of value to fanners, buytrs, and dealers. Much of western Nebraska is now cultivated to wheat, oats, rye, corn, alfalfa, and potatoes. Land values have shown a rapid advance the past few years. Tractors and combines are common and some of the best land where the rainfall is low sells above $100 per acre. The tend - ency now is to buy in other areas. Some dealers, formerly of Nebraska, are operating in Colorado and other states. Some of the areas being sold are quite well suited for dry farming, but not so completely as on pans of Cheyenne and Box Butte tables of Nebraska where good crops have been grown for several years. Heavy rainfall in the west and drouth in the east the past ye;-r n&gt;ay cause farmers in the eastern counties to sell at relatively low prices and to piy high prices for dry land soils better suited for grazing than (arm - ing. This should be safeguarded. Some realty denltrs have used misinformation regarding the dry lands. They have taken advantage of the most favorable years to tell the lese desirable land. Among the points observed in this connect on are: (1) The claim that the rainfall increases on dry lands as the country is brought under cultivation, thus improving the condition. This claim Is not well founded. It is true, however, that cultivation does change the climate of the soil. (2) Advantage is taken of such fluctuations of rainfall as occur from year to year or by periods of years. Land is boomed at times of heaviest rainfall. A good many Nebraskans file upon grazing land in such states as Wyoming, Co'orado. and Montana, thinking that it is farm land. Some of them pay locaters $100 per for assistance which might be extended by the government and probably with better results. Only those who know cattle raising or sheep raising and are in a position to block out ranches can succeed in this project. Land Schemes in General. There are many land projects. Invest - ments have been made by Nebraskans in the small tract propositions of Texas, Florida, and other states. Some of this land has value, but much of it Is over-estimated and most investments have shown a loss. The cut-over lands particularly of Louisiana, Michigan, and Texas though promoted from time to time, have not been a profitable Invest - ment for most Nebraskans. The department has several cases in whi-.h our people lost heavily. </seg>

They show the land classification, drainage conditions, soils, agricultural developments, crops, land values, markets, and social conditions.

These are free upon request fron&lt; the U. S. Hureau of Soils. Washington. Thinp* to Consider in Buying Land. A person thinking of buying land as an investment or to establish a home should consider the follow - ing point&lt; with reference to the land in question: (1 ) See and study the land. Be sure to see the right piece of land. Get infoimation about tho place from disinterested farmers living in the region. Find out why it is for sale. (2) Study the soil. Use a spade or an auger with which to de - termine the depth and the texture of the soil. See whether the soil is deep or shallow, light or heavy, fertile or impoverished. Does it re - quire fertilizers to grow crops? What crops are profitably grown? (3) Water supply. Make sure that there is an adequate supply of water for home and stock. In case of irrigation, see that there is a good water right. (4) Consult the Weather Bureau and its reports. Determine the facts about rainfall, temperature, winds, storms, and seasons. If these e'ements are unfavorable, do not buy the land for agricultural purposes. (5) Drainage and Topography. See that the land tallies with de - scriptions made by the dealer. Is it subject to overflow? Does it have too little or too much drainage? Does it wash badly? Is it too hilly for farming? (Again be sure that you see the right land.) (6) Health fulness. This relates particularly to climatic conditions and water supply. One should hesitate to buy in a community where pro - visions for sanitation are neglected. (7) Soda' Conditions. How about the people — their nationality schools, and churches? </seg>
            <seg id="p243">230 I'klHKKlPIXliS NKHHASKA S.TATE IIOAUII (IP A&lt;JKItTl.TlHK (8) Markets and Transportation. Though the auto and the truck have brought the town and country close together, the buyer should keep in mind the tact that land values are determined in part by location with respect to railroads and markets. (9) Interest Rates and Taxes. Some states have high interest and heavy taxes. These are influences to be considered. . (10) Price and Terms. The buyer should not be in a hurry to close a deal. It may not be a bargain. Deal only with known, reputable realty men. Secure a good buy or keep out. Buy land for a specific purpose and see that it is suited for that purpcse. Neither overload nor assume an incumbrance that is too heavy. (11) Make sure that a good title is secured and not a lawsuit. Have the title passed upon by a competent abstractor. Hod out most of the payment until the abstract is approved. Use the bank in clos ng the deal. (12) Remember that one can scatter his land interests too much and that it is better to invest at close range than by long distance. ASPECTS OF THE OIL INDUSTRY The United States is richly endowed with petroleum and natural gas occurring in a number of states. The oil industry is specialized. It relates to prospecting, production of crude, pipe line transportation, re - fining, and a number of by-products. The refined products serves many purposes in transportation, manufacture, agriculture, and war. The oil industry is largely owned and operated by a few companies, some of them subsidiaries of the Standard Oi Company. These interests are well organized. They employ technical assistance in all depart - ments, beginning with the geological field work and extending to the marketing and use of products. Though Nebraska is not an oil producing state, its citizens are heavy investors in companies prospecting for oil, and in refineries. The Lure of Oil. Since oil was discovered in Pennsylvania, the in - dustry has been noted for its hazardous risks, dismal failures, and great successes. Failure has come to many and success to few. Notwithstand - ing this fact, hope is ever strong, and most persons dabbling in oi! ex - pect to "get rich quick." The success of Rockefeller is recited in moat announcements of promotion companies. This is pleasing to those who like a risky project. To assist in the discovery of oil is the great ambi - tion of many people. Oil Promotion Schemet. Various schemes are used to interest the people in wildcatting, either at home or in other states. Many of the projects are organized and directed by promoters with no experience in oil prospecting. </seg>
            <seg id="p244">PROCEEDING*) NKKUA8KA BTATB l'.oAKH OF AlJlilCII.TI'KK 231 Most promotion deals are started without regard for the technical details considered by oil companies. Some would-be oil man takfs a fancy to the general appearance of the country or to some unessential feature of the land, and asserts that there is a strong indication for oil, perhaps at a shallow depth. He is at once a big man for everyone hopes to find oil. It may bs that the newcomer has been in an oil re - gion some time or some where. This makes him an authority and noth - ing more is needed. So a boom is started; a company is organized, and funds are raised for a test. The motives of the people who take part in this kind of thing in a community are commendable, but the methods are bad. Some projects are organized wholly for a clean-up. A lease is se - cured near a well defined structure at the edge of an oil field. Dry holes are disregarded. Certain people are invited to take part in organizing a stock jobbing proposition. A prospectus is prepared and agents are sent forth to sell to unsuspecting persons. Soon a wildcat test is started. False reports are made from time to time to show that oil sands are reached and a big flow — always a gusher — may be reported within a few days. As a rule, such tests are off structure and condemned by experi - enced oil men. Those on good locations speak ightly of the stock job - bers saying that they are selling to suckers who do not know the oil game. Much money has gone from Nebraska to be squandered on bafl deals of this kind. Structure a Guide. The University of Nebraska has trained a num - ber of corroetent geologists now in the employment of oil companies. These men t-ive studied the stratigraphy of several oil regions. Person* similarly trained in other universities are also engaged in this work and every oil company of any consequence has its corps of oil geologists. In the structure work relating to prospecting for oil and gas and the development, particular attention is given to the position of the outcrops in the region and to the age of formations. The geology is worked close - ly. Each member or bed is studied and mapped. Sections are made and the whole structure is described. The geologist looks for the formations known to contain oil. He wants to find places where the strata bend upward, from all directions, forming what are known as domes and anti - clines, for these are where most oil is found. The result of the geologi - cal work are kept secret by the oil companies, because the structure shows where leasing should b done. A position of the strata favoring the accumulation of oil and gas, whether a dome, anticline, or terrace, is called an oil structure (Figures 1 and 2). Well denned structures have value for leasing and drilling, whereas locations off structure, even though it be for a short distance, are regarded as valueless. The geology Is tne first consideration In prospecting. A geological report made by a competent person is taken at its value and followed closely, whereas a loose report made by some so-called geologist has no value and should not serve In making drilling locations or to Induce people to subscribe for oil stock. </seg>

Some of these leases were found to be described, and others, particularly those of Blue Sky companies, were at places having no chance for oil or gas. The loose geological report is misleading. In fact it may show where not to prospect. A fake geological report is un - reliable and fraudulent. Oil Faker*. The public has not only been misguided by well mean - ing oil promoters, stock jobbers, and fake geological reports, but it baa been worked to a finish by oil fakers, i. e., by men claiming to possess the ability to locate oil by means of some physical device. The oil faker has no particular knowledge of geology and of other things of value in prospecting yet he speaks glibly of structure, oil sands and domes. He selects a convenient location for his dome, usually near a town or if he has an anticline, it can pass through several towns to be promoted. The writer has observed the bad work of oil fakers in Nebraska and other states. Nearly all the domes of these fe'lows are on their heads and not in the ground. Most of the men are poor and irresponsible. They are ready to direct the prospecting for an interest in the stock and for a good place to eat and sleep. When a prospect fails, the faker loses nothing. He moves on and the community is wiser as a result of its ex - perience. The man who assumes to locate a sure thing in the discovery of oil by means of a divining rod or similar devise is a fraud. Oil is not found in this way. Let it be known that oil interests are ready and willing to pay big money for any reliab'e hint that will lead to oil discovery. The faker would be a valuable man in the oil industry if he could guarantee his claims even in part. He does not make good where there is oil or among oil men, and we believe that Nebraska has had enough of such fraud. Blue Sky and Promotion Oil Deals. We class under this head all propositions in which there is misrepresentation relating to structure^ depth of oil sands, the number of oil sands, and the returns from invest - ments. Many projects formerly sold in Nebraska were stock jobbing deals of the blue sky kind. Those now sold are good and bad. Though the state has laws to protect the investing public by preventing the sale of bad leases and bad oil stocks, there are those who do4ge the law and induce citizens to invest in unreliable propositions. Small Tract Projects. Much Nebraska money goes to small tract projects. These tracts are only a few square feet in area and should not be sold as separate units not related to the who'e project in the way of co-operative management. The management of many projects is bad and the dealers operate principally through paid advertisements run In pa - pers published in other states, but circulating in Nebraska. </seg>

Though it is not possible to defi - nitely determine that oil and gas or both of these may be found at a given place, it is possible to reduce the risk in prospecting and develop - ment and to safeguard the investor. This being true, it should be more generally recognized that the best methods to follow are those used by the practical oil man and the larger companies. Som* of the things to consider are as follows: (1) As a general investor you cannot afford, as a rule, to become interested in extreme wildcat propositions. Only the going concerns, re - ceiving money from production, can afford to engage in this work. (2) Do not invest in a lease or in the stock of a cmpany managed by strangers who control the majority of stock. (3) Do not invest in an over-capitalized project. (4) Make sure that wild-cat prospecting is done above formations known to carry oil and on good structure. (5) Determine the standing of the person making the geological re - port. A sure-thing report should be rejected. (6) If the lease is in an oil district or oil region, make inquiry re - garding dry holes, depth of drilling, thickness of sands, production and life of wells, pipe line runs and the refining qualities of the crude. (7) Deal only with men known to be honest and who are in a po - sition to make good their contracts. (8) Remember it is better to invest in oil projects near production, pipe lines and refineries than in a region located far from these de - velopments. (9) See that the agent selling oil stock has a permit from the Rail - way Commission and that the person selling oil land or an oil lease has made a good showing before the State Conservation and Soil Surrey. (10) Co-operate with the state departments in keeping fraudulent operators out of your community and out of Nebraska. (11) Stand for the square deal in business and for state develop - ment along fundamental lines. </seg>
