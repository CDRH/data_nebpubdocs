            <seg id="p004">4 PURPOSE OF THE LIVE STOCK SANITARY BOARD The Live Stock Sanitary Hoard is charged with the control and eradication of communicable diseases of live stock within the state, the supervision of shipments of animals into the state in order to prevent the introduction of disease, and the supervision of the inspection and testing of live stock shipped out of the state in accordance with the laws and regulations at the point of destination. Inspection and testing si live stock to be shipped out (if tin- state is done by practicing veterinarians who have been authorized by the Deputy State Veterinarian, and who are required to report all inspections tad testing of any kind whether they be coikIik ted on stock to be shipped out or are tr. conducted merely for private information for the ownei The Live Stock Sanitary Board is required fea ■ twice a year, and may meet a* many additional considered necessary. The Deputy State Veteriaarii Seer tary to the Board and is required to enforce the rules and reg - ulations as adopted by the Hoard for the welfare and improve - ment of the live stock industry of the state. The Deputy State Veterinarian is also rhargad with the duties of tarrying on a id supervising the stallion inspection work of the state which in - volves an amount of labor and responsibility of large proportions due to the large number of stallions and jacks to be inspected each year and the magnitude of the horse industry in the ittte of Nebraska. There are many towns and even whole counties that are without the services of a graduate veterinarian and from such localities calls are received frequently to come and investigate some outbreak of disease among stock. Whenever possible the Deputy State Veterinarian or his assistant respond immediately and attempt to locate the cause of the trouble by a personal investigation, but when this is impossible some graduate and licensed practitioner nearest to the place where disease is re- </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 ported is notified by wire or telephone to immediately investigate th trouble and make a complete report to the office of the Board. This is done, of course, at the state's expense. Shortage of help greatly hinders the activities of the Board and reduces the value of the regulations which are enacted for the good of the public, for laws and regulations are of no value unless they are judiciously enforced. Particularly is this true with regard to the importation of dairy and breeding cattle into the state. In spite of federal and state laws and regulations, with regard to the traffic in diseased animals, many tubercular cattle, mostly dairy tows from other states, find their way into Nebraska. There always have been and there always will be a certain number of men who will engage in this business of deal - ing in diseased cattle as long as it will prove profitable. It ia easy enough to prevent this, providing there are men employed for this purpose. There should be one veterinarian employed by the state regularly and stationed permanently at the stock yards at Smith Omaha. There are several kinds of work at the yards which are of vital importance to the state, that are beyond the jurisdiction of the federal inspectors and which should be looked after hy a state official. Another veterinarian should be reg - ularly employed to do sanitary police work over the state at large. Carloads of dairy tattle are often shipped in from cer - tain states in full compliance with the regulations, but knowing their source of origin and the reputation of some of the men connected with them, there is no doubt but what some of them are diseased, and this has often been proven by later tests. If the Board had someone to follow up these cattle and be present when they are sold at auction, one important source of spreading of tuberculosis in Nebraska would be eliminated. There are many dairy farms over the state which sell milk to creameries, institutions or private families, where the eows are often dis - eased, besides being kept under very filthy conditions, and such farms constitute a positive danger to public health and are a source of tuberculosis, septic sore throat, dysentery and many other diseases of the human family. Proper local milk ordi - nances are uncommon in Nebraska and in the majority of locali - ties where they have been passed, due to ignorance and politics </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 they are not properly enforced and have proven of no value. A state veterinary sanitary officer should have the power to enter any premises where dairy cows or hogs are kept, and if kept in a deplorable condition, be able to compel the owner to clean up, disinfect, test and do whateer necessary to protect the public from preventable diseases. The stock yards at Sioux City are also a prolific source of trouble. Hundreds of dairy cattle, many of which are of un - known or suspicious origin and in a questionable state of health, pass out of those yards and into Nebraska, without being prop - erly examined, but merely on a grazer's and feeder's permit. The federal inspector at these yards, like at all other yards, always have more work of their own than they can properly handle, therefore the state should employ a veterinarian who should spend at least part of his time here and be responsible for every animal that enters the state out of this public stock market. The traffic of live stock in the United States has assumed enormous proportions, and Nebraska, as a strictly agricultural State and one of the leading live stock producing and feeding states, is contributing its full share towards the industry. The features governing the movements of live stock are changing continually; diseases among animals have a tendency to increase with the increase in their numbers and exposure by traffic. Stockmen of Nebraska, whether breeders or feeders, have a rifrht to demand the fullest possible protection against the introduc - tion of disease. Methods of control which were satisfactory ten years ago are totally inadequate today and will be still more so five or ten years hence. The well-known saying, that "an ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure," is never so true as when applied to the fighting of disease. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">7 REQUIREMENTS OF THE DIFFERENT STATES COVERING THE IMPORTATION OF LIVE STOCK Every state in the union has enacted laws and regulations governing the importation of live stock within its borders. Such precautions are absolutely necessary in order to prevent the in - troduction and spread of infectious and contagious diseases. The regulations are modified from time to time, depending on the existence of outbreaks in certain states and localities; and also to meet changed conditions. The only function and reason for existence of such laws and regulations are to protect the breeder and stockman. Every one knows this, including the occasional individual who deals in tubercular cattle or other diseased animals, who finds these sanitary control measures a severe handicap to his business and who. when he has nothing else to do. writes communications to his favorite agricultural papers deploring the existence of such laws and blaming the veterinarians for their enactment. That the veterinary pro - fession is responsible for many of the precautions enacted to prevent the spread of animal diseases, and is also an effective hindrance to the man who has opportunities to make money by buying: and selling diseased animals, there is not the shadow of a doubt. No one will deny this: and for this reason one need not be surprised to find the existence of hard feelings on the part of a few ignorant and unscrupulous live stock traders towards every member of the veterinary calling regardless of his standing or his reputation. In making out a health certificate covering a physical exam - ination only, or in conducting a tuberculin or mallein test, the veterinarian is offered an opportunity to display good judgment. A few additional words of information are often of great value to the authorities of the state to which the animals are destined ; whose laws and regulations are always to be strictly complied with in issuing health charts of any kind. The value of any laws depend largely upon the intelligence and fairness of those who enforce them ; and the more complete the information given about the stock to be shipped the less chance is htere for any </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 inconvenience resulting either to the shipper or to the con- signee. If the shipper or inspector is not familiar with the latest requirements of the state at destination they should find out, be - fore shipping:, of the Live Stock Sanitary Board. Railroad agents, especially in the smaller towns, seldom possess any in - telligent information about the requirements of the different states: their printed matter on this subject is usually about MTen years behind. Traffic regulations cause no annoyance to the mai who takes the trouble to find out about them before h&lt;&gt; is rea&lt;l\ to ship. If a breeder or feeder lives a considerable distance from a railroad or from a veterinarian, whether he wnnis port or export some live stock, if he will write to the Live Stock Sanitary Board and explain the situation fully, he will assisted every time and will be saved as much as possihi.- f any unnecessary expense or delay.

            <seg id="p094">94 ANNUAL REPORT LIVE STOCK DISEASES Live stock diseases in Nebraska are more preva would expect, considering the excellence of th allows stock to live outdoors practically tl fertility of the soil which insure-; ;i feed, because disease i&gt; usually brought the vitality of the animal body through an iiisiifl oxygen and lack of nourishment and then disease producing miero-organisnu which are fou and at all times. In the ease of infectious and contagions diseases, how the condition of the animal has usually no influence in protecting it against them, for some of the diseases, as blackleg sn&lt; cholera, seem to always prefer to attack the fattest mItm and th most valuable hogs. The claim made by some, that diseav among man and the lower animals is more prevalent at praami than it was twenty-five and fifty years airo. is not true. In pro - portion to the number of animals in existence, disease is less prevalent than it used to be, only we hear more about it because' more complete records are kept and of the fact that we are con - tinually waging war against it.

            <seg id="p095">95 t &lt; ?ase than is the high grade or pure-bred, have no grounds what - mr, but are contrary to the facts at hand. The only way to keep animals free from disease is to pre vent them from getting it, which is perfectly possible if the owner possesses sufficient intelligence to familiarize lrimsel with the nature and symptoms of those infectious and eontagiou • I isiiis.-s to which his stock is ■"most" subject to. and is far sighted enough to heed the advice of those who have made the study of animal diseases their life-work. There is nothing mysterious nor difficult about doing thi»c few little things which, as far as we know at present, is all that could be done to prevent costly ravages of diseases. For in - stance, if a man has a dairy herd, it will not require any extra work nor any additional outlay of money to let every animal have a constant supply of fresh air and sunlight, nor will it require very much extra labor or money to arrange the stalls, '-rutters. etc.. iii such a way that they can be easily and thor- oughly cleaned ; and to whitewash the inside of the barn about twice a year is a small matter as compared with the returns it will yield. In addition, all animals of six months or over should be tested with tuberculin every year and all those that are bought, unless they come from accredited tuberculosis-free herds, should be &lt;|iiarantined for at least sixty days and tested before lie.v are placed together with the rest of the herd. Now. this rccedure is simple, cheap and the only way to keep a herd from tuberculosis. When a rancher has a bunch of calves he has no excuse for not vaccinating them at least once a year until they are three years old. Theoretically, a vaccine is supposed to immunize a calf for life, but practically it does not always do it. A stock - man is perfectly able to vaccinate his own calves and he should get the best vaccine obtainable and do the work thoroughly. The cause of blackleg was definitely determined quite a num - ber of years ago, and to vaccinate before the calves get sick is the only remedy. For anyone to claim that he has successfully prevented or cured blackleg with copper wire, turpentine, bleed- </seg>
            <seg id="p096">96 ANNUAL REPORT ing from the tail, etc., is to proclaim that he knows more about the disease than bacteriological investigators, and for this ignor - ance he sooner or later pays in full by losing a number of his best calves, which loss he usually fails to tell about when talking about his wonderful success with copper wire or some other substance. Hog cholera has gotten a foothold in every part of the state and the only way to prevent it is by vaccinating with the double method all pigs right after weaning. There is no reason why a farmer should not be able to do it himself, and do a good job, if he will take pains. The most important part is to ad - minister serum of great potency and plenty of it. There are many points about hog cholera and vaccination which it is im - possible to grasp by anyone who is not well trained in physiology, pathology and other fundamental sciences, and in the long nu the employment of a well-trained veterinarian, with specia training and experience in serum therapy, will always provi more satisfactory, but since it is not always possible to emplo] such men, every hog raiser should avail himself of the oppor - tunity to learn all he can from the public demonstrations of th&lt; vaccination of hogs which are conducted by federal veterin arians. of whom there are about twenty in Nebraska, statione. in different parts of the state, and whose work is cotinnec wholly to the investigation of hog cholera and to devise wav and means for its eradication. Tuberculosis Among the diseases of cattle, tuberculosis is of the first im - portance. We deem it a waste of space to describe the symp - toms, lesions and treatment of any disease that we may men - tion as being found in Nebraska, because tons upon tons of liter - ature has been published by the federal and state departments of agriculture in describing in pamphlet form every detail of the various diseases, and in a perfectly plain, non-technical lan - guage, and anyone interested may obtain any or all of those publications free of charge. </seg>

The disease pwid in Nebraska through the importation of tuber- ttle from other states. Many cattle are shipped in tlie stock yards at Omaha and Sioux City, which are : u feeders or for grazing purposes, but upon reaching icir destination are being sold as dairy cows and many of them mil to be tubercular after being in the state for several i and after being scattered in many directions. Like in very other line of business, there exists the usual quota of live tock dealers who are crooked, men who will apply all of their ability to evade the law and as long as there is a chance to make I lew dollars will not hesitate to knowingly buy tubercular m,\ where and sell them wherever they can, regardless of ; tbat these cattle will spread the disease to other cattle that they will come in contact with and through their milk will spread lie disease to children. Thorough investigations have proven conclusively that in the human family tuberculosis is irly always contracted in early childhood from the ingestion milk from tubercular eows, but the clinical symptoms of the lisea.se usually do not appear until the child gets to be near wenty years of age. This is due to the insidious nature of the and the slowness with which the tubercular lesions de- Connderiaf that the white plague is the greatest scourge ever befallen humanity and that it is progagated entirely by the use of milk from tubercular cows, it is very obvious that tlie jail is no place for the man who knowingly deals i:i tuber - cular cattle and is therefore directly responsible for spreading the disease to mankind. The place for such a man are the cal - lows.

            <seg id="p100">100 ANNUAL REPORT the reliability of the test. The tuberculin test has reached a point where it needs no further recommendation or proof as to its value in the eradicating of the disease. Excepting strictly range animals, every owner of a herd of breeding cattle, whether of the dairy or beef type, should totl them at least once a year. Some of the reasons for doing this Ills are as follows : 1. Tubercular animals never return full value for th&lt; consumed like healthy animals would. They do not do often abort, gradually lose riesh and often die suddenly what appears to the farmer without any obvious cause. 1&gt; real tmmmt is not thoroughly investigated and usually nevi feed well. rom covered. 2.

If a breeder is known to have tuberculosis amo cattle, the fact is bound to be soon found out in spit anv precautions that he may take to hide it. and when it is found out his reputation is usually gone for irood ami the sellim rice of his cattle will naturally be severely affected. When a herd, consisting say of twenty cows, is tested and four are found to react, it does not mean that all of the rest are healthy. It simply means that the herd was exposed to in fection and that there are. no doubt, several more which have bei me infected, but the disease in them has not yet progressed (In-ii.

For this reason, a man cannot claim to have cleaned up his herd after a single test : it is only after repeated testing at regular intervals of not more than one year apart that a stockman can be sure that his cattle are free from the disease. To conduct a tuberculin test on a herd of cattle intelligently s not as simple an operation as it appears to be. The injection )f tuberculin and later reading the thermometer every two hours is of no greater importance than the thorough physical examina - tion which should always prceede all tests, inculding the history and origin of the cattle tested; also a careful study of th« organic disturbances displayed by the animals during the time when the vital forces of the body are reacting to the action of the tuh.niiliii. which period may last anywhere from about the eighth to the thirtieth hour after injection. There are at least ten ways to test animals for tuberculosis. There is the : 1. Physical. 2. Subcutaneous. Intradermal. 4. Intrapalbebral Cutaneous. 6. Complement fixation. 7. Agglutination. 8. Bacteriological examination of sputum. !•. Innoculation of guinea pijrs, rabbits, etc.. with sputum or tissue products. 10. Post mortem examination. The subcutaneous and intradermal methods are the only ones in use in the field by practicioners and are often combined where there is any reason to suspect plugging or other attempt! to deceive. A physical examination, as stated before, always precedes any method of testing. The intradermal test is con - venient to apply, less laborious and expensive, and in careful and well-informed hands sufficiently reliable to serve the purpose, but it is rather a new test and on account of those practitioners who fail to keep thoroughly posted on all of the latest informa - tion with regard to tuberculin testing and other work, state and </seg>

It is infectious and usually fatal to all domestic animals. In Nebraska its ravages are practically confined to cattle. The disease shows no characteristic symptoms or lesions: animals affected with it might show almost any imaginable symptoms. It resembles anthrox and under some conditions might be mistaken for blackleg. It is claimed to be caused by a micro-organism which is called bacillus bipolaris septicus. but whether this organism is the actual cause of the disease or merely acts as a secondary invader has not yet been definitely determined. A secondary invader is an organism which under usual conditions does not cause disease, but when the vitality of the body is weakened through some other cause, it enters it, multiplies rapidly and produces poisonous substances which exert a deleterious or fatal influence. Unlike other infections, contagious diseases, the general physical condition of the animal has much to do with their susceptibility to this disease.

" and possibly others of a similar nature, are by some con - idered to be merely the different forms of the one disease, emorrhagic septicemia, and it is more than likely that such is the case. The disease is certainly baffling to an inexperienced practitioner, but after seeing it several times there is usually no difficulty in diagnosing it. On post mortem examination, the • .iiiliitoMs of the spleen, heart, blood and the lungs are the ones chiefly depended upon to assist in differentiating it from anthrax, with which it is most apt to be confused. A laboratory examination should always accompany the linical and post mortem investigation of any infectious and ontagious disease. A laboratory examination is made usually ■onfirm the diagnosis in the field and is infallible only when findings are positive, but when the findings in the laboratory are negative it does not mean that the disease suspected is ab - sent, because many of the micro-organisms are very elusive and require considerable and prolonged labor before they can be recovered from the sample sent in for identification, while other disease-producing organisms entirely disappear from the tissues or organs soon after the death of the animal or even before, so that it is impossible to find them when the material reaches the laboratory. One of the usual reasons for failing to get satisfac - tory results with specimens sent for bacteriological and path - ological examination is the fact that the material reaches the laboratory in a decomposed state, due either to having been packed and shipped in a careless manner or that it was already partly decomposed when taken from the animal at the time of the post mortem examination.

In the eradication of any infectious and contagious disease, the biggest drawback encountered usually is the ignorance and lack of co-operation among those for whose sole benefit the work </seg>

It is only a few u-coincrs and small traders that stand in the way of the eom - 'te eradication of scabies in the country. Such men, when ey have a few mangy head, will often hide them or move them (round : they have no vats, as a rule, and when they do dip they •onsuler themselves as conferring a personal favor upon the &gt;&lt;1 States government.

Such men as referred to in the above paragraph are indeed very few, but there are just enough of them to prevent federal and state authorities from completely eradicating scabies, for their herds are never properly or entirely dipped and act as breeding grounds from which the infection spreads to the cattle of their neighbors or to those of others with which they may come in contact. Another reason for failing to get the best results from dipping is the scarcity and poor quality of the vats. In a range country like western Nebraska, there should be found a properly </seg>
            <seg id="p118">118 and substantially built vat at least every six or seven miles. The majority of vats are very poorly built, very often a whole day is wasted waiting for the dipping material in the vat to reach the proper temperature, and after dipping begins it is im - possible to keep u the temerature to the oint which the Bureau of Animal Industry considers necessary for effective work. Complete and detailed plans for building vats may be had from the 1'. S. Department of Agriculture and from the office of the State Veterinarian of many of the range states. A well-built dipping vat is the first prerequisite in order to do effective work, but the majority of the vats are built in a haphazard manner without consulting experienced men or plans of any kind, wit the result that they are a continuous source of annoyance an make it impossible to do efficient work. The dips recognized by the B. A. I. are the lime and sulphur. and nicotine. It does very little good to dip stock of any kind unless the liquid is tested frequently enough to insure that it is being maintained at the proper strength and temperature. The nicotine is considered superior to the lime and sulphur for de - stroying lice on cattle. Practically all cattle in the ran-re dis - tricts are lousy during the fall and winter, and a dipping v;it will prove a most profitable investment on any ranch or srood - sized stock farm, even where there is no manire. Every ttoek - man will testify that it pays to dip cattle even if it is only to kill the lice. The ordinary outlay of money in building a vat need not be large and the expense of charging it is but a trifle as compared with the amount of feed one can save by dipping a large number of cattle and save them from the annoyance and drain produced by blood-sucking insects on their skin. Contagious Abortion and Sterility This disease, which causes severe financial losses whenever it gains a foothold in a herd of cattle, is quite prevalent in Ne - braska. It is hard to estimate just to what extent the infection prevails. It is known that many herds even on the range are affec ted with contagious abortion while sterility among cows in pure-bred and grade breeding herds is not uncommon. Many ranchers have lost their entire crop of spring calves through the </seg>

The sibility of this disease seems to rest upon one of the varie- &gt;!' the bacillus coli. The organism may enter the cow's body rough the feed, water, by copulation, and possibly through her ways. It seems to confine its activities to the lining of he uterus, upon which it grows and multiplies and may produce in acid condition, which, when the cow is bred, would prevent :i para cells from surviving and developing and thus cause niuial to become sterile or it may produce a catarrhal in - latii.n on the mucus membrane of the uterus which would I the separation of the tissues which envelop the fetus from items, result in&gt;; in the premature expulsion of the young. The infection is found in the cow's blood as evidenced by reac - tions to the complement fixation test. It is claimed that if heifer eive milk from cows which are infected with con- \ s abortion they will harbor the infection and abort after bred. That the bull is a carrier of the disease, if he is al- owed to serve infected cows, need hardly be emphasized. Cows that abort several times either become immune to the disease or become sterile. The way to guard against the disease is by prevention and sanitation. Be careful when buying new animals to be placed in the herd. Then- are no drugs which are of any value in the treatment of this disease except antiseptics. Carbolic acid, methylin blue anil some other drugs which some claim have proven useful, are in fact of no value whatever. Anti-abortion bacterins have been put on the market and are being advertised </seg>
            <seg id="p120">120 ANNUAL REPORT extensively, but the manufacturers have as yet not been able to prove their value. Excepting the claims made by the biological houses, which they seem to be neither able nor willing to sub - stantiate, there is no evidence whatever to prove that anti-abor - tion batterins are worth anything. The best that can N Hid about them is htat they are still in the experimental stage. This does not mean that they will never be perfected to a high degree of usefulness, such as other biological preparations have been developed, but until such time, it would be folly to depend on their use in the prevention of the disease and it would be money wasted to buy them. Considerable research work is being done on this disease, and a lot more will have to be done before more definite informa - tion as to its manner of spreading and the best way of combat - ing it will be available. Dr. Williams of Cornell was the first veterinarian in this country to realize its importance and has so far done most of the research work on this disease. Contagious abortion is to be overcome by prevention, and sterility will be combated by treatment. After a cow has aborted she is not to be bred again until the uterus has been put into a perfectly healthy condition. When a cow is sterile it is usually due to a dis.a-~.-i condition of the uterus or of the ovaries, or both. The ovaries are manipulated to detect cysts or other abnormalities which can sometimes be removed by applying pressure while the uterus is treated with mild, non-irritating. Ink. '-warm, stimulating anti - septics, or normal salt solutions long continued. Practitioners who live in localities where pure-bred herds are numerous and where the work of a real veterinarian is ap - preciated, are making great efforts to overcome contagious abor - tion with its sequaela. It requires special training with the ex - penditure of much time and money, besides involving a lot of hard and disagreeable work, to become proficient enough to fight the disease successfully.

It is rather pe - culiar that the disease in this country is found most often on the northwestern palins where the climatic conditions are without a doubt among the most healthful in the world.

Swamp Fever Swamp fever is an infectious disease of horses found occa - ;illy in some parts ol Nebraska and practically all other west- i states. It is a specific septicemia and caused, as far as could determined at present, by a filtrable virus. The symptoms are xtreinely variable and confusing and in diagnosing, unless one as had experience with the disease, he will resort to the mination of other diseases which show symptoms that are nilar to some which characterize this disease; also the fact certain localities are infected with it more than others will aken into consideration. A practitioner who lives in a lo- ity where this ailment is often found and has seen several ;es will be able to diagnose it readily. The disease is prac- ly laways fatal, the mortality being over 90 per cent. Death in occurs rather suddenly and unexpectedly. The treatment wholly symptomatic and usually of no avail. The disease seems to be spread mostly through the virus which is found extensively in the urine of the animals. The dis- fased animals should be destroyed, the suspected ones segregated, ind the feed and water prevented from becoming contaminated; the staMes disinfected and the wet pasture lands drained. In baying horses from an area which is known to be infected with this malady the animals should be held in quarantine for a suffi - cient time to allow for a thorough examination for the symptoms of the disease.

Illinois. A care - ful and systematic investigation was immediately inaugurated, which indicated that at this time the disease was confined solely t.i equities and that the infection could be traced back to similar remount stations at Grand Island, Nebraska, and Denver, Colo - rado. At these points horses and mules had been gathered to - gether by agents of the French and English governments for shipment abroad, and the disease found ideal conditions for its spread among the thousands of these animals closely quartered in barns and pens. As the disease was undoubtedly contagious, local quarantines were recommended and enforced. Sick ani - mals were separated from the well, the healthy, but exposed. </seg>

As a result of thf and the reports from the field inspectors, the opinion was reach that the disease in question was not foot-and-mouth disease, but vesicular stomititis, a contagious disease affecting the mouths of horses, but at times spreading to cattle also The most striking lesion of this disease is the occurrence of vesicles or blisters, followed by erosions chiefly on the tongue but also involving other portions of the mouth and occasionally the muzzle.

While the disease has not the great economic import - of foot-and-mouth disease, it nevertheless is contagious and ■ausi-s considerable alarm owing to its close resemblance to the hvail European disease.

The opinion that the niiiiady is not foot-and-mouth disease lased on the fact that persistent observation of sick animals liled to reveal certain typical symptoms which would bi&gt; ted in an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The droll- i-les. aiitl erosions are similar in appearance to those pro - y foot-andmouth disease, but in none of the animals ex- nined in the Held has there been found any soreness of the common symptom of foot-and-mouth disease. .Moreover, many horses have this particular ailment, and horses have not been observed to contract foot-and-mouth disease i:i any lav of the previous outbreaks in the United States. Hundreds of lion's exposed to the disease and in association with the sick ani - mals in pastures have shown no signs of the malady, and this is regarded as significant because in the last outbreak of foot-and - mouth disease hogs were as susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease as were cattle. Kxposeil sheep also fail to show the disease, yet these cloven-foot animals are also susceptible to foot-and-mouth infection. The disease seems to be local and not a systemic in - fection like foot-and-mouth disease, and unlike the latter, it is not ushered in as a rule by any apparent rise of temperature.

Tonics of all kinds are valuable, chiefly as a means for un- crupnlous traders who travel about the country to obtain easy money from hard-working farmers, but to feed them to animals, they arc practically worthless, for a tonic has never cured a sick hog. and a healthy hog needs no tonie.

Whether or not the trainig received at one of these famous institutions would be superior to that given by the others, he was in no position to know.

One of them did not seem to know that he had attended high school and informed him that since the demand for veterinarians being far in excess of the supply, they considered it as a public duty to urge him to be sure and enroll with them as soon as possible and not spend any time attending high school, for a hijrh school edu&lt;ation for a veterinarian was quite unnecessary.

Likewise, at the age of fifty his views I life and ambitions are bound to be of an entirely different character and although the young man of twenty does not know what his opportunities or desires might be fifteen or thirty years later, if he is wise he will endeavor to obtain as broad am thorough a training as possible so that, when some time later in life, he is confronted with a great opportunity he will not be handicapped by an inferior state of mind, but will be able to take hold of it and carry it just as far as his energies, menta power and lighting qualities will permit him. As I said before, I do not consider myself qualified to advise you definitely which of the veterinary schools to attend. I do know that both of the universities which you mention in your letter have a worldwide reputation and maintain a very high standard of instruction in all of their departments, and should you be fortunate enough to graduate from either of them, it will prove a source of satisfaction to you as long as you will live, pro - viding, of course, that you possess average ability and honesty. On the other hand, looking over the samples of the entrance ex - amination questions which you have enclosed and which were sent to you by some of the private veterinary colleges, I find them to be ridiculously easy, and taking this as a criterion to the kind of examinations which you will most likely be asked to pass after entering one of those colleges, in addition to the fact that their terms at school are several months shorter, my opinion is htat their course of instruction must necessarily be inferior and very incomplete, and since it would cost just as much to attend one of these schools as it would one of the big ones I can see no </seg>

There are practically no students here who earn their entire living and only a few who earn a part of their expenses.

The statement in the last part of your letter wherein you say that you have always worked on afarm and have been "around" live stock all of your life and are wondering whether we would accept this in lieu for some poor work which you might do in your studies, is of great significance : for the reason that this idea that practical experience with stock on the farm will offset a lack of scientific training at college, is so common and wide - spread not only among uneducated people, but even among agricultural and some veterinary educators, who should know better. I do not blame you nor any other ordinary farmer for thinking that way, but the fact is that nothing could be more absurd. Unless you receive a thorough course in anatomy, physiology, pathology, bacteriology, therapeutics, surgery and the other sciences which a modern veterinarian is thoroughly groomed in. you have about as much chance of knowing what is wrong with a sick horse or cow and what to do for it, as an old colored southern "mammy" would have in diagnosing and pre - scribing for a sick human on no other grounds than the fact that she has been "around" children all her life. If your practical agricultural experience was gained by working on an "average" farm it is more likely than not that you do not know how to intelligently feed and care for a work horse or a dairy cow. how to handle a bunch of heifer calves so as to insure their best possible development and cause them to attain their highest degree of usefulness at maturity, or how to intelligently feed and care for adrove of pigs. Chances are also </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 ANNUAL REPORT that you have no idea as to the correct manner of cleaning grooming a horse; and perhaps are not even able to adjust harness on one properly. Among teamsters in a town or one will often find one who can be relied upon t • faithfully and intelligently nurse a sick animal, but among farmers pnetieally never; about the only care and treatment a sick animal usually gets on the farm is to be turned out to pasture. Now, I hope th:it you understand that this is not Meant as ■ slur on the "average" farmer. There are good reasons for this condition prevailing and upon thorough analysis yon will find that it could hardly bo otherwise. The fact is that farming is the most complex of ali occupations. A lot of physical labor is its foundation ; b. ■ if you want to be a fanner above the average you have to bt familiar with about all of the sciences there are in existence, be- sides being a financier, a skilled mechanic and a philosc And considering how much influence the elgments exert o termining the rewards the farmer shall receive for his 1 and knowing that even when the capricious elements fail I duce his crops and other yields to more than a small exte still has to deal with and worry about that vast army o tributors, many of whom are powerfully organized and equ with the most fertile minds that money could buy, with H energies directed for selfish gains and the exploitation i farmer and husbandman, never hesitating even to rob him pletely of the fruits of his labors only when this might pro\ 1111 favorable for future events, you can readily see the vast the variety of problems which confront the average farmer and as a class it is impossible for him to spend the time to obtain great proficiency in cleaning a horse like a stableman would witli whom this is the main business ; nor would we expect the average farmer to be in a position to spend the time and labor in becom - ing an expert in feeding of milch cows, unless dairying con - stitutes his chief income, in which case he is a specialist, and outside of the feeding and care of his cattle he has probably but few other problems.

The fields of activity open to you after graduation are practically limited to private practice in a rural community or as a sanitarian in federal employ. There is a demand for a limited number of veterinarians in other fields, such as for laboratory research work in bacteriology and pathol - ogy ; as workers in the manufacture of biological products and as instructors, but the positons along these lines are few, and in order to properly fill one, aveterinarian must have additional </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 ANNUAL REPORT and special training, and the salaries connected with them are far from being attractive; also one must be especially adapted for such work. The federal government offres employment to all the vet - erinarians it can get. The work consists of meat inspection : scab and tick eradication ; hog cholera control ; tuberculosis erad - ication; glanders and dourine tradifti— ; supervision at the productoin of biological products: and may include almost any other kind of veterinary work. The experience gained in this work is of enormous value and an absolute necessity for anyone who intends to practice. The newly graduate should ipmd ;it least one year and ahalf in such work nad get as mueh ex - perience in the various different lines as possible. The salary paid is less than that earned by a carpenter of the neond class, and after one is engaged in this work for any considerable time, it becomes a tedious routine which destroys the —my »\' probably ninety per cent of those engaged in it and whatever ambition there is left is directed usually towards leavinir the service and engaging in some other line of activity. The veterinary practitioner in the rural community con - stitutes the bulwark of the veterinary profession. He is the man who does the real work and his field offers opportunities of the most varied character. Private practice in the country in order to attain that grade of usefulness which it should iad could be made to attain demands many and well-defined qualifi - cations of the practitioner and up to the present time only a small percent of veterinarians have been able to meet those qualifications and develop that power for good which he alon ' is able to exert. The modern veterinary practitioner is the con - necting link between the great scientific truths which are dis - covered in the laboratories and the artful manner in which such truths are applied and made to produce results in the barnyard. feed lot and pasture. His course of preparation is long aiul thorough. While at school he not only acquires a thorough knowledge of the basic sciences, but is thoroughly faimliar with even the most advanced forms of speculative research, readily realizing their relations and value to him when he will be called upon to solve complicated and intricate problems. Just as </seg>
            <seg id="p149">STATE VETERINARIAN 149 there is nothing which is too scientific for him while at school, there is nothing too practical when out of school. He can »d or milk a cow at the least as good as a good herdsman ; can throw ,iik1 restrain a horse for an operation at least as good as i cowboy, and can clean and groom one at least as good as any nripe. If there is anything that he thinks he ought to be able ) do, but is not, he immediately proceeds to learn it regardless f the amount of time and money involved. And most of the Tactical things he has to learn before, between or after his school ears, for veterinary colleges do not have the time nor is it their function to teach practical things; they have hardly time enough to impart the necessary scientific training, and for this reason whenever a college emphasizes the great "practicability" of its course you can make up your mind that it is in a position to tradi you mostly little things which you could learn much more (|iiickly and cheaply by working a short time in a horse stable, farm, or ranch ; and that they are not able to give you that thorough training in the basic sciences which they are supposed to do and which constitute the very soul of the profession and require several years of labor under highly qualified men. After locating for practice you will be confronted by several facts which you are not aware of at present, before you have taken up the profession. You will find out in due time that a country veterinary practice means a lot of hard, dirty and dis - agreeable work; you will be out in all kinds of weather, at any time during the day or night, and over all kinds of roads. In performing an operation you will not have the assistance of trained nurses, sanitary surroundings and an intelligent patient. You will have to throw your patient down, restrain him se - curely and at the same time always be on your guard, for if given a chance your patient will break your arm or leg or at - tempt toi njure you in any other possible manner. Practically all of this restraining you have to do yourself, and you will sometimes be exhausted before you even begin the operation. After performing whatever work was necessary you need not depend on th assistanc of any intelligent after-care to bring about the fvaorable results which you have a right to expect, un'ess you happen to have the sick animal on your own premises. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">ANNUAL REPORT 150 This, and many other similar problems you will, h soon learn to solve and overcome. There is one feature eral veterinary practice in the country, though, which, your training will develop you into a man of superior standing, one who can take a broad view of matters and the reason for everything, will prove a severe handicap Wc'Yi II unit dei II man.

There are thousands only in the south, but even in the enlishtened co have no idea that aveterinarian has to spend sev&lt; Vf scientific study: their conception of a "veterinary" is who has made a failure of farming or storekeeping and f of a better occupation has gone to "doctorin' " sto&lt; whenever such people do employ a qualified practition always as a last resort measure, tha is, after all of the kn and abilities of the owner, neighbors and the local qua 1 been exhausted and the sick animal is beyond a and when the practitioner finally is called and the animal dies, which it nearly always does, it furnishes good proof that it does not pay to call a veterinarian because "they don't do any good i » anyway. Another source of much annoyance to a beginner in prac - tice who has undergone long and elaborate preparations to at - tain the greatest possible der"-ee of usefulness to the live stock - industry, is what seems to him as unfah competition on the part of quacks and county agricultural agenN. Several years later you will realize that this is no competetion at all, the activities </seg>

Another feature which yon have probably not given any be bet that there are no opportunities for wealth who confines his activities to the veterinary profes- *ke. for instance, two youni: men of e&lt;[ual intelligence me Ml and start one of them out on a farm raising ml ived live stock and educate the other as a veterinarian and start him up in practice: at the end of twenty years the stockman will not only have led a much easier and more satisfactory life, tint will have accumulated a great deal more of the material which makes for financial liberty. As compared with farmers and stockmen, independent veterinarians at middle age are very rare. So far, I have told you only of the disadvantages of the veterinary profession and you might think that I am trying to d M«mg« you from taking it up. This is not my object, but I do want you to be thoroughly familiar with all of the disap - pointments that you will surely meet with and which you cannot avoid, but which you will be able to overcome if you will take special pains to balance your way of thinking and direct it into proper channels. My function is to state facts as I know and see them only, but occasionally I am allowed to express an opinion ; and in this connection let me say to you, my opinion is that the opportunities in the veterinary profession can be made to correspond in proportion to the man who makes them. To boil the proposition down you may figure that to put in from nine to twelve hours a day in a slaughter house, or to spend about sixteen or more hours out of every twenty-four around a gloomy-looking structure which constitutes the average veter - inary hospital, is a prospect which does not deserve the efforts of an ambitious young man, but if you possess hte qualifications necessary to develop into an ideal veterinarian, and will then locate on a farm and devote a part of your energies^to the pro - duction of high-class live stock, limiting your professional activ- </seg>

Should you find it advisable to enter another instit stead of ours, I may never again have an opportunity yo uand will, therefore, before I close, attempt to enlijj with regard to several matters which are of vital in to you and to the veterinary profession as a whole. First, before entering a veternary college get som education: if possible attend an agricultural college, and as much time as possible on history and English literat know that you will be wondering how a knowledge of gi 1 erature and history will help you to deliver a calf or cut a col but let me tell you that delivering a calf and gelding of a colt is not all there is to being a modern veterinarian. I do not con - sider it necessary to discuss this with you further, for it will be very plain to you as you grow older; but for the present, if you will stop to think you will realize that I have no personal interest in this matter and will heed my advice, because, since I have been in the profession for over twenty years, and for many years dean of the veterinary department of one of America's finest universities, chances are that my suggestions are based on sub - stantial grounds. Instead of following the well-trodden road of the average young man and spend only sufficient time to become and remain a mediocre veterinarian, you will find it the most </seg>

It is admitted bv all that our present knowledge It is admitted by all that our present knowledge of the cause, methods of diagnosis and treatment of diseases is superior to what it was twenty or more years ago. and vet there are any number of practitioners who have never taken the to keep themselves informed on the latest developments irofssiiin. and a young man working for one of these upon ring college may not be able to purge himself of all the nformation which he has accumulated and which he will to do if, in his own practice, be is to follow sound scien- netlioils instead of senseless quackery. One of the penal- ing man pays for being fortunate in obtaining a lot of experience before entering college is to waste •» lot of drug*. Daring his apprenticeship, his emi- nev tor u tly practical employer has very kindly given him a. large rtnieiit of prescriptions for nearly every disease, which con- nuinher of drugs, many of which are expensive and the majority of which are not capable of exerting any influ - ence whatever towards the favorable termination of the disease. Mysterious and complicated concoctions are relics of the past, and when used extensively by any practitioner indicate ignor - ance. When a veterinarian, after administering medicine to a sick animal, upon boaf asked, refuses to explain every ingredient in it and just what he expects the medicine to do for the patient, he deserves of no confidence in his knowledge of disease or in his ability to combat it. for he is an imposter. Before anyone is justified in claiming certain virtues in a drug or a combination of drugs he must first convince us that he has a thorough under - standing of the pathology of the disease at hand; also, that he is thoroughly familiar with the physiological action of the drug or </seg>
