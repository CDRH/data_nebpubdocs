            <seg id="p002">2 STATE OF NEBRASKA ADJUTANT GENERALS DEPARTMENT LINCOLN December 1, 1924. Krom: | The Adjutant General of Nebraska To: | His Excellency, Charles W. Bryan, Governor of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. Subject: Biennial Report of 1923 and 1924. 1. In compliance with the requirements of Section 3305, Chapter 34, Article I, Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, the following bien - nial report for the calendar years of 1923 and 1924 is respectfully sub - mitted. REORGANIZATION OF THF NEBRASKA NATIONAL GUARD Since the last biennial report was submitted, the organization of the 110th Medical Regiment and the 35th Division Train, Q. M. C, has been completed and they are now fully equipped by the Federal govern - ment and are becoming quite well trained. The 35th Division Train is equipped and has been trained as In - fantry and is therefore of the same value to the State, in case of an emergency within its borders, as would be an extra battalion of Infantry. At the present time the 134th Infantry, the 35th Division Train and the 110th Medical Regiment are fully organized, equipped and trained, v hich gives the State a regiment and a battalion of Infantry which, together with the Medical Regiment, makes an ideal organization for a State and will enable it to cope with any disaster or emergency that may require their services. ANNUAL ENCAMPMENTS The annual encampments for the Nebraska National Guard for the last biennium have been held at Ashland, Nebraska, which is fast be - coming an ideal camp for the training of the National Guard and especially for target practice, to which, under the present government requirements, fifty per cent of the time provided for annual training must be devoted. We are now able to have assigned to us for training purposes only the officer instructors and sergeant instructors that are ently detailed to the State, but also an able corps in addition for each period of annual field training and for the annual^^ </seg>
            <seg id="p003">REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 3 instruction. This gives us the greatest amount of instruction in the shortest period of time, and as all transportation, subsistence and pay for these camps and schools are taken care of by the Federal govern - ment, it is also with a minimum expense to the State. Orders, programs and reports of inspectors pertaining to the an - nual field training and schools of instruction for the last biennium will be found in another part of this report. RIFLE RANGE The rifle range at Ashland, Nebraska, has been greatly improved within the last two years, as permanent rifle butts, target houses (of cement construction), a permanent road, a dike and a water system have all been constructed at the expense of the federal government, and this, in connection with the grading, construction of semi-permanent kitch - ens, a swimming pool and a semi-permanent hospital for emergency pur - poses, which have been added at the expense of the State, is fast round - ing this camp site out into an ideal camp. For the coming year we are promised, at the expense of the feder - al government, permanent mess halls, a sewer system, permanent bath houses, and possibly cement floors for the men's tents. The improvement of this rifle range at Ashland permits of our training our own men within the State and thereby giving to the State the benefit of all expenditures made, which would not have been poss - ible had we followed out the first plans laid down for us, of going to some adjoining state where they had improved camp sites already con - structed, and the improvement of this rifle range has also given em - ployment to hundreds of men which otherwise would have been lost to us. UNITED STATES ARMY OFFICERS AND SERGEANT INSTRUCTORS DETAILED TO THE STATE The following is a list of United States Army Officers and Ser - geant Instructors who are assigned by the War Department to the State of Nebraska for instructional purposes: Major T. F. McNeill, Inf. D. O. L., Lincoln, Nebraska Captain J. W. Crissy, Inf. D. O. L., Omaha, Nebraska Captain H. B. Battenberg, Inf. D. O. L., Grand Island, Nebraska Major J. F. Presnell, M. C, D. O. L., Lincoln, Nebraska Captain Jack L. Meyer, Q. M. C, D. O. L., Lincoln Nebraska Tech. Sgt. Lee R. G. Ward, Inf. D. E. M. L., Omaha, Nebraska. Sgt. Merriell Modglin, D. E. M. L., Lincoln, Nebraska Sgt. John Davis, D. E. M. I.., Scottsbluff, Nebraska Sgt. Harry Gilliam, Q. M. C, D. E. M. L., Lincoln, Nebraska Sgt. Paul K. Griffith, M. D , D. E. M. L., Lincoln, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 The above named officer instructors and sergeant instructors are rendering a valuable service and have done much to assist in placing the Nebraska National Guard at its present high standing among the other states of the union. Lieutenant Colonel W. A. McDaniel, Infantry', D- O. L., who has been on duty at this office as Senior Instructor for the last four years, has rendered most valuable assistance to the State, and it was with great regret that we were informed it would be impossible to continue his tour over the allotted four years. ARMORIES The most discouraging proposition with which the units of the Ne - l.raska National Guard have to contend at the present time is the rental of armories. It is almost impossible to rent buildings at reasonable rentals for armories for the National Guard units which give adequate protection to the government property that the State is required to protect, and at the same time have ample space for training purposes, to say nothing of the desirability of having armories that can be made attractive for the enlisted personnel and in which their athletics can be carried on and in which recreation rooms and rest rooms should be provided. Many of the states in the union have made appropriations for the building of armories for National Guard units and it is suggested that the present high rentals be taken into consideration, in connection with the desirability of having armories with the facilities above described, ami that serious consideration be given to the commencement of an armory building program which in time will furnish our National Guard r.; with desirable and attractive buildings and at the same time abol - the necessity of making large appropriations for rentals. Nebraska is one of the few states that have not done anything for their National Guard along this line and the following law, copied from the Revised rutes of Kansas, Sections 48-301 and 48-306, Chapter 48, is submitted your consideration. "48-301. Establishment and use of armories. That the Mili - tary Board of the state is hereby empowered and directed to erect or provide, anywhere within the limits of this state, upon such terms and conditions as shall be decided upon by said Military Board as most advantageous to the state, armories for the use of the National Guard of Kansas, which armories shall be used for drill, meeting and rendezvous purposes by the organization of the National Guard occupying same, and such other public functions which the officers in charge of said armory may deem advisable and proper, and which shall also be opened for meetings and functions of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Spanish-American War Veterans, and their auxiliary organizations. (I.. 1909, ch. 172, sec. 1.)" </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 • "48-306. Amount expended by state for such armory. The amount to be expended for said armory building shall not be leu than $5,000 nor more than $20,000, which shall be exclusive of all gifts or donations made to or for the benefit of any particular ar - mory by the city: Provided, That no armory shall be erected in any city or place unless said city or place donate either real estate or other property of at least one-half the amount expended by the state. (L. 1909, ch. 172, sec. 6.)" RIFLE TEAMS The following named rifle teams have been sent to Camp Perry, Ohio, in the order named, for the years of 1923 and 1924, and consider - ing the limited amount of preliminary practice they had, and that they were competing with the best shots and rifle teams from all over the world, they have made very good records. These teams are taken to Camp Perry annually at the expense of the federal government. Nebraska National Guard Rifle Team. 1923 Captain W. E. McConnaughey, Q. M.

The records are in card form and show name, serial number, color or race, residence, dates of service, date and place of birth, or - ganizations served in with grades, dates of overseas service and date and kind of discharge. The approximate number whose records have been credited to the State of Nebraska is 55,634. Nebraska Certificates of Service have been furnished to those whose records are on file in this office, in conformity with House Roll No. 637, 1919-1920, with the exception of approximately 2,500. New certificates have been ordered under the present administration but have not yet been delivered. Numerous inquiries relative to the military records of Nebraska ex-service men have been answered both verbally and by correspondence. Certified copies of Records of Service have been furnished to approxi - mately three hundred ex-service men of this State or to their nearest of kin, for use in obtaining U. S. Compensation, pensions, longevity pay, etc. It has been necessary to cancel approximately 250 records of serv - ice received from the federal government, for the reason that the in - dividuals concerned have claimed a State other than Nebraska as a bona fide residence. The War Department has also asked us to correct 179 records of service. Several states who are paying state compen - sations have been furnished with certified copies of records of service of men who gave their residence as Nebraska, but who have applied for compensation under the laws of other states. CONCLUSION I wish to express my appreciation to the officers and enlisted men of the Nebraska National Guard who, through their cooperation and willingness in recruiting and training their units, have assisted so ably in bringing the Nebraska National Guard to the present high state of efficiency it enjoys. I also desire to express my gratitude to the offi - cers and non-commissioned officers of the Regular Army on duty with this State, for the assistance they have given in the training of the Nebraska National Guard. In conclusion, I wish to express to your Excellency my appreciation for the moral support and uniform courtesy always extended by you to this Department. H. J. PAUL, The Adjutant General, Nebraska </seg>

Heavy rains during eight of the fifteen days of the period left the drill field in such condition that only a small part of it could be used. For the same reason the tactical exercises were eliminated by the Camp Commander. Battalion Commanders were not given sufficient opportun - ity to exercise command of their Battalions.

KENZIE W. WALKER, Chief of Finance. NOTE: The above ruling reverses the ruling of the Chief of the Militia Bureau to the effect that "all medical officers" would be paid as officers not belonging to an organization. In this connection, attention is invited to the fact that an officer cannot qualify for pay under both provisions of law, i. e. as "Officers belonging" and as "Officers not be - longing" to an organization, and, under the above ruling, they are class - ed as officers "belonging to an organization" and subject to regulations and decisions (see also Cir.

Attention is invited to above copy of Finance Memorandum No. 105, dated December 28, 1922, which determines the status of Medical Officers of the National Guard below the grade of major when attached to medical detachments. In the opinion of this office, the provisions of F. M. No. 105, supra, extend to other medical organizations, such as hospital companies, for which the tables of organization provide a com - missioned personnel as belonging thereto. 2. The law, with reference to organization officers provides no drill pay for duty other than drills unless such duty is ordered for the entire organization and is specifically authorized by the Secretary of War, hence medical officers coming under the provisions of F. M. No. 105 are en - titled to armory pay for drills attended subject to regulations as to the percentages of strength required to attend and the maintenance of tr.e organization's strength at or exceeding the mirin-.um required for fedeial recognition. 3.

Circular Letter No. 7 Subject: Courts-martial Procedure. To: All Officers, Nebraska National Guard. 1. Recent delays in the executing cf courts-martial sentences have been traced to the erronous sending of the sentence to the Regimental Commander for approval. This is unnecessary except where the Regi - mental Commander happens to be the appointing authority (convening authority). </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 REPORT OF THE ADJUTANT GENERAL 2. The approving- authority is the same as the appointing authority shown in Pars. 72-74 N. G. Regs, and this approval is the one referred to on line 19, Page 6, of Model Pay Roll. 3. Whenever the member of a command fails to appear for trial when so directed by proper authority, the convening authority must give the accused an order in writing together with a copy of the charge or charges upon which his trial is desired, before the President of the Court or the Summary Court Officer can compel the attendance of the accused by the issue of a warrant to a U. S. Marshal or his duly appointed deputy. 4. Where but one commissioned officer is present at a station, he automatically becomes Summary Court Officer, whether he issues an order appointing himself or not. But in signing as Summary Court Officer, he must always place "Only Officer Present" after his rank and organization. 5. After a sentence has been duly approved and all necessary data recorded for entry on Service Record, Pay Roll, etc., the original charge sheet must be forwarded to the office of the State Adjutant General for review and file. 6. Although the State Laws do not provide for a State Civil Officer executing all processes and sentences of a National Guard Court, thereby devolving it upon the Federal authorities, they do provide in Sec. 3956, R. S. of Nebraska, 1913, as follows: "When the fines by Court-Martial or Company Courts of discipline are not paid within ten days after the sentence is approved by the Com - mander in Chief and returned to the immediate Commanding Officer of the party so assessed, a list of such fines, with the names of the delin - quents shall be placed in the hands of a Justice of Peace within the Coun - ties in which the delinquents respectively reside, and said Justice shall thereupon issue processes and render judgment upon proof, against said delinquents separately (the record of the military court to be considered proof), together with the costs of suit, and shall ; ssue execution thereon directed to any Constable of the proper township who shall collect the same." 7. Expenses of confinement of members turned over to U. S. Mar - shal's office will be met by that office as in the case of other Federal prisoners. BY ORDER OF THE GOVERNOR H. J.

N. G. 1. Owinsr to the fact that many of the men came to camp last year with uniforms that were soiled and that in some instances showed signs of excessive wear and use, and with shoes in such bad condition in many instances, showing plainly that it could not have been caused by fair wear and tear, it is suggested that the Unit Commanders take up with their men the question of having their shoe? repaired and that you per - mit the men to take their clothing home for repair and renovation pre - paratory to camp. Men who have worn their shoes for other than military purposes cannot well object to having them repaired and I think they all have enough interest in their personal appearance so that they would be glad of an opportunity of having their clothing put in good shape for camp. 2. The personal expenditure in each instance would be so slight that I cannot feel that any member of the National Guard would object to bearing it, for at the present time the State funds are so nearly de - pleted that we cannot do it at State expense, and there are no federal funds available for this purpose.

Attention is again invited to the necessity of putting forth extra effort to recruit all units up to full strength during the month of June. In case the new law is made applicable to the National Guard, and it probably will be, after the first of July, it will require the permission of both parents with each of their signatures attached thereto on the en - listment of recruits between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years. Under the present law, a boy eighteen years of age and older can enlist without the permission of either parent. 2. Units below the required strength will not be permitted to at - tend camp this year, nor will it be permissible to transfer from one unit to another in order to bring this strength up to standard. 3. Field and Staff Officers will be held responsible for strength and condition of units located at same station and they will in the future render all possible assistance to unit commanders in keeping their units up to the required strength and bringing them up to the highest degree of perfection.

B. 1922, the Army Correpondence Courses are adopted as the prescribed State school for officers, and al - though this work is not compulsory, it would be of great value to all, and especially to those field, staff and detached officers who cannot attend drill regularly with a unit and qualify for armory drill pay there - by. In this connection attention is invited to the following from the Chief of the Militia Bureau, dated August 18, 1921 : "Training of Officers" "In addition to the work which naturally falls to an officer as a part of his organization, it is expected that all officers will spend the equiva - lent of at least one weekly drill period on individual study. Where possible officers' schools will be organized to work under, the supervision of the Instructor, correspondence methods being resorted to where local conditions make it necessary. In this work as well as in the instruc - tion of units, the fullest possible use will be made of those officers who have attended a special service school. It is considered that they are under a special obligation to give more than the usual amount of time to the instruction and development of the National Guard." 6. Above mentioned Circular Letter from Headquarters 7th Corps Area requires N. C. O. school at least twice per month in Drill Regs., Musketry, Guard Duty, Riot Duty, Hygiene, Military Courtesy and Dis - cipline. Special attention should be given to War Department Train - ing Regulations, which modify the original texts of these and other subjects. The "Cadence System" of giving commands should be taught i-i school as well as at drill, because of its value to inexperienced drill structors. 7.

To: AH Unit Commanders, N. N. G. 1. Owing to the fact that unit commanders have become very care - less in their official correspondence, it again becomes necessary to call their attention to the fact that all correspondence of an official nature for anyone connected with this office should be addressed "The Adjutant General, Nebraska National Guard, Lincoln, Nebraska". Upon receipt of mail so addressed, the Chief Clerk will sort and see that the mail goes to the respective departments that are supposed to handle same. 2. Much delay is caused in addressing mail otherwise than above enumerated, as a letter addressed to Major H. C. Stein, for instance, is taken to be of a personal nature and if he is out of the city, is laid upon his desk to await his return, when it is found to be purely of a business nature and had it been properly addressed, would have received attention several days sooner. 3. In some instances letters are addressed to the Sergeant In - structors that contain requisition for equipment, office or otherwise, and your attention in this connection is invited to the fact that the Sergeant Instructors' duties are just what their title would imply and they have nothing to do with the filling of requisitions or the furnishing of any kind of supplies. 4. Letters pertaining to administrative work should always be for - warded to this office through military channels, but Drill Programs, should be sent direct so as to reach this office not later than the 5th of the month. Official communication should always reach this office in duplicate. H. J. PAUL, The Adjutant General, </seg>

Recent failure on the part of unit commanders to observe Par. 5, C. L. 1, M. B., 1921 (see Page 10, N. G.

R. 57 and Page 270, N. G. Hand Book.) Regimental and corresponding commanders will net issue the promotion orders unless the above mentioned data is furnished. 3.

In the opinion of this office, the fact that Tables of Organization prescribe a fixed number of non-commissioned officers for each grade for an Infantry Rifle Company of less than 64 men and a fixed number of non-commissioned officers for an organization of more than 64 men and less than 75 men establishes the two minimums to which reference ■ had in paragraph 5, C.

With a strength of 65 to include 74, it may have seven Sergeants. If the organization obtains the strength of 75 (80'r of the Regular Army minimum peace strength), it may appoint the quota of Sergeants authorized for a similar unit in the Regular Army.

The attitude of the Militia Bureau in regard to Efficiency Reports of National Guard officers is as follows: (a) The routing of Efficiency Reports is believed to be such as to enable all concerned to gain a correct estimate of the officers reporte'l upon and to take such action as is deemed necessary. (b) The rating of "below average" is considered as an "unfavor - able entry" for the purposes of paragraph R, for the reason that it is believed that such an entry should not lightly be made by the reporting officer, without an accompanying statement as to whether or not the deficiency was brought to the attention of the officer reported upon. (c) The Adjutant General of the State is informed, under the present system of routing of these reports, of the rating made on each officer in the State. This enables the State to take any action deemed necessary at once. What such action should be, is a matter for the state authorities to determine. The Militia Bureau wishes simply to be informed in the matter. If the Adjutant General decides that no action is needed, a statement to that effect should be included in his indorsement. (d) It is not considered advisable to permit Efficiency Reports, which contain expressions of opinion or of fact, to accumulate in the record of any National Guard officer, with no evidence that such derogatory expressions have ever been brought to the attention of the officer reported upon, and which would only serve to cause his dismissal if drafted into Federal service. One of the primary reasons for Kfficiency Reports is to point out the weaknesses in an officer with the hope of correcting them. It is far simpler to correct a few defects in an officer who is partially trained, than to attempt to train a new officer. 2. The Militia Bureau adheres to the position outlined***"**, and in view of the statement contained therein, efficiency reports need not be returned to the Adjutant General of the State, when it is shown that the officer reported on has not been furnished a copy of the unfavorable entries under paragraph R. In this connection, attention is invited to paragraph 1021 (5) (b), National Guard Regulations, 1922, which charges the Corps Area Commander with the responsibility of "making proper requests to the State authorities for the convening of Efficiency Boards under Section 77, National Defense Act."

"The National Uifle Association of America Washington, D. C. October 22, 1924. "Brig. Gen. Herbert J. Paul, The Adjutant General of Nebraska, National Rifle Association Director, Lincoln, Nebraska. My Dear General: It is a peculiar fact that relatively few National Guard officers actively support the work of the National Rifle Association. Prac - tically all of them are interested in seeing the work carried through but they do not stop to think of the immediate bearing that the activ - ities of the Association have on the shooting of the Guard. We be - lieve that if it was called to the attention of the officers of your state that the National Rifle Association was responsible for the original law authorizing the holding of the National Matches and has been instru - mental each year since the inception of the Matches in obtaining the passage of the necessary legislation to assure the continuation of the matches, if the officers were reminded of the fact that the present high state of development of the Springfield rifle and ammunition, particular - ly Match ammunition, is due to the continual efforts of the NRA, if it was mentioned that the adoption of the new .22 calibre Springfield was largely a result of the Association's activities, if the work of the NRA in introducing rifle shooting to the high schools and colleges of th country were called to their attention, and if the considerable strides in the interests of the Police Departments, in the matter of properly taking care of and handling their guns, were impressed on the Guard Officers, we believe that they would agree that the Association deserved their support both morally and actively. The active support of the Guard Officers of your state would have a double result. In the first place, it would give the National Rifle Association a much greater weight in its arguments before Congress and would give it considerable greater prestige locally. In the second place, the Guard would be assured of the considerable added incentive to a greater interest in small arms practice, which would result from the circulars and programs we are continually sending individual mem - bers of the Association. Your cooperation in enlisting the support of your officers will, needless to say, be greatly appreciated.

It is customary to require individual members of the Asso - ciation to be vouched for by some one who is already a member, or some police official or regular army or guard officer. This provision of coarse will not apply to the officers of your organization who desire to join us in the work we are trying to do. Annual memberships cost but two dollars per year and the applications received from this time forth will be credited for the balance of 1924 and all of 1925. As you know, the situation relative to the National Matches and the general promotion of rifle practice in this country is rather acute. There is nothing which will be of greater value to us in our efforts to Rave the situation than to be able to point to a one hundred per cent enrollment of the National Guard Officers of the various states. Your reply will be awaited with more than usual interest. Very truly yours, (Signed) F. H. Phillips, Jr., Secretary. BY DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNOR: H. J. PAUL, The Adjutant General, Nebraska STATE OF NEBRASKA ADJUTANT GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT LINCOLN November 26, 1924. Circular Letter No. 32 Subject: Additional Appropriation, Nebraska National Guard To: All Officers, Nebraska National Guard. 1. Chapter 34, Article I, Section 3343, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska for 1922, provides among other things that: "For all enlisted men $1.00 per diem additional pay may be allowed in the discretion of the commander-in-chief." This is for the National Guard when in actual service of the State in camps of instruction or in time of war, insurrection, invasion, or reasonable apprehension thereof. 2. In submitting the budget for the Nebraska National Guard for the coming biennium, an additional sum of $45,000.00 is requested so aa to enable us to pay our enlisted men $1.00 per diem while attending camps, schools of instruction, etc., as provided above. S. The coming session of the legislature will undoubtly desire to </seg>
            <seg id="p095">95 make a record for economy and it will therefore be very hard to get through any increased appropriation. Owing to the fact that the cry in this section of the country has been for economy and reduced taxes, I have waited until the present time to ask for this sum, to which 1 feel the enlisted men are entitled, but now that I have asked for it, I request every officer to take the matter up with all senators and repre - sentatives upon whom he can bring any influence, in an endeavor to push the appropriation through. This should also be taken up with the enlisted men as a large percent of them have influence with their repre - sentatives and can do much in aiding us to go over the top. 4. It should be borne in mind that this is the year when it will be hard to get this appropriation through and if we are successful this time, we will have the precedent established and I anticipate no trouble then in continuing the appropriation so our enlisted men will be guar - anteed this sum in the future. However, if we fail this time, it will make it doubly hard in the future to establish the precedent. Many of the other states do this for their enlisted men and Nebraska cannot afford to show a lack of appreciation for what her enlisted men in the National Guard are doing. We hope to have correct data as to just what states are paying their enlisted men extra pay and the amount paid by each in the near future and will furnish you this information as soon as obtained. 5. If we are successful in getting this appropriation over, it is going to be a wonderful thing for the Nebraska National Guard, so strike now while the iron is hot and then keep striking until you have secured the promise of your senators and representatives to support this measure. Don't take "No" for an answer. H. J. PAUL, The Adjutant General, Nebraska STATE OF NEBRASKA ADJUTANT GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT LINCOLN November 28, 1924. Circular Letter No. 33 Subject: Adjusted Compensation Act (The Bonus). To: All Officers, Nebraska National Guard. 1.

As set out in General Rickards' letter, this is an opportunity for the National Guard to render valuable service to the government and to make many friends for itself in getting behind this and helpin c former veterans to help themselves.

PAUL, The Adjutant General Nebraska (COPY) War Department Militia Bureau Washington In reply refer to 240 (Bonus) Gen-1 November 21, 1924. Subject: Administration of Adjusted Compensation Act (the Bonus). To: The Adjutant General of Nebraska. 1. Your attention is invited to enclosed copy of letter from Major General Robert C. Davis, Adjutant General of the Army, to the Chief of the Militia Bureau, dated November 7, 1924, with regard to speeding up applications of those World War veterans who may be entitled to adjusted compensation and who desire to take advantage of the benefits conferred by the Adjusted Compensation Act (the Bonus). 2. The letter speaks for itself, but your attention is particularly invited to the last two paragraphs and to the last sentence of the first paragraph of said letter. 3. It is earnestly hoped that State Adjutants General may find it possible to take such action as will bring this matter to the attention of present and former members of the National Guard. It is felt that great impetus could be given the matter if National Guard organ - izations would interest themselves in aiding and advising the veterans in their localities as to obtaining, making out and forwarding their blanks to the War Department. Certainly the National Guard could render a valuable service to the Government and make many friends </seg>
            <seg id="p097">97 for itself, should it get behind this thing and help former veterans to help themselves. It should be urged upon those who do not intend to apply for compensation, either now or eventually, to communicate that fact to The Adjutant General of the Army, in order that the War De - partment may more accurately estimate the task remaining before it and thereby reduce the cost of administration of the benefits conferred. 4. Should you desire blanks sent to any organization or individual of the National Guard, they will be forwarded upon advice from you. (Signed) Geo. C. Rickards, Major General, Chief, Militia Bureau. (COPY) War Department The Adjutant General's Office Washington November 7, 1924. Major General George C. Rickards, Chief of Militia Bureau, Washington, D. C. My dear General Rickards: The War Department is making an appeal to veterans of the World War, through the press and other agencies available to it, to submit their applications at once if they intend to apply eventually for adjust - ed compensation. It is also requesting those who do not desire to avail themselves of the benefits of the Adjusted Compensation Act to* com - municate that fact to the Department. ****** It is thought that there are numerous members and former mem - bers of the National Guard who intend to apply but who have not done so as yet. It would help if they could be urged to submit their ap - plications at once. The various units of the National Guard could also be of great assistance in aiding and advising veterans in their localities in obtaining, making out, and forwarding their blanks to the Department. The inclosures, it is thought, will furnish you with sufficient data on which to base any action you may take. Should you desire blanks sent to any organization or individual of the National Guard, they will be forwarded upon advice from you. Your cooperation and assistance will be greatly appreciated in this matter. Sincerely yours, ROBERT C. DAVIS, Major General, The Adjutant General. </seg>
